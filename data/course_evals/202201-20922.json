                "Everything that the course covered regarding programming and digital tools tended to be pretty new to me (as a humanities student), so I was able to develop knowledge of what tools are out there and some basic skills regarding how to use them. Our discussions regarding the ethics of digitization projects relating to archaeological work was especially interesting to me and relevant to interests that I hope to pursue further.",

                "Not too much on the CS side of things. You do learn some front end and back end which is helpful if you need an introduction to the skills. I learned a lot of insights in the ways in which we code. It was very different from the other CS electives because there was a direct application outside of the class and we had to work with people who weren't CS minded meaning there was a lot of negotiation and team-oriented skills.",
                "I learned basic front-end development and information about Dura-Europos. I learned how technology can be applied to ethically studying archaelogy through the lens of Dura Europos.",
                "I gained insights into the ancient history of dura europos.",
                "I learnt about the specific history surrounding the site at Dura-Europos, developed my web development skills, and also got to interact with actual artefacts from Dura-Europos. The class covers a good variety of web development - with three main psets covering Python, JS & basic webtech (a mix of python, jquery & sql), some humanities-oriented reading responses of texts relating to dura europos and the theories surrounding the digital humanities, and of course, the final project. What you learn on the final project varies dramatically based on what you do, but it's likely it will be web-oriented.",
                "Learned how to use web technologies to build websites and about issues in digital humanities",
                "I learned a lot about the Dura-Europos site in Syria. I also learned about data management and degradation in the humanities and also photogrammetry.",

                "Strengths: the three programming assignments very clearly build on each other and are perfectly paced throughout the course. Weaknesses: lecture can be slow at times",
                "Overall good class. Don't let the final project sneak up on you.",
                "A major strength of the course was bringing together students of diverse backgrounds.",
                "Strengths: interdisciplinary, a foundation into the study of the Classical Near East, hands-on experiences were enjoyable\r\nWeaknesses: We only encountered specific digital humanities tools once or twice, meaning I feel like we only had surface level understandings of things. The division between Humanities and CS wasn't super generative; CS students were expected to understand everything technically while humanities students just had to sit in on things (e.g., the early coding introductions). We only spent a couple class times going over the history of Dura in antiquity, which meant it was difficult to frame the resulting projects.",
                "This was a great class for those looking for a Computer Science elective or a humanities credit. The topic was interesting and the group projects were fun.",
                "Strengths: An actual application of CS work, The teachers and Teaching Fellows, and the lectures were always engaging (though some I felt were unnecessary in the grand scope of things)\r\nWeaknesses: Organization of the class - the class was so unorganized and it was hard to keep up sometimes as the canvas page was a mess (The teachers very much understood this though and were lenient and understanding when it came to due dates). The team picking mechanism - I think Prof Rushmeier should talk to the professor of software design as I think his system was much better. The method of project delivery - there was a lot of criticism I received from the Profs on our final project which I felt like we had addressed in our project - made a youtube video to go alongside? \r\nI think these critiques are very easy to fix and in part because the class is so new.",
                "A strength of the course was the way it brought students of different interests together and the different course lecturers. A weakness of the course was a lack of strong organization and sometimes purpose to lessons that decreased engagement.",
                "The course felt disorganized at times. And the problem sets should count for more towards the overall grade.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- A good variety of learning, with the digital and coding well integrated into the humanities tasks.\r\n- Profs were easy to reach and responded quickly. \r\n- Problem sets made sense within the context of the course, and had the right amount of difficulty.\r\n- Final projects were fun\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I felt as if the problem sets were often quite \"unguided\", with not enough initial hints given. Though I guess there are some benefits, when helping my friends I saw some god-awful implementations and attempts to solve the tasks posed. It seems clear - at least to me - that using more guided assignments may result in better outcomes in terms of learning.",
                "The lectures were interesting, but it would have been nice to learn more about the computer science side in lecture. For the programming assignments, we had to do a lot of our own learning on how to use specific languages or tools.",
                "The course was a bit messily organized since a lot of the topics felt very standalone and not cohesive. Also there did not seem to be very much collaboration or cross learning between the humanities and comp sci sides.",
                "The class could be more organized in terms of the connections between different sections and assignments; and it could be clearer about the tasks and objectives for each section.",
                "The course exposed me to a wide variety of digital humanistic approaches, and it was a great survey course in terms of breadth. On the other hand, we did not go into any one topic in a lot of detail, so the material seemed simplistic at times.",
                "The expectations were unclear at times. A more rigid expectation and more computer science help for the 276 students would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: I liked how undergraduates worked with graduate students- it was nice to see what graduate students in history are researching and seeing how computer scientists can help with their work! I also enjoyed how we did a hands-on final group project (a good change of pace from the usual Yale CS lecture course). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, this course was disorganized. Some of the readings felt irrelevant to our study of Dura-Europos and computer science methods in DH research. I would have preferred more in-depth exploration of some computer science techniques (and even the history graduate student whom I worked with agreed that a deeper dive into the computer science/technical material would have been helpful for his understanding). There were also some logistical hiccups. Despite these issues, I think that as this course develops, better organization and better emphasis on relevant topics will follow.",
                "Strengths: the breadth of the material was great; we got a birds-eye view into many of the DH sub disciplines that are occurring right now. It was nice to hear from so many guest speakers. The psets were all pretty well put together (wish they comprised more of our final grade, though-- they took quite some time to finish). The readings pre-spring-break were interesting (except for the times we got assigned textbook chapters). The concept of the final project where humanities and cs students work together was promising. The planned group visits to the YUAG were a HUGE strength of this class, especially when Prof. Chen was there to guide discussion and give commentary. I wish there had been many more of these visits, since I feel like i learned more from that brief session than I did from multiple weeks' worth of assigned readings. I definitely wish I had taken an art history class in my time at Yale, now. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: grading for the final project was unexpectedly a little harsh, especially after the entire class up to then was completion-graded. It was kind of unclear why deductions were given on the writeups, and some criticisms on the project overall came as a surprise, after we did not receive those criticisms/suggestions earlier in the project proposal or in our individual meetings. Some of the deductions were related to our project concept as a whole, which was kind of hard to change after we had submitted the proposal.  I wish more feedback had been given earlier in the project, so that we could have addressed them. Also, I really wish that the professors had gone through all the project proposals and curated a set of options which would have yielded the best results, especially as it seemed in our final grading that our project concept itself was lacking. The group selection process was a huge mess-- people were last-minute-ditching groups; it was not transparent at all how the formations were taking place. It was easy to end up in a group where the majority of participants were disengaged (understandably, it's been a chaotic academic year, and people just want to be done). I just didn't realize this was the dynamic in my group until it was too late to switch. I also feel like each group should be mandated to have an actual graduate student, not just an undergrad enrolled as a grad student. Finally, I feel like this class was very insistent about maintaining the CS vs. humanities student division, in a way that is typical of academia. I know at least a few students in the class who are super interdisciplinary (CPAR and CS+ majors); i wish we had been encouraged more to submit project proposals, too. I think we could have come up with some interesting ideas, I just forgot to do so since it wasn't explicitly mentioned for CS-enrolled students and  i trusted the pure humanities students to handle it all.",
                "Strengths: very open ended, really showed the intersection between how technology can aid with humanities information. Could tell that the professors were super engaged and passionate about the topic with a diverse range of resources and interactive activities. \r\nWeakenss: does not actually teach you web development! It's very hard to do the psets without background knowledge, in class tutorials on the languages. Also would appreciate more time to develop and execute the final assignment.",
                "I think the hybrid component of this class could have definitely been done better in order to make the experiences of both people on zoom and in-person better. In addition, it felt like there could have been more integration between the computer science and humanities students.",
                "Both professors are very enthusiastic about digital humanities and introducing this intersection of art history and computer science. However, I found that a lot of the content we learned, although interesting, was either not very accessible for us to practice, or was not applicable to our final projects. I wish that we spent more time on learning html/css/javascript or actively practiced some more methods of visualization. I did not gain much from the readings and felt like I wanted to learn more on the history of art side, as a CS student. I really think that this class can be very successful if it was re-structured to focus on slightly different things on the CS side.",
                "Not enough time spent learning about the site of Dura or any sort of relevant classical or near eastern art and archaeology which were needed to complete higher level work as an outsider in the field. Instead, too much time was spent on discussions of current issues facing the field which while important, were not needed for work in the class",
                "The mix of humanities students and computer science students was both a strenghth and weakness. I loved being able to collaborate for the final project and was very pleased with what my group produced. However, I felt there was a problem with pitching the various learning components of the course for these very different groups. The computer science lectures and tasks often felt too complicated for those of us in the Humanities, but too simple for the computer science students. I thought the humanities task and lectures were well pitched for computer science students - in terms of giving them an overview of Dura-Europos - but many of us in the humanities felt we'd have liked more detail so that we could have supplied our aspect of the final projects better. I would recommend having more split sessions in the future, so that each group could learn skills and information useful to them. Of course, it's also important to keep the collaborative sessions as well - I especially enjoyed trying photogrammetry with my group. Just a little more separation would be helpful though.",
                "For humanists, the CS components often passed by too quickly, and I feel like I hardly learned anything well enough to be useful for me in practice - although it was a good introduction into what is out there."

                "I would recommend this course, especially because there's so much interesting work to be done with digital humanities. I think that the format for this course itself can be tweaked for the future, which is to be expected for a more newly developed course. I would need to tell people though that, due to the nature of being designed for a combination of CS and humanities students, it seems somewhat difficult for this course to provide more in-depth treatments of either side of the material.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, although I would recommend that they have prior web development experience if they are planning to take the CPSC version of the course.",
                "No, unless that student was interested in Dura, had CS knowledge already, and wanted to engage with the digital humanities. The class format made it difficult to be successful in gaining mastery over both the Dura material and the digital humanities material.\r\n\r\nSome of the assignments felt worthwhile, like the photogrammetry one at the Yale University Art Gallery. \r\n\r\nThe readings were interesting but left me wanting more.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class if you're looking to add an elective to your schedule.",
                "It's a pretty good chill CS elective (376), there were only like 3 PSETs spread out sporadically and although they did give us a lot of time to complete them, they were quite difficult and there was not a lot of guidance from the professors/TAs on how to complete them. Perhaps more, smaller PSETs would be a better way to gradually introduce students to web development and data management. Other than the PSETs the readings/final project were not difficult and were quite interesting to do, so I would definitely recommend this class to a CS major who is looking for an elective on the lower end of the workload spectrum.",
                "It's an interesting course, for sure. You should definitely care about the topics, else the guest lectures can feel frivolous at times.",
                "Yes I would. I think a humanities center school like Yale needs more classes where our work can help contribute to humanities related issues/academia. Though this was the first time this class was taught it does have amazing potential to be one of the better classes offered. I think this class really shines in the instructors being not only knowledgeable but really engaged and cooperative with their students.",
                "Yes if you are still starting out in CS or would like a lighter workload. It teaches you some front-end stuff and it's cool to collaborate, but I didn't get as much out of the course as I thought I would. This was the first time they were running this so I believe the course will improve.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes. I can imagine you're probably looking at taking this because it's a CS class that gives a humanities credit, but it is genuinely a lot of fun. The projects are a good way to get yourself involved with humanities, the essay is not particularly difficult (albeit quite long), and the problem sets should get you well-versed in a variety of languages and methods.",
                "Yes, it is an interesting class and a solid CS elective.",
                "I would recommend this course to a CS major looking for a humanities credit that already has a firm understanding of programming in Python/web dev since you don't really learn how to do it but rather what to use it for.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in digital humanities and is interested in working with other team members to deliver a final project.",
                "If you are interested in interdisciplinary research (blending humanities and tech), I would recommend this course. Bear in mind, however, that DH is a relatively new field and thus it seems to be constantly in flux.",
                "Yeah if you're interested in cs+humanities in any way; there aren't exactly a lot of classes in the CS department that try to bridge both of these areas. Hopefully the final project process gets streamlined in the future. I would advise you to pick your final project group very carefully. Try to find a humanities graduate student whose super excited about their area of expertise. And when the time comes to comment on the canvas discussion posts to start group formations, do that with intentionality too. A lot of CS-enrolled students I know just commented on the idea that it was easiest to give feedback for (for the sake of the deadline), and they either switched later on or just went with it (path of least resistance); it will be easier if you choose well early on. The final project is 50% of your grade, so choose something you'll be motivated to do, with people who are excited to work in it with you! Grading otherwise is not stressful at all; pretty much everything is a completion grade; even psets feel that way.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you have a specific interest in learning about the site of Dura Europos on the humanities side, as many of the ways that computer languages were taught on this side I felt like I could have done on my own.",
                "I definitely recommend this course if you are interested in approaching computer science from a humanities perspective. I hope that the class is adjusted a bit to focus more on visual applications of cs rather than metadata and that the transition between cs and humanities related class sessions is more smooth.",
                "No. Both the professors and teaching assistants were very kind and engaged, but the structure of the course felt poorly designed. It felt like students received crash courses in both the humanities and computer science material without really absorbing anything meaningful from either discipline. I often felt confused as to why we were learning the content for any given week and unsure of how to succeed, and the classmates I spoke to generally agreed.",
                "If they had background in classical art and archaeology",
                "I would recommend this course, regardless of whether the changes suggested above are made, but my endorsement would be stronger if those changes were implemented."
