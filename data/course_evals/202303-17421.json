                "This course introduced me to the theory behind the formation of Third World Studies as a discipline and foundation for all other ethnic studies. I learned about prominent thinkers in the discourse of ethnic studies and gained insights into advanced concepts in Ethnic studies.",
                "I learned a lot from the lectures in this class. It encourage me to think critically about many structures in today's world that I had previously taken for granted.",
                "This course highlighted an academic field and geneaology that is seldom taught in higher academia, and completely changed my approach to engaging with my field of study. The course introduces you to a wide range of foundational texts and highlights critical histories of the Third World in various national and global contexts.",
                "This course details an intellectual history of Third World Studies. Most of the class discussion revolves around theory with some historicization of these theories.",
                "this class gave me so much knowledge and ways of knowing and completely changed how i think about what liberation means and how to live it. learning about third world studies, you really come into readings and communities that are so diverse in their approaches to liberation. but even more, prof okihiro is so intelligent, well-read, vulnerable, honest and that shines through his lectures and interactions with students. he connects so many things like ancient greek philosophers and study of science to foundations of colonialist and imperialist thought. he connects taxonomy, diff periods in humanity like the enlightenment and how all these ideas led to how we think about social formations today like gender, sexuality, (dis)ability. please take this class-- it will change ur life.",
                "I developed a strong grasp of the foundational texts, thinkers, and ideologies that shaped Third World Studies.",
                "Foremost, an insight I gained by taking this course is that histories of people of the Third World can be collective without conflating difference. Professor Okihiro's course is probably the most important course I can take at Yale for its call to interrogate history, and ultimately understand it as call to collective action---that can be both local and universal in formation.",
                "I learned a lot about larger structures in society and putting names to different systems of oppression.",
                "I learned an immense amount about historical events and theories around topics such as colonization, imperialism, queer theory, etc. I learned how to think through these difficult topics through many angles and with the aid of our TA.",
                "This course opened my eyes to so much and taught me to challenge institutions and ideas more. I learned about imperialism and the academic progression of third world studies to what it is today. You don't study the third world much itself, it's basically like studying the study of the third world. A lot of history too and academic history. I learned about social formation theory which is genuinely life changing and how to check my biases more. So some pretty useful stuff, and you read a lot of important texts that are absolutely eye-opening. I definitely thought we'd be learning more about the third world itself though :("

            "comments": [
                "1. Strengths: incredible introduction to the field of Third World Studies, extremely knowledgable professor\r\n2. Weaknesses: In class engagement was relatively low for a class where critical reasoning skills is extremely important, high reading load was tough to stay on top of without slightly more comprehensive summaries and discussions in seminar",
                "Strength: This course is incredibly interesting and Professor Okihiro is a wonderful and warm teacher. Weaknesses: This course can feel disorganized at times; instruction is all on a blackboard and there are no slides. This can make it difficult to review for the midterm and final.",
                "Strengths: A plethora of readings that helped touched many different fields of study ranging from articulations about the family, queer politics, or providing histories of Eugenics, the TF team and Okihiro are brilliant and caring, the final essay (which is essentially a meditation about your subjectivity and how did history help dictate your position in society).  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The in-class timed midterm was not ideal and proved to be quite counterproductive to the class's mission of making learning environments accessible many students would have benefitted from having a longer in-class time as some students proved that there were still a fair amount of people taking the test nearing the end of time. The only complaint I have about the final essay was that 15-20 sources for a 10 (max) paged paper were exceptionally challenging, it could have easily been a 12-15 (max) paper. \r\n\r\n If this structure is to stay the same I would suggest making the in-class midterm exam longer and the page limit longer for the final essay.",
                "This course is incredibly theory heavy and has no real structure or flow. It at times felt all over the place and I struggled to follow the trajectory of the information I was expected to learn. The course has so many intricate topics which change every week based on readings. It did not feel like the course built on itself, but rather was a survey of the discipline. This was not made clear in the syllabus.",
                "The course material was highly engaging and, despite being challenging at times, was integral to making this course so impactful. The lecture style was a little hard to follow at timesI think that having more visual aids/a more organized presentation format would be helpful in making this course easier to follow as students new to this field.",
                "A hand out at the start of lecture that has the important terms would help students know what to write down. I sometimes didnt know what was important or not. \r\nIn terms of strengths, Professor Okihiro is a phenomenal lecturer and incredibly caring. His lectures were engaging and informative, and section was helpful to parse through some of the more difficult texts.",
                "weaknesses: maybe more assignments or essays to help you engage more with the ideas from lecture and readings. i loved learning about this material i would be so happy to have written more cuz all we had were weekly discussion posts\r\nstrenghts: the TAs were some of the most genuine ppl and they truly embodied the ideas we talk about in class like solidarity and community care. prof okihiro is so wonderful and sweet, he interacts w the class and tells us stories of his past. he truly critically analyzes and is honest about being at yale and what that means. ppl say this is the most theory heavy class in erm but i thought it was on par w other erm classes and it provides such a great foundation for social sciences and the humanities. this class makes me so proud to be erm major fr.",
                "Professor Okihiro is so knowledgeable, and I enjoy the flow of his lectures--he doesn't teach off of lecture slides but rather his own memory, and he writes important concepts on the blackboard as if he were creating a word cloud. I think this structure lends itself to more organic interactions with the class's questions and current events that are relevant to our readings. I also enjoyed that there was closer engagement with the text during sections--Okihiro's big-picture approach to lecture and the more detailed analysis in sections complemented each other well. The course is definitely heavy on theory, which I think is immensely important to learn. My one small criticism is that I wish we received a few more examples or guidelines for the final paper--I am overall really appreciative of the less rigid approach Professor Okihiro and the TFs take for assignments, but I think I would have written my final with a bit more confidence had we been provided with more examples or expectations for the assignment.",
                "A strength of this course is the breadth and depth of knowledge---theoretical, historical, cultural, literary, and philisophical---that Professor Okihiro draws upon. I also really appreciated the organization of the course, and how each week was thematic and each lecture was generally divided into discursive and material understandings of the theme.  A weakness of the course, albeit small, is that the ratio of content from lecture to section is extremely large, so much of the knowledge discussed in lecture gets left undiscussed.",
                "There is a lot of jargon that is difficult to understand in the beginning, but Professor Okihiro is very clear and engaging . The readings are incredibly dense but doable if you collaborate with others.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- content\r\n- Professor\r\n- lectures\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- organization \r\n\r\n\r\nHow it could be improved:\r\n- create note sheets or slideshows\r\n- create a more organized system for reading responses \r\n- use canvas in a more productive way (for ex, for assignments)",
                "STRENGTHS: Gary. He's an incredible genius and I am so glad to have spent time with him, he has changed my perspective on life and the world and he is so amazing. The conversations we had one-on-one were enlightening, he is legitimately one of the best teachers I've ever had and we all love him so much. This guy has genuinely changed the world. Also, very organized reading schedule and PDFs. .....WEAKNESSES: I thought we would study the third world itself more and how to solve a lot of their more specific problems. The later part of the course about gender and crt and sexuality was definitely intriguing and I'm glad I learned it, but I would have liked to know more about the third world itself in addition to it. How do we fix the water problems? How can the third world get peace? Yes, women's oppression is based on an arbitrary social distinction, but how do we actually help women? I have an internship with fragility in South Sudan and while I've learned a lot about how to be ethical and the importance of eliminating dependence, I didn't learn many feasible ways to solve their problems. It was difficult to tolerate the over intellectualization in the readings. An author legitimately used the word 'problematical' and it once took me 30 minutes to interpret a 3 page reading and the wikipedia article on it took me maybe 2 minutes to get through. I have no aversion to academic and dense texts, but these texts seemed to be intentionally confusing so it would sound smarter. It was unfortunate because the material really is interesting. .....IMPROVEMENTS: Grade inflation. It's so terrible. Literally I think you could have only shown up to two classes and gotten an A."

                "I would the readings and content was very interesting.",
                "Yes, if they are looking for a very well rounded and comprehensive analysis of Third World Studies and hegemonic ways of thinking.",
                "Yes, but only if you have a strong interest in ER&M and are eager to discuss theory. The reading workload for this class is significant, too. If you don't like digesting big readings heavy in theory, engaging in discussion will be very difficult.",
                "I probably would BUT I think students need to know a few things before taking this class. As amazing as the class is and a lecturer Okihiro-- truly an expert in the field as Third World Studies is his articulation --  is, the language he uses, the histories/genealogies, and theorists he pulls from is at times inaccessible. I'd find myself having to google many of the theorists or vocabulary he was mentioning in class despite being an ER&M major myself. There also are no slideshows used in class, but rather listening to Okihiro-- who is an amazing lecturer. However, at times, I think having a visual representation helps signpost what is going on and how were previous ideas he talked about were all connected. Additionally, many of the readings are dense and long, so even with sections at times, I would be feeling a little bit unsure in total what the writers were fully saying. I think we could benefit from cutting down the readings a little bit more and having more time to explain in lectures and sections\r\n \r\nThat said,  I HAVE NO REGRETS about taking the class despite it at times difficult, and found the final essay to be perhaps one of the most meaningful things I have written thus far. \r\n\r\n.",
                "If they are interested in the theory behind Third World Studies and plan to major in ER&M, I think this course is valuable in providing a survey of the prominent thinkers and discourses in the field. There are other, more engaging and focused courses which might provide similar learning for a student that is not concerned with theory.",
                "Yes, it is really interesting so I would go for it. The texts are challenging and require deep engagement, but I think it is possible to do well without reading every single one. It is definitely a class where you only get as much out of it as you put in.",
                "Yes! I think that any student involved in ethnic studies/identity-based studies should take this course. Even if you are not involved in those fields, I think that this course provides important historical context in understanding Yale as an institution and its current role in addressing social issues.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in TWS and who enjoys theory. If you arent a fan of reading and discussing theory, this probably isnt a class youll enjoy.",
                "ofc i recommend, if i had to take 1 course at yale, it would be third world studies. it provided so much breadth and connection to so many areas of study like sociology, anthro, life sciences, philosophy and connects back to third world studies. prof okihiro is so great at articulating flaws of erm and how separation of indigenous studies, black studies, etc. can be limiting so he tries to draw ideas and scholars from all over. you can truly see how he lives out what he teaches about liberation and solidarity. he is so inspiring and i just want to be like him when i grow up.",
                "I think every student at Yale should absolutely take this course, regardless of major. The course has strongly influenced my understanding of both large and small scale historical currents, from world history and highly influential ideologies to the specific ways the Yale institution perpetuates oppressive structures, all of which shape my current subject-position. You will gain a wide and thorough background in ethnic studies, especially on the topics of imperialism, colonialism, and capitalism.",
                "I would wholly recommend this course to another student at Yale because more than learning about the Third World as an academic subject, this class positions you into interrogating your personal role and subject position in the Third World.",
                "YESSSS! You will learn so much and professor Okihiro's lectures are incredible. This is the only lecture based course that I always attended.",
                "I would definitely recommend this to another student because no matter what, because it is important to learn about the full history rather than just bias history we may be taught earlier in school.",
                "It depends. It's definitely an interesting course that changed my perspective on the world, but it was a bit extreme. I lean VERY FAR LEFT (like reading rawls and marx) and this course made me seem centrist. This is the class your crazy republican grandparents warned you about because they heard someone saying math is racist on Fox News (someone in the class legitimately made this exact claim I wish I was joking). Okihiro does amazing and he is so enlightening, but the problem is really the class environment and some of the readings. The class attracts a lot of wealthy performative activists who embarrass the left with their trivial complaints and detract attention away from those solving actual problems, like poverty and food insecurity. Yes, language and representation is important, but there are more pressing issues that class time could have been devoted to. Also, the insane egos and lack of perspective of the students and TF's are difficult to deal with to say the least. We would read about people vomiting up their own lungs and then they would focus the discussion on how using the word 'woman' is epistemological violence and how feminism is racist, then act like they were solving the world's problems. The class seems performative, infeasible, and lacking in substance and this is coming from an EPE/Philosophy major. However, Third World Studies has taught me to challenge a lot of things and beliefs and social formation theory is life changing. You could just read Okihiro's book and some of the authors listed in the syllabus and avoid all of the nonsense that goes on in this class. However, it's also interesting and if you read a lot of European philosophy, it's an amazing class to widen your perspective and it definitely made me more critical of marxism and european philosophy and made me more open minded so... It's up  to you."
