                "The discussions were very lively and enjoyable.  There is a lot of space to explore our own thoughts and philosophical positions.",
                "Strengths: readings were engaging, class discussion was productive and exciting, we were able to have a close group despite being virtual \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: we sometimes would get so wrapped up in our discussion that we would not actually discuss the reading that we did for that day",
                "The course required students to think beyond individualized opinions and consider the perspectives of a variety of authors, fellow classmates, and modern-day ideologies. It also created a highly welcoming environment in which each student felt compelled to share their ideas."

Every seminar with him was filled with lively conversation, yet no one's opinions were ever looked over or undervalued. Beyond the DS syllabus, Professor Grimstad did a wonderful job of introducing us to the world of philosophy. If I  could take this class again, I definitely would.",

The conversations we had in class were always really interesting and engaging in thinking about fundamental questions on what it means to be human. This class was a great introduction to the main areas of classical philosophy, especially for someone without a large background in the subject.",

                "I would highly recommend this course. Students were encouraged to think originally and formulate their own opinions on topics that have been debated for centuries, while also acquiring skills such as quick thinking, written communication, and collaboration."
