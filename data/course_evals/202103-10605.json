                "Fundamentals of conducting and score analysis.",
                "I learned a few technical aspects about conducting, but mostly I learned about what it takes to be a conductor (it's harder than you think), and I got good practice conducting real musicians.",

            "comments": [
                "I think the class is very well structured, basing itself off of what the individual class needs. However, I wish that there was more transparency in how the students are doing grade wise. Also, the level of enrollment for the second semester is a HUGE change which does not seem appropriate given that it is only an intermediate class, rather than an advanced class.",
                "Honestly, the most fun part of the class was playing in our mini orchestra. Maestro Boughton has a lot of cool stories and insights as well, and keeps the class engaging. How much you learn is directly affected by the size of the class, since more people means less time for each individual to conduct, which is kind of a shame but there's no way around it.",
                "The course is so cool! For the majority of it, we were working with fellow classmates who we could physically conduct in a live setting! So that part of the course design was immensely cool. Also, at the beginning of the course, going through the baton patterns for different time signatures and learning more of the technicalities of cuing different instruments was really helpful.\r\n\r\nA weakness of the course was that it was a bit disorganized - it was unclear for most of it when we were supposed to do readings/prepare different sections of the piece, etc. Sometimes it seemed like we were expected to have done certain things but they hadn't actually been asked of us. It was also rather nerve-wracking that the final was the only graded assignment.",
                "Strength - actually get to conduct an orchestra (students bring their instruments to class)\r\nWeakness - too many people in the class so there is not enough individualized attention. Also we have no idea about our grade in the class ever (it's completely subjective)",
                "Mostly, time in class was too limited. Also, there was somewhat of a lack of canvas material, or direction outside of class, but in class, everything was excellent.",
                "Strengths -- Boughton is incredibly knowledgeable and has a lot of wisdom to share!\r\nWeaknesses -- There were way too many people in the class which limited how much we could learn. Conducting is really something that only improves by doing, so the fact that we only got to conduct for about 3 minutes every third class did not lend itself to learning as much as we could have. There were never any assessments, so currently, none of us have any idea what our grade is as the only grade is the final. As an undergrad, I definitely wish I knew this going in!",
                "We got to conduct an orchestra made up of members of the class, which was very good because half of the people were YSM grad students. The class was pretty big though so we each didn't get to conduct as often as we should have and I think this caused some students to get more out of the course than others.",
                "The course is not organized as well as it could be and you often go into class not knowing what to expect or what you should prepare.",
                "Since there were 20-30 people in the class, the problem becomes the limited time that each one gets to conduct. It happened that we had the right people for a small orchestra with only an instrument missing, which allowed us to conduct the class in turns, so only for that reason did the amount of people we had make sense.\r\nThe book wouldn't be necessary if the important parts are summarized externally."

                "Yes - such cool material/experience and a fun setting.",
                "I loved this course! There is so much to learn from Maestro Boughton with his wealth of experience, and I'd highly recommend it.",

                "Yes, if you're interested in conducting for the first time or improving your skills, this is a pretty good course. It won't instantly make you a great conductor but it's a good start.",
                "Yes but only if you are actually interested in conducting. The course would be very stressful otherwise.",
                "Yes, to any classical musician interested in trying conducting. Prof Boughton is a great teacher. If you practice outside of class, you will get more out of the class."
