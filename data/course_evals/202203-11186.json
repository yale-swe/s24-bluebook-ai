I gained a lot of useful vocabulary that is relevant in conversations about education, media, and politics.  I also learned more about Chinese culture, e.g. through learning about food customs."

                "The greatest weakness is honestly the amount of homework/studying required per week. There are quizzes everyday (both online/in person), and multiple long homework exercises to complete. That being said, the homework is very similar to the tests, so if you are doing well on the homework you will be prepared for the test.",
                "Course is good in terms of learning new vocabulary and writing. However, too much on the assessment is based on the ability to write.",
                "Strengths: I think for the most part the course is paced very well and had a generally manageable workload, such as how we split each passage into multiple lessons. Xu Laoshi gave great feedback on our work and created a wonderful classroom environment to spur discussions.\r\nWeaknesses: The workload became relatively high in the last two weeks of class with an essay, test, and two projects. It would be great it those could be spread out a little more to allow more focus on each of them.",
                "My weaknesses are my reading and writing skills, especially with a formal setting, but Ive been improving it with all the grammar we learn. My strengths are my tonal accuracy and i strengthen that as well with the oral presentations we gave at the end of the year as well as participating in class.",
                "The class had a very good workload schedule, and every deadline and assignment was outlined very clearly, making it easy to keep track of. Classes were focused on learning new phrases and grammatical structures, as well as practicing them orally in class. The only weakness of the class is that more materials/study guides can be provided to help study for the exams!",
                "I think that this course is really good in that we learned a lot about formal speech in different settings and also had a lot of practice for all the new content we learned. I think that a weakness was that there was a lot of content in the later half of the course and it felt very quick.",
                "Strengths: I liked the topics we discussed, especially in terms of education, Chinese culture, immigration/politics, gentrification, and romance.  In the past, my Chinese classes were very far removed from what I cared about day-to-day, and to have topics such as immigration reflected in my Chinese curriculum was great. Weaknesses: the level of engagement in class was not great.  Though my teacher tried to engage us in conversations, often it would fall silent.  I did not gain as much from class as I did from homework, assessments, and practices."

In fact, when I went home, my mom pointed out how much my Chinese had improved. Besides the learning, the class has a wonderful atmosphere that allowed us to have nice conversations.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course because of how fast all aspects of my Chinese learning improved and how engaging the class is.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, especially for any student that wants to refine their native Chinese speaking/reading/writing skills. Even just speaking Chinese on a regular basis alone can greatly help with maintaining language proficiency, but a lot can be learned from this class that will elevate and improve speaking skills.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in improving their Chinese fluency.",
                "Yes. This course offers a great view into aspects of historical and modern Chinese culture. The workload is only high in weeks where essays and projects are due. Overall, I appreciated this course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to students who place in this level and are looking to improve their Chinese or to re-learn Chinese.  This class has definitely made my communication with Chinese-speaking family members better."
