   "comments": [
    "This class allowed me to develop my own taste in  essays through our readings of The Best American Essays and also introduced me to the key facets of strong creative essay writing, from incorporating storyline with psychological distance, to movement within an essay, to the puzzle-piece like nature of essay writing.",
    "How to write well quickly and be more introspective",
    "I learned a lot about constructing personal essays that are both valuable to me and are, I hope, meaningful to others. I also practiced and improved my skills as an editor and writing workshop participant.",
    "This class taught me how to craft essays of different lengths. It also taught me how to edit extensively.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of what an essay actually is. My writing improved greatly, I learned to appreciate the organization of my paragraphs and sentences more, and, on the macro level, to think more deeply about my stylistic choices. I also developed a stronger ability to read great writers to parse out what makes their writing strong.",
    "Finer eye for craft. Exercises for developing a piece. Editing skills.",
    "I began this course pretty shy to speak up first about assigned reading in class, or to share my essays confidently with the whole class. I was nervous at first when Prof Zarin was cold-calling people, but I think overall it made me more confident in my abilities as a reader and writer. I got a lot of exposure to various authors each week in this class, and feel more able to identify why an essay is working or why it isn't."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: great class discussions and helpful line edits\r\nWeaknesses: I wish she had continued to read our drafts once peer editing started",
    "I love the peer editing structure of the course as well as the personalized attention that professor Zarin gives each of the writers in the workshop. Her edits were detailed, and she always made time to meet if we wanted to talk through ideas, drafts, etc.",
    "The strengths of this course are the workshops where you engage with your work, reading the essays for a different author each week to develop a richer understanding of their style, and Professor Zarin's detailed feedback. Where the class could be improved would be to create more accountability structures to ensure that students are spending time revising their work - an essay due every other week is a demanding schedule, which can make students not devote the time to revise their work thoroughly.  You also do not get any grades until the end of the semester.",
    "At times, I wished we studied less Contemporary essays!",
    "This class was very consistent in its assignments, as 2 essays from \"Best American Essays 2019\" and 3 essays from a different author each week were assigned. I got a lot of practice writing different styles of essays, as each essay had a different word count requirement. My biggest criticism of the course was its organization, as there was no syllabus and no essay prompts, and class often went a half hour over time."

   "comments": [
    "It is a very good course for learning to generate writing. I learned a lot and would recommend it.",
    "This is a good opportunity to practice essay-writing, with lots of feedback from Professor Zarin and classmates. It's very much self-guided in terms of writing topics, and I found that to be a valuable opportunity to explore ideas that are important and challenging to me.",
    "Yes! it will make you a stronger writer! You will learn from your classmates (who are brilliant) as well as professor Zarin",
    "Yes, take this course if you want to become a better writer but stay engaged with the readings as well as other students' work. You can learn a lot from your classmates.",
    "No better place to practice writing. Theres a lot of latitude in this class to experiment: take advantage of it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is passionate about writing and looking for some creative liberty. The course requires self-motivation and organization, as expectations were never totally clear because there was no syllabus or essay prompts."
