                "Strengths: Prof. Amand is phenomenal. He has a very deep grasp of the material and his teaching style is excellent. He doesn't simply \"lecture\", but rather asks guiding questions that allow students to arrive at the key results themselves and understand the underlying intuition behind why things are the way they are. His explanations are meticulous and easy to follow. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As with all summer courses, the main weakness I see is the shortage of time to dive into the material further.",
                "The course is excellent. The pacing, while very fast, is logical, and everything that needs to be covered is covered. Solutions to problem sets were also posted promptly. Also, I really liked the textbook. Readings were clear and problems were helpful.",
                "Strengths- Great professor that really knows how to breakdown the material and keep the class engaged. Probably the best econ preq I've taken so far",
                "Interesting topics. Lots of information for a summer course.  Could have more interactive and varied teaching methods.",
                "strengths: professor always super engaged, ed discussion and after class office hours were great resources for asking questions\r\nweaknesses: too many videos to watch in between classes, could be cut down as difficult to manage all of the reading, videos and pset assignments at times",
                "Strengths: Marnix is a great lecturer and the content is very interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures take sooooo long to watch (understandable I guess cause it's a summer class). Also I wish they sent out announcements every time pset solutions were out, because I often forgot to check them at the right time (psets are only graded for completion in this class)."

                "Yes, if they had the time and dedication to do it. I will admit, especially after the fall and spring semester online, taking this class over zoom was difficult. However, I really enjoyed macro, and the concepts that I didn't understand or only had a vague idea about became clear and real in this class.",
                "Yes, although I have taken the same Macroeconomics course in Zhejiang University, I still learned something new. The professor explained some basic concepts and models from a totally different angle.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, it is engaging and teaches valuable information.",
                "yeah, it's a good class to take over the summer and marnix was a great professor...just be prepared to put in the work",
                "yes!",
                "Yes, I would recommend. Taking classes with students from Yale is my pleasure, and their activeness really impress me.",
                "For sure - summer session probably won't be the same in future years because of the lack of a COVID pandemic (causing everyone to get two free credits) but it was a very worthwhile class that I'm glad I took. Macro is very different from micro (ECON 115) so do be warned of that, there's a lot less math and a lot more conceptual understanding that's required. The psets and exams were very much a mix of logical reasoning and understanding the economic theory/history necessary to answer the question. But overall it's a great subject to learn no matter what you plan to study at Yale so definitely take it if you can. Two summer-specific warnings: beware the time commitment because the designated class time is just for discussion and exams, all the lectures you have to watch prerecorded and they take an outrageously long time due to the condensed nature of a summer class. Also the psets are graded for completion so to make sure you have everything right you have to look at the posted solutions (sometimes the TA gives you a heads-up to check them, but not always)."
