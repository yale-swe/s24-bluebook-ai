    "How to read primary texts. Classical mythology & the modern debates surrounding it.",
    "i learned 1) how to engage with verse as opposed to my past experiences with prose 2) how to question the place of renowned literature in the modern canon 3) how to move past surface interpretations of difficult texts",
    "I learned that mythologies are mutable and forever shifting depending on the teller, and that the types of stories we value reveal something about us as a culture.",
    "I developed a further ability to discuss classic literature and draw different interpretations from them. In addition, I also learned how to contextualize the myths; to look at them as the product of a peoples rather than just a story.",
    "I learned a huge amount about Classical Mythologies throughout the Greco-Roman period, spanning many centuries and many different genres. It was a great class as well to improve critical thinking skills in a variety of mediums, through reading poems, plays, and articles, viewing art and listening and watching other representations of myth too.",
    "So much! This course introduced me to so many Greek and Roman myths in a very accessible manner. All of the texts tied to one another very well. This course will change your general approach to story-telling and their potential rooting.",
    "I definitely learned a lot the greek and roman mythologies, which is just what this course is about. I also developed my abilities to make connections between the past and the present through modern-day Odyssey\/Oedipus exercises we did. I am more inclined towards STEM-related subjects, so this course also helped make me comfortable with humanities at the college level.",
    "Learning to have group discussions.",
    "I read important books, but didn't learn much beyond that.",
    "I learned a lot about the cultures of the Ancient Greeks and Romans, as well as a knowledge of how to analyze their respective mythologizes."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: professor, material, format.\r\nWeaknesses: Zoom.",
    "the strengths were the variety of readings and the variety of interpretations that those readings brought to source texts. i personally found some of the source readings like the Aeneid quite dry and difficult to engage with, however. everyone seemed open to discussion and willing to input their ideas. i think that in humanities classes similar to these there is an expectation that the teaching will be unengaging but prof. kraus was fantastic.",
    "The online version of the course was successful in facilitating the learning experience in many ways. However, the grading of the in-class short responses resulted in some anxiety on my part, as I was expected to produce the same quality of response as I would have when given a few days to complete a prompt. In addition, the final project being a very different animal than all the other assignments, I felt that I did not have much preparation on how to incorporate what Ive learned throughout the course in such a long format. Other than that, I have no complaints about the course which were not addressed within the span of time I was enrolled in it.",
    "The class is amazingly taught, and I loved the reading selections we  did throughout. I would've liked to go more into some of the modern selections and to set up the discussions in a way that allowed us to move through them bit quicker. Another strength was the use of break out rooms  it made discussion a whole lot easier. However, the way these smaller discussions were brought into the larger group could've been easier and more organized.",
    "I would have preferred to take the quizzes at the beginning of the class, before learning new material. One strength is that it was very well structured.",
    "The professor for this course was excellent and very engaging. The discussion portion of the class was great, both in whole class discussion and smaller groups. However, there was some awkwardness due to zoom in the smaller group discussions, but I'm not sure there's a way to overcome that considering you've never met any of the people you're virtually grouped with in person. I also felt like it could be frustrating when a question would be asked and ten people would 'raise' their hands. If you were the tenth person to raise your hand, you would be last to speak, that is if you had anything relevant and original left to say at that point anyway. In-person classes avoid this problem because when many students raise a hand, one person is typically chosen, the rest put down their hands, giving people who didn't initially raise their hand a chance to jump and have more time to formulate a response to the initial question. For example, after one person would speak, I might have something of note to say, but if there were 5+ hands already 'raised' I didn't usually raise my, knowing that we would not likely have the time to hear me speak, nor would it likely be relevant. Additionally, this would sometimes result in a discussion in which people reiterated points or took a good discussion off topic just to get participation in. Though, I'm not sure this can really be fixed in a zoom format. Back to strengths, the readings were all super interesting as well as the ancient texts. Sometimes the reading was a bit overwhelming, but it was doable and well worth it in the end. The powerpoints were very clear and nicely laid out, and the professor nearly always was clear and asked discussion-provoking questions. The narrative of the class was clear and well-outlined and I was glad we read up to the Metamorphoses. It came full circle in a lot of ways from the Hesiod. The variety of activities were also really great and helpful to my learning of the material. Overall, this was one of the best classes I've taken and certainly one of the best, if not the best, zoom class I've done.",
    "Strengths: everyone was very engaged \r\nWeakness: the amount of reading altered depending on the text, making it difficult to routinely plan for weekly assignments.",
    "The course balanced lecture and discussion really well, despite it being online. However, I sometimes felt a bit intimidated during our class discussions (which was probably mostly in my head) and did not participate as much as I wanted to. Having breakout rooms more often might be one way to help students who were shyer like me.",
    "Good syllabus, and Prof Kraus is committed and kind. But the reading quizzes felt like middle school, and the analysis of texts was generally quite superficial. I'd recommend Prof Kraus spends less time lecturing on ancient context, a bit more time on close reading, reception, and analysis.",
    "Great course, lots of good readings. Wish we could've delved more in-depth for Ovid's Metamorphoses but understandable given the time constraints."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I took it because the material seemed interesting but I learned that it's so much more relevant to modern debates and topics than I could've imagined.",
    "it was a really wonderful class. this is really the only class of its sort i've seen offered at yale which is strange for such a popular topic, so if you have time to take it i would. the readings, taking into account how many would be assigned for a typical 75 minute class if we were in a normal fall\/spring semester, were still significantly more than i've encountered in seminars of a similar size.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is a great stepping-in point to study the classics no matter how much previous experience you have with the material. You experience ancient stories in a fresh way by examining them through the perspective of myth, which gives new insight into how myth has been shaped over time. The readings are largely fascinating and contribute to interesting discussion.",
    "Yes! Such a great way to get into the classics and get a broader view of the cultures behind them. It honestly was a very fun course and I would recommend it wholeheartedly.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course! I loved Professor Kraus, but I think the course would still be excellent and fascinating with another professor. You will learn so much and really develop your critical thinking skills - this was a pleasant surprise for me. The discussions were super fruitful and I often found myself thinking about the readings and class discussions beyond our class time. A huge amount of material is covered, but you don't need to worry about memorizing the numerous, numerous characters. The important ones will be made clear and will stand out to you. The reading can be very powerful and enjoyable and is well-worth anyone's time who is the least bit interested in this realm of mythology and also the Greco-Roman world and their literature.",
    "Yes! It is a decent amount of readings, but very worth it.",
    "Yes. The course was well-formatted, well-taught, and, overall, just very interesting. The course is definitely a lot of work, but managing to get through it feels very rewarding.",
    "Yes I would.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student with little to no prior experience with classical literature, who wants an introduction to classical texts in a supportive environment.",
    "Only for an easy humanities credit. Not a good course for people well versed in the humanities.",
    "Yes, an excellent survey course of the great classics of Greece and Rome. You get to read a number of Greek tragedies, as well as the Odyssey, the Aeneid, and some of the Metamorphoses."
