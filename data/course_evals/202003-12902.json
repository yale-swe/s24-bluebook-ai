                "This course helped elucidate some \"exceptions to the rules\" and clarify distinctions in various points of Spanish grammar about which I had always felt confused in previous courses. We reviewed cases for using preterit\/imperfect, ser\/estar, many uses of subjunctive, conditional statements, uses of se, placement of adjectives, por\/para, some prepositions, and different ways to say certain phrases in English depending on the context (like \"to become\" or \"to take\"). We went over a lot of the points that we had already seen on a basic level in earlier Spanish classes, but we really focused on understanding the context and thinking about how meaning can change with subtle changes in tense\/mode.",

                "Strengths: Your grammar will definitely improve. Despite being a grammar course, it was not dull at all as we read short stories, watched films, and engaged with other material beyond the textbook. Professor Pilar is incredible! She is very understanding if you need to submit late work or if you don't understand something and need additional support. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Your grammar will improve, BUT it will mainly be helpful in the written language and not in everyday communication. The asynchronous component of this course this semester was not the best as it was not always clear what our assignments were. Also, the beginning of the course could have been a bit more organized in terms of how grammar topics were taught, but it should be noted that this was greatly improved after the midterm when our professor created useful power points, charts, and a shared Google Doc with exercises and notes which was a great resource.",
                "It is a course structured around grammar, so it's not going to be the most interesting class ever. For what it is, this class is interesting, but could still be improved.",
                "The strength of this course is that the course clarifies previously unclear or confusing parts of Spanish grammar. The weekly conversations that students have are also extremely helpful in improving Spanish speaking skills. A weakness might be that the course covers so many rules in a short amount of time.",
                "I really enjoyed having the opportunity to read\/watch various stories\/movies in this course in order to better understand grammatical concepts in context. Pilar was always very receptive and encouraging us to ask questions whenever there was confusion at any point throughout the class. I liked that we did homework assignments on our own before classes to introduce ourselves to the concepts and then we did some more interactive work\/asked questions during class. I thought that the format was good overall. Of course there can sometimes be communication difficulties during a zoom class since we can't always see each other's faces and have to juggle multiple tabs\/papers at once sometimes, but this is not a fault of the course itself and more of a general adjustment that we have to make with online learning. The asynchronous day was good (in my opinion) because we got a chance to slow down and take some extra time to review if needed.",
                "Pilar Asensio is a fabulous teacher. She was so supportive and made the class very enjoyable even over zoom. The conversations we had were interesting and she has a wonderful teaching manner.",
                "Strengths: a lot of opportunities to practice grammar concepts, definitely improved my reading and writing skills. \r\nWeaknesses: some of the assignments feel like busy work, could have a greater focus on speaking."

During weeks in which we had exams\/compositions, we would meet live on the usual asynchronous day.",

                "If you placed into L5 and are simply looking to get your language requirement out of the way, there are classes with MUCH easier workloads and grading to take. But, if you are serious about improving your Spanish- especially if you want to do so before taking more advanced L5 courses that require a lot of writing or if you want to use Spanish in your career down the line- I would 100% recommend this course, especially with Profesora Pilar who is the best.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student. While there is a lot of work involved, this course has been extremely helpful in improving my Spanish skills (particularly with using tenses when writing\/speaking). With enough time and effort put in, there's truly so much to learn from this course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Some students might not be interested in this course because we spend a lot of time going over some seemingly \"nit-picky\" examples, but I think it has really helped my confidence in Spanish. I would love to spend time reading and discussing abstract topics more, but I have struggled with that when I don't feel that I can properly communicate my ideas. Also, we met with language coaches and students from Ecuador outside of class, and that was a really cool way to improve conversational skills and attempt to include some of the ideas from class without worrying about being perfect. It was a nice way to feel more confident in speaking about various topics of interest. Of course there are still many things for me to learn and understand in practice, but I feel a little more knowledgeable, at least in the sense that I acknowledge the fact that meaning can change depending on grammatical choices. I felt that assignments were reasonable and Pilar always provided helpful comments and corrections to facilitate understanding. I was slightly intimidated at first, but this course really is open and inviting as long as you do your best to keep up. And if you are struggling or feel behind, the professors are willing to answer any questions and provide office hours. Although I was originally thinking about taking a creative writing course in Spanish this fall, I am really happy with my decision to improve my grammar now so that I can better convey my thoughts later on.",

                "Yes. Expect to put in some work, definitely wasn't an \"easy\" course to take first semester, first year BUT the pay off was pretty good and I think my reading and writing abilities are definitely better because of this course."
