    "I learned how to read Supreme Court cases and write law papers.",
    "I definitely have a better sense of our government system.",
    "I learned a lot about early US history and the evolution of supreme court jurisprudence on big topics like race, sex, and privacy. Also pretty central to the curriculum: what Akhil Amar thinks of the US Constitution.",
    "overview over constitutional law and how it's developed, focus on 14th amendment, commerce clause, etc.",
    "I learned about US constitution and the mechanisms through which it supports the way we think about case law today on the federal level. I learned how to use legal evidence to analyze constitutional issues.",
    "I learned a lot about how constitutional arguments regarding rights, privacy, and discrimination have evolved over time. This course is a great survey of Supreme Court arguments and historical context surrounding the Constitution. I learned how to argue with the Constitution in mind, using various modalities to strengthen my claims.",
    "How to think clearly, like a lawyer.",
    "I learned a lot of ConLaw.",
    "I learned a great deal about the Constitutional and constitutional interpretation in this class. Prof. Amar was also very good at mixing in relevant history to give the proper background in this class. I think this course really helped crystallize the difference between civics and constitutional law (the later being a much richer and complex field).",
    "I learned how judges and constitutional scholars think through cases and issues. I also learned about the development of rights and how to analyze present day legal issues.",
    "I learned a ton of Constitutional Law.",
    "Basically learned the entire constitution and the emergence of different rights revolutions throughout historic case rulings",

    "I learned how to critically read a court case and create a court brief.",
    "Got a broad survey of the major issues in constitutional law the judicial, legislative, and executive powers, commerce clause, equal protection, substantive due process, etc. Read through pretty much all of the notable cases from the past century or so. Learned how to think critically about the law, and got a taste of what going to law school might look like.",
    "Great class with a renowned professor. You learn so much in a single semester. It's a lot of work and pretty demanding, but very worth it. BUT if you're not invested or interested, you will find it hard to keep up with.",
    "I gained a very strong base of knowledge on constitutional issues that I'm sure will be extremely useful and applicable in the future.",
    "Learned some cases (some stuck far better than others) and the modalities of constitutional reasoning. Overall, though, I learned so little because Amar's lectures are rambly and diffuse. Everything I learned I learned from section.",

    "an understanding of the law cases we studied and the legal reasoning behind the holdings in the cases",
    "Introduction to law as a discipline",
    "This class made me think in an entirely different way about politics, American government, and decision making in general. It made me address in my thinking the difference that exists between morals and laws, and how the judiciary must be wary of subordinating the latter to the former in cases. It also gave me a new appreciation for thinking about all current events from a constitutional and legal perspective.",
    "This was an incredible deep dive into the world of the U.S. Constitution, providing me with a broad understanding of the way various constitutional questions have developed over the course of American history.",
    "This course is an amazing, in-depth overview of the underpinnings of Constitutional Law.",

    "I gained more knowledge and writing skills from this class than in any other course I have ever taken: the sheer volume of material covered is immense, and the readings are truly interesting and engaging. I learned a great deal about the American legal system, legal history, and nature of the Supreme Court. I also learned how to read cases (both in full and case briefs) and effectively summarize and analyze them, and this course is overall taught very similarly to a law-school class.",

    "analytical thinking, critical thinking, applicability of history to present day",
    "I learned a lot about the liberal originalist interpretation of the Constitution. I also learned a bit about American history.",
    "by CDing it, I didn't learn much. To learn you really have to keep up with all the readings",
    "A working understanding of ConLaw.",
    "This course gave me the background to better understand where we are now as a nation, democracy, and society.",
    "How to read legal cases, how to make legal arguments",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "more focused readings and replace exams with papers\/projects",
    "Class is very informative, but lecture can move by very fast and it can be hard to keep up with readings, especially when Professor Amar mentions random cases or cases you have not gotten to yet in lecture. It can also be hard to follow him during lecture as it is just listening to him talk and there are no visual cues.",
    "Professor Amar is very passionate, but lecture often consisted of ramblings and it was hard to stay engaged.",
    "CREDIT D THIS CLASS! You will still be able to learn course content without the pressure of getting an A. There is a new grade distribution in place with only 15% getting As and it is not worth fighting for the A. I am strongly against using this distribution.",
    "I feel like there could be more discussion. There is a lot covered in lecture and we usually would hear it once and never again. It was hard to retain what was important and what was not.",
    "I understand that this is a survey course in constitutional doctrine, but I think Amar had room to touch a bit more on critical race theory and alternative interpretations of court opinions.",
    "materials well put together, whoever figured out recording the lectures was the way to go is a genius \r\n\r\n\r\nwould have been interesting to go more into other amendments\/facets of constitutional law, but it already is a lot of information so makes sense.",
    "The course is really well organized to cover some of the most important areas of constitutional law. The TAs are really important to the class in terms of offering feedback and synthesizing the material, and the assignments, including the exams, are pretty well thought out (although the paper's prompt is just a reading response, which I think could be more specific).",
    "It's a lot of reading. You'll need to pick and choose how you go about all of the case-book readings. Lecture is much more informative when you've done the readings beforehand, or else it seems like a mish-mash of Amar's arguments.",
    "More organization with the syllabus would be helpful.",
    "I think the reading response paper should be due earlier. It was a very back-half loaded semester in terms of workload. Overall, interesting though.",
    "Prof. Amar is extremely knowledgeable and an engaging lecture. My TF was also fantastic, and I found discussion sections to be extremely useful for diving into cases with more specificity. \r\nI think this is one of the few courses during my tenure at Yale so far that I really had to pour my heart and soul into without necessarily receiving an A grade, which was refreshing.",
    "You do not have to go to lecture to do well in this class. In fact, though I respect Amar immensely and think he is one of the great legal scholars of our time, the lectures actually frustrated me immensely. I had a hard time following them and often left confused. \r\n\r\nI think the first half of the semester was better than the second because Amar very carefully explained the first few cases we went over. By the end, it was unclear which cases we were focusing on. \r\n\r\nMy TA was excellent and section was incredibly useful.",
    "strength: very easy cr d, Amar is so knowledgeable and really wants his students to learn the material and enjoy the class. don't need to do all the readings except just know the cases \r\nweakness: syllabus is a little disorganized and it's hard ottotake notes during lecture beacuse Amar sometimes goes on tangents",
    "Weaknesses: the lectures at the beginning were amazing, when Professor Amar would walk us through each line of a court case. Towards the end, it was hard to determine Professor Amar's big takeaways he wanted us to get from the lectures.",
    "My teaching fellow, who was a student at the law school, was absolutely incredible. Most of my learning happened in discussion section we'd go through the cases very thoroughly, try a few hypotheticals, and discuss the overarching themes of the course. Also, I really liked how we could choose how much we could get out of the course; discussion section was optional, the final research paper was optional, and both exams could be taken either in class or at home. My only complaint would be that lectures seemed a little disorganized at times. They were great to get historical background and context, but to do well in the exams and truly understand what it means to read a case, going to discussion section is a must.",
    "Strength: the TA was amazing. They were very well picked, taking into consideration their background and experiences. Weakness: Sometimes, Amar goes off tangents.",
    "There is no guidance on what the 5-page response paper should look like or include; Amar should provide a sample paper or even just a prompt longer than a single sentence.",
    "The course is all about Amar, and though he's obviously a hotshot, his lectures are terrible. He doesn't prepare at all, so they're just a rambling mess. So the obvious improvement for the course would be to have organized, information-filled lectures.",
    "Professor Amar gives really interesting lectures, although the pacing was somewhat erratic throughout the semester. There is a lot of reading, so be sure you have room in your schedule.",
    "You can take this course as you will; by that, I mean that many Yale college courses either demand no effort or a lot of effort. Amar explicitly says on day 1 that this is a great credit\/d\/fail class, and you can really show up and learn a little bit of con law for credit, or you can dive into it fully. Great class to jump into and decide in early October if you want to really give it a go. Also, Amar is a great lecturer and really approachable, and the TA's are all awesome.",
    "Overall, Amar does a great job teaching the course. He can get off on tangents, but he does a great job explaining the material. The exams are also well-designed and well-facilitated. The TFs are great. No real critiques of the course.",
    "I loved this course! The exam options, optional final paper, and optional section let students take the class however they would like. That said, toward the latter half of the course, the lectures became less structured as Prof. Amar increasingly discussed current events. This was a really great addition, but we were behind a lecture and a half by the time the course finished. I would recommend covering the cases in class and discussing current events in detail during the much appreciated Wed. lunches or office hours.",
    "Strengths: the material\/readings are unbelievably interesting, the TFs are fantastic, and you'll learn a ton of history, philosophy, law, and politics\r\n\r\nWeakness: Professor Amar often goes off topic so the lectures can sometimes seem irrelevant",
    "I wish the syllabus had been more clear and that my TF has been more organized.",
    "I think the course was very well-organized. At times the way it was taught felt a bit impersonal, but maybe that's just a function of it being a lecture course with an optional section. The one thing that I did think could be improved was the way the course was graded. The ranking system used (wherein the TF for a section would rank the exams from best to worst and assign grades based on that curve) I think could be improved, since doing this means that depending on which section you're in, the curve will be different, and I think this is a bit unfair.",
    "Great lecture and section. I think a more clear outline of what we will be doing when would be helpfully, especially what cases we will be reading each day.",
    "Lectures were posted online for the first time I believe this year, and it was incredibly useful pedagogically to be able to replay and review them. My weekly section TA was also very valuable.",
    "The lecture was unstructured and difficult to follow. Oftentimes consisted of random ramblings  the section is where I obtained much of my knowledge.",
    "All strengths. Professor Amar offered lunches every Wednesday, which allowed us to visit with him and continue learning from him even after class had ended; his lecturing was phenomenal; the content was engaging and the cases were consistently excellent.",
    "The class is brilliantly interesting and the most unorganized class I've ever taken. I both loved and hated it.",
    "The lectures could be more geared towards the subjects and content that we are actually tested on.",
    "Strengths - Amar is obviously a great lecturer and the TAs and assignments are great. Weaknesses - No one can do all that reading, sorry.",
    "the lectures were disorganized and section was really the most helpful",
    "Strengths:\r\n- instructor and TF\r\n- course materials\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- lectures were unstructured at times\r\n- course aimed to cover more material than possible in one semester\r\n- grading was too strict in my eyes, grading scale was ambiguous at times and seemed to be inconsistent across sections",
    "The reading assignments were so large that few students in my class actually completed them. Maybe it would be helpful to make the reading assignments slightly smaller so that students can more realistically complete them.",
    "This course is an amazing option for students with a true interest in the Constitution. That said, it is an extreme amount of work and is definitely not the course to take if you are looking for a breeze.",
    "Strengths: TAs are amazing and provide the necessary background to understand the cases; I also think it's great that we are exposed to actual case law instead of reading overviews of the cases. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Lectures are disorganized and supplementary materials were unhelpful.",
    "Strengths: independent, very similar to law school\r\nWeaknesses: Amar rambles, lectures are disorganized, what you get from the course depends a lot on your TA (usually this is a good thing, but I did not like my TA)",
    "The professor is highly skilled and knowledgeable in the field of constitutional law.",
    "This course was honestly not good. It could have been a lot more engaging if I did the readings, in all honesty, but the lectures were IMPOSSIBLE to take anything from. There were no unifying themes, and the lectures were incoherent. One thing that confused me was that the syllabus did not have instructions for the assignment or dates for when it was due, even though my TA referenced it having both of those things. I understood what the essay was from section, but we never had a written version of the assignment.",
    "Although the lectures were interesting (Prof Amar is a genus), I would say section was the best part of the course overall--take section if you can (it's optional). Don't expect lectures to replace readings, and don't expect all cases for the week to be covered in lecture. Instead, Prof Amar gives a fascinating big picture overview with interesting anecdotes, stories, and analysis that you wouldn't get from the readings alone.",
    "The lectures and discussion sections are great. Perhaps the only weakness might be that the course can feel a bit unstructured at times.",
    "This is overall an exceptional class: the syllabus is thorough and serves as an excellent introduction to American constitutional law. Readings are indeed time-consuming, but they are well worth it and students learn and gain immense, important knowledge from them. The papers\/assignments are well-suited to the course and supplement overall student learning. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, there is one main weakness: important topics such as women's rights, sexuality\/sexual orientation, etc. are not covered until the last week of class. I understand that this is an introductory course and that these topics cannot be covered in great detail, but I do think that landmark cases such as Roe v. Wade and Obergefell v. Hodges deserve more than a mere mention on the last day of class. The class would benefit from greater attention to issues of gender equity overall, from the start; I am nonetheless glad that these topics were included in the syllabus and taught, albeit in a limited manner.",
    "Strengths: I found the material really interesting, as well as the constitutional legal analyses both challenging and engaging. Also learned a lot in section. \r\nWeaknesses: Amar's lectures were often scattered and hard to understandI think the course could greatly benefit from more structure (or rather, sticking more closely to the structure set out in the syllabus). Amar spent too long on certain things in the first half of term (i.e. Powell v. McCormack) and so there wasn't sufficient time by the end of the semester to go through the rights revolution in depth.",
    "strengths - clearly comprehensive and knowledgeable, breadth of issues covered",
    "The course sometimes fails to synthesize the cases to help students practice constitutional analysis.",
    "lectures are rambly, sections are good, subject matter interesting",
    "Very well organized.",
    "One of the best parts was section and how my TA broke up the many cases we had each week by assignment 1-2 per person to share with the group. This made what we covered in lecture much more digestible.",
    "So much freaking reading, can be difficult to summarize all the material, just requires a lot of time\r\n\r\nLecture really interesting, take this class for the lecture\r\n\r\nTake notes on laptop so you can command f because tests are open-note\r\n\r\nI wish there were better ways to know how you were doing in the class before the midterm\/a way to gauge whether you were prepared for the midterm",
    "This course feels highly incoherent. The pacing is at one rushed and dawdling. Though the first half moves at a slow, leisurely pace, covering only a few cases per week, the latter half accelerates to a breakneck pace that will give even the most committed of students intellectual whiplash. Though the readings themselves are useful and well curated -- the casebook highlights the most important language of each case and includes useful analysis or critical issues -- the lectures of this course fail to expand meaningfully upon the material. Professor Amar ranges in his lecture style from from sermonizing to rambling. He often came into class without lecture notes and I felt as though he essentially \"winged it\" each class meeting. He rarely added meaningful insight to the assignments and often, I felt better off using the lecture time to review the course readings on my own. What's more, there appears to be little coordination across discussion sections. Due to the inconsistency of lectures, TFs are saddled with the responsibility of teaching much of the material. Whenever I would attempt to study with other students for papers or exams, it became clear that other students received different information on key topics and issues depending on their section assignment. Though the TF's are undoubtably the best part of the course -- my TF was absolutely extraordinary and all of Amar's law students appear well suited for the demands of teaching the course material -- this lack of consistency across sections made reviewing topics difficult. \r\n\r\nI enjoyed the opportunity to study under Professor Amar's instruction. He is a uniquely talented legal mind and forwarded several intriguing lines of thought throughout the semester. However, for the most part, I found this course generally weak and lacking direction.",
    "Prior to enrolling in Con Law, peers warned me that I would disagree with various aspects of Professor Ahmar's teachings in an attempt to dissuade me from taking the course. However, I decided to take the class as a way of being challenged since, at times, I believe it is difficult to find Yale professors whose opinions students disagree with. Throughout the semester, I was surprised by how neutral Professor Ahmar was when presenting the cases we covered. Whether its a conscious effort or not, it made for a very enjoyable learning experience! That being said, at times the lectures felt a bit rambly but over time, I found myself able to pick out which parts of lecture were important and which parts were more anecdotal.",

    "yes",
    "This is an amazing class where you learn a lot. If you are at all interested in law, civil rights, the constitution, take this class.",
    "I would like to take this chance to potentially save another student from making the same mistake I did. The first few lectures during shopping period are enchanting, as Amar makes very interesting points about the constitution and what makes our nation unique, but stay strong. If you're interested in the course, most certainly attend the first few lecture during shopping period or audit it for a few weeks. However, after the first week or so the lectures tended to turn into unorganized ramblings and it became hard to stay engaged. I also ending up credit\/D-ing the class which I ended up regretting for the fact that I could have used it on a more intellectually enriching course. RIP.",
    "I would not recommend this class... if you are interested in learning con law, you might as well read all of Amar's books and the casebooks. It will teach you the same stuff as the lecture without a quota on your grade.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in Law.",
    "Yes, I think it's important to understand the US Constitution.",
    "Yes, highly recommend, it's something everyone should know. Also very easy to credit\/d if you're into that, though not as hard as people say it is to take for a letter grade.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I hadn't realized how fundamental the constitution is to the way that our political system works and operates, and it's interesting to be able to think critically about it. If you're interested in law or politics I would say this course is pretty essential because it gives new and important perspective. I'm not recommending it because of the way it's taught, but more because of what you learn.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to students who might be interested in seeing what law students really do (read and analyze cases) or to those who may be interested in learning about how the Constitution can be applied to present-day issues like discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. This class provides you with the tools with which to analyze the world around us today.",
    "Yes-a lot of work but an eye-opening class that makes you think differently.",
    "Yes, but boy is it a lot of reading. Although you can take this Credit-D, you really learn the material preparing for the exams and that's probably the most valuable thing I got from this class.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. I believe every US citizen should have the opportunity to take such a great class, to really understand the Constitution and the foundations of our country.",
    "I would recommend this class to individuals who are interested in the law, or considering it. Given that this class is taught like a law school course, I think it would be really informative.",
    "Yes. Absolutely. Everyone at Yale should take this course.",
    "When Professor Amar says that he thinks this is a good course to take Credit-D, take the advice seriously. Good course but the lectures are rambling and often don't feel like they penetrate the central question of the class (\"how to do constitutional law\"), and the amount of material is too large to actually read or absorb meaningfully.",
    "No.",
    "yes if you want a basic learning of constitutional law and historic cases",
    "NO.",
    "Take this class!! It's a classic Yale class and it's actually really good. Definitely take it with a section though, Amar's lectures aren't the best and they can be very confusing.",
    "Highly recommend, for any student.",
    "Yes! And do the readings!",
    "This question is difficult for me to answer. On the one hand, the subject material of the course itself is something that has kept me more engaged than any other course I've taken at Yale. However, lectures oftentimes seem highly disorganized, with more background on cases being offered than substance. From what I've heard from friends that have taken this course, your experience really boils down to your TF. From what I've heard and what I saw at review sessions before the midterm and final, most TFs are amazing. I didn't have the same experience with the course, partially due to my TF, but still enjoyed the course overall, but it was significantly more difficult to understand the material than it was for my friends that had more focused and helpful TFs.",
    "Absolutely! I think it's really important to know the fundamentals of constitutional law, even if you're not interested in going to law school in the future. It'll teach you a new way to think about major political issues, and make you a more deliberate reader and writer. Definitely register for a discussion section. Just know that you'll only get out of the class what you put in.",
    "Yes. I would recommend it to students who are interested in pursuing an academic foundation in constitutional law. I don't think it's for everyone. But if you are interested, you would get a lot out of it.",
    "Professor Amar is a brilliant hot mess. His mastery of the constitution cannot be questioned, and he is incredibly helpful in office hours. However, he thinks that the fact that he is an expert on constitutional law makes him an expert on all things. Class would be much improved if he didn't waste time going on long, unnecessary tangents that basically consist of him giving his bad hot takes on social issues and issues in the Yale community. He should also be much more careful about the way he talks -- gems include \"...he was a KKK member and a very great man\" (I don't remember who this was in reference to, but does it matter?), \"I love women\" (in discussing women's suffrage), \"the blacks\" (in reference to black people, all the time), \"integration is actually a good thing\" (apparently he thinks this is a hot take), etc. Putting Amar's many issues aside for a moment, I did love the class overall, though your experience will be significantly impacted by your TF -- make sure you read their bios and choose one you think you will get along with. You will only like this class if you're interested in the material.",
    "No. For some reason, I thought I HAD to take this course before I graduated. Amar is such a disaster that I truly would have learned more by reading one book on constitutional law.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. It's a lot of work to do well, but the subject matter is interesting and the TA's are very helpful.",
    "Absolutely; a real bucket list class.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who wants to learn more about Constitutional Law and the relevant cases as well as learn from a professor like Amar.",
    "Honestly this is a must take. Taking this course alongside the Trump impeachment process really helped me understand what was going on a lot more than I otherwise would have, and the course empowered me to contend with the constitutional arguments put forth by various elected officials and witnesses. The TF's are incredible as well! I think this course probably has taught me the most about the world we live in today.",
    "Absolutely -- you should take this class to learn about politics and history. The Constitution is so unbelievably interesting, as are the cases covered in class...just be prepared for some off-topic lectures from Professor Amarettos",
    "Only take this class if it's something you're really interested in. If you're not going to put in the work, then it will be easy to lose track of what's going on and difficult to catch up, since there's such a huge amount of reading to be done.",
    "Yes, take it. It's amazing, not super hard.",
    "Yes - this is one of those must-take classes at Yale.",
    "Absolutely take it. Amar is brilliant and constitutional law is an important topic to know. The TFs are all super knowledgeable and generally cool people.",
    "Not really, unless with the caveat that they are to study much of the material on their own and to not take the course as an underclassmen. While there are successful first year students in the course, it is not a course for new students by any means.",
    "Absolutely. I have recommended this to many friends, and will continue to recommend it throughout my next three years at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any and every Yale student.",
    "Great class to Credit\/D. You will learn a lot without the stress of trying to get an A. The assignments are fun and the lectures are super interesting. Will totally change the way you look at the government.",
    "i would only if they sign up for the discussion section",
    "Yes. It is an amazing opportunity to learn about constitutional law from amazing faculty.",
    "Yes! This course is seminal to anyone's understanding of the constitution, and Professor Amar instills in you a tremendous sense of responsibility to think and behave critically as a political member of this country.",
    "Yes! Constitutional Law was really an important course in helping me understand the intricacies of the American political system. By taking this course, you will gain a new understanding of American history and contemporary politics alike.",
    "Take this course with the knowledge that it will be a lot of work and you can not fall behind.",
    "Honestly, a lot of people advertised this course as a must take before graduating and it definitely was not that. While there was a nice exposure to the case law, you could learn this material elsewhere. The TAs did a great job of providing all of the material which made this class worth staying in.",
    "I would recommend to shop around TA sections",
    "Yes, because I think its a very interesting course that would anyone who takes it to better appreciate American history from a constitutional law perspective.",
    "I would NOT recommend this! If anyone says this is a \"must take\" course, they need help. If you're very interested in the subject and will do all the readings, take it (with a section), but the number of people who meet that description can't be nearly close to the number enrolled. You should be FASCINATED by the nuances and intricacies of case law. It simply was not good, though.",
    "Absolutely. Even if you aren't interested in law, take this course. You will not regret it--but don't be afraid to Credit D it.",
    "Very much so. This course is not just a legal one, but a history and political science course as well. It is useful in understanding the American tradition, and I would hope as many students as possible take it before they end their time at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student, regardless of major. It has changed the way I think and view the law, and has actually shaped my career prospects and overall academic interests. Prior to taking this class, I was far more interested in public policy than in law, but my interests have now shifted and I intend on pursuing a career in law and impact litigation. This class is excellent for anyone interested, to any extent, in law school or legal careers, but even so I would truly recommend it to anyone.",
    "Yes! would recommend not taking it credit D though, or at least put some work into it. The more time you invest, the more interesting the material becomes.",
    "I would recommend this course, but with a caveat: I personally really enjoyed learning about the different issues in constitutional law and found it quite relevant to current events, as well as enjoyed practicing the different modalities of legal thinking. That said, the lectures, while sometimes interesting and often entertaining, were disorganized and not really tailored to student learning in my opinionmuch of the learning comes from doing your own independent reading of the cases.",
    "yes",
    "Take it to challenge yourself and learn a little bit to learn how the sausage is made.",
    "if CDing, you won't get much, so be ready for that",
    "Yes",
    "Yes- its a fair amount of work but I think everyone should take this credit\/D to better understand our world today.",
    "Yes if you are ready for the reading load.\r\n\r\nI took it credit-d and still got a lot out of it though.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to another student. Though the material is excellent, the instruction is notably poor. You'd be better off reading Supreme Court opinions on your own time. The TFs are fabulous, though they do most of the teaching. You should take this class for the reading and the structure of having to read a few court opinions each week. Also, if you take the course, I'd recommend taking it for a grade. Thought the material is challenging, those who do CR\/D don't really get anything out of the course, as you won't feel motivated to do the reading. Don't take this class if you aren't already interested in the work.",
    "Yes!",
    "Great"
