                "Assignments and workload is very well organized, as are class discussions.",
                "Madame Pinzka is a great, kind teacher who makes sure everyone has the opportunity to speak in class and facilitates the conversation well. The movies we watched were interesting and I now feel like I understand contemporary life in France; in my previous French courses, the material we studied seemed outdated and not modern, but all the materials presented in this course covered contemporary, current issues (especially all of the Le Monde articles we read). I liked having many assignments so that I had opportunities to practice my French without being too worried about making a poor grade on a single assignment that would have a large impact on my overall grade (if there had been fewer assignments).",
                "Strengths: I appreciated the chance to discuss personal experiences and relate them to course content. I liked the variety of topics; the class moved at a nice pace. I also liked that the final was an oral and that it involved interviewing a francophone. The teacher provided useful feedback during office hours. I liked that we could correct our work after the first grade. \r\nWeaknesses: The role play of politicians (some of whom were Islamophobic, racist, etc.) felt uncomfortable. I also would have appreciated the chance to talk more in class; it felt like either the teacher or one student in particular would dominate discussion. A bit more structure to who spoke would have been useful.",
                "I cannot see any weaknesses in this course; it is very evident Professor Pinzka has put a lot of time into planning it. As for strengths, I loved the informal discussions in class about topics, and while there were a lot of assessments, I personally relished those as opportunities to improve our skills and with more chances to improve our grade in the class. moreover, professor Pinzka also allowed us to do corrections, which not only took the pressure off of certain assignments but also strengthened my French skills a lot.",
                "Strengths: engaging class that covers a variety of interesting topics, definitely helped me expand my worldview and think critically about different societal issues, heavy load is worth it since the activities are designed to help improve language skills\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of readings (often did not have enough class time to discuss them all which can sometimes be frustrating), could benefit from more small group discussions so students can practice conversing with each other as one would be more likely to do in real life rather than only be able to talk a few times throughout the whole class period"

                "I would definitely recommend this course to students who are interested in learning more about French culture and how their political and educational systems function. This class is unique from other French courses at Yale as we covered important topics in France from the Black Lives Matter movement there to the Me Too movement to surrogate mothers and abortion. This course allows you to improve your conversational French in a friendly and welcoming environment, and you should not feel nervous to make mistakes in front of Madame Pinzka or your peers!",
                "I would recommend this course to a student if they took it abroad. I think it's the perfect course to take while in France. Otherwise, it was not my favorite French class Yale.",
                "Most definitely! If anyone is interested in French culture and wishes to improve their speaking, I would definitely recommend this course. I would also recommend it to any student that is interested in French culture.",
                "Yes! This course is a great way to improve your French while focusing on topics that would actually come up in conversation. While casual conversation is not necessarily emphasized here (e.g. speaking in verlan or about quotidien life), it covers real-world topics that are more conversationally applicable than a literature course for example. Definitely improved my vocabulary and learned a lot about French society, politics, and current events from this course. Beware, though, this course involves a lot of reading, a fair amount of writing, and, obviously, speaking."
