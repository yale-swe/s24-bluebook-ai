                "I really enjoyed this class! It was the first anthropology class I had ever taken and Inhorn made it a welcoming environment for students of all groups. The workload was greater than other classes I have taken simply because it's a 200-300 page book requirement every week, but I personally found the books really interesting on their own so had no trouble pushing through on the readings. I really think the syllabus was thoughtfully chosen and covered the topic at a breadth and depth that was extremely valuable! I could probably actually talk to someone over dinner about all the things I've learned in this singular course, which is not something I can say about the rest of my classes at Yale. I'd recommend it for sure.",
                "I learned about the genre of ethnography and was exposed to concepts in gender studies, politics of the Middle East, and general lessons in anthropology. I honed my skills in writing book reviews and combining synthesis and analysis. I also learned about comparative politics, human rights, and cultural studies in ways I had not previously considered.",
                "I learned about the lives of women and men in many Middle Eastern countries, from Shia activists in Lebanon to trans people in Iran. I also learned what anthropology is and how to read and evaluate an ethnography.\r\n\r\nThis course made me think a lot about how I identify as a feminist. It opened my eyes to some of the unconscious beliefs I hold about what women's equality is, and about what role men play. I left almost every class with some sort of new epiphany or insight into my thinking and biases. I feel like I developed a lot personally in addition to how much I learned academically.",
                "I learned what an ethnography/ethnographic study is in the field of anthropology, and what qualities constitute a \"good\" one. Through our assigned readings and papers I learned how to perform a critical reading of an ethnographic text, and how to write a scholarly book review. I gained greater insight into issues of gender in the Middle East, in particular how the reality from the perspective of the residents differs from the typical Western perspective. Through our group discussions I was able to reconsider and reevaluate how I think about gender dynamics in the Middle East. I also learned a great deal about the history and recent conditions of several countries I knew very little about, giving me a greater sense of the complexity of the region.",
                "As the title suggests, you learn a lot from the readings about the Middle East through the lens of gender. You also learn about ethnography as a genre and practice, including academic and ethical considerations. And you learn how to write a professional book review."

            "comments": [
                "I think that the reading load was quite high and the reading responses were a bit burdensome because there was one due every week. Maybe allow for more flexibility when it comes to the reading assignments (doing at least 75% of them, for example). It was tough because even if I was having a busy week in another class I knew I had to do the reading response for this class every Monday without fail.",
                "I enjoyed the structure of each seminar and liked how each student led one class (it was a lot of work and worth it!). I think the progression of course readings made sense, with some of the more abstract and complex texts coming near the end. Sometimes the themes became repetitive, but I have few qualms about this course.",
                "Strengths: This course is advertised as a feminist reading group about the Middle East, and that's exactly what makes it so fantastic. I'm so glad we have the chance to read and discuss eleven ethnographies. The simplicity of the structure, engaging nature of the materials, flexibility of the assignments, and seminar-style format are all great strengths.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many that I can think of. It might have been nice to have one final day without an ethnography to tie things together for a better sense of closure -- perhaps getting more time to synthesize what we've learned from all the books, or even giving students the chance to find their own article/ethnography on the region to look into.",
                "The structure of the course is excellent, and very clearly laid out from day one. I always knew what assignments were due when, and could refer to the syllabus to find each week's reading from the first week of class. I appreciated the clear directions and provided examples for our writing assignments, as well. The weekly sessions were always extremely engaging. \r\n\r\nOverall, I think the biggest complaint most people would have with this class is the length of some of the books, particularly the ones in the last few weeks of class. I did find it difficult to complete the reading on time some weeks, which combined with the fact that papers had to be turned in before class, sometimes left me unable to write my book reviews on weeks where I would have particularly liked to. \r\n\r\nThe only improvement I would suggest is to have students set the weeks they would like to write their two short reviews at the beginning of class (with the option to ask to change later) because I think there was a tendency among the class to forget until the last possible week and then have to rush to complete one.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Inhorn is amazing, graded assignments are manageable, books are interesting\r\nWeaknesses: none that other discussion-based seminars don't have"

                "I'd recommend it. Inhorn is a great professor and even brought food in for us at certain points. She really cares about this field and clearly has years of experience and knowledge under her belt as a celebrated anthropologist.",
                "Yes! This was my first course in anthropology or on the Middle East or gender studies, and I really enjoyed it and feel I learned a lot. Marcia is lovely and super thoughtful & knowledgeable.",
                "Yes! Take this class!! This is one of my favorite classes I've ever taken at Yale. This is the kind of class where you look forward to every seminar, and afterwards you want to tell your friends all of the interesting things you just learned. You do have to read a book a week, but I have never looked forward to reading more. Overall, the workload is manageable because you mostly get to choose when and what books you write your papers on. \r\n\r\nI think it is a great idea to take a gender studies class while at Yale, and especially one that is looking at women outside of the US. We all know that Western feminism has its problems, but this class is especially eye-opening. You will realize so many assumptions that you didn't even know you had, and encounter new lives, cultures, and ways of thinking about how to improve women's lives. This course is also really valuable for how it studies men (because that's part of gender studies too!) and LGBTQ+ lives.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in anthropology of gender,  as well as people wanting to learn more about everyday life in the MENA region. I would caution someone who thinks that they can simply skim the weekly assigned books and get by in discussion that that is not the most beneficial to their experience of the class, so don't take this class if you don't have the time to read a full (sometimes 300 page) book each week. Also, the assignments look light but they have to be completed in the same week that you are reading the book so (i.e. before the seminar meeting where you discuss the book) so definitely start the book for nest week the day after class.",
