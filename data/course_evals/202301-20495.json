                "I learned to apply conversational Spanish with more precision in grammar.",
                "Spanish grammar, plus a little vocabulary and ability to make conversation. Specifically: ser vs. estar, preterite vs. imperfect vs. pluperfect, how to talk about time, subjunctive, relative pronouns, para vs. por. I haven't taken any other Spanish courses at Yale, so I don't know how this material overlaps with Spanish 4, but everything we learned was new to me, or I didn't remember it from AP Spanish, at least not at the level of detail we talked about. For example, going into the class I had some idea of para vs. por, but didn't know about or understand the difference between motive (por) and goal (para).\r\n\r\nWhile the material was technical, it was also practical. The distinction I mentioned with para vs. por, does come up in conversation and writing, as do all the other concepts we learned about.",
                "I learned advanced topics in Spanish grammar that are typically not covered. I also deepened existing understanding.",
                "comprehensive review of difficult and sentence specific grammar topics",
                "I learned a lot about spanish grammar, including new tenses, as well as rules that I wouldn't have thought to learn. Improved my writing skills, and somewhat improved my speaking skills.",
                "I developed an understanding of why certain verb tenses, verbs, phrases, and prepositions are used in specific contexts. The course was particularly useful for gaining a level of comfort with the subjunctive and conditional tenses.",
                "I have preterite vs. imperfect down on lock. Really solidified your understanding and usage of grammar. I feel much more comfortable speaking, writing, reading, and listening. Learned a lot about Latin American writing and music."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Lots of practice! Both in and out of class, all of the assignments were directly relevant to strengthening my grammar abilities. The content of the reading was also quite engaging, as well as the podcasts and videos and language partners. The class, rather unexpectedly, started with more basic grammar, which was super appreciated. The professor is amazing, kind, and helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: the online assignments were sometimes excessive, as well as frustrating because it was hard to tell what you did wrong. The due dates for most assignments are not flexible, which is understandable but adds stress.",
                "Strengths: lots of engagement with Spanish due to the number of assignments that were all topically relevant to the class periods. Professor Seymour is super passionate about the subject and gives so much individual feedback which is incredible. Weaknesses: not really any focus on speaking ability (which might be a strength depending on your perspective)",
                "There was a lot of homework.",
                "I think this is a great class to practice a lot of grammatical concepts. I also think that given the volume of assignments and the fact that with few exceptions none of them were even graded quickly, a slightly more lenient policy on late work would better encourage students to do it all. If you fell behind, that discouraged getting in the good practice of going back and redoing it. Yes, if that happens too much youll struggle to participate, but I think that the Spanish department in general should think about whether its policies are consistent with principles that those who study education would endorse. I think the answer broadly is no, and I think that changing some policies wouldnt change the amount of effort put in by students but it would just give them room to be a person with ups and downs.",
                "Strengths: concepts are well-explained, and while a few times over the semester, we learned some grammatical concept just is the way it is, almost every concept we learned had some logic behind it, which made things easier to metabolize. Weekly conversations are useful\/fairly relaxed, and the readings are interesting\/engaging. The professor was approachable\/happy to answer questions, and gave helpful answers.\r\nWeaknesses: This isn't a weakness, exactly, but the material is difficult. We cover many different concepts in a fairly short period of time, and it's hard to hang on to everything we learn. I think the course compensates for this by making every assignment cumulative: ser vs. estar is the main focus for the first week or so, and then shows up every once in a while on unrelated assignments throughout the rest of the course, because ser and estar are important enough verbs that you need to use them frequently.\r\nImprovements: The class wouldn't function if it wasn't a lot of work, but sometimes I think it was a bit much. I would maybe draw the line at three unrelated assignments being due on the same day.",
                "The course at times was formulaic and repetitive in its format. VHL Central was more frustrating than helpful. Nonetheless, it was an organized and easy to follow course.",
                "strong teaching of grammar and support at office hours. lively collaborative class environment. way too much work each night",
                "Strengths: Tons of feedback, Prof Seymour is super engaged with students, it's a collaborative class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the class would be improved if it was more focused on helping us get our point across with new forms of grammar, rather than just testing us on particular contexts in which the word or tense might make sense. Like helping understand when to use a certain tense or construction, and then giving us the freedom to articulate more complex topics or sentences with that grammar.",
                "I felt that I walked away with a lot of knowledge that I will retain about the Spanish language. The course requires a lot of work outside of the course, and although this made it a challenge for time management, it did help reinforce concepts well. I would advise assigning films over the weekend rather than during the week, but it was otherwise a pretty manageable workload.",
                "It is a lot of work! But you get out what you put in and this course really offers an opportunity to commit yourself to the tedious every day work of learning a language and learning it well. If you keep up with the work, your spanish will really improve. Professor Seymour is wonderfulpatience, non-judgemental, flexible."

                "If your goal is to learn grammar, from simple to advanced, absolutely! If your goal is to actually explore Spanish literature, culture, or anything else, there are probably better classes out there.",
                "Would definitely recommend this course if you want to solidify the concepts you learned in L1-L4 or need a crash course refresher in Spanish because you haven't practiced it in a few years. The class starts with the most basic grammar concepts and quickly moves into much more advanced ones. The class definitely is a lot of work though (which is great if you want to improve your Spanish). I probably averaged 2 hours a day of homework just for this class if you spread out the studying for the 3 exams. Professor Seymour is fantastic and always keeps the class periods interesting, so even though it is a lot of work, it is quite enjoyable.",

                "Sure, if you have the time to dedicate to this class it will help your grammar. But it will take your time.",
                "Yes; the workload is very high in comparison to other courses, but you will learn a lot of good Spanish vocabulary and grammar while also honing your conversational skills. If you're just trying to fulfill the language requirement, though, there are probably easier options.",
                "Yes if you want to learn Spanish grammar in detail. This is also a good class to take after high school AP Spanish - it doesn't assume much in terms of vocab, and all grammar is explained clearly before students are expected to know it. The course is a lot of work, though, and the work is fairly constant, so I'd plan around that. Expect to spend a few hours on homework before each class (Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday nights for me; more spread out if you do work in advance).",
                "Yes, to those who want to improve their Spanish grammar. They should be aware that this class is comparable to a 1.5 credit language class. It is extremely work heavy.",
                "i would under the condition that they will spend so much time on the nightly homework assignments.",
                "I would recommend this course, but maybe during a semester when you are taking 4 classes. It's a significant workload. I think maybe if the class had less busywork, it would definitely all be worthwhile work though. I learned a lot.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. It is incredibly beneficial in creating many opportunities for practice, both verbally and on paper. The course was structured well to build on concepts we had already learned.",
                "Yes, but be prepared to keep up with the work. There are assignments due three times a week and it is very easy to fall behind. However, Professor Seymour is very helpful!"
