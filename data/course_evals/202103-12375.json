                "A new appreciation for the exponential growth of impact of media and the significance of the 19th century in that growth.",
                "I learned an awful lot about the nineteenth-century, and that's coming from someone who already knew quite a bit about the era. We also learned how to analyze media and think about media in different ways.",
                "I had never taken a media studies course before, so the ways of thinking this course encouraged were new to me. We approached questions of what questions people in the 19th century were dealing withespecially in light of a dazzling array of new media. Professor Peters is an anti-snob. He has read and knows about an insane amount of stuff, but he seems deeply interested in learning from others. Even though many 19th century ideas about and responses to media could be satirized, the focus was instead on learning from others with fresher eyes than our own. We tried to understand how others made sense of a world suddenly filled with novel media such as photographs and phonographs and trains. The point was never to laugh at 19th century \"crazies.\" I learned how to think about media\/technology\/inventions as forces that both structure and respond to human society; how mediums for conveying information also convey information about themselves and about us. (This might also give you a sense of how abstract the learning in this course can sometimes be.) I would say that this course can be seen as developing skills in so many directions. For instance, thinking about how the earliest photographs were seen as defying death can help open new understandings of film, our current media environment, or how we go about inhabiting a body. I will definitely be returning to my notes from this class for many semesters to come.",
                "I had never taken a media studies course before, so my understand of what a medium is changed a lot, and this was a first encounter with media theory. My conception of the 19th century changed. I was forced to think deeply about issues both abstract and practical."

                "Strengths:\r\nProf. Peters\r\nNiche, meaning the students who took the class all seemed to have a vested interest in the subject matter\r\nDepth of reading material\r\n\r\nWeaknessess:\r\nA bit broad, it would be totally feasible to teach an entire semester on any one of the single topics we studied during a given week.",
                "The readings were all interesting and breaking each week down by theme was great because the conversations never got boring or repetitive. I felt like I did not have enough time at the end to write a great final paper, so if there were more final paper benchmarks earlier on in the semester it might help improve things.",
                "The greatest strength is definitely Professor Peters. Professor Peters is an incredible professor and also a person whom I deeply admire. He is kind and compassionate, curious about everything, genuinely interested in his students and what they care about. He makes office hours exciting and new every time, and is so good at making surprising connections. He is very receptive to all kinds of passions; he is interested in that which is weird and marginal and also interested in studying things that others might consider too \"normal\" to study. Which is to say: you can really show up to this class with any set of interests, and pursue them seriously. The focus on the 19th century is great for this, because there was so much nuts stuff going on back then that new things were seemingly happening in pretty much every arena. The syllabus was also a great balance of literature, scientific sources, news sources, and art. There were some academic secondary sources assigned, but we rarely focussed on these in class. I think the breadth of material, Professor Peters' wide interests, and the varied interests of people in the class could make for very compelling discussions. In terms of weaknesses, I found the amount of reading assigned to be a bit much, especially given that we could never touch on everything in class. The seminar discussions also could feel a bit scattered. There was rarely a succinct take-away in a given seminar discussion, and it was up to us to make build connections between each others' comments. Which isn't bad or unfair, just something to be aware of: Professor Peters solicits lots of comments but mostly leaves it up to students to make connections with each others' comments\/ideas. It's hard work, and doesn't always go well, but the payoff is great when it does!",
                "The discussion-based format of the class was great, although it sometimes hit a lull, but I think that is probably just a necessary pitfall of a format that also facilitates free-flowing conversation and moments of concentrated creativity. The readings were amazing, and somehow, I came away from the course with a sense that I knew the 19th century far better than I did before, despite the fact that topics we studied were so seemingly niche. On the flip side, it was really cool to spend each week on a different specific subject - it was a great way to focus in on different aspects of such a broad topic area."

            "comments": [
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but only if you like reading.",
                "I would if the student showed an interest in the subject matter, i.e. this would not be a class for someone looking to knock out a WR or HU distribution. The reading is very manageable, but to get anything out of the class you need to be fully vested in the material. If distributions are what you're after, I'd suggest a different class.",
                "Yes! First of all, the primary sources are just so weird, and I think looking at this stuff through a media lens can really help us look at our lives with fresh eyes. Secondly, Professor Peters is amazing: kind, curious, extraordinarily humble and down-to-earth, seems to have interesting thoughts on everything. Thirdly, the final project is a \"medium\" that allows you to think about your own interests in a new light. Just beware that you won't be focussing on traditional news media (hopefully this is obvious from the syllabus), you won't be exclusively practicing close reading like in some other English seminars, and because seminars are really a place to experiment and try on different ideas, they don't always feel super focussed\/organized.",
                "Yes. It was a fun class, discussion was engaging, the other students were super smart, and Professor Peters is a great teacher and person. It is a sampler of the literature (and, sometimes, art) of the 19th century, and in a way it feels like going back in time - it offers the student a peek at the intellectual and cultural currents of 19th century England and America, and, in turn, the student is encouraged to rehash these ideas from a modern viewpoint. Cool experience and I was exposed to a lot of amazing writing."
