                "Aside from basic type skills, I learned a lot about the design mentality within the typography sector. We've done so much, from simple compositions to posters to books, and even designed our own typefaces, which are extremely cool.",
                "I learned a lot about the design process through our many projects and assignments. This class was very hands on and crit based, meaning I received tons of feedback that I was able to act on throughout the semester and my practical design skills improved vastly as a result. Specifically, I learned a lot about typesetting, compositional layout, bookbinding, and some history of typefaces and type design.",
                "This course taught a great balance of specific skills and methods of approaching design. All the assignments are worthwhile and are organized to guide you along the learning process. Specifically, I learned about the history of typefaces and how to identify types of fonts, how to use InDesign to make a booklet, how to typeset rags and justified text nicely, how to letterspace, learned about a bunch of different bookbinding methods, and saw many cool examples from different designers. Alice emphasized using simple concepts, even just one verb, as the foundation for designs, which I found really helpful and will definitely use in the future.",
                "I advanced my knowledge and skills in graphic design a lot in this course. Over the course of the semester, my skills and confidence with typography improved significantly, and I have found those skills very useful and applicable in all of my other work."

                "In terms of both time management and content, the whole course format is extremely well-organized. It's a fairly sophisticated system for introducing newcomers to the realm of typography. Also, the use of notion is super helpful.",
                "This may have been my favorite course I've taken at Yale. As a non-art major I believe that everyone should take a design class, whether that's architecture, graphic design, art or sculpture. This class influenced how I perceive text in all mediums, including how I write things down on a day-to-day basis. I think the insight I gained from this class will continue to affect me for the rest of my life.",
                "I loved everything about this course and wouldn't change a thing. Alice is an amazing teacher and gives great advice that helps you bring your visions to life. I really felt like this was a space where I could be myself, explore, be risky, and learn from my peers who felt like they could do the same. I know 4 hours seems like a lot, but I wouldn't have wanted any less time, and I looked forward to it every week.",
                "I think that a strength of the course was the smaller class size. We had time to thoroughly critique everyone in the class's work and the class environment was very close and positive."

                "I will surely suggest this course to others; perhaps this will be the tipping point in professional choices.",

                "I would 100% recommend this course to any student who wants to dive into the deep end of the typography pool. Alice is such an inspiration and I feel incredibly lucky to have had the opportunity to be her student. I've learned skills, strategies, and ideas from this course that have made their way into my day-to-day life that I'll take with me forever. If you're choosing between taking this course in the fall or spring, opt for the spring 4-hour once-a-week option. I honestly can't imagine taking this course in the fall and having to meet twice a week, one week is the perfect amount of time for making substantial improvements.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone pursuing graphic design (in any capacity, as a major or as an interest). I also believe that this course would be really helpful for almost anybody. Learning how to use indesign to layout text and pages and how to arrange type for clarity and visual interest are skills that could be really helpful for anyone."
