   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned how to think critically about social theories, and I learned how to conceptualize oppression. I began to challenge capitalism in ways I hadn't before.",
    "I learned sociology and politics. Learned skills in political science and social science. And most importantly, as a high school student, I tried to write college level essays. I think it's difficult for me, but it's really very helpful.",
    "I developed stronger reading comprehension skills because of the volume of material we read for this class every day. I also improved my critical thinking skills in participating in discussions, engaging with the texts and forming my own opinions in my writing. I appreciated that the class assigned a diversity of readings from authors of different genders and races, because it helped me have a better grasp on the various angles political sociology can be looked at from.",
    "The course not only helped me gain a deeper understanding of topics I already had cursory knowledge of, but it helped develop my understanding of the world, and the way we, as humans, interact with one another and how our circumstances affect those interactions.",
    "This course provides you with the theoretical knowledge necessary to better understand how oppression and power domination present themselves in our societies. How domination works and how it prevents resistance and participation will be looked at through various lenses such as gender, class, race. Furthermore, the course will provide some historical background on power relations as they relate to the state, colonialism, and revolutions.\r\nYou will also learn to apply all of this knowledge to the world around you through the class discussions and your weekly reflections\/ writing assignments.",
    "I developed a ton of knowledge on foundational pieces of scholarship on the dynamics of class, power, intersectionality, and systems of domination (etc.) that operate in our society today. Through our in-depth discussions and assignments, I was able to develop stronger analytical skills that we used to put pieces in conversation with one another, as well as a better ability to use tools given by different scholars to apply to our society and specific contemporary situations. I feel like I am walking away from this course with a completely new understanding of our world and the systems of power that we live in.",
    "The course covers a variety of topics about social science, and after taking this course, I really get a basic idea of what is considered by sociologists. I learned a lot about states, nations, and capitalism. \r\n\r\nI practiced my reading skills a lot with many readings assigned each day and tried to extract the main idea out of the texts to better understand the topic. I also learned how to apply a sociological framework to an event and better understand the complicated picture. \r\n\r\nThe most insight would be that it's important to get a complete and thorough picture of an event and avoid being misled by the mainstream ideas, and another insight would be to always consider my position in the society, thinking about the privileges I have, unfairness I experience, and trying not to oversimplify others' experience and thoughts according to my standards, and therefore to hopefully be a better person."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was engaging in general. The discussion questions were great, readings were interesting, and writing assignments were straightforward and interesting. I think discussing our discussion questions more in class (we did some) would be great.",
    "Perhaps the decrease the amount of course material so as to encourage higher engagement with course material for a longer time, as the nature of Summer Session is very swift.",
    "The strengths of this course is the content of the course is interesting to learn.  The weakness is that I think it's a pity that this class is online due to COVID-19, sometimes the network connection is not smooth, I think it would be better if the class was face-to-face.",
    "I think the strengths of this course were its engaging discussion environment in class and in the discussion board, and the interesting texts that were assigned. Something that could improve the course would be to have the final due a while after our last class, because with the current structure it would be difficult to incorporate the last texts assigned into the final paper. Additionally, it would be nice to receive more feedback on the midterm papers in order to know what to work on in the final.",
    "Most of the weaknesses of the course were due to the constraints of zoom.  I think that the course was as good as a remote course could be.  I imagine that an in person class would have been better.  As for strengths - the professor managed to explain very complicated concepts in ways that made them easy to understand.",
    "I have no complaints about the way the course was structured. The classroom environment always provided dynamic discussions, the readings supported the course well, and the assignments were interesting and fulfilling to complete. The only suggestion I have is that the course provide a long break, sitting still for 2 hours gets exhausting and a longer break would be beneficial.",
    "The wide range of readings was a great way to gain exposure to many different influential pieces in political sociology, also into different ideologies and methodologies in sociology as a whole. The discussion format of the class provided a great space for students to work through the theories and applications together and be able to apply them to current situations which was really helpful in solidifying complex theories. The heavy reading requirements at times was a struggle because of how much had to be done within the week, though this also was clearly necessary in order to cover such a wide range of the topic in such a short period of time.",
    "Strengths: fantastic, insightful readings that gave tremendous perspective, good amount of discussion and student engagement, weekly reflections on real-world events through the readings\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that the midterm and final assignment especially tried to incorporate too much of the readings into each assignment, which might have been better if the midterm and final were more focused, specific, or particular.",
    "Strengths: \r\nThe materials that this course covers are definitely excellent and well-chosen, with different sides of opinion and analysis presented, especially around the topics of capitalism and nation-states, and one can learn materials that are usually not taught in other classes. \r\n\r\nThe class format is mostly discussions and lectures, and the instructor plans the class very well and organized. He would lead the students to discover the topic step by step instead of telling them directly, which requires the student to think and reflect on what they read. It is also very helpful that the instructor gave students the opportunity to expand on questions that they are interested in from the readings and draw connections with current events, which helps students to understand the topic in a greater context and gain a deeper understanding indeed. \r\n\r\nThe essay questions for the midterm and final provide a lot of flexibility and choices, especially the final questions, which guides students to do a lot of research and critical thinking and therefore be able to understand the material better. The feedback provided is helpful in terms of pointing out the strengths and weaknesses of the students writing directly.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nThe structure of the class is a bit too rigid, with reading being the major task on weekdays, reflections in the weekend, and the midterm and final paper in particular weeks. I would appreciate a lot if there are some kind of alterations during the week- while it is definitely reasonable to provide students with enough time to finish the readings during the weekdays- and more writing assignments, which would help students with their writings with more feedback. Also, with a lot of materials covered, I wish there can be notes or highlights provided for each class, which makes it easier for students to review and check their understanding."

   "comments": [
    "I would! This course helped to challenge my views and was a great space for honest intellectual discussion.",
    "Absolutely. The materials, readings, and insights in the course are ones one would rarely find at Yale. The course allowed it students to engage with extremely valuable material and establish analytical frameworks that stray beyond the typical conventions of traditional Yale courses.",
    "I will recommend this course because I think this course is very good and helpful. And can improve students' skills.  This course is very meaningful.",
    "I definitely would recommend this class for another student, I think it gave me a really good broad understanding of political sociology as a whole but we were also able to dive into real-world and current day examples of the issues we were studying.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.  While it is very niche, I think that anyone who has any sort of interest in the topics covered should take a course like this one.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone, even if it doesn't align with your major! This class will change the way you see even daily interactions in the society. Independent of what field you decide to go into, I think it's important to know how power structures work, especially since power is a system that involves everyone!",
    "Absolutely. This course completely changed how I view our current society and also how I approach my life and goals. Even if you don't completely agree with much of the scholarship that we read and discuss, it is still a really great space to be exposed to different theories on the dynamics of power within our society and really pushes you to rethink everything that we take as normal and given in our world today.",
    "Absolutely, 100%. This is an essential course for any Yale student concerned about other people in the world. No doubt about it, every Yale student should take this course at some point not just to understand the many issues that are happening in the world (police brutality, poverty, gender violence, etc.) but more importantly to understand the overarching structures that are responsible for maintaining the existence and health of these issues. Learning about the interlocking forms of gender, class, and racial domination, or about the monopoly on legitimate use of force by the state, or nationalism and capitalism\/neoliberalism, for instance, helped me understand why issues like police brutality, or poverty, or gender violence continue to plague societies. By understanding how these issues are upheld by systems of domination and power dynamics, everyone will better understand how to begin to demolish these unacceptable structures to address the many problems that arise from these structures. \r\nAbove all, it is a very empowering course both academically (gives you frameworks to understand the content in so many other classes) and personally, and has significant real world application from a theoretical and practical (actionable) perspective.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is eye opening and inspiring because, not only does the course give students a thorough introduction of sociology, but the materials covered also sort of challenges the common understandings of important topics by providing counterarguments and motivates students to think critically."
