                "This course has both given me an incredible first semester with a new language and transformed my idea of language as a whole. I learned how to speak conversationally with my peers, have an entertaining dialogue with the professor, and learn about Brazilian society and pop culture.",
                "I developed a strong foundation of Portuguese. Specifically, I learned vocabulary that was essential for me to have conversations with me in Portuguese. I also learned some foundation grammar rules.",

                "There was homework every day but it was manageable. The course did feel disorganized at times, like we were jumping from one concept to another. A more specific, detailed syllabus (with specific grammar concepts/vocab themes to be covered each week) might help provide structure for students over the course of the semester. \r\nThe asynchronous day is a gem and one that I hope is kept for future semesters!",
                "Strengths:\r\n-Learning how to hold discussions. The ability to speak came much easier than I expected.\r\n- Manageable workload. I could come to class each day to simply learn rather than worry about taking notes as fast as I could write. \r\n-Engaging course content.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Asynchronous Wednesdays. The workload was inconsistent and could often take what felt like hours to complete.",
                "I think the course was strategically and efficiently designed to keep students engaged in the course material and in the classroom. The class activities involved partner and group work, which made students work together. \r\nI think the course could be improved if there was more speaking practice that also involved feedback from the professor. I think a greater emphasis on improving pronunciation would be helpful and is important for an introductory language class.",
                "basic course so it was good",
                "The strength of this course is that in class, the professor always tried to make it fun. The weakness to this class is the organization. The canvas page was beyond confusing and it was unclear which assignments were due which days. It was also difficult to know where we were at with grades because we were never given any indication.",
                "The course was well-organized around central themes and projects. The balance of written assignments to more formal exams felt right, and the organization of a final Portuguese \"event\" related to the final project was fun and fulfilling. The instructors do a great job of trying to create a sense of community between the different sections of Portuguese. I sometimes wished that the speed of instruction/material could have been a bit quicker, but for the most part the pacing was good, and there were plenty of opportunities to challenge oneself on assignments and out-of-class projects.",
                "With no prior experience to Portuguese, I thought that it was very hard to understand Professor Souza once she started speaking in only Portuguese after the 2nd or 3rd week.  I think that there needs to be a bette blend between English and Portuguese before diving right into speaking solely Portuguese."

                "I would recommend this course to any student who is genuinely interested (or who thinks they might be interested) in learning Portuguese. Don't take this course if you're looking for a gut language course, both because PORT 110 isn't really a gut and (more importantly) because it does a disservice to those in the class who are passionate about the language. Other than that, I think anyone can get a lot from taking this course and learning this language.",
