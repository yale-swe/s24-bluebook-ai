The Professor trusts the students, and everyone cares enough about the course and material to get the work done without much monitoring by the Professor. Discussions were engaging and very encouraging/ uncompetitive. That said, some feedback throughout the semester would have been helpful not necessarily more grades, but even a written/ verbal evaluation of our work and contributions to the class.",

It is a smaller sized class which allowed for more participation and familiarity with each other and the material. It was great to be able to choose the material we presented on and researched so we could learn about a variety of topics."

This is the ideal class for MCDB students who are self-motivated and have their own interests that theyd like to pursue further by leading discussions and writing literature reviews/ grant proposals on any topic of their choosing.

I also appreciated the added focus on social issues related to biology and hope that more courses in the MCDB department address these in the future."
