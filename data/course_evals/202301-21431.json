                "The labs in this course are easy and fun until they make no sense and even the TFs are confused. The grading ranges by section, so you could end up with a picky TF that takes off points as if you have an infinite amount to lose. Some TFs give students hints about what to focus on or reminders about important details to include in lab books. Other TFs keep their mouths shut and say they can't help. I think grading should be shared between all TFs, such that each one grades a few questions of each students' lab report. This course needs to be standardized.",
                "Strengths: my TA, max schafer was helpful and great at explaining the labs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lab practical, there was no incentive to read the labs beforehand other than for the quizzes, and even then I still didnt understand what was happening until I did it in person.",
                "This course was strong in its ability to help student collaboration. However, the labs were often long and filled with information that wasn't gone over during the course of the lab. I would recommend having an educational review session at the start of each lab before completing tasks to understand more the purpose\/physics behind activities. I also found the lab went out-of-sequence with Physics 181, which made it difficult for me to understand the labs as we were completing them. I was happy to self-study but I would advice review sessions for this reason.",
                "a requirement",
                "The course is more difficult and longer than its first semester counterpart (165L). The number of assignments and time needed to complete each was the same each week.",

                "labs were too long and too disconnected from PHYS 171\/181 course content. It was difficult to get the most out of it when we were unfamiliar with the content",
                "The hands on nature of the course is one of its greatest strengths. You have full autonomy during lab to work on a problem on your own.",
                "I did feel sometimes like the lab handouts could be difficult to follow. I personally found the format of 165L better and easier to follow. I found the strengths to be the amount of hands on learning, and the variety of interesting tools we used to demonstrate the topics such as genecons, speakers, lightbulbs, multimeters, etc.",
                "whole class was awesome until the practical - I don't think the exam really evaluated the concepts well",
                "The course was very engaging and well organized! I took PHYS165L last semester and this was the more enjoyable course even though the Lab Reports were graded harsher. I really liked the format and the way that we were faster than the material in PHYS181; this allowed us to get a head start on some of the material that we ended up seeing not too long after.",
                "Strengths: the labs were quite fun, especially Cardiac Harvey. Most of the labs were also planned out very well, such that we were not at lab for the full amount of time, and could spend the remaining time concepts with our TFs. Weaknesses: the biggest issue of this course is its dissonance with the physics sequence. I took PHYS 181 with this course, and we were performing experiments related to RLC circuits, for example, before we learned what indicators were in PHYS 181. While the experiments made sense at the end of the semester, I feel that pedagogically, my learning was suboptimal because the provided materials in PHYS 166L are not sufficient to properly explain and appreciate, for example, an inductor. Most weeks consisted of students who were very confused being taught the fundamentals by a TF in a way that only made sense for the purposes of the lab, not for actually learning the concepts underlying the experiments.",
                "The course settled into a nice groove during the semester. There was a slight imbalance in the length and rigor of some of the labs; it would have been nice if some were shorter and others were longer.",
                "The final exam came out of nowhere, the course does not prepare you for the difficulty of the final exam. It's actually awful.",
                "I think the course is very well formatted to optimize students' understanding of the material both with hands-on learning opportunities and with feedback from the professor present in the section as well as the TF. My one comment would be to ensure that TFs are returning feedback to their students in a timely manner, so that they can course correct and adjust their tacts for lab reports \/ quizzes etc. if they need to.",
                "This course may be improved immensely by making better practical exam questions that test what we had actually learned in class. This year, one question on the practical was a fair test of the knowledge that we built up in class, whereas the other did not reflect that.",
                "The grading on the lab notebooks is very tedious, and the practical exam is fairly difficult. Making labs shorter and more clear would improve this.",
                "Strengths: some of the labs were cool. not too much work. learned a lot about physics concepts; was helpful to learn in a more applications\/hands-on course.\r\nWeaknesses: concepts do not align with 181 (lab was often far ahead, which meant that I was actually learning the concepts in lecture much later and was pretty unclear during the time of the lab). labs were sometimes too long and can be un-engaging. final exam was definitely tough.",
                "-TAs generally very knowledgeable and explain things well which is good because the packets generally do a bad job with this. Even if you sit and read and try to understand, you will not get a satisfying understanding. Derivations are hand wavy and they dont provide intuitive explanations for concepts that are too complex to explain directly.\r\n-Labs can be very long and tedious. Some can be fun especially with a good partner",
                "Awful. Labs are much longer than 165L and sometimes we stayed late. They are also just as boring and even more confusing. Concepts also barely aligned with lectures (at least for 171, not sure about 181).",
                "Physics labs are by far the worst courses at Yale. By the end of the semester, it was clear that every student had so many gaps in their understanding of the course material because the information was not taught. For example, all chemistry labs begin with a short \"lecture\" where the topic of the week is discussed and specific aspects of the lab are analyzed to learn how the demonstrate the topic at hand. However, physics labs do not include any specific teaching of the topics which is a huge downfall. Instead, each week involves just learning to follow the lab handout directions without truly learning what is happening. Additionally, when we ask questions, the TAs are not familiar with how the lead instructors want something done, which makes everyone very confused.",
                "Strengths: well designed lab reports that solidified concepts learned in the classroom; fair practical exam\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: nit-picky grading on lab reports (i.e. taking of several points each time function generator settings weren't listed, despite them being laid out in the lab handouts); insufficient explanation around some of the more complex concepts (i.e. fast fourier transforms, normal modes, etc.)",
                "very good overall, labs were sometimes confusing and required extreme explanantion",
                "I liked that we did labs in pairs and had detailed instructions. I think some of the questions could be improved to more clear since often you couldn't do them without asking the TA.",
                "The course was well organized and translated well to practicals",
                "The structure of the lab report is good and fair. The labs are interesting and take up the right amount of time.",
                "I think a strength of this course is that it provides an environment for us to physically engage with the content with we are learning in class. But, a weakness is that a lot of times the pace of the lab was ahead of the lecture and so it was difficult to understand what we were doing in lab because we had not done it in lecture. Also, even with reading the lab report, sometimes it was difficult to understand what was going on in the lab or what the concepts were because we had not done it in lecture previously. Our TA generously would explains some of the tricky concepts in lab before we started, but this was not the norm for other sections. I think the lab could be improved by making this mini explanation component at the beginning a requirement. Finally, I  do not think the LPE is a reasonable assessment of the lab skills we have learned. Someone could perform well and put in effort all year, but because the LPE is worth so much of the grade, they could end up doing poorly. I understand the need for a final assessment, but I think it should be worth less so it does not largely affect students' grade when they have put in hard work throughout the year.",

                "Strengths: handouts were detailed and sometimes fun to read, labs often ended early, in general there was some fun labs (Cardiac Harvey + Genecon Hand Crank + laser labs come to mind)\r\nWeaknesses: lab practical exam felt a bit rushed \/ somewhat difficult relative to anything else we did this semester",
                "Often times the labs would be much longer than the class period and the tas and professor were aware of this but i dont see it as entirely fair that you either cannot get all of your data or you have to miss prior engagements after class. I think the lab assignments should not bleed over",
                "Strengths: Well-organized for student learning.\r\nWeaknesses: Grading felt arbitrary at times.",

                "I liked the challenge of this class and that the labs, for the most part, were not as long as PHYS 165L. The TFs were knowledgeable and helped me understand many concepts that I didnt quite get at first. I think this class was much more challenging that PHYS 165L. Not only were the concepts tougher, there was an adjustment to the fact that more was expected on lab reports for this class. This is not necessarily bad, but the expectations werent effectively communicated at the beginning of the class, I feel.",
                "Strengths - Greg was a great TA. The labs were usually not that bad overall. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the lab final was ridiculously difficult and we didnt get practice problems to prepare for the questions. I assume it was curved though.",
                "Strengths: I like that the workload is pretty low, and the TAs tend to know how to navigate the labs rather well. The lab reports are a good way to sum up what we've learned from each lab.\r\nWeaknesses: I think that different TAs grade pretty differently!",
                "This lab could greatly be improved if tas held office hours. If you dont understand a concept once completing the lab there arent any resources to help. Offfice hours should be held like every other stem class.",
                "It was a fair course, no particular strengths or weaknesses",
                "strengths: TAs, lab reports are not super intense, lab handouts have clear directions\r\n\r\nweaknesses: final lab practical was a bit difficult and we didn't get much information about what would be on it, labs can feel very long and boring",
                "Strengths: Organized, informative, lots of help provided \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes ahead of the physics lecture pacing",
                "Frankly, I thought this course was an extremely well designed lab. The teaching staff is extremely involved and supportive.",
                "Feels like students are meant to need help every single lab, which doesnt make sense. There was times where we figured out concepts on our own which felt like how it was supposed to be run but at times it felt like we wouldnt make it through the lab without the help of a TA.",
                "Some of the instructions were long and\/or unclear.",
                "Strengths: well organized, interesting labs\r\nWeaknesses: the lab reports seem unnecessary and I don't feel like we learn much from doing them",
                "This course was definitely interesting. As a non-major I thought a lot of the labs we did were cool. I would suggest perhaps making the lab handouts a bit more condensed with the directions more clear as I and my lab partners often had a difficult time navigating them during session. Other than that though, this course was a nice introduction to a lot of different physics lab concepts.",
                "I thought the course was overall a very good course.",
                "N\/A",
                "Strengths are the labs themselves which are well created and thought through. Weaknesses: not having a representative lab practical practice which was incredibly frustrating. I had attended all the extra review sessions for practice before the final one and breezed through the practice so i was horrified when the final practical was so much more difficult than the review one.",
                "Strengths = labs supplemented physics lecture work \r\n\r\nWeakness = some labs felt longer than necessary",
                "The TA's are super ready to help but at times I felt lost with the tasks\/they were hard to figure out on our own",
                "Strengths: well-organised, good length of tasks, very helpful and applicable to PHYS 171, good balance of theory with tasks\r\nWeaknesses: You should be able to drop quizzes. As it stands, if you miss one, they can SIGNIFICANTLY drop your grade.",
                "Very hands on and TAs\/professors that are willing to help you or explain the physics behind the experiment further if desired.",
                "I thought that our TFs were really geared to helping us learn but thought that the practical lab exam was extremely hard. I worked very hard on the labs yet feel my grade didnt accurately resemble what I had learned.",
                "STRENGTHS: the TAs and the entire teaching team are really willing to answer questions - it's a safe space to make mistakes and they are there to provide a lot of guidance WEAKNESSES: a lot of the labs were really long, and the lecture course was behind the labs in content - most people had never seen electricity and magnetism concepts before. So, there was not ample explanation in the lab handouts to answer the questions. TAs had to teach basic content to every pair of students over and over again, making everyone frustrated and making the labs frustrating and draining (because most people did not have enough background knowledge to answer the questions, it was unclear what was supposed to be \"figured out\" and what was supposed to be a simple question based on background content. The lab handouts should provide enough information to complete the lab without lecture content. The post-lab summaries are not time-consuming, but I'm not sure I learn much from them. It might be better a better learning strategy to answer a few post-lab questions that directly ask the questions we should be covering in the summary.",
                "This is a required class for most majors",
                "The strengths of the course were the TAs. They were always available to help and did an amazing job helping provide guidance in the lab if concepts were unclear. The weaknesses of the course were mostly due to the structuring. Several labs ran for beyond the course timeframe due to how lengthy and confusing they were. This was not respectful of our time and made it difficult to fully understand the lab in such a short period. The lab handouts were often confusing and poorly-written at times where both the students and TAs would struggle to decipher what the handout wanted us to do. Additionally, the final exam was not a great measure of the work we did in lab and did not test on skills that we learned. Specifically, the first question was abnormally difficult and confusing, having us do concepts we had not worked on before and resulted in an unfair advantage for those who had a more extensive physics background. The second question was fine, but still had confusing parts.",
                "Strengths: very engaging and fun course\r\nWeakness: Little resources and help in preparing for LPE other than look over previous labs",
                "Strengths: Gives students an opportunity to have a hands-on experience with what we learn in PHYS 171 or 181. \r\nWeaknesses: Your enjoyment and understanding in this course was completely determined by which TA you had. Also, the topics weren't completely coordinated with the physics lecture sequence, so for example when we learned induction, I had no idea what was going on because induction wasn't taught in lecture until a month later.",
                "I like how it aligned with what I was learning in my other physics course",
                "The teaching staff is very helpful and the course is very well structured",
                "The strengths of this course are that the TAs are really kind and genuinely understand that the lab course doesn't match up with what we are learning in class. The weaknesses of this course are that the lab practical is extremely unnecessary and doesn't truly demonstrate how much effort students have put into learning the course material and dedicating time to preparation before labs. Time-constrained testing like quizzes and the lab practical induce anxiety in students who genuinely want to learn physics and have a love of learning circuits  an extended lab report would have been better. The fact that the average on the lab practical exam was a 75% and people were running out of the room crying should show that this was not something that would actually test how much students engaged with the material and wanted to do well in the course.",
                "Excellently organized with clear instructions",
                "A lot of the activities, both in lab and outside of lab through the weekly quizzes, often seem tedious and like they dont improve our understanding of the material.",
                "the lab reports were far too detailed and would include basic information, such as how to locate the power button on a function generator. The tasks felt like busy work, and I'm not sure the pacing was quick enough. My lab partner and I would finish the 3 hour labs in a fraction of the time, and it felt more like a task I had to complete rather than a course I was taking.",
                "The course is great but I think quizzes are weighted improperly",
                "Everything is very organized and instructions are very clear. Takes you through step by step, so anyone can go at any pace they would like. There is not much that could be improved. Even the background information was what was necessary, but not more.",
                "This course was a very well organized lab course.",
                "Strength: The course offers two free 48-hr extensions for lab notebooks to be turned in without penalty. Weakness: Some of the labs can be quite lengthy, and there were at least one or two labs where multiple students from multiple sections were not able to finish the lab within the allotted 2.5 hour time window. For example, I recommend that Lab 8 be shortened.",
                "This course was very comprehensive and challenging, but the experience with it depended greatly on the quality of the TA. Also, the lab would often be ahead of content being taught the physics course.",
                "The lab practical at the end is nothing like the labs we did which was obvious by everyones scores. The TAs and some of the professors are amazing but the rest is very poorly done. The labs are long and unengaging. Less emphasis should be put on finishing the lab and more on actually learning.",
                "In my experience, this course asks too much of its students to the detriment of actual learning and academic exploration. Labs would often have upwards of 50 questions to answer, and multiple times the entire class stayed over the allotted 3 hr time limit to complete these labs. I found that this left us cutting corners, answering questions without understanding why an answer was correct, and asking for help immediately without trying a few ways of solving something ourselves. It's really a shame because I think I really benefited from getting to tangibly explore the topics I learned in physics lecture. But right now this class is just something to get through, when I think it could really be a moment students appreciate as enriching their academic experience.",
                "The labs were engaging and sometimes difficult, but I think the one drawback was that they were pretty repetitive and sometimes it felt like we were just repeating the same processes with a slightly different setup.",
                "The strength of this class was that you learned technical skills in lab and also got to apply and see physics concepts in action during section.",
                "The labs are all wonderful. The handout are easy to follow and very well crafted. All the material builds up to things, and really helps you get a good understanding. All the background you need is there, and the teaching team does a great job helping out when you need.",
                "Strengths: having 2 48 hour extensions for the lab reports\r\nWeaknesses: having the quizzes just benefitted people who cheated. if you cheated, you could do well on the quizzes. if you didn't cheat, you would struggle on the quizzes, getting lower grades than your classmates, and ultimately doing worse in the class. if you want to have quizzes, do them in person. or don't have them at all. or have them be open note (we're using our notes for the lab anyways, why make the quizzes closed note?). the practical exam was absolutely terrible and so unfair. the labs were too long and I felt like I wasn't able to understand what I was doing because I had to rush to do everything to get it done within the time frame, so I wasn't able to digest everything. everything is so dependent on your TA (I had a rough grader) and that isn't factored into the final grades.",
                "I did not like the pre-quizzes. I preferred how it was for 165L where we had surveys",
                "Strengths: rigorous, supple video guides, detailed manuals\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: manuals can be a bit too detailed (cut down on word count), and one or two labs were super long (I didn't finish one of them)."

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to others because it reinforces the material you learn in lecture. The material from both lab and lecture (Physics 170 in my case) complemented each other nicely. This made sure that the info really stuck.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. As a pre-med student, this class was not directly relevant to me, but it accompanied my PHYS 171 lecture quite well.",
                "I would. I feel that it helped my understanding of the material of PHYS 181 a lot. I think that what I learned in 166L will be more valuable to me than what I learned in Physics 181.",
                "yes absolutely a good way to drive home the concepts learned in PHYS 171",
                "For many majors, it is required. The teaching team is quite helpful, and the TFs are amazing. I genuinely think this is a good course, but with minor tweaks to the structure of experiments, I think that this could become a much more intellectually engaging and rewarding class for students.",

                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless required. The course felt very disjointed, questions were frequently dismissed, and there was no small lecture each week to discuss the topic at hand. All of this together makes learning the physics behind the experiments each week very difficult and unnecessarily draining.",
                "Avoid this course unless required by major\/pre-med",

                "Physics 166L had some pretty fun labs and it wasn't too much work. I wouldn't say it accompanies the lecture all that closely but you'll be introduced to capacitors, resistors, and inductors in lab before you get to it in lecture, which was a bit helpful.",

                "If its not necessary for their program or study I wouldnt recommend it. The labs dont always coincide with what youre learning in physics. Sometimes its ahead so its hard to understand whats going on. \r\nHaving a lab practical worth so much of our grade seems unfair. If you do fairly well throughout the year but not so well on the exam your grade will be tanked.",

Lab handouts were clear, and I could always find support in the TA's. Second semester introductory physics was a bit more intellectually challenging than first semester, so a hands-on lab practical to supplement my lecture learning was helpful.",

In which case, make friends with your classmates and help each other out, eat beforehand and bring a juice or chocolate milk to drink during lab. Read the lab write-ups ahead of time and answer any questions that you can ahead of time. Start writing your lab reports as a formula (i.e. start off with purpose, then say what variables you measured and how you did, include a possible source of error in the variable measurement section, draw some conclusion from data, directly say \"This reminds me of PHYS 171 where we learned...\").",

Everyone wants to be there, the workload is not that high which lets you enjoy the labs themselvse without being worried about the work. The labs are all very intentionally made to actually teach you things that really help you grasp the harder concepts in physics.",
                "No, I would not recommend this course to another student, but I'm assuming that if you're taking it, you have to take it for some requirement. I don't feel like I learned much"
