                "A strength is the research paper. You can literally research whatever you want which is really rare and a great experience. A weakness is that I felt like class was a slog almost every week. Prof. Fair cold calls and it was not very discussion centric and was more did you do the reading at all.",
                "Strengths: Very hands-on and practical. I liked writing the papers \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Assumed a lot of knowledge going on; there isn't much class time spent on the underlying concepts to write a good paper. It just goes over different papers.",
                "Cold calling on the same people over and over disincentivized doing the readings. Really interesting professor but not amazing at teaching except in one-on-one meeting context.",
                "The class has a unique design (three large papers). I think the actual lectures themselves could be a bit more engaging but Professor Fair does a good job explaining the different papers.",
                "Strengths: interesting content, manageable workload, opportunity and guidance to do original research on a topic of your choosing, Professor Fair does a great job of introducing students to original econometrics research. (Potential) Weaknesses: a strong foundation in econometrics is likely necessary to get out of this course the full extent of what it has to offer, students should be prepared to do research on their own with minimal hand-holding.",

This course is relatively low workload (three papers throughout the semester), and the professor is super approachable. You get out however much you put in, so you can choose to challenge yourself on the papers or you can also explore a topic that you want to research with statistical lens. The professor expects you to at least skim the assigned readings because he cold calls on students during class.",
                "I would if you have a clear idea of a topic you want to research.",

                "Yes if you want to only have three assignments for the whole semester.",
                "I would recommend this course if you have all the prerequisites and enjoyed your econometrics classes. It's also a good class to satisfy an S&DS certificate requirement.",
                "Definitely! Regardless of whether one wants to pursue a career in academia, the opportunity to do original econometrics research is an interesting and valuable challenge to any student. Professor Fair is great and helps guide students through this task.",
                "The course is easy and helps with basic paper writing, but otherwise not very engaging."
