    "Word to word memorization is useful but sometimes focusing more on talking would be better.",
    "First of all, it was a an excellent course. I think the homework and the daily quizzes helped a lot with our learning. They helped me to keep the information fresh which is vital when learning a language. I also think learning the dialogues was also very helpful. I do not know any weaknesses."

    "Yes",
    "Yes! Just make sure you put in the time necessary to succeedI slacked off in the first half, which meant the second half of the lessons were a mad scramble to get my grades back in shape. If you stay on top of things, though, you should be fine.",
    "Yes certainly. great language course.",
    "YES! This course is excellent because of the amazing teachers but be aware that you have to study daily and there are short(5 minute) quizzes and homework EVERYDAY. However, this helps to improve your Chinese immensely."
