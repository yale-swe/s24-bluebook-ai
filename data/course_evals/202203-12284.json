                "I was exposed to different types of comedy (straight-line/wavy-line, unreliable narrator, parody & satire, physical comedy, etc.) I also learned how to try and experiment and fail.",
                "I learned a lot about how things we encounter in everyday life are good comedic material.",
                "I learned about the structures and practice of comedy.",
                "You get to try out a lot of things with the exercises that we do and you get better at just spontaneous living as a human in a crazy world. I learned a lot (through practice) of what really makes so things funny. The class is in no way a full overview of all things funny but it's a great start. I gained way more confidence to story-tell and be and actor not only on stage but in life too.",
                "This class gleefully knocks down the ivory tower of comedy and proclaims that everyone is funny. You may not believe that you're funny at the start of the class--or that the person next to you is--but by the end of the semester, your mind will be changed."

                "I think I thought that this class would be something different from what it actually turned out being. It's very much people just trying out material they've written for the class and Deb's insights on performing, which is still super helpful, but was not exactly what I was expecting. You do a lot of doing comedy in this class, which is great, and some analysis of comedy.",
                "Deb is a great professor. She's kind and knowledgeable. This was a course that was very dependent on the community of the class. Somedays it was more enjoyable to share in the learning of comedy than others. I'm not sure how much I tangibly learned from the course. The in class explorations were fun, but there weren't many readings to support an intellectual understanding of comedy.",
                "Strengths: Deb! Deb is truly a gem. She is so encouraging and fosters such a safe environment to experiment with comedic forms. I especially enjoyed her \"Stand Up and Say Something\" activities at the beginning of each class. It was such an engaging way to force us to share stories that could become grounds for comedic exploration. I also loved the assignments. It was the most fun I had preparing for a class.\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "I think this course could benefit from more frequent discussions on our readings.",
                "More viewings, more discussion of structures.  More stand-up.",
                "Strengths: Deb setting the tone and being such a character. She's such a lovable person. The exercises are fun and insightful. The council of 18 goofballs that gets formed by the students of the class is a beautiful thing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lacking in structure in knowing what's coming for future classes, also no real specific feedback for your performance in the class but that may very well be due to the communal lab-style of the class where we talk about things as they happen.",
                "Strengths: didn't feel aggressively like a theater class, a lot of room to play around and make mistakes, we built a really great class community, you could watch everyone get stronger/more confident as the class went on, a lot of different types of comedy were explored and discussed\r\nWeakness: The syllabus was a bit scattered and sometimes I wasn't sure what I was expected to have read or watched before class",
                "This is a great class. It's hands on--which is a great balance for the folks taking a bunch of lectures--and you learn things you won't learn anywhere else. It's one of those quintessentially Yale courses. There's not another professor out there like Deb Margolin. She is great a cultivating the supportive, community environment which makes this class so successful.\r\nMy biggest problem with the class was the lack of structure, which made it hard for me to fully engage with the class. This problem may very well be solved for future iterations of the class, though, because one student in our class created a new syllabus that's much clearer. I also didn't feel I got much feedback from the professor throughout the semester. I would have especially liked to get a written response on my final."

                "Yes! A chill and fun class that gets you thinking about comedy. You'll enjoy this course much more if you have acting experience, as you act a lot in this class.",
                "Yes as a light hearted class to get you through a difficult semester.",
                "YESSSSSSS!!!!! Please take this class with Deb. You will not regret it. If you love comedy or just love to laugh, you'll enjoy this course. As someone who is interested in pursuing comedy, this was an incredible chance to try new style of comedy and experiment with my comedic style. It was also lovely to be surrounded by incredibly funny people and laugh together. Any class with Deb is truly a joy. I felt so supported throughout the course. It was a welcome respite from the academic stresses of my other classes. TL;DR: It's two hours with Deb making each other laugh. What's not to like?",
                "Yes! I think this class had great exercises for thinking about what is funny.",
                "I would recommend the course. There's nowhere else on campus where you get to take a class about performing comedy. While there was a section in the middle of the class that kind of dragged on, overall it was a really fun addition to my week each week. It pushed me to do things outside my comfort zone (like stand up), and I'm glad I had such a nice place to explore comedy in.",
                "Yes, definitely. For all who are formal comedians or actors and for all who are not (honestly especially if you are not). One of the best parts of the class was that it was a blend of people in the class in terms of experience. This class is such a great one for confidence-building in whatever you end up doing in your life. The class is straightforward and the community of goofballs that you get to know is great, especially since this is the only comedy class beyond \"Writing Humor\". No stressful tedious work either",
                "Very yes.",
                "Definitely. If you're at all interested in laughing, then this class should be on your radar. During the semester's most stressful weeks, it'll be a bright spot. If you can deal with a loosely structured class, then press on intrepid jokester. Just show up and, you may not realize it at the time, but you'll be learning at lot."
