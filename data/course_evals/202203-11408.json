It was really cool to take an idea and translate it into a physical work. We also had numerous workshops with other artists and learned a lot about their works and processes. Also, we had learned how to stretch our own canvases and prime them!",

Class was really as much as you put into it and seemed to have something everyone could engage with.\r\nWeaknesses: The course could have a slight bit more clarity/organization on the specific day-to-day schedule. This wasn't a huge deal but definitely came up whenever I had to purchase supplies and we ended up not using them/using them way later.",
                "I really enjoyed being free to start straight away with real painting, rather than doing endless studies. We did some practical skill-based work but were also allowed freedom to really explore, experiment and take risks. We also received such helpful, honest, kind but firm feedback.",
                "Strengths: you are surrounded by peers who are of all artistic levels and can really learn a lot from them. the classroom environment is super open and I genuinely enjoyed coming to class everyday.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this is not necessarily a weakness, but I (& many other students) often had to come in and paint outside of class hours.",

Even if you don't have much experience, there is so much to learn and it's really a unique experience to be a part of Yale's art world (even if you aren't an art major).",
