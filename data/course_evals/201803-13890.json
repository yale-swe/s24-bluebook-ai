    "Amazing professor, interesting readings, and great discussions!",
    "The intro question that opens class is a major strength that engages everyone and sets up the lecture portion. Perhaps more group work could be helpful for a mid point in class."

    "I would recommend it if you want an easy class. The readings are pretty low key and there aren't many assignments. If you want to know about the precursor to racial understanding and genocide, this works. But it doesn't go much further than that.",
    "Yes! Amazing course. Take this if you are genuinely interested in the Spanish Inquisition and want to actually engage with this material. This course is demanding, but also fair. It is not a gut! Be prepared to talk in class, write papers, and give a presentation.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about this subject.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone interested in race and anything it lists in the title. The papers are super doable and spaced out well throughout the semester."
