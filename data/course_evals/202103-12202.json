                "This course provides an excellent introduction to short stories of famous Russian authors. You can also improve your writing and literary analysis skills.",
                "I hadn't read any Russian literature before taking this course. I feel like I now have a much better sense of the Russian literary tradition. And I've learned that I really like reading Russian short stories! I hope to read more Chekhov, Gogol, etc. in the future.",
                "I read a lot of Russian short stories. I got a great overview of the subject and a lot of insight into how short stories are written and what is interesting about specific stories.",
                "reading critically, analyzing passages, writing skills",
                "Close reading analysis, greatly improved writing skills through practice, wide survey of key Russian authors and important works",
                "I was thoroughly introduced to Russian short stories",
                "This course served very well for me as an introduction to intertextuality and comparison essays, which were fascinating!",
                "I loved this class! I had never gained an understanding of Russian literature and I found this exploration into it to be very informative and interesting. Not only did I learn how to correctly read a short story but I also learned how to be passionate about them and how to gain insight from simple words and phrases.",
                "I gained an appreciation for the narrative complexity of the short story and the numerous literary strategies that authors use to build compelling stories. The class also developed my ability to conduct intertextual analysis and to place different works in conversation with each other. I also grew as a writer from Prof. Bojanowskas generous and exhaustive feedback. I also gained a lot of historical insight into the enduring legacy of Russian colonialism in Eastern Europe.",

                "The workload is very manageable, the stories are fun, and the class discussions are interesting and thought-provoking. Professor Bojanowska is encouraging, supportive, and gives great constructive feedback. The class is very engaging and intellectually stimulating.",
                "Professor Bojanowska is probably the class' greatest strength. Although the syllabus is also fantastic, the course was really anchored by the wonderful class discussions that Professor Bojanowska led. \r\n\r\nI also really appreciated how manageable the reading load was. Even when I had very busy weeks, I always felt that I could read the stories assigned for this class. As a result, my engagement with this course was high. I was able to really dig into the material, which I loved.",
                "Strengths: quite light reading, really fantastic literature, not too much work, sensible exams, really insightful professor. Overall very enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the professor let the class talk too much and didn't steer the conversation enough. Essay grades were a little weird\/low, and I didn't really learn much about writing from the professor.",
                "This is one of my favorite courses I have ever taken at Yale. Loved the course material and structure of the class. Very organized and clear with great open discussions.",
                "I think that this course was amazing, and there really is no way that it could be improved. We covered a lot of short stories from a variety of time periods of Russian history. Professor Bojanowska always began each class discussion with an overview of the history of the time period and a biography of the author, which allowed us to contextualize our discussion more. Each story was also situated within a larger unit - the structure of the genre and critical tools, intertextuality, and narrative complication - which really helped with focusing the discussion as well and allowing us to learn more about each of these ideas. I also think that the course breakdown really made a lot of sense and helped with cementing everything that we have learned. I think that the midterm quiz is helpful as a review of all of the stories we have read. The only comment that I would make is that I think the smaller group discussions were at times more helpful and I would have enjoyed a few more of those because it provided a bit more structure to the discussion and allowed us to really explore the big ideas of the course through the questions or excerpts that Professor Bojanowska provided. The larger group discussion was still thoroughly engaging, but I think that sometimes discussions jumped very quickly from one theme to the next.",
                "Fascinating material and very well taught. Discussions are engaging although the class is bigger than a seminar so you can't necessarily speak often.",
                "strengths: engaging course, interesting readings.\r\nweaknesses: always unsure what the expectations for the essays are.",
                "The syllabus is incredibly thoughtful and well organized, and Professor Bojanowska is an intelligent and caring professor who moderates discussions well. I do wish the class had been smaller  at over 25 students, class discussion often felt competitive and not collaborative, even in small group settings.",
                "I thought the amount of reading for this class was Perfect because it allowed for an in-depth exploration into the text without worrying about completing the texts in general.",
                "The workload is manageable and spread evenly across the semester and we got a heads up when a text was longer than 50 pages. \r\n\r\nProf. Bojanowska is the largest strength of this class. Her passion for the stories we read was simply infectious. She had the unique ability to make century-old stories accessible and meaningful to students with varying degrees of exposure to Russian literature. She also created a learning environment in which I felt challenged but equally comfortable to make mistakes and test out ideas.\r\n\r\nEven though the class centers on the themes of love and death, the selection of stories was vast and addressed other pertinent issues like Russias imperial campaign in the Caucus, Anti-Semitism, and the afterlives of communism in Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nThis class is truly accessible to all students of all writing abilities. It assumes no background in Russian, literature, or the humanities. I appreciated that the essays tested ideas and not ones ability to compose beautiful, ornate prose.",
                "The course consisted of a pretty good array of Russian short stories, some of which were great reads, and others of which were okay but by no means special. My biggest qualm with this course is that it was an enormous waste of an hour and fifteen minutes twice a week. You would struggle to find another course in which you could meet for such a long time and yet gain only a surface-level interpretation of each story. Professor Bojanowska had little to offer herself, though she had notes, and I would have loved to see her steer discussion in a more coherent manner.  Seminars would consist of some context from her, then individual students making isolated points for the majority of the class, with a final firing off of points from the professor at the end.\r\n\r\nThese isolated points were sometimes very good, and in those cases Professor Bojanowska should have stopped the discussion there and dived deeper, but pretty much every time she failed to do so, and simply nodded and pointed at someone else to say their point which was completely off topic. In many cases students came up with, frankly, bad interpretations, and instead of challenging these interpretations, or challenging the student to make a better one or refine their point, the professor again simply nodded and pointed to the next person.\r\n\r\nThis made for generally intellectually weak discussion, and I probably would have learned the same amount if I had not turned up to any classes.\r\n\r\nOne other thing I noticed, having looked up many of the stories on the internet, is that many of Professor Bojanowskas notes were taken straight from Wikipedia. One time she rattled off word for word what I had on my screen in the lesson. This was pretty shocking, especially as there is a lot of rich literary criticism of the stories we read, criticism which Professor Bojanowska may have quoted a couple of times, but never really engaged us with.\r\n\r\nOverall I think this class was really let down by a lack of creativity from the professor. Discussions were stilted and boring, and apart from a simplistic structuring of the course into three modules, the stories were rather homogeneous in meaning and subject matter. I dont think this class should be taught again in its current format."

                "Yes! Take this class if you're interested in Russian literature, or even think you might be. If you don't speak Russian then this is one of the ideal classes to take.",
                "It's a great crash course on different authors in Russian literature, but the Professor doesn't do a great job of facilitating discussion. It was always the same people talking in class. In a nutshell: you learn a lot but it's not really fun.",
                "Absolutely. Wonderful survey of 18th-19th century Russian short stories.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students, especially if they are interested in learning more about Russian literature and its themes. You also learn a lot about literary theory and the components that make up a short story, and how they apply to the stories that you read in the class. The stories are also incredibly enjoyable to read and think about. This course is extremely well structured and Professor Bojanowska is truly wonderful. She provides a wealth of information about all of the authors and the stories in every class and leads really enjoyable class discussions. Professor Bojanowska also provides great resources and instruction about how to write different types of essays, such as analytical and comparative essays, and then gives really clear and great feedback about your writing so that you can improve as a writer. So if you take this class, you will not only learn a lot more about Russian literature, but you will also really improve as a writer and learn skills that will be invaluable in a lot of other Yale courses and your future.",

                "no",
                "I had a wonderful time in Love and Death in the Russian Short Story. I would absolutely recommend it to any student  I took it as a first semester freshman and felt it a wonderful introduction to college-level analytical writing that still challenged me a great deal. The range of authors and works you read is absolutely amazing. I read and loved so many stories that I wouldn't have otherwise encountered, in addition to the introduction to so many of the classic authors and works this course provides. (We read female authors!) I never felt like I truly understood a story until we discussed it in class, and I found that Professor Bojanowska and my classmates were essential to discovering new ideas and themes that hadn't yet occurred to me.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it challenged my traditional education at Yale.",
                "Stop reading these reviews! This is the best class taught at Yale, you will be lucky to take it.",
                "Dont be fooled by an interesting course description. This was one of the most boring, least stimulating classes I have taken at Yale. You would learn the same if not more by simply reading the assigned texts in your own time."
