                "This class was a great introduction into literary analysis. From the course I learned various ways and lenses through which I can approach literary analysis and essay writing. I feel that the course helped strengthen my essay writing skills. I gained new insight into the authors we read and, at times, the greater movements that these authors were apart of. I appreciated the wide selection of readings the class provided, and Professor Williams always made and brought out interesting points and arguments during lecture.",
                "By taking this course, I gained crucial knowledge about the American literary canon, as well as strategies on how to conduct close readings. I deeply enhanced my writing skills and learned a lot about some of the most prominent writers/texts in American literature (Dickinsons poems, Melvilles short stories, etc.).",

                "This course's curriculum is very well thought out and explore's diverse literature from a wide variety of authors and styles. It focuses on postmodern writers whom I had never analyzed before, and so I enjoyed being able to do so. I also liked that the class was structured as 2/3 lecture and 1/3 discussion and that it was only twice a week. The only downside was that it was on Zoom and so engagement was more difficult, but of course the online option could be seen as a positive too depending on individual circumstances.",
                "Strengths: Excellent teacher and teaching assistant",
                "I enjoyed the arrangement of the books. They roughly followed a chronological timeline, but were also grouped by theme or literary movement. This made it easier to find commonalities between the texts and to observe how a given concept developed over time. Sometimes I wish more time was spent talking about the texts, rather than planning for upcoming essays, etc.",
                "Strengths:The teaching provided by the lecturer and tbe TA is highly engaging.The materials for study are valuable. Lots of practical skills for literary appreciation were taught.",
                "I thought the course was quite engaging for an online course. I thought that lecture time was always insightful and Professor Williams always made meaningful and thought provoking points. I thought that the course load was appropriate for a one month summer course. The readings were enjoyable and fairly diverse. Many were short stories or shorter novels that made it possible to actually read everything in a timely manner. I though the three essays we had were well spaced and Professor Williams and the TAs provided a very generous late policy that I thoroughly appreciated. Essay prompts were good and feedback on essays was helpful as well. I also did appreciate the writings tips given during lecture, and we would also go over sample essays which was helpful. For most classes, we did lecture the first half of the class and then we would enter discussion section the second half of the class. Discussion section was lead by TAs, and I definitely think all the TAs are hardworking and have vested interest in us doing well. I found discussion section to be insightful, you definitely get what you put in and that really applies to the class as a whole as well. If you engage with the ideas presented in lecture and discussion then I think you can take a lot away from the class. However, occasionally, discussion section can be a little awkward due to the online format and depending on people's energy level and level of engagement with the class. Nonetheless, you do still get to know the people in your section over time and are able to form relationships as long as you attend and participate to a degree. I found discussion section to be most successful when we had a loose structure and could bounce off of people's ideas and organically grow conversations. I do think that as a shorter summer course, the class does feel more abridged, and I do think you may get more out of the class if you attended it during the regular school year and had more time and more readings. But, I think if you are looking for a solid intro writing course for the summer, this is a great option.",
                "Strengths include the professors sheer brilliance, the relevance of the content, and the fact that the course goes so in-depth Im teaching a variety of lessons and texts. I wouldve liked more opportunities to chat with rather than listen to the Professor.",
                "Fantastic professor and TAs, interesting choice of literature, very welcoming atmosphere, accommodations, space to discuss openly."

Plus, I think the analysis skills and ways of analysis I learned are applicable to other media like visual arts, movies, music, other literary work, etc. I feel that I am better equipped at articulating my understanding of works and in making interpretations about media that I encounter.",
