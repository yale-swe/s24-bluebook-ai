                "I loved this class! I really cannot name all the strengths of it, and I would suggest it to every student even remotely interested in animals!!! It definitely isn't a gut, and is a lot of material, but Casey is SO kind and easy to reach out to, and so excited about inverts! He has a wonderful and engaging teaching style, and really really wants his students to succeed. The assignments were also really varied and different, which was nice! My only suggestion for improving the course would be to do more comparative anatomy among different inverts. Because there is a lot of material to cover, each lecture is focused on one clade of animals. I think it would be helpful to have more lectures that focus on collective traits among the clades! There are a couple lectures that do this already (like one on Lifecycles, Feeding Behavior, etc), but having more would have been really beneficial for drawing connections!",
                "Very engaging and interesting lectures! Prof. Dunn is super passionate about the material and this class in particular which made going to lectures a real pleasure. The assessments (one in-class, closed book midterm, one open-notes final, one paper and 10 shorts quizzes) were fair and split up work nicely so as not to make this class too stressful, but still kept us engaged. Prof. Dunn is very low-key, but in the process of researching for my paper I realized that his name pops up in most Wikipedia and scholarly articles about Zoology.",
                "I was very engaged throughout all the lectures, and each lecture was recorded (when the equipment was functioning properly), which was helpful when studying for the midterm and final. \r\nI would recommend taking the lab alongside the course it you have the time. Even if you can't, try to join in on one of the lab's tidepooling field trips. It's rewarding to take the knowledge gained in the class and apply it to living organisms.",
                "Strengths: incredible prof, engaging content, helpful psets, extremely reasonable assessments, interesting final project. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: ... honestly hard to think of any! There was definitely a lot of content to learn, so I could see the course being overwhelming to someone who didn't want to really engage with it, but if you're genuinely interested in this stuff I think its a good level of challenge.",
                "The class is organized very well, with Professor Dunn providing detailed feedback, support, and materials throughout the course. I honestly didn't have any complaints about the course."

                "I have recommended this course to at least 10-15 friends! This is dually the most interesting and the most enjoyable class I have taken at Yale. Because the course content is so specific, nearly every students comes in with a low-level of prior knowledge, so this class is extremely accessible. Additionally, Professor Dunn makes the lecture engaging and interesting. The enthusiasm all students have about the course content indicates that this course is worth recommending.",
                "Yes! One of the best classes at Yale",
                "You will learn new insights about what an animal is and about the abundance of life all around us which we often take for granted. A beautiful course which teaches you about the world :)",
                "I definitely would! The class isn't easy, especially if you aren't very interested in animals, but Casey is such a wonderful professor and makes the class so engaging!",
                "Absolutely!",
                "I would recommend this course to any student with even a passing interest in biodiversity. It's fascinating to learn about the huge diversity of life we share the planet with (even if it can get difficult differentiating between all the different groups of worms). While a solid foundation in biology would help, Casey does set aside some of his lectures to discuss some of the more general concepts needed to understand the course such as phylogenetics.",
                "This was one of the most curiosity-inspiring classes I've ever taken at Yale, and I'm a senior who's taken a lot of classes already.  I felt like I left class every day a bit more in awe of the creatures of the world, and wanting to go out and explore it. \r\n\r\nA big part of why this class is so great was Professor Dunn. Professor Dunn has this contagious enthusiasm for all the animals, which makes the whole experience really engaging. Moreover, it is clear that he genuinely cares about the wellbeing of the students and what the students are getting out of the class. Midway through the semester, Professor Dunn took over half an hour of our lecture time to have a very thoughtful discussion with the class about how the class was going, what assignments/assessments were helpful for learning, and how we think that college courses in general should be structured and graded. Never before have I had a professor be so intentional about getting and listening to student feedback.",
                "Yuhhhhhh",
                "10000%. Professor Dunn has such a great lecturer, and many other non EEB/EVST students in the class found the material very interesting and engaging. I learned so much about all clades of animals (not just insects, don't be fooled!) and I genuinely looked forward to every class."
