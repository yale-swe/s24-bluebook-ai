The workload was very manageable, and it was really helpful to start receiving feedback on my thesis project ideas at the end of junior year.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Cannot think of much other than that the readings were sometimes pretty dense and did not always directly relate to the content discussed during class.",

Professor Menon was the only professor I had that actually asked how students were doing throughout the semester and adjusted the class to reflect the challenges of the semester. It was really wonderful feeling like she actually cared how we were feeling as students.",

While the material may feel a bit dry at times, it's a very effective methods survey course and also allows you to start planning ahead for your senior thesis if you are a junior.",
