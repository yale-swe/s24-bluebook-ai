                "strengths; Ryan was a very clear lecturer and is good at elucidating very complex concepts in a digestible way. This class does a great job covering a VAST amount of ground in terms of human rights theory\/history and lectures felt structured in a very intentional way which is more than I can say for many Yale classes tbh \r\nweaknesses: i honestly think it's hard to feel completely engaged in a class SO broad sometimes, it can feel like there is nothing particular to grasp onto and focus on. we did have discussions sometimes but i think this class could have benefited from that more because the \"discussion\/debate\" format can draw out the issues that are most complex and pressing within human rights. Also I wish there had been a bit more guidance on the final paper",
                "This course was a great introduction to the field, especially for someone who had not studied the subject before. Professor Thoreson is very knowledgeable, understanding, and is genuinely excited about the topics in the course. I liked the weekly reading response assignments and enjoyed writing the final paper.",
                "Strengths: Professor Thoreson and the TFs were GREAT!!!; human rights is a super interesting topic; the class and syllabus were excellently organized; weekly reading load was very manageable; final paper offered a great opportunity for academic explanation\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: weekly reading responses were leniently grades, but not very constructive",
                "Both the lectures and discussion sections for this class were really really thoughtfully put together, delivered, and always were so highly engaging.",
                "We didn't have the opportunity to go in-depth with some of the more interesting subjects, but I think it was a really good survey course to gain a foundational understanding of human rights. The workload was very low, just discussion responses and a final paper, but I really enjoyed the course overall.",
                "The course was strong because it covered topics that were interesting, and the professor and the teaching assistant had the class engage at all times. Itwas never just them speaking to us without inviting feedback.",
                "I think 45% weight for the final paper is a bit much, as there was relatively little guidance for it built into the class. Of course, the professor and TA's were very helpful when students reached out.",
                "Strengths: wide scope of material covered, engaging discussions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: low student engagement, little engagement with readings, little feedback on weekly responses",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Great variety of reading for a very comprehensive perspective of human rights\r\n- Discussion sections were very engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Low student engagement overall (definitely not the professors fault, just a general trend)\r\n- Comparatively, larger sections were much less engaging than smaller ones (I had to attend a smaller one a few times out of necessity). Each student in smaller section presented their own unique perspective on the weeks issues in their response paper, whereas large section was much more general and less personalized.\r\n- I didnt feel like I learned too much about the UN bureaucracy overall, and I would have appreciated an introduction to this topic earlier on"

To me this content could sometimes be a little dry but there were definitely several modules that have stuck with me and I think the class was as good as it could be for an intro-style class",

It definitely gave me the language and the theories to better talk about human rights, a term that is often thrown around but never clearly defined. I think that it was incredibly interesting to me and I really enjoyed learning about it, especially because my section was so good and gave me the opportunity to work through my thoughts and concerns.",
