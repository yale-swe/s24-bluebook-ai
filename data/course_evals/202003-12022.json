                "Weaknesses: The lecture could get dry at times because people didn't want to participate which made it more awkward even for people who did want to participate. A suggestion could be encouraging everyone to get to know each other more at the start of the semester and talk in conversation with each other and not the professor. \r\nStrengths: Whenever we did breakout rooms, I always retained a lot of information.",
                "The strengths were that I learned a lot and appreciated the comprehensive overview of Chinese parks and gardens and the overall conception of nature held by various Chinese people (kings, scholars, government officials, etc.) over time.\r\n\r\nAt times I felt the reading was a bit too much and did not have time to complete all of them. In these cases, I struggled with deciding on which readings to focus on first. \r\n\r\nI thought studying for the midterm was quite helpful for cementing a lot of what we learned. I think it would have felt a bit less overwhelming if we had received the study guide of images\/quotes at the start of the semester, so we could follow along and take notes during lecture\/discussion on the assigned images\/quotes during the semester.",
                "The different lenses through which we examined Chinese gardens were interesting, and the instructor was very open and engaging with each of the students. However, sometimes it was difficult to know what exactly was being evaluated in terms of graded assignments, and some of the content of the midterm seemed a bit unrelated to the material we focused on in class."

                "The material of the course is interesting. However, the readings are often very long and the organization of the class was poor. The mid term materials were posted four days before the mid term and required students to memorize over 200 slides worth of images and quotes in the short time period. The midterm was unnecessarily difficult (may be due to an attempt to prevent cheating because it was over zoom) and not conducive to actually learning but rather quick brute memorization.  There were many projects throughout the semester that were not formal assignments that require a great deal of work outside of the course for a regular class meeting. Classes also often times went over anywhere between 10-20 minuets. Overall, the material of this course is really cool, but don't take it unless you have a great desire to learn about the topic and are prepared to dedicate more time to this course doing busy work than is necessary."
