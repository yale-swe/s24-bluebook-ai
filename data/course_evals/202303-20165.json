                "The course is a wonderful continuation of the French sequence here at Yale. Developed advanced conversation skills through readings, films, and discussions related to a wide variety of subjects related to France and the Francophone world. Developed writing skills further through low-stakes weekly writing assignments and through two written exams. Finally, developed presentation skills in French through the oral examinations and presentation. The course is a truly excellent way to further spoken, written, and reading French in a supportive environment.",
                "I improved my ability to speak in French and write in french. I also learned a lot about french culture. I liked practicing my presenting and writing skills. I took this class so that I could continue to practice my french and it was the perfect class for that.",
                "I obtained a much better understanding of the French language and about French and francophone culture. I also watched a handful of incredible films while improving my French writing, reading, and speaking skills.",
                "After taking this class, I feel that Im finally very comfortable to speak in French, and only in French. I have truly perfected my oral conversation skills and I can talk with a Francophone person about a variety of topics. I now consider myself fluent in French, and ready to undertake any conversation. Ive broaden my vocabulary different topics and Ive also developed the necessary conversation skills. Most importantly, Ive gained valuable insights into French and Francophone culture which is something I love given the fact that Im also European.",
                "My French vocabulary and knowledge of everyday French society was immensely improved by taking this class, and I feel that I am much more knowledgable on real-life issues facing France and French people."

            "comments": [
                "The course is truly a conversational French course as the syllabus suggests. Meeting twice a week, students engage with the professor and other students on topics as wide-ranging as the French government, French history, the international geopolitics and organization of the Francophone world (l'OIF for example), religion (la lacit), and the French educational system. Readings are diverse and interesting -- news articles, a variety of films, short video clips, and songs, just to name a few. The assignments are really well-structured and spaced evenly throughout the semester. The opportunity to speak with Francophones online via TalkAbroad for several assignments is amazing, giving students the ability to practice their spoken French in a low-stakes, interesting way. Finally, Mme Pinzka (the professor) is fantastic. She truly cares for this course and for her students, holding office hours regularly and engaging passionately in every aspect of this course. Her enthusiasm for the course, and her love for teaching, are evident. Also, she knows SO much about every course topic, and provides invaluable feedback (on your writing, speaking, even helping you plan the presentation). \r\n\r\nThere are few, if any, weaknesses to the course. I would have liked to have a few more chances to discuss topics in small groups, but that's a small complaint in what is a clearly well thought-out and executed course.",
                "Strengths: interesing material, good topics, a nice mix of movies, articles, and videos. I liked the discusison format of the class which I felt like allowed me to engage well with teh topics. I really enjoyed our 4 one-on-one conversations with a francophone, especially since it allowed me to talk with non-french people. I enjoyed the mix of different types of assignments like papers, short reflections, questionaires, etc. I also loved how the class was on the smaller side and I made some friends in the class too. I thought that Mme. Pinzka was open and it felt like were discusisng together. I felt like she was pretty approachable. I also loved how organized the class was and I was never confused about the assignment for that day. Prof. Pinzka was also very nice about accomodations which hasn't always been my experince in language classes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The amount of reading was a lot given that we often discussed articles for a few minutes only. It would have been better to have one major reading each class becuase I felt like I was skimming to do all of the reading and that way I could've focused more on specific readings. So either less readings and more focus on them or longer readings becuase I didn't like having so many short readings. I also thought that sometimes certain students took over the discussion and we could've benefited from a more guided discusison. I would have liked a little bit more feedback on how to improve my french.",
                "Strengths: the films were all extremely interesting, each class there were built in opportunities for students to practice their French-speaking abilities, many of the activities we did were extremely fun and intellectually stimulating, there were opportunities for revision and the feedback we received was always very clear.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses!",
                "The discussions in class were priceless, and the instructor was amazing, one of the best professors Ive ever had. She was great and capturing our attention and helping us throughout the films with the biggest strength of this class. They were all very fun and helpful in our learning. The readings were quite a lot though, although all very interesting."

                "Absolutely. FREN 160 is an excellent course to develop spoken French, but also to make meaningful progress in writing, presentation, and reading. Through well thought-out assignments and readings, if you put effort in this course, you will definitely come out a better French speaker and probably make some friends in the course, too!",
                "Yes, if you want to work on your french! I took this class just to practice my french and it definitly did that. Way more speaking heavy than other Yale French classes which I loved. It was not a gut but chill and fun!",
                "Yes! If you are interested in improving your french and learning about France and other francophone countries, I highly recommend. This class is a good amount of work, but I found all of the assignments to be useful. If you have the means to commit to the work, it will pay off. Madame Pinzka was a great professor. She was invested in getting to know all of her students on a personal level, she put in a lot of time to the structure of class each day, and I loved every assignment we had and every film we watched. All in all, I was very satisfied with my FREN 160 experience.",
                "I would recommend this class to a student was already taken in French and knows how to speak, but overall yes I would its a great way to master your conversation skills in French",
                "Yes, absolutely. This class is amazing for any student interested in developing the skills and knowledge necessary to more fluently and freely communicate with French people on a plethora of topics."
