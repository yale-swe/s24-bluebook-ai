                "I gained some new language to discuss the particularities of teaching pedagogy. I was really interested in the readings and they informed some of the other subjects that I work in, especially because many of the readings are treated as \"the basics\" that we're expected to have already read when we go to other classes.",

                "I learned a lot about various theories concerning identity like Critical Race Theory and Queer Feminist Theory. We also did many readings surrounding these topics that opened our minds to different perspectives and struggles.",
                "I was introduced to many theories that I hadn't previously read, and learned how to apply theory to policy. I became a stronger writer and reader, and learned to manage theoretically difficult texts."

            "comments": [
                "I think that it was a mistake to allow so many students to take the course because it felt a lot less like a seminar class. Since the class only met once a week, it was really hard to be held accountable for the content, and many times it was evident that students just did not complete the readings, leading to a pretty unproductive discussion. I really learned how I need to approach classes that meet only once a week because there were so many readings that it was impossible to go through all of them the night before, which is what you're typically able to do for twice-a-week courses. You really have to pace yourself with this class, not just with the readings but also with the assignments. Being able to choose your own deadlines for the course is really helpful and the leniency with due dates was also really appreciated, but I think that it would be valuable to preface that with the fact that studies have shown that when students pick their due dates to be all at the end of the semester they often perform worse.",
                "Strengths: Some of the theory readings were cool\r\nWeaknesses: I did not think the theory was bridged to policy\/practice well at all, which is what was advertised as the main goal of this course. I thought this class was going to be about how theory can explain policy about identity and diversity, not constantly condemning the use of quantitative data to inform policy and arguing that theory should be used as direct evidence in policy. While I think there's some value in having flexible deadlines and types of assignments, I feel like the way it was pulled off in this course did it at the expense of high expectations (for instance, 10% of the total grade was effectively how much we cared about our final projects). As a result, I was not super motivated to put effort into this class, and based on the fact that a significant number of students plagiarized their midterm assignments, I'm going to guess I'm not the only one who felt this way. I also feel like we needed to talk about stakeholders in DEI legislation a lot more because the proposals we put out were often baseless and a lot of them were like oh yeah we just need to abolish everything and also fund things that will fix the problem without knowing 1) what to abolish and 2) what to fund.",
                "Strengths: The subject matter of the course was great and I liked having to do presentations each week for the given readings so that if I could not finish all of them we still got a summary about it. I also liked how it taught us various writing styles like thought pieces, policy briefs, and research reports.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think we could have had more in depth conversations about the readings. I think the class being so big prohibited us from getting to know each other and open up with one another which is vital because we talk about very personal topics. I also think we should have had more discussion questions that we would have to respond to before each class to enforce the readings because I feel like most people did not actually read. I also think the open-ended deadlines were not the best structure for me because I procrastinate but maybe it helped others so I think it should be continued but just revised so that extensions are not given so freely. It also caused me to save a lot for the end so I could not get the feedback I would want.",
                "The professor is extremely accommodating. This was very helpful in the sense that the class was not stressful for me, but it was a little unfortunate to see such low turnout. It worked out in the end because the class started as a very large seminar, so having low attendance facilitated more conversation, but it did feel like a very individual experience as opposed to a class endeavor.",
                "Strengths: Professor Canfield, manageable workload, extremely accommodating strucutre and policies, interesting course materials\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture style class rather than seminar without a change in reading workload, often too large of a class to engage in seminar style discussion, student presentations and icebreakers took up far too much of class time, no real incentive to complete weekly readings"

                "I really like Craig as a professor, which is why I took this course. I had taken Feminist & Queer Theory with him, which was an overwhelmingly positive experience, so I was really sad to find that this class did not yield a similar experience. I know that I'm personally not very interested in this subject and if Craig were not teaching the class, I would not have taken it. There is a lot of room for improvement for this class and I know that Craig is aware of that and keeping that in mind for future iterations of this course.",
                "No. I found myself consistently frustrated by this course, and not in a \"society is screwed and this inspires me to make change\" way.",
                "I definitely would recommend this course because I think we learned important topics that affect all of society and especially affects how we learn as individuals. It is essential that everyone learn through these varying theoretical outlooks and understand how one's identity can affect their entire life and place in society. I also think the coursework itself was a good blend of reading and writing so everyone had to learn at least one thing by the end of the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in theory and policy making. The professor does an excellent job of pushing you to think critically about what policy actually is and how we can make policy with concrete impacts.",
                "I don't think I would. It was an easy, manageable class but it was the type of class that felt like I was wasting my time by attending it. The structure of the class meant that every week the student presentations on that week's readings took up almost half of the entire class time, icebreakers took up an additional quarter, and the remaining quarter was not nearly enough time to engage with readings or concepts, and was often spent discussing course assignments instead. As a result, although readings and course concepts were interesting and important, there was no urgent reason or benefit to completing the readings. By all means take it if you are interested in the course topics because Professor Canfield is a great instructor but if you are expecting something truly engaging and worthwhile I'm not sure this is the class for you.",
