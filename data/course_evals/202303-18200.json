You will be able to think so deeply and critically about aging, ageism, ageism, life expectancy, and their intersections with queerness and disability. The possibilities for what there is to learn and take away from this course feel simply endless. You will get to engage with both conceptual ideas (such as ones of long-term survivorhood, radical modes of care and support, and the politics of archiving) as well as more material ideas (such as LGBTQ senior centers, social security, healthcare). You will walk away with a much more complex understanding of life spans--of the way we conceptualize their progression, of the things that happen within them, of the ways we evolve over them--than you had walking into it. It is not only historically and conceptually fascinating but deeply intimate, and will truly change not only how you think about these concepts theoretically but how you think about your own life: past, present, and future."

                "Strengths: SO many. Professor Herring designs this course so carefully and intentionally, both in terms of the materials we engage with and in the very structure of assignments. There is such a breadth of materials (from incredible documentaries, poetry, and photography to oral histories and book chapters), each chosen with incredible attention to the perspectives, themes, and nuances they evoke. Professor Herring does a spectacular job of helping us reconcile with various types of texts each week and dissect the logic that connects them. He cares so deeply about making sure we each get the most we can out of the readings and that we arrive at a collective consensus about what these readings are telling us, even as we may have somewhat different personal interpretations of / connections to them. The class is also such a community space -- super close-knit and inviting to both silly goofiness (which there was a lot) and vulnerability. The work all felt worthwhile to do -- never busy work -- and I particularly loved the weekly journal entries. Incredible, incredible class. No weaknesses.",
                "readings were phenomenal and syllabus progression made a lot of sense; assignments were fun and not too stressful but also were really good at challenging students to expand their learning and make new connections across readings/topics/etc, class discussion was always enthusiastic and easy to participate in without pressure to say the right/perfect thing"

                "This is my favorite class I've ever taken. It completely changed how I view aging, generations, time, etc. Professor Herring is a gem.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student -- having the space and community to think critically about aging, ageism, longevity, disability, etc. was a truly memorable experience. Professor Herring also works incredibly hard to make this class accessible to a range of backgrounds + majors. There is no expectation of knowledge, only an ask that you come with your full self and ready to engage thoughtfully in conversation.",
                "Absolutely! This course challenged me to think through the intersections of age, class, gender, sexuality, race, and ability; in particular, it was useful for considering the current state of aging in the U.S. and imagining how it might be different. Prof. Herring is an amazing professor who cares deeply about the course content and his students; I would recommend any course of his and have already done so.",
                "Yes for sure. Professor Herring is incredible and the syllabus for this course was so interesting. The classroom environment was so uplifting and conducive to learning, such a fun course."
