                "Grammar and vocab are very thoroughly covered, giving the student all the tools to work with the language after only two classes. The workload is appropriately hard for a 1.5 credit summer class, but the weekend essays and presentations never feel like a waste of time. The exams are fair as well.\r\n\r\nMy one complaint is that the class suffers greatly when some students choose to give less effort, and there seems to be no consequencesin grading or otherwisewhen low-effort work is produced. The class relies greatly on interaction and one bad attitude can be destructive for others. Thankfully, there are also extremely talented and earnest individuals that pull more than the extra weight needed and make Italian at Yale an overall wonderful experience.",
                "The strengths of this course were Anna and Deborah, who are both incredible professors who care so much about their students. The major weakness was just that it was so fast-paced, as it was a condensed summer session. This of course, could not really be avoided, and Anna and Deborah did a great way structuring the class so this did not feel overwhelming.",
                "While there is a high amount of material to cover in a short period of time, the instructors set very realistic expectations which makes class more engaging since students because there is less pressure to get everything right the first time.",
                "This course is well-organized and well-designed for learning. The textbook is detailed and handy, and the professors are good at explaining and taking in questions.",
                "Strength oof the course were engagement and pace of the class. A weakness was the length of each class.",
                "Strengths: many opportunities to increase fluency through assignments\r\nWeaknesses: could be more opportunities to speak in class"

                "I would absolutely recommend not only taking the course, but fully immersing yourself in Italian language and culture for the five (or ten) weeks while you are learning. Find some Italian music. Follow Italian public figures and athletes on instagram. Seek out Italian movies or choose Italian subtitles when possible. You really can learn a great bit of Italian in a very short amount of time when your heart is poured into it. This is really only possible during the summer when you have no other classes to worry about, so don't miss out on this opportunity!",
                "Yes! Italian is such a beautiful course to take, especially at Yale. Professors in the department care so much about teaching you not just the language, but about the beauty and culture of the country. Highly recommend!",
                "Yes absolutely! The faculty is very friendly and energetic which is huge when it comes to an online class. I could only imagine things being even better and engaging in person where people can be more engaged in speaking with all the other nuanced cues when it comes to communication.",
                "Yes",
                "Definitely to those who finished Italian L1. This course is very useful (and necessary) to fill up basic grammars and vocabs in Italian. And the professors are very friendly and are always willing to help even if you may have forgotten things learnt in L1.",
                "Yes; I got more practice speaking and writing in Italian.",
                "I would recommend this course because it was interesting and a lot of fun.",
