    "I learned a lot of the foundational theory and revolutionary studies currently being done in Economics.",
    "I learned a great deal about many of the most notable Nobel Prize-winning economists in history, whilst simultaneously being taught the roots of some of the fundamentals of economics. The topics I learned in this course were directly useful in my other economics courses and allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the lectures of the other econ courses.",
    "Having a good understanding of well-known names in the field of economics. Understanding how economics can combine with psychology and other fields.",
    "By taking this course, I now have many historical and economic insights which can be applied to my everyday experiences. Additionally, I now understand the context in which those ideas were developed.",
    "Listening to others speak",
    "I became familiar with some advanced economic concepts.",
    "A variety of important economic discoveries and ideas, as well as how they appear\/are used in the real world.",
    "I came into this class with very limited knowledge of economics and now feel like I have a basic understanding of many of the most important economic concepts that can apply to many other aspects of my courses and life."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are that it was very well organized and the weekly assignments were very straightforward. The readings were manageable and that was very helpful. I think it would have been better to have received more clear instructions for the final paper but I also could have asked the professor more questions.",
    "Overall, this is a pretty laid back course full of extremely interesting content. There are only a few pages of readings a week, one weekly online quiz that takes about 30 minutes, and a 10-12 page essay due at the end of the course. Very good for students with no prior background in econ to get some idea of some of the most important concepts.",
    "The class was a bit boring as most classes were simply following powerpoints.",
    "In my opinion, this course had no weaknesses.",
    "More problems",
    "It was well balanced.",
    "This course was great. I learned a lot about economics, outside of basic supply and demand principles, leading me to understand how wide the field is.",
    "The strengths of this course are the lectures and the engagement of the professor with the class. The lectures were highly interactive. One weakness off the course would be that the final paper felt a bit rushed at the end and lacked a clear rubric or guidelines."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would. It is very interesting, the professor is very nice, and it is not stressful.",
    "Yes, as this course is extremely interesting and does not require a ton of work.",
    "Yes, Id recommend it if youd like to understand the wider field of economics more.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Learning about different historical perspectives and how those perspectives shaped economic insights, landing some individuals a Nobel prize in economics, is very important. The instructor does an excellent job of communicating many different, yet related, sub-fields of economics in a clear and concise manner.",
    "Yes. Its a relatively light course that teaches some interesting concepts.",
    "Yes. It is a great way to expand your knowledge of the field of economics.",
    "Absolutely, and i already have. Jose was phenomenal and the content was interesting.",
    "Yes! This course was an engaging introduction to important economic concepts."
