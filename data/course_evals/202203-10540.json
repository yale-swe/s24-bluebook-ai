I gained an insight into how the music from these regions has developed over time and how they have influenced world musical trends in general. I also gained an understanding of historical and socio-economic factors that played a role in the development of these musics."

                "This is an awesome class! The course content is interesting, even if some of the readings are a bit long, and you get to listen to some great music!",
                "Strength: the class covers an interesting subject. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The readings were very boring, the same author was assigned almost every week. The structure of the class could be improved: class was supposed to be led by 3 to 5 discussion leaders who explain one reading each for the week. We either did not have enough time to discuss each text in depth or we did not get to all of them. There was also no opportunity to put the texts into conversation with one another. This can be improved by assigning one or two leaders per class and introducing the overall theme, then bringing in each text to give students a better opportunity to discuss. I think the course was supposed to be a seminar, but Professor Veal ends up talking over his students -- sometimes even interrupting them mid sentence. This could be improved by Professor Veal making a sustained effort to allow students to talk. Additionally, to no fault of Professor Veal, the projector/sound equipment in the room did not work for the greater half of the semester. However, Professor Veal could have adapted by either posting the content he wanted share on Canvas or just showing it on a laptop.",
                "Strengths: Professor Veal is a really great teacher and super knowledgeable. The readings were super interesting and not overwhelmingly long. The class itself was pretty chill, with two papers I felt prepared to write. Weaknesses: sometimes class discussion lulled, I feel like I didnt always know what to say, and Professor Veal really wanted us to talk (understandably). There was a little miscommunication too sometimes about readings and due dates, but I didnt mind.",
                "Great course. Weakness was tech issues",
                "A strength of this course is that it gives a comprehensive look into the musical history of two specific nations: Cuba and Jamaica. While these two are the countries who have likely influenced the world's music the most, this also meant that we were not able to talk much about the impact on other countries in the Caribbean. One weakness I felt was that we did not have many visual learning aides (though many times due technical issues), such as slideshows, which would have helped in my learning.",
                "This course went very in-depth with its content; the readings and discussions were consistently engaging. Professor Veal is an absolute expert on the subject and it was fascinating to hear everything he had to say during our class meetings. My only real suggestion for improvement would be that I think it would be better to have a couple more assignments sprinkled throughout the semester instead of having the only two grades be for the midterm and final. I think adding short papers or assignments on a biweekly basis would allow engagement with the material to increase even more."

The music of Cuba and Jamaica is innovative and influential and I think this course gives students the opportunity to study some musical traditions that may be traditionally overlooked in a university setting."
