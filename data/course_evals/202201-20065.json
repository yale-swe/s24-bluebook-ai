                "I CANT READ. This class was hard because it demanded a book a week, Although the books were good and <200 pgs I rarely ever got through the books. The strengths are that the books are all great choices and interesting reads. However I do wish the discussions were a little more guided and that disclaimers are made at the beginning of the class that we do not attack individuals and that this is a safe space. Due to the diversity in topics students very easily identify with different sessions making them very passionate and prone to feeling personally attacked when statements re rebuked. The class has a lot of heavy content, which is good, but we should have more rules about how we talk and respect one another.",

Marcia is an amazing professor and has so much knowledge and empathy to sharethe class will be so interesting to you if you are interested in women's health, medicine in general, addiction, pregnancy, inequality, and more. If you really want to engage in the course, the workload is quite high (a book a week and a few papers) but the books are super interesting and not too difficult to read. Highly recommend",
