                "I learned about representation theory of groups and associative algebras. Representation theory is the study of groups through a homomorphism to a linear map. When a group or algebra is considered as a linear map we can learn a lot of new information about the group or algebra itself.",
                "I developed a really strong understanding of representations and the implications for other areas of mathematics. Additionally, I felt the problem sets challenged me to become a better problem solver and a more mature mathematics student in my ability to digest different ideas and apply them to solving problems.",

But most important, if you have a typical undergrad's background in algebra, this course will give you a lot more maturity in algebra---you'll become familiar with important algebraic constructions, notation, and patterns of thinking.",

This course gave me further insight into this construction. In a broader sense, learning representation theory showed me how to use an unfamiliar mathematical construction to answer all kinds of interesting questions. This class tied together much of group theory and linear algebra, with the classification of Abelian groups, the class equation, orbit-stabilizer theorem, Jordan normal form, generalized eigenspaces, and direct products playing central roles in the study of representations.",

We learned a lot about representations (vector space + group action on the vector space), classifying\/constructing representations, and notable examples, e.g. for S_n. Prof. Loseu talked about some applications, such as to harmonic analysis and Lie groups. Later on we talked about algebras (vector space with multiplication) and skew fields. My sense is that this kinda continues down the path of abstract algebra after Math 350.",

            "comments": [
                "The material is pretty cool, but Loseu is the principal strength of this course.  His lecturing is incredibly clear and organized, he always posts his notes ahead of time and they are great, psets are of a reasonable difficulty and usually pretty interesting results, and office hours are plentiful.  He's also just a very funny guy and entertaining lecturer.  He even posts notes for 'bonus lectures' and additional sections of the real lectures, which aren't necessary at all but give cool results for students who might have more background.  There aren't really any major weaknesses.",
                "I thought a strength of the course were the lecture notes that Professor Loseu posted. These were comprehensive and allowed me to go through the course at my own pace. I thought that the lecture itself was somewhat hard to follow at times and became very technical, but I may have just been a little bit unprepared.",
                "The course overall was excellent and was well organized. At times it went a bit too fast. The section on combinatorics was a bit too fast and confusing so the proof of the classification for the irreducible representations of S_n is still a bit obscure.",
                "This course was very dry and abstract. I found it interesting, but many of the proofs are a slog.",
                "Strengths: subject is interesting and results are good. Psets and exams are fair and not too much work\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some lectures are a bit dry because you have to define a lot of things",
                "Strengths: Lectures were very clear and the lecture notes were super helpful. Weaknesses: The problem sets sometimes didn't feel super related to the lecture content. There was also little grade differentiation outside of the take-home final; I wish the midterm had been a little more difficult (it was a complete joke) and then the final easier. The graders also didn't quite seem to know what they were doing. They often missed things in the problem sets that were completely and wrong, and there was also the issue of one of the grades grading more harshly than the other, so half the alphabet suffered a bit.",
                "Strengths: Extremely well-organized, great lecturer, very clear, detailed course notes, easy-to-use course website, fascinating subject material, cool problem sets. Weaknesses: I'm not sure most students learned much from seeing the combinatorics behind the representations of the symmetric groups---I know it's nice to see the complete proof, but it was just a bit too much to try to fit in.",
                "Strengths: I thought the material was extremely challenging and engaging\/interesting. At the same time, the grading was very fair and this created a very collaborative environment where we were encouraged to work very hard, but the grading was relatively light so this minimized stress. Also, Professor Loseu is extremely intelligent and his lectures are wonderfully organized and presented. Im his office hours, he would always try to help me to understand and figure out the problem rather than just giving me the answer. Overall, I dont think this course had any weaknesses.",
                "This is a very strong course, with interesting and applicable subject matter. The pace of the course was tough but manageable, and the course was structured to facilitate learning. The biggest area of improvement would be finding a textbook that doesn't treat every important result as trivial!",
                "Very well organized and documented, lectures very clear, homework was rewarding but at times challenging",
                "Lecture was very clear though perhaps a bit too quick. The notes were an invaluable resource for going over what I missed. It would have been helpful to have more resources (though not necessarily class time) dedicated towards more traditional approaches to modules and commutative algebra, since the language we used was rather idiosyncratic. Psets also didnt always feel like they were related to class material. I sometimes found myself doing combinatorics or group theory for most of a pset.",
                "Strengths: Great content--rep theory is surprisingly not that definition-y\/nitpicky for an introductory algebra course. Ivan's psets were great. The exams were very reasonable. Weaknesses: Lectures went too fast and could be very dry. The grader didn't give clear feedback.",
                "Strengths: professor Loseu has impeccable organization. The lectures are well structured, the flow of topics made sense, he always posted detailed lecture notes. Two things I really appreciated: 1) professor Loseu made problem sets have between 12-13 points, with final score being min(your score, 10), which I felt was very generous and made me engage more with the content than worrying overly much about the points; 2) professor Loseu intermittently sent out feedback forms and looked at the feedback. I also appreciated professor Loseu making lots of connections to different areas of math, e.g. harmonic analysis. Weaknesses: this is more a matter of personal taste, but some of the topics I found not very stimulating, e.g. we spent a couple of lectures just doing combinatorics in order to prove a result about representations of S_n; I felt like some of the content mentioned in passing\/in the bonus lectures - e.g. reflection groups or things with respect to Lie algebras - could've been explored further if it had been possible. I felt that some of the abstractions were a bit hard to reckon with at times, and more concrete examples would've helped, for example with tensor products (I appreciated that professor Loseu did more of these as time went on, which I think may have been because of the feedback forms).",
                "I feel like the prerequisite for truly understanding this course, and many of the bonus lectures, should include Math 380. I feel like many concepts were hard to follow because I didn't have sufficient algebra background. Having more prerequisite for this course would prepare students better, and allow the class to run more smoothly as the collective class has a stronger background.",

                "Yes - the material is very cool and Loseu is very good.  If you have a free slot, take this course.  Representation theory is also used in lots of other places like group theory and topology and quantum mechanics and more.\r\n\r\nNot at all necessary, but you might get a little more out of it if you've taken 380; for example, you'll notice when Ind and Res are adjoint functors, and in general you'll have a firmer understanding of modules and tensor products.  There's also content in the bonus lecturs that requires 380, but these are really very strictly optional.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who has taken a few advanced courses in algebra before or is ready to put in a lot of work to understand the material. I had only taken 350 and took 370 concurrently and felt that a lot of things in the class were too difficult for me to understand fully. I think that the students who had taken 380 before were much more comfortable with the material and had to put in a lot less work to follow along.",
                "Absolutely. I learned a great deal from this course and was able to make a lot of connections to other areas of mathematics.",
                "Yes definitely! Losev is a great lecturer and his explanations are always clear",
                "Only if you have taken 380\/500 (algebra). It really should be a more explicit prerequisite; I felt entirely lost often because I didn't have the necessary algebra knowledge. Otherwise, the content is pretty cool! Psets were biweekly and super time-consuming and difficult. If you are a procrastinator, you will struggle a lot, on the more difficult ones I easily sank 30+ hours into them just trying to solve the problems (may have been partially due to lack of algebra preparation), but it's hard to do that across tue\/wed\/thu every other week. The take home final also took a long time, which was difficult to balance during reading week.",
                "Yes! This was the best math course I've taken at Yale. If you enjoy algebra you'll love this course! It's challenging and requires intense focus, especially during lectures, which move fast. But Professor Losev does a great job making the material crystal clear if you put in effort to keep up during lectures---it pays off, and you'll learn and grow a lot.",
                "Don't take this class",
                "Yes, if you have any interest in representation theory, then this class was a wonderful introduction to the subject.",
                "I have recommended this course to many of my friends. However, I don't think this course would be enjoyable for someone without significant preparation in proof-based math and group theory. Students are expected to be fluent in the basic concepts of group and ring theory such as quotient groups and the isomorphism theorems.",
                "Yes, get to play around with a lot of cool problems in algebra and the Professor is very good at both teaching and assigning satisfying questions to think about",
                "Absolutely would recommend to any student studying mathematics. The course offers a very clear and accessible introduction to a field of math with applications in everything from analysis to topology to algebra.",
                "Yes, if you're an algebra person or a quantum physics person or pursuing an intensive math major, this is a good class for you.",
                "This is another course down the algebra pipeline; the closest analog I can think of is perhaps Math 370 (Galois theory), which is another natural continuation of Math 350\/abstract algebra. I think that this class is perhaps more of a stepping stone\/toolkit for further algebra down the line, or for looking at the world as an algebraist, while I didn't quite get the sense that it broke a lot of ground in terms of showing new results; i.e., the main point of it was to get us to be comfortable with representations, rather than apply them to solve problems. This isn't a criticism, just a sense of what I got out of the class. I might contrast this with 370, for example: I felt that in 370 we spent a little time building up the technical theory, and then went and used them to say things about constructability\/solving polynomial equations\/finite fields\/etc. - So if you're looking to use representation theory\/doing more algebra in the future (which, by the number of things professor Loseu mentioned, it's used quite a bunch in general), and want it in your toolkit, then I would recommend this class. Professor Loseu is also a great professor, and I thought that he structured the class to make me focus less on grades and more on the content, so I got a lot out of it.",
                "This is by far the hardest class I've taken at this school. I wouldn't recommend students taking this class unless they wish to suffer for the whole semester.",
                "Yes, the course contains foundational knowledge. I believe it was a good introduction to the topic.",
