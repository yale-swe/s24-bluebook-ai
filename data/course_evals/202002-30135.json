    "I learnt how to write better and to edit my writing.",
    "Writing and revising a series of essays combining personal experience and larger public points.",
    "read pieces from & dove into the realm of nonfiction essay writing. an incredibly interesting class  not only did i become a more effective writer and a more insightful reader, i learned a lot about myself in the process :)",
    "How to make edits and not be afraid to change up huge chucks of the essay. How to read before starting to write. How to take ten different perspectives and contradicting criticisms and make the best edits you can out of it.",
    "I received insights about the persuasion tactics used to make a solid argument in a paper. But we're not talking about your typical intro, 3 body arguments, and a conclusion. It was a real challenge to get outside my comfort zone and write for specific style. I'm very glad I did it. I definitely appreciate the beauty of writing a lot more now.",
    "I definitely gained a lot from this course as I've seen my writing develop over my 4 different essays. I also learned how to better approach nonfiction texts and how to extract meaning from them.",
    "Developed a more critical eye for journalistic readings and improved on self-critique (reading my own work objectively and editing with an audience in mind).",
    "Creative nonfiction writing.",
    "This course helped me to improve my personal essay writing technique through focus on public significance, tone, style, etc."

   "comments": [
    "I loved this course, and I think that it works in the online format very well.",
    "I absolutely loved the readings. I thought they were interesting, great examples of each style were were practicing, and relevant to today's issues. Part of me wishes that we've each gotten more workshop experiences, but summer courses are so tight that it's in the nature for us to be a little rushed, and that's okay. I think this class ran as best as it could given the amount of time that we had, and I enjoyed it and was much more engaged in it than many classes I've had before.",
    "The strengths of this class are the workshopping\/ pear review. Students have to face criticism and also give feedback about how to improve a paper. It's a  powerful process to be apart of. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were the restrictions to zoom. English classes are about comfort and familiarity, so it was challenging to develop a class bond from remote locations.",
    "The strengths are that the readings are all very engaging and the conversations we have in class really help us see the pieces and our writings from different perspectives. In addition, having your essays read by the rest of the class was beyond helpful in the writing process. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "Strengths: the readings were engaging, and class discussions were generally very open and productive. \r\nWeaknesses: I would've liked more optional readings to consider more examples in each genre. Written feedback to peers sometimes felt a bit unnecessary after lengthy class discussions - I often felt as if I was just repeating things we'd already discussed. Many of the readings came from similar sources (NYT, the New Yorker), and were therefore geared for similar audiences - it might've been nice to have a few more from other publications (possibly international\/smaller sources as well).",
    "It was great.",
    "The course is well structured and very organized. The readings were interesting and the essays were doable length, while still challenging. I would've liked even more breakout-room time to interact more directly with my peers."

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend this class especially if you are looking for an engaging writing credit.",
    "Yes! Dean Hill is a fantastic prof, and the course is super fun.",
    "yes. useful and interesting.",
    "Absolutely. It's a great class to learn how to give and take criticisms, and to learn nonacademic writing. I had a lot of fun, especially because all my classmates were so engaged. I was nervous before taking this course because I felt that everyone at Yale would be super advanced at writing, but there were multiple people who told me that ENGL 120 is a great writing to class to take. I am in complete agreement.",
    "Absolutely, it's a class that forces you to get better at writing through repetition and revision. I feel 10x more confident in the ability to cohesively articulate my beliefs. I think will come in handy as I move into a world where there are so many perspectives being brought to the table. How can dig out the important parts and find common ground?",
    "Yes for sure, this was the best course I have taken at Yale so far. It's not the easiest course, but if you put the work into it, you get so much out of it and the readings are so engaging.",
    "Definitely recommend to anyone with an interest in writing non-fiction personal essays - but this probably isn't for everyone. You need to be prepared to think deeply and share personal experiences, and develop a creative voice different to the usual style of academic writing you'll use in other courses. I found this exciting, but it might not be for you.",
    "Yes.",
    "Very much so. It was interesting, fun, and helped me enjoy writing!"
