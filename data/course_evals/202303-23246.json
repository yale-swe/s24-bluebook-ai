Having to print out the note slides made it hard to take in some of what was being taught, and only in rewriting my notes a second or third time helped to solidify what I had learned. Additionally, I really struggled with having problem sets due the Tuesday before the two first Thursday exams. The close proximity of these events plus not receiving feedback on the assignments before the exam shortened the adequate time I felt I had to prepare for the exams. I did appreciate the way in which the notes were given though, as the walkthroughs from equations and diagrams were extremely detailed and descriptive."

However, I think the mixture of the teaching and the overall subject matter are important for potential careers in environmental engineering. And while this course was extremely heavy on mass balance and math, the connections to municipal water treatment helps provide context and gives a greater understanding of how society functions."
