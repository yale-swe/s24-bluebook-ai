    "I learned about the history of classicism and the many different ways it has been utilized and shaped culture and history.   My ability to utilize vocabulary and analyze works was greatly improved.",
    "I learned about the nuanced legacy of classicism in relation to other topics. The reading responses helped me improve my reading, writing, and organizational skills.",
    "I learned so much during this course about classicism and beyond Im very fortunate I decided to take it. It was a great decision to take this class because it informed me about a diversity of things about aesthetics and art and history.",
    "I learned so much about Classical art through the lens of the modern academic discipline of the classics. I also learned a lot about modern western understandings and misconceptions of the classics.",
    "A much deeper understanding of classicism and how we have come to use it through the centuries. Also, learned some basic art terms and classical art knowledge.",
    "Understanding the transtemporal nature of classical art and how it has been used for all sorts of purposes over time, both nefarious and innocuous.",
    "As a student of Classics for many years, I feel this course helped bolster my cumulative knowledge of the subjects modern implications, which is precisely why I enrolled. Prior to my participation in this course, I had been questioning the roots of my interest in the subject of antiquity and the Classics, and Classicism and Its Controversies was instrumental to my understanding of why I gravitate towards these subjects; they remain relevant and integral to our understanding of modernity. The class revealed to me the importance of listening with intention before responding with my own thoughts, and the supportive environment made me feel both heard and respected.",
    "Gained a better appreciation at how to analyze classical art critically.",
    "Critical engagement with the Classical legacy beyond the privilege typically associated with studying areas like Roman art and Latin language",
    "I learned about visual analysis and thinking about politics and art."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this course was well designed and the assignments and readings well chosen for reasonable length and maximum engagement.",
    "I thought the course was generally strong. I enjoyed the in-class discussions, wide variety of reading topics, and assignment structures. However, I think that class could be made a bit more productive if it were more structured. It might be helpful to create some sort of agenda (maybe students could contribute to it) so that we stayed on task and covered as much as possible in limited time.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Ferando was absolutely amazing and all the readings were so interesting. All the assignments were pretty enjoyable and really helped apply the concepts we were learning in class each week.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The classes could feel a bit unstructured at times, but I think that was more a consequence of allowing students to talk\/ask about the things that were interesting to them which was definitely positive. Overall, this was an exceptional course with very few weaknesses.",
    "The main weakness was just that there was so much material to cover in a very short amount of time. We had a lot of reading for each class but only 1.5 hours to discuss. I think that either increasing the length of each class meeting or decreasing the amount of reading would have remedied this issue. Also there were reading responses and short papers due each week in addition to a final so it felt like in the assignments we were only skimming the surface and that I was always just rushing through everything. I think that instead if there was a reading response for each class and three longer assignments that could allow students to dive more deeply. \r\n\r\nThe strengths were that the assignments were super interesting, the readings very engaging and always made me think of things in a completely new way. Furthermore, the professor and teach assistant helped foster a super great class environment. Everyone felt comfortable sharing and each student's thoughts were talked about equally.",
    "Amazing content and readings. Professor Ferando is fantastic and great at facilitating engaging conversations. The TA left super insightful comments as well.",
    "The major strength is that Professor Ferando is an amazing professor and she was also able to adapt the course well to an exclusively online learning environment. Professor Ferando is really good at prompting students to stay engaged and talk in class. The course is also really well organized! Its a lot of work, but youre very aware of the deadlines and expectations from the beginning so its definitely feasible to get it all done in time.",
    "Because we were assigned many lengthy readings, we were not able to discuss all of them. Perhaps, longer class times would be helpful. Overall, the course was informative, relevant, and engaging. The subject matter was often difficult to grapple with, but the conversations  surrounding it were always respectful and handled with the utmost care by the students. As a high-school student, I worried that the class might be a lecture style that I was unaccustomed to, but those fears were dispelled by the discussion based style of the course. I felt welcomed by the other students and enjoyed engaging in discourse with them throughout the five weeks.",
    "Strengths: interesting subject\r\nWeaknesses: not much feedback given",
    "I think the class was structured brilliantly! I think I learned more than in my other summer class (a \"traditional\" suite of reading response, 4-5 page essay, and longer final paper) because the breadth of shorter assignments both allowed me to think about a breadth of topics and sharpen my analysis\/writing. \r\n\r\nThe one thing I would have liked was more practice in visual analysis, especially in a class with few art history majors. Maybe weekly sections, or hewing more to a powerpoint of art objects as we discuss the reading (start from the art to the readings and not vice versa)."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, Dean\/Professor Ferando is excellent and engaging.  She is passionate about the material and makes class very enjoyable and informative.",
    "Yes, absolutely. With classicism being so ingrained and unavoidable in our society, especially at Yale, understanding the structures and ideologies that underlie it was eye-opening. The professor and TF were fantastic, the readings were interesting, and the short yet frequent writing assignments made the course move at a nice pace.",
    "I already have recommended this class to many of my friends at Yale because theres little overlap between this class and any other at Yale. What I mean is that the million things I learned in this class I hadnt encountered any other classes. It was a great experience because it was mostly new territory for me and I learned so much.",
    "If you have the opportunity to take this course, you definitely should! Prof. Ferando is a joy to learn from and each class is so different, yet so informative. I truly walked away with an understanding of classicism that I had never thought of before.",
    "Yes! It was a really unique way to learn both about Classicism and the Western understandings of classically influenced ideas such as race, gender, and the state.",
    "Fantastic class! Really gets you thinking about why we have the ideas we do about classicism and antiquity. Very important if you have an interest in art, latin, or the classics, as it gives you the context to understand how classicism has been manipulated over history.",
    "Yes, the course subject is relevant outside of even the history of art and Professor Ferando is a great professor.",
    "Yes. This course was extremely important to my perception of a prior interest of mine that I had once viewed one dimensionally. The readings contained a diversity of opinion and style, and the written assignments challenged me to formulate my own hypotheses about subjects that I had once felt intimidated by. The condensed nature of the course facilitated a rigorous commitment to contribution in class conversations about each subject, and the chronology of each week was organized and clear. This course was an amazing opportunity to immerse myself in a new-found passion of mine and share that experience with other students.",
    "Yes, it's a really interesting topic. You might want to take an introductory classical art course first.",
    "Yes! I would also like to take this space to commend TF Webley for all his work throughout this course",
    "Yes! I learned about a lot of material and ways of thinking in a way that didn't feel onerous in an online and condensed period!"
