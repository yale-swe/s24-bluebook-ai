                "I learned formalisms and techniques of quantum mechanics relevant for quantum chemistry. For me, the first half of the course was a review of quantum mechanical systems that I had already seen (particle in a box, particle in a finite well, harmonic oscillator, rigid rotor), while the second half of the course went more deeply into advanced topics in quantum chemistry (hydrogen atom, variational theorem, perturbation theory, Hartree Fock, Configuration Interaction). This course is essential for my graduate studies and did a great job of introducing me to formalisms and theories that are directly relevant to my research. The course emphasizes concepts over technical math which feels like the appropriate way to introduce quantum chemistry to graduate students.",

Very undergraduate style instead of discussion based - which was the expectation since we can learn the material from the book. A reverse classroom setting would be much more useful. The topic is harder to apply in varied settings and that is the portion that is important to discuss and ask advice about how to solve and reason through.",
