Darwall is great at letting us do real philosophy while always staying close to the actual history. You'll learn about the issue at real depth, and come away with a much more nuanced view than you initially held (I promise!).",

                "It's well structured, you learn a lot, Darwall is great at managing discussion, and he's a fair grader. Only thing is sometimes we were assigned perhaps an unreasonably high amount of reading, but usually it wasn't too difficult if so.",
                "This course was really strengthened by Professor Darwall and the other students. Discussions were lively and enlightening. I think that the reading load was sometimes intimidating, but Professor Darwall did occasionally adapt it. I might have liked for there to be a word limit on the weekly reading responses because this sometimes felt competitive but not always substantive.",
                "Hard to think of improvements. A wonderful classroom community even with the constraints of being virtual.",

                "A comprehensive overview of the history of race relations in the United States and of theories of justice, equality, and reparations.",
                "This course is excellent and I have few comments for how it could be improved. I liked the structure: how we began with foundational theories from Locke and Mills, and moved to historical study before ending on the reparations arguments proposed by various thinkers.",
                "Strengths: meaningful discussions! This class is entirely discussion based and twice a week half the class prepares discussion questions to lead the seminar. Further, diverse readings historically (covering history of American slavery to Jim Crow to mass incarceration) philosophically, (covering Locke to Rawls to Mills; arguments for and against reparations)\r\nWeaknesses: by the nature of the classs philosophically dense material, we didnt get to fully deconstruct and dissect certain important arguments",
                "The course is very strong. Professor Darwall is excellent and the issue is important, interesting, and in a place where we can make meaningful contributions (unlike some more traditional philosophical concepts). The only weakness for me was the amount of reading: I found it to be difficult to keep up with the readings, especially during the history-focused portion of the coursewhile I understand that there is a large amount of information, and that the topic deserves more attention and respect (which may justify a higher reading load), I found it to be prohibitive."

It warmed the class atmosphere and reminded us we are in dialogue with each other. Check-ins, frequent back-and-forth seminar discussion, and attentive listening on the part of the professor and students created an intimate seminar environment that mimicked in-person seminars.",

                "The added break was very appreciated. The Fall semester was grueling without breaksProfessor Darwall cancelling one class during the middle of the semester was great and helped with my burnout in this and other courses."

                "PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE. not unreasonably difficult grading, intriguing subject, and you get to take it with Darwall! Especially good for EPE majors: it's the only class in the whole major that allows you to actually use normative theorizing and the tools of social science in a robust way. You also feel pretty free to share your genuine opinions and ideas as you see them. Yale classes are almost always overly restrictive in what's an acceptable idea, or they're filled with people who just want to troll and \"play devils advocate for a second\" to be provocative for no reason. Darwall created an environment where people could speak their minds, but so long as they were genuine about what they thought and why. I've never seen this in another Yale class. Also: you are really encouraged to think for yourself in the papers, which is huge. Not just \"react to this or that idea\". This has gotta be one of the best seminars yale offers.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. Professor Darwall is very kind and thoughtful and put together a fantastic syllabus. He really is able to draw out students' ideas and the material, and the discussion of reparations was very fascinating and relevant.",
                "Absolutely! Allowed for a thorough examination of engaging topics.",
