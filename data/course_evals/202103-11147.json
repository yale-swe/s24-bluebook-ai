                "I learned a lot about the different consequences of globalization in various Hispanophone contexts. I also learned how a Western perspective often misjudges those effects.",
                "I learned how to discuss loftier topics (i.e. philosophy, politics, etc) in Spanish, honed my StoryMaps skills, learned how to critique maps and art in Spanish, helped with conversational Spanish",
                "The strength of the course was the implementation of multimodality. Unlike other courses where projects consist of long essays or sit-down exams, this course focuses on research through the use of StoryMaps, readings, presentations, videos, images, etc. Learning how to research and present in another form rather than the accustomed essay is a skill I greatly learned in this course.",
                "This class taught me so much. Not only did it elevate my language skills in different fields (art, literature, philosophy, etc) but greatly increased my knowledge about the world as a whole. Readings were paired with philosophical texts and artworks to facilitate complete comprehension of difficult to grasp concepts. Learned how to be a better student and a better human!!",
                "I learned a lot about history and current events from across the Spanish-speaking world that also shaped how I view global systems and racial formations more broadly. My confidence speaking Spanish and discussing topics around migration, colonization, and race definitely improved as well.",
                "I learned to view texts from different points of views and compare perspectives in order to see different sides of one story. I also learned to apply key terms and concepts of the class to the different texts that we were viewing/reading. One key insight I gained is that we must do our best to leverage our privilege as Yale students and utilize our education for the betterment of society, specifically for marginalized groups worldwide. Another insight that I found valuable is that ongoing systems of globalization, borders, and capitalism have real and significant impacts on BIPOC communities, and these perspectives are the most important to highlight.",

                "Strengths: Great opportunity to develop your Spanish speaking and listening skills with very low stakes. The topic was interesting. The class discussion helped me to broaden my perspective. She grades well, and she allows for revisions.\r\nWeaknesses: The final project was terrible. When we started the final project in the middle of the semester, I immediately stopped learning as all the time I could put into the class went into the final project. I also did not know what exactly she wanted during that final project. Also, since it was her first-time teaching, it seemed like at times she planned for a little too much, so some classes felt rushed. (I think she will fix these weaknesses next semester.)",
                "very organized and great content, great class discussions, but the assignments were sometime tedious",
                "The strengths are the way in which the course was organized, Prof. Najeras vast knowledge on these topics, and the different ways to participate. This course had no weaknesses, besides maybe being a bit written-work-heavy.",
                "Strengths: using StoryMaps instead of papers, the team spirit amongst classmates, opportunities to discuss with neighbors, second chances on assignments\r\nWeaknesses: it was often unclear what was expected of us for assignments",
                "A great strength of the course was that the majority of the students had a personal connection to the overall theme/topic. Not only did we analyze academic, historical, and fictional texts/videos, but my classmates and I brought personal anecdotes and experiences that enriched the conversation.",
                "Strengths: Very engaging. The class flowed cohesively and was very tied to the cultures of the different areas we were studying. It taught me all about the history, but from the perspective of the people from different countries. The class was structured in a way that prompted engagement (discussion) and kept ideas fresh on our minds (weekly journal entries). No stressful tests but fun projects!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lulled a bit in the middle but just because the material felt similar to before (old historical paintings, dense philosophy, etc). Was made better by good discussion but it was hard to interpret some texts without guidance.",
                "I appreciated the opportunity to talk about hispanophone cultures in Spanish, it definitely allowed us to directly engage with the cultures and people we were learning about. However, at times the focus of the class became a little too much on reading comprehension and Spanish language ability. For example for assignments there would be much more feedback on grammar and spelling errors rather than the content. The class had a range of Spanish-ability and I benefited from the recapping the major points of the more difficult readings, but often this meant there was less time for us to analyze the readings and discuss our own opinions. The need to summarize/review the readings during class was mainly for the more abstract theory-based readings that presented difficult concepts. Personally, I enjoyed the readings that were more grounded in history or related to current events. I also found that these topics were easier to understand as a non-native Spanish speaker, and would have liked more of this focus. I also really appreciated that many of the \"readings\" in this class were not just written prose, I loved the inclusion of videos, poetry, and murals - this was a really engaging way to discuss the concepts of the course. Perhaps including more of these multi-media readings would be a good improvement. I also would be interested to discuss Spanish-speaking cultures with relation to the US, especially the US-Mexico border, which was not a major topic covered in this class.",
                "I like how our class in particular was able to create a comfortable community where we didn't feel bad about ourselves when we made mistakes; the class environment emphasized collaborative efforts. I also liked when we led our own group discussions rather than having the professor lead them. I loved most of the texts we read, though some of them, such as Rey and other philosophical texts, were difficult of understand without any context or any glossary with clear definitions of key terms. One weakness of the class was that for some texts, we would spend a lot of time discussing, but then that left little time to discuss other readings. Furthermore, some sources weren't even discussed in class and when they were, the discussions were just surface-level in order to not get behind on texts we would evaluate for the next class. I recommend dividing the time more efficiently, though I do understand that some texts really do need that time because they are so extensive. Another weakness was that we didn't have an example to follow for the pre-draft practice, so everyone was confused and we weren't sure what we were doing. Another weakness was that the final project was way too rushed. Each part of the project needed a lot of time and preparation to complete, and and had little time to complete them. Moreover, when we were done completing one phase of the project, then it was onto another phase that was due in a few days. I recommend spreading out the project more to allow for more time for completion of the individual phases.",
                "Strengths of the course were definitely the professor's organization of the Canvas site and syllabus, the range of texts that we looked at, and the reflections we did in our cuaderno. I would have appreciated a bit more depth than breadth when discussing the texts."

I also wanted to improve my Spanish, and this felt like a great class to do so as the stakes were low (my grade wouldn't be impacted as I was developing my Spanish skills). However, the final project was terrible and greatly took away from the learning experience since when that project started (mid way through the semester) my learning about boarders and globalization completely stopped, and I began to dislike the class. Also, some assignments felt redundant. That being said, this was her first time teaching this course and she truly loves it. For this reason, after seeing our feedback, I think that these issues will be adequately addressed for next semester.",
                "yes, a great content course! the work was a bit tedious at times but ver unique, especially due to the focus on multimodal learning (which means no boring essays that will just it in your google drive after your write them!!)",
                "Absolutely",
                "Maybe. If you have impeccable Spanish, then you're going to enjoy the course. The content is interesting, and I definitely learned a lot about Latin American culture. But if you are not super comfortable with your Spanish abilities, this class might be a lot. Matters are worsened when the professor is not great at reacting to quieter students. There are also a lot of random assignments in preparation for the final project. The professor gave competing instructions for it, so everyone was often confused with what was expected of them. Ultimately, content-wise, the course is really interesting, but if you want an easy L5 class, there are easier classes out there. However, this was the first iteration of the course, so maybe it'll be better in the future.",
                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely. What a fascinating course in which this was the first semester being taught. I am sure the course will improve and be even more appealing to any student.",
                "Yes! I learned so much about my place in the world (going to this institution) and how I can use my academic background to critically analyze borders. We also discussed the nuances of borders as they are usually not physical and sometimes beneficial. Seeing how they are created is also so interesting. High praise for this class!",
                "Yes! Most of the readings are engaging, and I learned about key terms that I see myself applying to my life. The final project does require a lot of work and preparation but it's nice that the project is divided into phases. Profesora Njera also provides a lot of feedback, but at times, it seemed like it was way too much and we had little time to implement the feedback. If you are looking for a gut L5 Spanish class, then no. Out of all the classes I had this semester, this class had the most work."
