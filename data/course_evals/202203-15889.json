                "I developed the ability to work with classmates in order to get through assignments I was struggling with on my own. I also learned how to balance missing classes due to medical reasons with keeping in touch with my professor to try and stay successful.",
                "A greater understanding of calculus, specially of sequences and series",
                "I learned how to integrate different functions and all of the different applications of integration",
                "I gained the ability to attack different integrals and series with a variety of techniques. My professor was quick to define what was real-world applicable after we learned each skill, and the idea of Taylor polynomials being so applicable really enhanced my understanding and willingness to understand.",
                "Methods of integration, series, and an introduction to polar and parametric graphs.",
                "I learned a greater depth of the calculus that I had learned in high school.",
                "I was able to learn about fundamental Calculus II concepts through learning inside and outside of the classroom. The focus was on integration.",
                "A deeper understanding of Calculus Two. I also learned a lot about how to effectively study for math exams.",
                "I gained a deeper appreciation for calculus. Unlike Calc BC taught at my highschool, Math 115 was more application based and required me to make use of concepts at a more advanced level. Through Math 115, I think I have developed the skill to think about and apply math more creatively.",
                "I developed skills for approaching challenging math problems with skills we learned in class. Refreshing my knowledge of integral calculus and series was very helpful.",
                "Through this course I was able to further my knowledge in calculus. Some of which was familiar from high school, such as integration techniques, while others like polar and parametric forms were totally new.",
                "This course was effective in teaching me that consistency and time management is very important. The number of small, regular assignements taught me that I needed to have a plan to accomplish each exercise in advance. Also, I learnt to take advantage of Yale resources, prompted by the Learning Analysis and I started using the peer tutors more and more.",
                "Aside from the course content, this class helped me develop the skill of staying on top of due dates, as there were quizzes due before class. Although I found these quizzes useful, I found that sometimes classes were conducted in a way that assumed you had a strong understanding of the quiz content, even when this may not have been the case."

            "comments": [
                "This class was taught very differently than I would have imagined for a math class. This class has so many resources like peer tutoring and available office hours but in the classroom, the class is taught quite poorly.",
                "From talking to many people across the various section of Math 115, if you had any professor other than Rachel, you were really struggling. There were varying levels of the quality of the professors/sections, but she is the only professor who explained things in a way that everyone understood. It would be better off taught as a lecture with her as the sole professor. A strength of the class is the review sessions available to aid students before exams.",
                "The course was effective at conveying the material but less effective at making the material feel engaging. My professor did much work to fix the latter issue, but the course design itself makes it hard.",
                "The main weakness of this course is that your experience is very dependent on what teacher you get. Some teachers are much more invested than others and provide their students with a lot more guidance and resources. Personally I felt like I was teaching myself everything and in class we would only go over examples which was not that helpful for my learning style.",
                "I was not a fan of the explorations due before class, mostly because they were tedious more than helpful. I will say, the structure of the class was perfect. 20-30 students in each section was a perfect number to learn.",
                "Strengths: well organized, moderate time commitment, a plethora of help available. \r\nWeaknesses: a lot of grade weight placed on exams.",
                "I think making the lessons more uniform across instructors would be beneficial to student learning.",
                "I think that there is a great difference between the experience of different sections of the course. Some classes had note packets for each week that I believe made learning easier and more clear (as I learned through having a substitute professor).",
                "The course was structured well.",
                "A strength is that extra help resources were very accessible and helpful. \r\nA weakness is that the problem set material often feels very different than what we are tested on. Additionally, I felt like I had to do a lot of the actual learning outside of the classroom and with the peer tutors.",
                "I felt like I thought the explorations were really informative as well as the peer tutoring sessions and review sessions, but I was always scrambling last minute to learn everything. I think some teachers gave packets out to students during the lessons with extra questions to look back on. I think if my teacher had employed this method, the course would have been a lot easier for me.",
                "This course could be improved by more consistent teaching across different instructors of different sections. My instructor had a very loose teaching style that was not strict to exam content whereas when another instructor subbed in one time, we were given detailed notes and example problems to follow along with which was extremely helpful.",
                "Strengths: Office hours are always helpful!\r\nWeaknesses: Oftentimes, there are no videos prior to the explorations making it difficult to understand the focus of the exploration.",
                "The quality of teaching varied so much among the different instructors.",
                "Strengths include having many resources for students to understand concepts they are not sure about, but a weakness was engaging students in class.",
                "A strength of the class were that problem sets helped me practice my knowledge. A weakness was that the class didn't feel very collaborative or engaging, so more group work could help with that.",
                "Since it is a big course I think its organization was very well. For instance, I think the review sessions held before exams were very useful.",
                "Strength: - Lots of small exercises mean you have to do Maths almost every day to stay on top of things. Each day you build and therefore revision is not as difficult. \r\n- Midterms were well-written and aligned with content\r\n- Professor Diethorn made excellent notes available to everyone\r\n- Explorations were very useful\r\n\r\nWeakness: - PSETS were a lot harder than the explorations/ questions covered in class\r\n-Last few weeks covering polar content and area felt a bit rushed"

In my opinion its not worth it to take this class if you don't fall into either of those categories because it will just be extremely stressful and the class itself is fairly difficult.",

If a true understanding of the essence of one variable calculus is what is desired, this class is the place to be.",

                "I think I would recommend this course to a student who has already taken Calc BC. I think the course does a good job at glossing over the general concepts of calculus BC, but it does not cover material sufficiently for a first time learner.",
                "I would recommend this class because it introduced and reinforced important math concepts that are applicable to other areas of study.",
