                "The course was extremely hand-wavey when it came to differential equations. I would have appreciated more time spent teaching the theory and less time repeating \"intuition\" for mathematical models which were theoretically almost identical.",
                "Strengths: good professor, ample practice, fair tests and grading policies\r\nWeaknesses: may not fully cover 120 material",
                "Strengths: enjoyed the incorporation of engaging papers; good support during office hours\/peer tutor hours\r\nWeaknesses: content covered in class was poorly explained and represented only a fraction of what was needed for psets\/exam--was forced to self-learn most of the material via lectures from other universities; grading was quite harsh and unforgiving, making for a stressful and unpleasant experience; course title is misleading--only one mathematical model in a biological context was covered (advection-diffusion), and the course felt far closer to a generic math class than an exploration of \"mathematical modeling in the biosciences\".",
                "Strengths were definitely Professor Halls dedication to his students and the engagement within the course, as it was a small class. There werent many weaknesses besides the early class time.",
                "I learned about resilience and consistency and trying my best.",
                "Very supportive environment designed to facilitate learning. Although, some of the material required students to self learn.",
                "I like that this class didn't cover as much multivariable material as Math 120 would. However, after taking Math 116 which had a high focus on the biology aspect, I was disappointed that Math 121 didn't focus as much on biological applications. But this could just be due to the nature of the material covered and how it generally applies more to physics than biology. Overall, I enjoy John's teaching style, and I feel like I got a lot of personalized feedback in terms of what I'm confused about. I never felt like I couldn't ask a question in class, and the environment in the classroom was one that encouraged collaboration and genuine interest.",
                "strengths: very interested professor and small seminary environment\r\nweakness: no curve and lots of emphasis on testing",
                "Overall, I found the course to be well-organized. However, the parts\/units of the class (differential calculus, Fick's Law and it's applications, integral calculus) felt a little disjointed to me, and it might be worth considering switching around the distinct parts of the course to increase the cohesion between the three parts. I also found it a little weird that the middle part of the class wasn't tested at all on the final exam, but I assume there was a specific reason for this exclusion. \r\nOtherwise, the course had very strong support systems (accessible office hours, practice exams before every exam, review session for midterms and the final exam) that gave many opportunities for practice. There are not many opportunities for improvement.",
                "The course was very organized and the format of class which started with practice problems reviewing old material or previewing new material before we started new content was very helpful. Including many example problems during class was very helpful as it helped prepare us for exams, and the review sessions and practice exams aligned very well to what we were tested on. The course didnt always go in depth enough to get a strong conceptual understanding of the theorems\/equations\/etc. we were using, and some problem sets were very computational rather than conceptual, but Professor Hall did offer more in-depth explanation in office hours, so it really just depends on the student to choose how much they want to get out of the class. Some of the problems sets were quite challenging and they can be very time-consuming, but if you start early enough to go to office hours or peer-tutor office hours, theyre definitely manageable and partial credit awarded for your work is very fairly graded.",
                "StrengthsDr. Hall's teaching. He is so organized and supportive if you need some help understanding a topic. \r\nWeaknessesSometimes it was a little unclear how the multivariable calculus and mathematical modeling topics were related."

                "As someone who entered the course being interested in the math itself, and bearing no contempt for calculus, I would not recommend it to another student. The mathematical models and publications themselves were somewhat interesting, but too similar to each other to feel satisfying to learn past the first one. However, it is a great choice for someone who wants an overview of calc III without the workload of math 120, or who needs to take a calculus class for some other reason (pre-med, etc.) and is averse to math 120.",
                "Yes, it was a very good course that exposes you to different ways of thinking and teaches you the fundamentals of multivariable calculus",
                "Yes for sure!",
                "Do not take this course unless you absolutely need multivariable calculus and want to avoid MATH 120",

                "Yes, John Hall is an excellent teacher and the material is interesting and challenging",
                "Yes, it is interesting how biology is integrated",
                "It is a challenging class and you should definitely have a strong background in calc 1 and 2. This is not the class to be reviewing concepts from calc 2 while learning new material. You should definitely be coming in very strong but if this is true for you I think it is a great class and you get out what you put  in. Professor is very nice and kind. But yes it is very quick and intense and you learn a lot about math but also how it applies to other fields, specifically biology and chemistry. Very eye opening and exciting at lest I thought so but yes also challenging.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Hall is an excellent professor who structures this course around seeing his students truly understand the concepts he teaches.",
                "Yes, great course to learn the life sciences applications as well as gain an understanding of multivariable calculus.",
                "Yes! If you're someone that doesn't feel like they need much math for their future or doesn't want to take many math courses, I would recommend this class since it is a nice bridge between multivariable and biology. Since it doesn't cover as much material as Math 120, the class is less of a stressor.",
                "If you're interested in math, I'd suggest this. It is very calculus-focused. We spent around 4 weeks discussing actual biological-related topics.",
                "I would! I think Professor Hall is an excellent professor. He is great at explaining concepts the first time and I was always really impressed that he responded to questions about content with a different explanation instead of repeating a previous explanation that had left you a little lost. He was also great at finding the point of your confusion even when you yourself struggle to identify it. I really appreciated reading the papers as a way to understand the applications of the math we were learning. It made the topics \"stick\" better in my mind. Overall highly recommend!",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student who wants to learn the mathematical bases behind various biological and ecological phenomena. The discussion of Fick's Law in this course is very relevant and adjacent to a number of topics discussed throughout the introductory biology sequence taught at Yale. Additionally, I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in developing mathematical models within the context of the biosciences. Overall, I would recommend this course to any student who wants to gain a deeper understanding and intuition of multidimensional space and multivariable functions.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in biology but isnt planning on studying pure math. I dont know if 120 goes into more depth with proofs and nuances of what we learn, but I assume it might and that would probably be better for someone who is more interested in math than biology. As an MCDB major who wanted a basic understanding of multivariable calculus so I would have the background to go further with math if I want to, it was definitely a good choice and I would choose it again.",
                "Yes! It was well-taught and there was lots of support to help master difficult content."
