I feel that the knowledge I have gotten from this course is very useful and that my writing improved dramatically. I feel that the biggest change I noticed was the way the descriptive language I used within my writing grew and showed my own voice as the author more clearly.",
                "I learned a lot of useful skills for crafting unique, creative essays in styles that I had never written before. I enjoyed the opportunity to write academic essays in a non-academic style.",
                "I got a lot better at creative writing through reading lots of great work and having the opportunity to write and revise. I think my voice and tone improved dramatically over the course of the semester. Also, the process of writing about a topic or two that I sometimes got stuck on or had a hard time making interesting was really great practice in improving my writing ability.",
                "Developed personal writing skills as well as specific stylistic techniques, like defamiliarization and extended lists.",

I also love the peer work and comments we wrote to each other because they really helped strengthen our writing and revision process. I think this course is over very strong.",
                "Strength: the essays we read were all very good examples of the styles of essays we were trying to write. One major weakness was that the course jumped around so fast and it was difficult to focus on any given unit.",
                "A huge strength of this course is the material we read. I loved almost every single thing we read, and the course really made me want to be a writer / english major (which I had not really even considered beforehand). I also love the way each class is formatted. Each class is centered around a discussion of what makes the essays we have read work, which was a very helpful and engaging way of improving our writing. I also really loved the workshops and getting to read others' writing and share my own. Everything about this course is great.",

                "Out of all of the classes I have taken at Yale so far, this is the one I would recommend most highly. It was a fantastic introduction to writing at Yale for me. I really enjoyed all the essays we read, and I loved the process of writing and revising creative essays for the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in becoming a better writer. The class can be difficult, but the feedback is useful and if you put effort in, it will be rewarded."
