                "Through a series of readings, podcasts, and discussions, I developed a better understanding of the power that food holds as a tool to both cultivate cultural identity and reclamation and as a force to perpetuate to social hierarchies.",
                "I learned about the relationship between food, race, and migration. I also realized the importance and power of food. I learned more about the conditions of migrant workers, kitchen workers and processing plants; how food reflects identity; and food justice.",
                "i learned so much about the food industry and who is behind the food that i eat. this class taught me about farms and restaurants and everything in between and opened my eyes to viewing food  in a different light. i definitely recommend this class if you want to be more conscious of your consumption.",
                "I learned to look at food through a new lens, specifically in regards to race and migration in both historical and contemporary contexts. We delved into the systems of labor practices that go into producing our food, the formation of social and power relations, and food as a site for cultural, political, and social formation.",
                "As I took this course, I was able to improve my relationship with food. I started thinking more critically about where my food came from as well as how it got to me. I have also started to accept and acknowledge that each system in the food industry has roots in immigration and racism which allows me to make better choices and push for change.",
                "Thinking critically about the food industry in the United States.",
                "By taking this course, I came to learn about the migrating and racial parts in food history. Although land is a separate unit from human, the evolvement of human can not be completed without land. To learn about land and food provides me a new angle to obeserve and study human. Moreover, the anchor on US society allowed me to have some reflections on my own experience.",
                "Food history is rapidly developing recently, yet it was not until the 1960s that researchers began to pay attention to food. Food are frequently viewed as a backdrop to other aspects of human behavior. Sustenance is such a basic and constant topic that it almost goes unnoticed. So it is fantastic to know so much about everyday living. I learned a lot about culinary history and culture from this course which can help both my academic learning and daily life.",
                "Greater integrated overview of the growth of food systems from colonization to slave labor to the neoliberally forced migration of today. Made connections between the different parts of the food industry (farming, packing, transportation, distribution, restaurants, delivery) and located some points for individual and collective intervention."

                "the course was pretty long (3 hrs/session) but the discussions were so fruitful and the prof was amazing at keeping awk pauses to a minimum that it went by pretty quickly",
                "Strengths: readings were all very interesting, discussion and lectures were engaging, supplemental material was good (documentaries, podcasts, guest speakers), final project (a podcast) was very fun\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "strengths: diverse sources of information (documentaries, podcasts,books,articles), applicable knowledge that relates to everyone personally, entertaining\r\nweaknesses: long readings",
                "I absolutely loved the readings and documentaries we were assigned because they were extremely insightful, and so I thought the workload was manageable. Likewise, our class discussions were very engaging and valuable and I found myself leaving each class with a new perspective of food and foodways in the US. As for a weakness, I feel like we could have gotten more feedback throughout the course.",
                "Given the limitations of having a remote class, I think the course did a great job. Despite being discussion based there were still a variety of activities and assignments which prevented the dull feeling of routine as it actively pushed the student to stay engaged. As for weaknesses, Im not sure theres much to improve as I have mentioned it has already been limited by the online structure.",
                "The strengths were definitely the professor and the materials. The professor was amazingvery knowledgeable and just a great human",
                "Strengths\r\n1. This course is very engaging! The intensity of discussion in class is very high, Moreover, we can really use our hands to do some projects which are very interesting.\r\n2. The evaluation of this course is very innovative. Personally, I like it very much!\r\n3. The content is very relatable to our daily life while reveals a lot of hidden secrets under capitalists.\r\n\r\nWeakness\r\n1. It is not a problem about the course, but online teaching did make some parts during the teaching less desirable (eg. communication with classmates and teacher sare way less convenient)",
                "The courses and syllabus are well-organized and comprehensive. However, I wish there were more mini lectures to provide students with a better understanding of food history.",
                "Strengths: Assignments were creative and well balanced, especially for a short summer course - podcast, film responses, gardenkeeping, manageable reading load. Prof. Tran was kind, engaging, and respectful of our time. She even shared some of her seedlings with us for the gardenkeeping assignment and gathered us for a safe in-person last class. The classroom environment was conducive to learning no matter our previous exposure to the material.\r\nWeaknesses: Some ER&M majors might find discussions to be a little elementary or circular if they have already been exposed to this material."

Now, I am more critical about foodasking questions like who made this food available to me, under what conditions was this food produced, what racial hierarchies exist in this food, how is identity reflected in food. The assignments were also very fun, specifically caring for a small veggie garden. This class was overall a lot of fun.",
                "Absolutely! The information you learn in this class is so relevant to everyday life and should be known by everyone. The workload is manageable and the professor is very kind and understanding.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student because the topics we've discussed have changed my perspective about and relationship with food. I left every class with new insights about the labor practices that produce and the histories behind the food. The discussions are incredibly engaging and Professor Tran is very knowledgeable on the topics and also supportive.",
                "Yes, can be interesting material for those not exposed to human rights issues within the world of food.",
                "Yes. I believe its a great course to take to begin to understand the relationship between food and race especially when its one that often goes hidden. It pushes the student to think critically about their own relationship with food and pushes them to improve their food choices as they go through the course. This is an incredibly important aspect of life which is why I would encourage others to take the course.",
                "Yes!!!!! Such a great class.",
                "YES!!!\r\nThis course is definitely a good way to learn more about food history and human' s involvement in it. Also,",
