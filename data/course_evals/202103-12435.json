                "I learned about the details of how the global financial crisis was caused, how to be critical of literature on the crisis and, and to evaluate policies related to it. I learned to set up my knowledge on economics very quickly and be comfortable with confusion for long periods of time before I felt truly comfortable with the course material.",
                "One of the best course I have taken at Yale!",
                "I gained a deep understanding about the 2008 financial crisis, how financial crises work, how best to fight them, and the political constraints that influence crisis response.  I also vastly improved my ability to read and internalize key insights from financial and econ literature.  Especially as someone who has limited real-time memory of the 2008 crisis, it is useful to understand how it happened and how the economy and financial system have been changed in the aftermath.",
                "I learned how to think about the crisis through a new lens that differs from the perspective of the media and pop culture. This class helped me interpret economic research and allowed me to become a better writer.",
                "Learned so much about the GFC, the US banking system, and macroeconomic trends. It was incredibly insightful and I developed great writing and analytical skills",
                "I learned about the background, likely causes, effects, and resolutions of the 2008 global financial crisis. I learned everything from how mortgages work, how they are securitized (and what securities are), how securities are bought and traded in a financial system, and many of the moving parts of the financial system. The course highlighted how fragile the system may be under the right conditions. This was highlighted with several case studies of firms that failed or almost failed, either due to their stake in poorly-perceived subprime mortgage-backed securities, or just because people were too skittish about the firm despite not having an actual stake in subprime. I learned about many of the policies that helped quell the fire of the recession, and insights into how to try and understand/prevent/control the next inevitable crisis. I also learned a good amount of how the federal crisis inquiry committee conducted their research via guest lecturers and the optional writing sessions for undergrads."

                "The strengths of the course are primarily how interesting it is due to the fact that it is taught by a professor and secretary that were so involved in the crisis itself. Every class was exciting and I gained insights I never could have otherwise. The weak points I think were mainly the confusion that lasts several weeks especially for students with less knowledge on the crisis coming in.",
                "Really great course structure. Mostly Q&A in class really allows for all questions to be asked and answered",
                "Professor Metrick is absolutely one of the classes biggest strengths.  He is one of the most engaging lecturers I've ever had at Yale, and his ability to explain complex topics in a way that doesn't assume a significant amount of econ background is a huge plus.  The flipped classroom also works very well  it allows a free flowing conversation most classes where students can ask questions in conjunction with the discussion questions Metrick has prepared ahead of time.  The memos are certainly a lot of work if you want to do well on them, but they are also very rewarding  it's really exciting to read a bunch of papers in one very niche topic and come away feeling like you really understand the scope of the literature in that area.\r\n\r\nGeithner has some interesting things to say, but don't take this class just for him.  He's not the most engaging lecturer, and a lot of his answers end up avoiding taking a clear stance on anything.  It's still cool to hear from someone who was in the room, but you get most of that from reading his book.",
                "Professor Metrick is amazing and the content is interesting.",
                "All strengths",
                "A major strength is that Metrick is a very engaging professor that always is on his toes when it comes to discussing student questions and really nailing home points he's trying to make. However, the differences in knowledge base between the SOM students and undergrads can be a bit daunting at first - many have held large positions in finance companies and will ask questions seemingly beyond what was possible for me to understand. But, on our online discussion forums, many SOM students would post insightful responses that helped me understand what was being talked about in the forum, and what would be talked about in class. Also, another weakness was the amount of writing in the class, even if you weren't taking it as a Yale College writing credit. The paper topics were all interesting to write about, but the overall writing amount (4 3-page memos, 2 6-page midterm papers, a 12-page final paper, and 12 \"insightful\" discussion posts throughout the semester) seemed a bit much considering you wouldn't get a WR credit for the course if you didn't sign up to take the 6 optional writing sessions. Luckily, the sessions themselves were very lowkey and interesting! Also, the fact that the course was flipped was good in that the in-class discussions really helped me get deeper understandings of many topics, but it also meant even more work outside of class to watch the course videos and do the pre-class quizzes. Overall, though, although the class was a fair amount of work, I don't regret taking it at all because of the insane amount I learned from it."

                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in economics and global affairs. You have to be ready to be surrounded by MBA students perhaps much more knowledgeable than you on many levels but that you can still do well next to as long as you are willing to be proactive and put in the work and research necessary. The modules can be tiring as the courses main material is taught through video, but I enjoyed how that material then got re-emphasized in class with student questions.",
                "Yes! One of the most practical and interesting classes I have taken at Yale",
                "100% yes.  This is probably my favorite class that I've taken at Yale and I could not recommend it more highly.  It is a fantastic Econ course for those with a heavy interest in politics and policy, and it explores a foundational event for the modern economy.  This is not a class to miss!",
