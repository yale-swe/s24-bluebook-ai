                "Working alongside my advisor Emily Skillings and my co-advisee Kinsale Drake was a pleasure through and through. Emily has been familiar with my work since my first semester at Yale, and Kinsale and I took ENGL 460 together in the spring of 2022 and participated in Bucknell's Seminar for Undergraduate Poets that summer. Their familiarity with my work meant that their feedback was tailored to my voice and stylistic particularities; as such, they were able to pull me back at times when I became too immersed in my own rhythms or vocabularies. They prompted me to grant breathing room and experimentation to poetic formulae that could easily become oppressively tight and breathless. More importantly, though, it was unfailingly fun to convene with both of them biweekly, whether we were actively revising our own work or musing on the works of other poets. This fall was a semester during which I sometimes felt demoralized by the amount of creative work I had to produce in such a short span of time; Emily and Kinsale understood this exhaustion, and, silly as it may sound, there was as much to be gained from our workshop-style meetings as there was to be gained from discussing what TV shows we'd been watching of late. I'm incredibly grateful to have spent the semester working with two formidable poets who value and esteem my work as much as I value and esteem theirs, and I'm confident that I'm leaving ENGL 489 with a manuscript worth revisiting and revising further."

                "Strengths: student can focus on exactly what they want to write. Weaknesses: the community you find in the writing concentration is entirely what you put into it because there are only ~3 meetings a semester",
                "I would love this to be formatted as a seminar with feedback from other fiction concentrators!",
                "I think it depends a lot on the adviser/advisee relationship. Mine was great so I really benefited from this class",
                "A lot of freedom for creativityI wrote a novella for the first time in my life, and I would never have received such great feedback and guidance without the structure of the writing concentration.\r\n\r\nThis needs to be a year-long project. One semester is a little short to execute a creative project that, for many, matters to the concentrators on a personal level. I dont see why yale cant expand the writing concentration within the English major to 16 credits and carry 2 credits for the senior project plus one analytical senior component.",
                "My time in ENGL 489 felt very well balanced. Meeting with Emily biweekly allowed my work on my project to feel regular and regimented while still allowing time for me to produce new work. Additionally, it was wonderful to know that Emily was always just a text or email away if we had concerns or questions in between meetings. These meetings, combined with the less frequent genre-wide or Concentration-wide meetings organized by Prof. Zarin, made ENGL 489 a fruitful blend of collaborative workshopping and individual writing/revising."

                "I would. The writing concentration is a great program Yale offers.",
                "The Writing Concentration was one of the facets of Yale's English major that appealed to me before I even began my undergraduate career, and it's one of the things that prompted me to choose Yale over other schools with otherwise comparable English programs. Years later, on the other side of the Concentration, I'm glad I made the choice I did. ENGL 489 provided a rather singular opportunity to work seriously on a body of work that I feel could, with a few further revisions, potentially stand on its own two feet. But more meaningful than this was the opportunity to work with Emily in a more intimate context. She's been one of my poetic cheerleaders and mentors since my time at Yale began, and ENGL 489 felt a wonderfully full-circle way to spend my penultimate semester. I'd absolutely recommend ENGL 489 to any declared or prospective English majors."
