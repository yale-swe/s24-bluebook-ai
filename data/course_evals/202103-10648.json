                "Strengths: the topics were interesting\r\nWeaknesses: incredibly poorly organized which caused the class to rehash old arguments over and over and over again with little engagement from the students who did not have sufficient time to read the materials being discussed",
                "Strengths: An avuncular professor with a deep and personal investment in the primary topic of the course. A professor willing to countenance strong objections to his perspective and entertain alternative perspectives. A professor who exhibited humility about his personal and academic positionality within the literature. A professor willing to share his personal perspective about the course material whenever prompted and who genuinely valued student input. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A non-existent syllabus. Many readings were not announced until 18-36 hours before the seminar. 95 percent of the class never spoke once throughout the entire course and were never prompted to speak. The lack of a syllabus meant the course never exhibited clear direction and too much of class entailed discursive reminiscence. Virtually no interdisciplinary literature was assigned or even acknowledged. With few early exceptions, all of the readings derived from Analytic philosophy's theodicy subfield. Theology, literature, autobiography, psychology, phenomenology --none of these intruded into a class about suffering. The complete lack of student participation necessitated the seminar transform into a quasi-lecture format. This class desperately needs a clear and detailed syllabus. It also needs a plurality of voices and perspectives about suffering --not just the exclusive perspective of a handful of Analytic philosophers.",
                "It's a bit disorganized but the content of the lecture was extremely good and discussion in class was engaging.",
                "Strengths: Very well led; instructor always made sure we were prepared.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Somewhat repetitive; some discussions felt like they were covering old territory again.",
                "It is rather disorganized and I think the best way to improve it is to go into the details of each reading, and unpack the arguments that are written out.",
                "The course was an interesting way to explore some incredibly difficult topics. I left feeling a bit unsatisfied, but that is to be expected when exploring the reason for suffering, and overall thought our professors did a good job of laying out potential answers through the theodicies of different thinkers. I do believe this course could be improved with a bit more structure/organization, and possibly sending out the readings earlier in the week. I appreciated that the professors were both very approachable and honest throughout the semester."
