    "I learned about several histories of Western Art Music.",
    "I gained a huge understanding of Western canon from 1800 to 1950, and knowledge of a huge variety of music from different styles from that era. Nearly all music I've played during the time I've taken this class and after, I've been able to relate to the course content. The detail that I had to go into for the exams was immense and so much of the information stuck with me. I can recall the lectures incredibly well.",
    "Music history",
    "How to think about music!",
    "I learned a lot about the rise and fall of european art music and the 19th and 20th centuries. I am not a music major and had not taken music history before. This class was a wonderful learning experience for contextualizing the music that I play and for making music more meaningful to me. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "I learned about the rise and decline of the European Art Music tradition from c.1800 - c.1950 and the tidal wave of popular culture that emerged in the 20th Century.  I also learned to critically examine the benefits and drawbacks of survey courses in music history and of the Western canon in my essay.  Finally, I learned a ton of music over this time period for the listening quizzes.",
    "Knowledge of a cohesive, informed and measured narrative of the European art music tradition; historical thinking and methodological approaches to musicology, esp. pertaining to critical theory; general repertoire knowledge of the studied period, w\/ accompanying aesthetic trends",
    "This course will teach you a lot of important background about the European art music tradition. It puts composers and their works \"in context\". This is more of a history course than a music theory course.",
    "This course is a survey of a selection of a lot, but not all, of the music happening in elite European circles from Beethoven onward. But more so than just the facts, it teaches you how to think about history by putting the material in context.",
    "Gained a broad overview of Western Art Music through the time period, while evaluating how historiography of music shapes the lasting view of certain musics and composers.",
    "I learned how to critically think about music, history, and its relevance. This class got me to think about issues as a musician and entirely outside of music in ways that were both fascinating and scary. I also have a general knowledge of 19th and early 20th century classical music.",
    "I learned so much about music in the context of history, history in the context of music, and the developments of Art music that have transpired since 1800.",
    "-knowledge of important figures, themes and trends in the WAM tradition\r\n-practice analyzing & writing about music\r\n-addressing biases in music curricula",
    "This class is a survey of the Western Canon, and we really delved deep into the main figures of the canon while taking in the general changes in aesthetic. However, in addition to all of that, we learned of the cultural, political, and social implications surrounding major changes in the classical art tradition. Being a musician, the class not only opened my eyes to the music I've known almost my entire life,  but gave me a new perspective and view on the status of the elite art tradition today.",
    "This course taught a good overall background in the musical principles, people, and aesthetic and political movements that drove the rise and decline of the European Art Music tradition of the 19th and 20th centuries.",
    "This course helped me to develop an in-depth understanding of not only musical, but also historical, political, and philosophical concepts in Europe in the 19th and early 20th century.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about the history of Western classical music from the time of Beethoven until Poulenc. The lectures are incredibly captivating, detailed, and are as much cultural history as they are music history. I learned to see Western music as part of the general development of culture and mass media in the long nineteenth century, not as a separate thing.",
    "The History of Western music from 1800-1950, as advertised. Highlights included Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Brahms, and a class about blues and jazz in the early 20th century in America. We learned not just about the famous composers of the era but the ideas and thinkers who inspired their styles. This course did a great job of placing everything in a larger historical narrative, with discussion at length of the effect of \"normal\" historical events on music history.",
    "I have a much better sense of the trajectory and significance of the western canon than I did before. I learned to better relate musical and cultural production to social reality. I also was engaged in deep thought about the importance and\/or livelihood of the western art music tradition today.",
    "Good foundation for the history of the canon as we know it, ability to question which musical events in history deserve importance",
    "I gained knowledge of the European Art Music tradition and an appreciation for the music contained within it, the course changed my life!",
    "I developed a clear understanding of the canon and the trajectory of art-music history 1800-1950.",
    "I learned about the Western art music tradition and how classical music attained the position it holds in society today.",
    "I learned a lot about classical music, not only how to analyze and think critically about the pieces themselves, but also the backstory of the composers and the time in which they lived. Fascinating class.",
    "A broad, integrative understanding of music history and how it relates to cultural, political, and intellectual trends",
    "Jim introduced me to the world of music. How to listen. How to appreciate.",
    "A comprehensive understanding of the social and musical trends of western (mostly classical) music.",
    "A detailed understanding of European music history in the 19th and 20th centuries, as well as historiographical skills through an essay response to various musicological writings."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Quite literally everything. The most fascinating material. A world famous musicologist as our professor. Sufficient work but not an overwhelming amount. Life changing views of history and art. The best class by far I have ever taken at Yale. \r\nWeaknesses: I'd say assessments were a little too crammed into the end of the class.",
    "Strengths: fantastic lectures, very interesting material, very engaged students, well structured, great readings, gave me an immense knowledge of the material. \r\nWeaknesses: sections could have been more structured.",
    "Hepokoski is an amazing lecturer, but he is retiring. At the end, the last three assessments (Essay, listening quiz, and test) were a little too close to each other.",
    "Lectures were super engaging, for the most part--I appreciated the attempt to incorporate jazz\/blues into the curriculum, but it didn't feel like the professor had much to say about those traditions, which made those lectures into a list of examples rather than a cohesive narrative.",
    "The strengths: cool course, lots of information, good lecturer. The weaknesses: biased lecturer, not enough discussion of why we were focusing on this canon, got much more history-based and less music-based as the course went on, AND TOO MANY PEOPLE IN ONE ROOM so I could never see the projected slides and note-taking was always difficult.",
    "I took this class with Prof. Hepokoski -- he is retiring so this course will not stay the same unfortunately. Prof. Hepokoski is a wonderful lecturer and will be dearly missed.",
    "This course provides a fascinating overview of the European Art Music tradition, but, as I argued in my essay, perhaps survey courses are not actually the most beneficial to students.  The only way I could see it being improved would be to completely replace it.",
    "I would've perhaps liked a smaller class size as to facilitate more interaction with the professor, but that's a minor issue - this class was wonderful.",
    "There's a lot of material to cover and a lot of reading! The workload is also substantial: 3 listening quizzes, 3 written exams, and 1 final paper. The good thing though is that you will be done with the class before reading week (if the format stays the same). Professor Jim Hepokoski is engaging and passionate about the course, but I heard he was retiring. As a non-music major, I was glad I took the class Credit\/D because the listening quizzes can definitely be challenging. The written exams are not bad if you learn the material well (and do the readings), but even if the course is not cumulative, there is definitely a lot of things to learn for each. Overall, I found the material to be very interesting.",
    "The course is incredibly engaging and well-taught. However, I'm still not sure what the educational purpose of listening quizzes areyou'll probably forget a lot of the music after you take them. Also, because the course is curated by Professor Hepokoski, you are not exactly getting an impartial introduction to the material.",
    "Fantastic course with a great professor. There were times when it didnt feel like the social climate surrounding the music wasnt addressed enough, but overall it was very good. One other weakness was that the sections seemed rather disorganized.",
    "Lecture was fantastic. Professor Hepokoski made every lecture engaging with a constant connection to the broader themes of the course at large. There was never a diversion from the topic, and it felt like what we were learning was always relevant.",
    "The strengths were obviously the lectures, but I also loved the readings. No real weaknesses.",
    "It's really great. Sad Hepo's leaving.",
    "Study guides provided further in advance",
    "-very well-polished, engaging and informative\r\n-no complaints",
    "The strengths are in the lectures by the wonderful James Hepokoski (who we are all sad to see retire), the incredibly nice TAs, and just the interesting material\/subject matter of the class. There really are no weaknesses although in future courses, no Hepo might be one.",
    "The course was excellent. The only complaint would be that the discussion of non-canonical musics (jazz, blues, popular music) was very limited and fairly ineffective perhaps it would be better to either expand the discussion of these musics, or relegate them to another class and have this course focus on what it focuses on.",
    "This course is very strong for the material it is required to recovered. However, topics such as jazz and blues could stand to be expanded upon, especially in terms of contextualizing the struggles of the black Americans that shaped these genres.",
    "A strength is its emphasis on cultural history and the lectures as well as teaching assistants. I think this sets it apart from many other music courses. However, I think that the course might need improvement in the realm of content testing. Listening quizzes should be biweekly to encourage listening as a habit rather than cramming. Additionally, the study guides often indicate much more information than is needed to do well on exams. They could use simplification. I would also like to see more treatments of jazz and blues in class as well.",
    "I think one weakness of the course was its overwhelming focus on instrumental weakness and, to a lesser extent, opera. There was very little discussion of choral music, and as one of several choral musicians in the class, I am sure that I was not the only one who would've liked to learn about all of the great choral works (of which there are many!) of the period we studied. I found the listening quizzes quite frustrating because they were actually too short. As stressful as they are, I understand that such quizzes are a standard element of a music history class, and I enjoyed engaging with the repertoire. It just didn't feel fair to test ten short excerpts (worth 10% of our grade) from 9+ hours of music. Perhaps these could be longer and administered in section, although of course sections are already limited because that's when the other exams are administered.",
    "While I found the lectures engaging and interesting, I felt that the organization of the course left very little room for students to learn - a large component of the required work was rote memorization in the existing structure; I think it's telling that the most significant artifact I have from this class is pages of piece titles with names and dates, checked for spelling, copied over and over for the purpose of listening quizzes. Moreover, even in places with some more inherent room for interpretation, like the factual exams, questions often addressed not necessarily the facts of history as much as the interpretations of history favored by the course (e.g. asking about specific readings of pieces or searching for characterizations of composers in highly subjective, but fixed terms). The longer essay required for the course required some more thought, but it did not feel like a substantial component of the class. While I suspect that the course as it stands would strongly appeal to those with a strong reverence for the classical music tradition and a desire to participate in it in the traditional way - and perhaps it serves some purpose in preparing students to work in an existing culture of classical music that does value these things - it falls short on any goals of critically approaching history. \r\n\r\nIn concrete terms, I think it would be improved by giving more emphasis to work beyond memorization; first of all, the listening lists are unmanageably long - while it is absolutely possible to feel comfortable with the existing format of quiz, the quantity of music leaves hardly any time to understand the context of each piece or to use one's ear to verify the assertions made in lecture of in the texture or to understand, aurally, how historical contexts affect the music. This reduces the student's scholarship to a blind trust of assertions by the lecturer and textbook author. Other courses with listening quizzes often ask for knowledge beyond who wrote it and when, and this is highly worthwhile, but restricts how much content can be included.\r\n\r\nI also think that there would be value in emphasizing the interpretations of students in class; it struck me, for instance, as incredibly strange that the lecturer proposed an almost programmatic interpretation of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 to a room full of students capable of hearing for themselves (and who, myself included, might not hear the abstract interpretations proposed by the lecturer unless they were properly challenged and defended in reference to musical events rather than in reference to the professor's subjective experience). It seemed improper that a surely diverse spectrum of perspectives would not be included in a discussion which music majors are well equipped to have. On a more philosophical level, this sort of teaching seemed like it advanced a very traditional understanding of what music and composers are intellectually valuable (especially as the professor kept saying \"As you all know...\" and other such phrases that seemed to assume the audience were completely on board with the approach of the class), which is not something I'd be eager to see perpetuated in an environment which includes considerable diversity, even among those who have an interest in the given tradition of western art music.",
    "For what it was, this course was essentially perfect. Professor Hepokoski has it down to a science (sad to see him leave), and it showed. It was as if each lecture was a chapter in a larger book, and we just got to enjoy it. Perhaps one thing that could be improved is the paper that we had to write - I felt that my resources for engaging meaningfully with the topic were limited, and I wish that I could have done more research or talked more to my TA or Professors Hepokoski before I wrote it.",
    "Listening quizzes, essays, and factual exams were too closely spaced towards end of course but otherwise, the course was well organized",
    "Super rigorous class, wouldn't change a thing! Best class I've ever taken at Yale and I'm a senior.",
    "I wish there was a way to reduce the sheer amount of memorization of this course. As I wrote in my term paper for the course, the class is designed in a way that privledges instrumentalists, students whose high schools had excellent music curriculum, and students whose parents were highly musically educated. Oftentimes, these groups also belong to much more economically privledged statuses. Consequently, I feel that the course should be adjusted to make it more accessible to students from lower income backgrounds. The course feels like its on an uneven playing ground.",
    "Overall I think this course is structured very well.",
    "Strength: Engaging lecturer and material.\r\nWeakness: The listening quiz required too much memorization.",
    "This course is part of a sequence that has been by far my most fulfilling academic experience at Yale so far. The course is rigorous and comprehensive, providing students with a clear grasp of the musical-historical arc of the time period in question. Evaluations ensure that students have a solid foundation in factual knowledge, are able to identify influential\/representative pieces, and are exposed to high-quality musicological writing."

   "comments": [
    "Take this class at all means possible. Given professor is retiring, find him at his home and beg him to lecture you on the History of Western Art Music.",
    "In case you are not aware: the professor who taught this course, Dr. Hepokoski, is leaving after this semester, so you will take it with someone else. Thus your experience will be vastly different from ours. The class we took was incredible, and one of the most challenging and most meaningful educational experiences of my life. He is easily the best lecturer I've ever had. \r\n\r\nIf you are a music major or a (relatively serious) musician, absolutely. Regardless of what this course becomes without Hepo, it is incredibly valuable to have a knowledge of the canon, and the class will provide a much, much greater appreciation for the composers we all know and love (and tons of others, too. I discovered great music). \r\n\r\nIf not: if it were under Hepo, I would 100% recommend it as a Credit\/D\/Fail course (simply because it was pretty damn hard and someone without that much knowledge of music might not want to invest that much time). I knew tons of non-musicians in the course who absolutely loved it. However, there's no telling what the course will become. If you're reading this while Music 351 (which goes before this in the sequence) is still going on, go to a lecture in that class to get an idea what this will be like. If not, maybe read the reviews and get some opinions. Definitely keep an open mind though, as this class can reach incredibly highs.",
    "Yes because Hepo is a great lecturer, but he is retiring so we'll see.",
    "I definitely recommend this class, but I also recommend taking it credit\/d if you, like me, have zero knowledge of music theory and don't already listen to a lot of classical music. Listening quizzes will be time-consuming to study for, and some theory-based things will go over your head, but you can still learn a lot.",
    "Take this class!!!! (as long as the next professor who teaches it is as wonderful a lecturer as Prof. Hepokoski) If you can, Credit-D it. This class has a ton of work that really picks up after the credit D deadline.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who is curious about the role of classical music in society.  The course highlights the relevance of classical music to society through its rise and decline, emphasizing many of the controversies.  It is also just a fascinating class for anyone who loves classical music.",
    "This was one of my favorite courses taken at Yale, and perhaps even my favorite. If Hepo weren't retiring, I would recommend it to anyone, no holds barred; as such, studying this material in a critical context provides immense insight into historical European and modern Euroamerican culture. Lectures challenged preconceptions I didn't know I had and were revelatory nearly every time. Extraordinary class.",
    "Yes! I wanted to learn more about the history of music before I graduate and I'm glad I took this course. I would recommend taking it Credit\/D if you can.",
    "If Professor Hepokoski were still teaching it, than yes, absolutely. However, it's unclear how this course will change in the future with a new professor and also within the new music major.",
    "This class was wonderful; you always leave energized and excited about the music. Professor Hepokoski really knows how to present this history as a narrative. One of the best classes Ive had at Yale! Also RIP Beethoven.",
    "Yes, take it if you have any interest in music or the humanities generally. Hepokoski does a good job of relating music to the philosophy and art of the time period.",
    "Yes! To anyone. Its life changing.",
    "Hepo's a legend. Not much more to say. The quality of the class will largely depend on who teaches it next.",
    "Absolutely. It is my favorite class Ive ever taken at yale",
    "-yes",
    "I would recommend this course to anybody. The music tradition is an excellent lens to view history through, and if you have any interest in classical music at all, you will get something out of this course.",
    "This is a great course to get to know an important era in classical music a lot better. The concepts and aesthetic ideas presented in the course extend well beyond the European canon. Highly recommended, especially if you are a music major!",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. Even if you arent a music major, this class provides a window into European zeitgeist and history.",
    "Absolutely. This is a cultural history of European in the long nineteenth and early twentieth centuries through art music. Exceedingly well-taught and fascinating.",
    "Yes! Even with its weaknesses, it's such a great course! I think I learned more in this course than in any other I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student - its an excellent introduction to the tradition of western art music, and it is a really fun way to engage with the material while still being thorough.",
    "Yes!!!",
    "This class is the absolute best, would recommend first of any class at Yale only under Hepokoski though and he is going. Hopefully someone can pick up the slack.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It covers an immense amount of material, but the lectures are excellent and my TA, Josh Gailey, fostered interesting intellectual conversation.",
    "Yes, Professor Hepokoski is amazing and I learned so much about art music that I did not know before. It will definitely make me a better performer.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, although I would warn anyone wanting to take it that the workload is quite significant, especially preparation for the listening quizzes!",
    "yes",
    "Absolutely! This course helps you appreciate music through the lens of history, and appreciate intellectual history through the lens of music. I think it is a great complement to Marci Shore's intellectual history. Even if you don't know music, take it (if you don't think you can handle the listening, maybe take it Credit D?)!",
    "YES! This course is fabulous for anyone regardless of whether you have little experience or lots of experience in music. It is what you make of it -- the hyper-theoretical sections are not essential to your understanding of the material, and it's easy to approach it either from the historical side or the musical side.",
    "Absolutely! Regardless of major or particular field of interest, you will learn invaluable information about culture, society, and intellectual currents through this course. Its treatment of music history is thoughtful and cohesive, ideal for serious musicians or those seriously interested in music as well."
