                "The seminar was engaging, and Professor Berger made sure to include everyone in the conversation, especially if they were not participating much on a particular day. The class felt somewhat like a book club and was very enjoyable. It was hard to keep up with all the readings, though!\r\n\r\nIt could have been effective to ask students what they were most excited to discuss about the books in the beginning of the class periods and build off of those topics. Or, at least discuss in the beginning of the class what the plan was for the day. I sometimes felt like I had questions or connections I wanted to make but which I never found time to bring up. Maybe we even could have submitted a few preparatory questions before the lectures.\r\n\r\nI think Professor Berger could have given a few seconds more time after asking us if we had anything to add. Especially in a virtual world, it takes some time to speak up.\r\n\r\nI also thought the discussion board was a good idea, but maybe could have been a bit more structured.\r\n\r\nFinally, maybe a slightly more accurate name could have been useful. :)\r\n\r\nOverall, I loved the class and it sufficiently satisfied my curiosity!",

Just note that you will need to come to class ready to engage! And, that the class isn't perfectly named... it's not all American, modern, or fiction. There's even one book without animals. :)",
