It was a great transition course from grammar to pure reading and review. If you are a bit shakey on your greek after l1 and l2 then this course is the perfect way to feel comfortable reading greek again."

                "I really think the texts chosen need to be reassessed. I understand that Lysias 1 and the story of Gyges are really typical intermediate Greek texts. However, they deal with very difficult subjects relating to the treatment of women in ancient Greece, and in a class focused on the language itself, it is difficult to take the time needed to really discuss the historical background of these works and the problems they present. While there are few ancient Greek texts written by women, and none appropriate for the intermediate level, this does not mean Lysias 1 is the only option. Euripidess Helen is perfectly accessible for intermediate level students, and presents a far more interesting take on women. Of course, being a play, it is poetry, but certainly there are prose options out there which do not involve the same misogamy in Lysias 1 and the Story of Gyges. Classics is in the midst of a reckoning, and I can only urge the department to reconsider whether the texts used at this level need to still be used, considering the problems they present.",

                "This course was great this year. A major strength is that it is reading-focused with selected grammar review which really helped me get used to reading attic prose."
