If one already has taken introductory physics much of the course will probably be a review. Additionally, the PSETs at times had problems which were difficult to answer using just the information given in lecture.",

                "The course is overall very good, but the degree of difficulty of the problem sets is bigger than that of the lectures. This made me a little out of place in the beginning.",
                "For me the course was at its strongest when it was explaining how a piece of technology that I've used actually works, even on a slightly basic level. Making sure each concept directly correlates to something students have experienced is really important and what makes the class so interesting.",
                "Strengths - clear instruction, interesting material\r\nWeaknesses - can't think of any",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Right balance of physics and application to technologies\r\n- Poll everywhere questions incentivized attendance to live lectures\r\n- Professors and TAs were very responsive to questions/understanding about the challenges of a virtual semester\r\n- Had worthwhile science content for non-STEM major (i.e. not a complete science gut, but also not overly difficult for non-STEM folks)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Too many problem sets (had 12 psets; can cut down to 10 psets). Not super time consuming or difficult, but honestly some psets weren't really necessary\r\n- Unclear grading curve. Students should be provided a more concrete idea of the grading curve in the syllabus (i.e. what percent of the class gets a particular grade on an average year?) or at least a midpoint check-in of \"if you are above X % in this class at the moment, you are currently sitting at a grade of X.\" It's the end of the semester, and I don't have a good idea of where I stand in the class besides above the median",
                "lectures are well organized and prof miller is good at explaining concepts, very helpful for people who know nothing about physics. office hours were also helpful and the final project was very flexible and accommodated a range of interests.",
                "This class made seemingly challenging concepts very clear. The main weakness was the lack of in-person/live engagement with Prof. Miller, the TAs, or other students.",
                "the midterm was very difficult in comparison to the lectures and problem sets",
                "The course material was very interesting, especially seeing the applications of technology we see and use everyday. That is a definite strength.",
                "Nice lectures and a lot of material covered.",
                "Good teacher",
                "Strenghts: For participation, the professor asked us two questions per class on Poll Everywhere. These were a great way for students to test if we were understanding the topics learned that class or if we had to go back to review/go to office hours. Additionally, it was really interesting to learn about the applications of the concepts that were taught. We learned how parts of our phones work, how Wifi, turbines, glasses, rainbows, etc.",
                "having virtual zoom lectures with low interactivity made it hard to focus during class. this was true of many classes this year, I found that the ones which sent us to breakout rooms or which encouraged more active participation were the ones I enjoyed most and felt like I learned the most from. so not a unique problem but nonetheless a difficulty which I associated with this course.",
                "Strengths: Class is entertaining and lots of examples and demonstrations.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: PSET questions have math and formulas not covered in class.",
                "Strength: Owen Miller is a really great professor. I wish I wouldve been able to interact with him in person.\r\n\r\nWeakness: pset material and actual lecture content are different",

                "strengths: truly very enlightening, practical knowledge, fun final project, wide breadth of topics covered\r\nweaknesses: at times, though our lectures were fascinating, the math that showed up on our Psets was not covered in lectures and left a lot of us hanging. Would be impossible without office hours",

                "TF office hours were structured so well, they helped me complete problem sets\r\nParticipation was calculated in a fair wayeven students who could not attend synchronously had the chance to earn participation points\r\nCould improve on the break down of the physics part of lecture (dedicating more time to the details)",
                "Prof Miller is engaging and friendly, and he explains concepts very clearly. I liked the demonstrations. I wish other students used Ed more because some pset questions were confusing and others definitely asked clarification questions just not on Ed.",
                "Professor Miller was great and knows the material well, which is challenging since the breadth of material is so vast. The problem sets were all very doable and fun, and I really enjoyed the course content.",
                "First of all, the professor was incredible. He encourages questions, maintains good communication with the class, and clearly cares about the course and his students. A major strength of the course is that it makes difficult technology accessible to understand for non-STEM students by redirecting us from difficult texts in favor of professor and student-created guides. The problem sets were not insane, but attending office hours often felt mandatory. Online sources of help stick to scientific terminology, so this class is somewhat self-contained. On the (rare) occassion where the professor forgot to mention something in a lecture, figuring out problem sets in-between office hours felt frustrating. The biggest strength of the course is the way it encourages students to learn more within problem sets. I remember feeling amazed when a problem revealed at the end how a microphone works. Overall stellar class.",
                "Lectures were always really interesting, and I felt that the course was very well taught. Prof. Miller is fantastic and very accessible. The material was complex but well-explained. The class is geared towards students without a strong background in science, but it's not a gut  I learned a lot every week. The only weakness I can think of is that the pace of the course, especially in the first half of the semester, was quite intense and often difficult to keep up with. I would not have been able to complete most of the early problem sets without going to office hours and truly walking through the steps of each problem. The amount of information per class at first was a bit overwhelming. This got better over the course of the semester, and Prof. Miller was very responsive to feedback."

If learning how a motor, generator, guitar, microphone, and spotlight works sounds like a good time, this is absolutely the class for you. Study for the midterm though!",

                "Yes! Professor Miller is a good instructor who has reasonable expectations for his students. It's pretty clear that he knows that this class is aimed for students who are just trying to fulfill the science distributional requirement, but he still tries to give students an understanding of key technologies--to a conversational degree at least. That being said, there are probably easier classes for non-STEM students to fulfill their science requirement. This one will require you to do some work, especially on the quantitative side. I had some STEM background from high school and am in QR-heavy majors, which definitely helped. \r\n\r\nTLDR: If you took high school physics (especially APs) and were half decent at it, this shouldn't be too difficult of a class for you. If you are numbers-adverse, take a different science class (bio the world and us or something along those lines).",

The professor does a great job introducing the concepts with live examples which helps understand what is being taught. There are also many practice questions provided to prepare for the exam.",
                "Great fun little course especially to learn about the cool ways everyday technologies around us use basic science concepts!",
                "Yeah, I think this is a decent science credit for anyone who isn't a STEM major - as someone who falls into that category, I found the material to be approachable and that it was rewarding to work on the trickier concepts and then understand them. Not a gut, but also not one that I regret taking or went credit/d/fail. It was cool to be able to explain a lot of these everyday technologies to my family at dinner, definitely you leave with some tangible knowledge which will make you look smart out in the world (lol)",
                "Yes, it is a great class for non-science majors. It was entertaining and not too hard!",
                "Sure, but this is not a complete gut. Def on the easier side but there is a decent time commitment",
                "Yes, the technological applications of simple physics are taught excellently!",
                "If the student is not a science major.",
                "Yes! I genuinely learned a lot about how things around me work and will not forget the stuff I learned, because it is so practical. If you are a humanities major, I definitely recommend this class for your SC or QR as it doesn't assume a ton of prior knowledge, so the playing field feels equal. If you put in effort and go to office hours, you should be fine in this class.",
                "Yes, I would, because Prof. Miller and the teaching fellows were fantastic.",
                "Yes because you learn a lot about technology",
                "This course is meant for students who do enjoy learning applied physics. However, if you struggle with physics problems then it will be very difficult to complete this independently.",
                "Yeah, I'm a CS major so I was worried some would be repetitive, but it was basically all new to me. I have a newfound appreciation for the physical aspects/reality of technology and now actually know things my parents can be impressed by haha. Prof Miller is really friendly, and the workload is pretty light it just sucks having a pset every week.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. It's probably the easiest course I've taken at Yale (and I just graduated). 100% take it for your science credit. If you took AP Physics at all in high school, the first third of the class will be extremely easy for you (it all should be easy, but there is a ton of overlap especially the electricity and magnetism material). Problem sets were super easy and doable, and lecture + the material were generally fun.",
                "I would recommend this course to students without a deep background in science who are looking for an accessible but challenging course! Class was always interesting and I am so glad I took this instead of a gut science where I would not have learned nearly as much."
