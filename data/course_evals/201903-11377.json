    "I learned basic music theory: how to read notes, chord progression, triads, seventh chords and form. I also developed my listening skills.",
    "Learned the basics of music theory (rhythm, meter, pitch, circle of fifths, tonal harmony, etc.), as well as special topics in pop and jazz music.",
    "I learned how to read music and the logic behind certain musical gestures and ideas.",
    "We started with the basics of note identification and rhythm and progressed to intervals, chords, and chord progressions. I basically learned generally how much of music from classical to pop and jazz works.",
    "I developed a fundamental understanding of basic music concepts through taking this course.",
    "A basic understanding of music theory, including scales, chord progressions and structure, and harmony. We also gained experience in composition.",
    "I learned a ton about the basics of music theory, such as chord formation and progressions. I also solidified the basics that I knew, but wasn't clear on, such as the circle of fifths and music reading."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Homework is based on completion and the midterm and final were both fair. No weaknesses.",
    "The course gave a solid foundation of music theory and it was really useful to listen to music during class and analyzing it. I wish that we had spent more time on voicing.",
    "Strengths: super interesting material, good projects.\r\nWeaknesses: none I can think of.",
    "This course is designed for beginners; however, many people with music theory experience take it to get an easy A. This creates an intimidating environment for people who have never been taught music theory before, and it makes it very difficult to learn.",
    "One strength of the course was the kind of homework assigned. The homework was clear, helpful, and aided in my understanding of the course.",
    "Although I feel like I learned a lot of material, the course is strangely paced -- most of the material on the final was on the mid-term exam, and not a lot of material was actually covered in the second half of the course.",
    "I enjoyed the projects and content, but wished class was more engaging. I often found it difficult to stay interested and engaged during class.",
    "Strengths: the material is very interesting and provides great groundwork for someone who is interested in music but doesn't know a ton of the theory behind it.\r\nWeaknesses: lectures occasionally dragged. There were days where there was a good amount of participation -- singing turned out to be super fun, even though a lot of us were nervous about it to start -- so if there more days with that kind of participation, even just interspersed, I think lectures would be easier to get through."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It's a good and relaxing fifth class. If you enjoy listening to music in class and learning easy music theory, I'd recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this class. It helped me improve my  understanding of music  and my sight-reading skills.",
    "Yes because I think the course was fun, taught me a lot, and also felt accessible to me even though I have had minimal musical training.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to everybody unless they already have a strong background in basic music theory. Its really cool to learn how the music that we hear\/perform all the time works. I also found the compositions fun to do.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who would like a pretty basic understanding of music theory concepts- I certainly find myself approaching music with a slightly more *~nuanced and educated~* perspective after taking this course (that is to say, I know what I'm talking about).",
    "If you're interested in learning how to navigate reading sheet music, then yes! It's a fun class.",
    "I think that the content in this course is definitely worth learning, so yes.",
    "If you don't know a ton about music theory, definitely! If you're solid on things like chord progressions, you probably won't learn too much new in this class, so at that point I wouldn't recommend taking it. But if you're below that level, you'll probably learn some new things and definitely solidify the knowledge you already have."
