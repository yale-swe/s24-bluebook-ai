                "I gained significant insight into the history of the United States, how the US came to own different territories, and how the Pacific ocean and its peoples have played a part in US history. I learnt skills such as how to read and analyse historical sources, and how to participate and engage in seminar discussions.",
                "I learned all about Pacific histories from a wide variety of perspectives.",
                "I learned so much about American imperialism in the Pacific, particularly how we construct history in places with less historical sources. We learned how to put different voices in conversation. We also got a very good crash course on song primary source historical research.",
                "I learned a tremendous amount about the history of the United States and Pacific Islanders, including a lot about US overseas empire in the Pacific. The course also focused a lot on helping students develop more general skills in historical analysis and historical research.",
                "This class not only covered a fascinating and largely undiscussed part of US history, but also important themes in the greater American narrative. Throughout the class, we also learny valuable skills in discussion abilities, writing, and leading classes through projects that prioritized learning and creativity.",
                "Read a lot of primary source material that was well selected by Prof. Akiboh.",
                "History wise, I learned so much about how the US explored, subjugated, and controlled pacific islands. Its something not taught often anywhere really, Prof Akiboh picked really interesting primary sources that contained different perspectives. We were able to really critic the biases and racism of many of the primary sources",
                "This class was especially helpful in improving my writing skills. The professor actually takes the time to explain how to properly do a research paper.",
                "I learned a lot about the important history that I never learned about the Pacific islands and the Indigenous peoples of those islands, especially critically acknowledging and analyzing how white settler colonialists enacted so much violence and harm to the people and the islands. It was especially insightful, enlightening, and refreshing to learn this history through Indigenous voices instead of the colonizer-centered histories we are taught throughout schooling in the United States. I also learned how to effectively lead a class discussion by summarizing and analyzing primary and secondary sources, asking critical questions about the readings, being able to identify the main takeaways from the assigned readings, and facilitating discussion effectively. The themes of this course are very relevant and critical that everyone should know about."

                "The discussion-based nature of the seminar kept students engaged and it was great to have a small class size so that everyone's voice could be heard. The readings were interesting and relevant, and the workload was fair. The subjects discussed in the course were interesting, and the final projects allow students to explore a particular area of interest in more detail. Each student having the opportunity to lead the class for a week was also fantastic, and worked really well. The course was excellent overall.",
                "Strengths: Professor Akiboh and her passion for the content, interesting readings, new perspectives. Weaknesses: none!",
                "I found the selection of readings and assignments to be very good. One thing I think could be added is a little more framing of th subject by professor Akiboh either before or after student presentations. I found her comments very enlightening and definitely wanted to learn some more directly from her insight.",
                "There were so many strengths to this course - the professor, the readings, and the class discussions. Professor Akiboh was a fantastic professor. She was guided our discussions skillfully, always raising interesting and thought-provoking questions and points for us to consider. She also provided helpful feedback on our assignments and was helpful outside of class. The readings were also well chosen and fascinating. I learned so much from them. One thing I would suggest changing is including more secondary readings as required. For some weeks, the reading load was pretty light and I think some of the optional secondary source readings could be made required.",
                "I thought that this class was taught in a manner very conducive to student learning, allowing us to exhibit our avenues of interest in the creater realm of US Pacific history.",
                "Prof. Akiboh is a fantastic instructor. She has a great depth of knowledge on the subject of U.S. imperialism and conquest in the Pacific. In my view, she should get rid of the format where students lead discussions every week. As blunt as it may sound, she has far more to offer each week than students. Because it was a different student leading the class each week, it was hard to get into a rhythm and each student had a different teaching style, some good and some bad. I wished that Prof. Akiboh just lead the class each week because she has a ton of knowledge on this topic and is a great teacher.",
                "Strength: j loved how Professor Akiboh have many tips about historical research, finding sources, giving feedback to others, etc. She definitely wanted us all to succeed, not just by teaching us historical content but vital critical analysis and research skills as well",
                "I appreciated that the course covers a lot of diverse countries within the Pacific region in the short amount of time that there is.",
                "I think a big strength of the course came from it being a small seminar as it allowed for more in-depth discussions of themes and generative discussions. However, I would love to see more interest in this class grow and see it being taught as a lecture in the future because I believe it is very critical and relevant to learn about the history and legacies that are taught in the class. The structure and the flow of the class were also strengths as themes and historical events were built upon each week allowing for students to make connections across the material throughout the semester. Having check-in assignments leading up to the final project worked really well and helped to work towards the final project throughout the semester instead of doing it all at the very last minute. I also appreciated having the freedom to choose what form the final project would take."

                "Yes, I truly loved the structure of the course and also everything I learnt. The workload was manageable, and being able to engage in discussions during each class was excellent.",
                "Yes! Professor Akiboh does a great job of facilitating honest, open, and engaging conversations and provides just enough context to our readings\/conversations.",
                "I would definitely recommend this. It is a subject that is understudied but has so much rich history and interactions and importance to the world that largely goes unrecognized. Professor Akiboh really helps you understand as well as improve your historical writing ability.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student. I learned so much about an important area of American history. The workload and assignments were manageable, and Professor Akiboh was a fantastic professor. I learned so much from the readings, and I looked forward to class each week.",
                "Absolutely, this course was highly engaging and one of my favorite seminars of my time at Yale.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. Prof. Akiboh is a great instructor and the syllabus was very interesting. Some assignments went ungraded for the majority of the semester, and we only really had one assignment which was the final project. This was definitely a lighter workload class than every other history course I've taken. It was very hard to tell how you were doing in the course because there was little to be graded on, other than this final project.",
                "Yes yes yes! Such a unique course in Yale that de-centers Southeast Asia, and also really digs deep about pacific islands and their history, centering many Indigenous voices as well",
                "Yes, I definitely suggest this class because it teaches about an incredibly important part of American history that's often hidden or discussed in a very pro-imperialist way. You also engage a lot with indigenous histories, which is something we usually aren't presented with very often.",
                "Yes! Every student at Yale should take this class!! I think especially students who are from the Pacific region or whose family is from that region would appreciate this course and how it's taught."
