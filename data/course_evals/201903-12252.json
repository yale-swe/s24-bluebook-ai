    "Being able to analyze and recognize Chinese contemporary art pieces and artists.",
    "I learned about major trends and key figures in Chinese contemporary art, combined with historical and cultural background that gave rise to artistic movements.",
    "A terrific class for those who are interested in Chinese contemporary art. In case you are not interested in this specific time\/region - it is WILD BEYOND YOUR IMAGINATION. It is a terrific class that explores a series of methods in approaching Chinese art, which I think is relevant to many regions in the world outside Europe&\/USA. You get to learn about contemporary Chinese history, contemporary artistic giants, contemporary Chinese art movements, and much more.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate the fact that we now have courses on Chinese art.",
    "I learned about modern Chinese history and examined the works of a few specific contemporary artists.",
    "Learned a lot about Chinese contemporary art and history, which is not something I was super familiar with before! Id recommend this class to anyone thats just interested in learning more about China and its relationship with art.",
    "We learned about many of the most important Chinese contemporary artists including Zhang Huan, Xu Bing, Ai Wei Wei. We mostly focused on visual and performance art rather than architecture. We also learned more generally how to look at and analyze complex contemporary art.",
    "Learned about contemporary chinese avant-garde art, but overall very little. You can probably learn more by reading a book or going to the Guggenheim."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This courses' readings were insightful and helped me understand the topics being discussed. \r\nWeaknesses: discussions were often a little stilted and awkward; sometimes difficult to receive constructive feedback; if students' interpretation of the art piece was different from the instructor, these opinions were often times stuck down without full debate or conversation",
    "Strengths: comprehensive and objective (as much and as often as we could)\r\nWeaknesses: this class is a bit like a small-scale lecture. After all most students do not come in with enough understanding of Chinese art history. Quincy kinda needs to talk a bit more for us to understand what's going on. I wonder if this class could become more seminar-like.",
    "strengths: syllabus is organized well, powerpoint slides are helpful, thought provoking and relevant themes including the local\/global, feminism, and space\/site-specificity. weaknesses: class time is too short to cover all the topics in depth, sometimes too much time is devoted to logistics",
    "The course material was well organized and the readings were interesting. However, for a seminar course, I felt that it was very heavily lecture-based. Discussions took place but were too heavily curated. Certain answers were expected. There was little room for open interpretations and critiques. Reading presentations were not very organized. There was no metric of evaluation.",
    "One of the strengths was the organization. The reading list was great and there were always really interesting videos and discussion questions associated with our weekly readings. I also enjoyed the questions prepared for class which led the organization and direction of our discussion. Additionally, Quincy's lecturing was a strength as he was great at leading discussions and asking probing questions.\r\n\r\nThough I enjoyed almost every aspect of the class, one way this course might be improved is through feedback from the main instructor on our essays, as only the TA read our final essay.",
    "The class was a very poor experience pedagogically. I received very little productive feedback on exams, participation, and assignments. The class did not cover the majority of the topics listed on the syllabus including \"We also look at Chinas Olympic stadiums, the Three Gorges Dam, and skyscrapers (including those in Hong Kong and Taiwan)\" and \" how Euro-American artists and filmmakers used their arts to express their views on contemporary China.\" The syllabus and first class are unrepresentative of the class as a whole. The seminar discussions were mostly repetitive since we spent the entire semester on avant-garde art and does not prepare you for the 15 page paper. Very little attention was paid to discussing how to actually interpret chinese art history, so much of the class consisted of scattered comments on specific artworks that did not lead to anything useful.  Classes were largely unstructured, involving a discussion of several unrelated points in the readings and then whatever the professor felt like talking about, which was not always related to the readings. The class consisted of about half art history majors and half students who had taken at most one previous art history class and discussions were not catered to either group well.  The class should either be taught as a graduate level seminar or as a lower level class. At the end of the semester one of the discussion questions was along the lines of what counts as chinese art and most students still did not have clear answers."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone really interested in art. I took this course more for the cultural aspect of contemporary China, but the class is definitely much more directed at art history students.",
    "Yes if you have a strong interest in Chinese contemporary art or Chinese culture. Syllabus wise, the class is great. The readings are well selected, and the videos are interesting too. Discussions I felt could be better. There were definitely topics covered in the readings that I wished we talked about more in class. Sometimes class time felt more introductory and answered questions of who the artist was and what was the historical background, rather than delving more in depth into more nuanced issues.",
    "I think everyone who studies art history should consider taking a class in Chinese art. It challenges many ways one thinks of the region, especially in terms of its artistic activities. If you study contemporary art, this class is kind of a must. You don't want to dwell in the comfortable euro-american narrative. You probably want to know what's going on in the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nQuincy's style of teaching may be different from other professors in the department. I can't really explain how. It's not in a good or bad way. It is just different.",
    "yes -- if you're interested in contemporary art, contemporary chinese history, or both! the final paper is a great opportunity to explore the topic\/artist\/work you're passionate about.",
    "I recommend this course to students who are interested in contemporary Chinese art and culture. It offers a good overview of the field.",
    "I would. The subject matter of the course is unique. Chinese contemporary art is a fascinating field. Many of the artworks and artists we looked at were very interesting.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this class to all majors and to people who are interested in China because the class gave much insight into the culture of China and some of the most pressing contemporary problems China faces. Quincy was also extremely friendly and helpful and made the class environment very enjoyable.",
    "No, I would recommend literally any other class over this one."
