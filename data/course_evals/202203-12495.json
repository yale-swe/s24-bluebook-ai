Second, this course was just poorly taught. You can't just cram an entire semester of content into 5 lectures. It would be nice to have a more steady increase in difficulty throughout the course rather than just throwing us down the cliff.",

Each lecture builds on the previous lecture's content, and by the end I felt pretty confident when analyzing analog circuits. \r\nWeaknesses: The labs feel somewhat disconnected from lecture material. I found myself being able to complete the labs simply by following the instructions, but not really coming away with a greater understanding of how the circuits functioned."

This course is great at showing how all the basic circuit analysis ideas in EENG 200/203 tie together; I think it makes circuit analysis more interesting because you finally see abstract ideas being applied to achieve something concrete."
