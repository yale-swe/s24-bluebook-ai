This class is more about properties of circuits (amplification, input resistance, output resistance, etc.) rather than properties of circuit components (impedance of capacitors, frequency response of capacitors, etc.)."

Second, this course was just poorly taught. You can't just cram an entire semester of content into 5 lectures. It would be nice to have a more steady increase in difficulty throughout the course rather than just throwing us down the cliff.",

                "Strengths: course material is very logical. Each lecture builds on the previous lecture's content, and by the end I felt pretty confident when analyzing analog circuits. \r\nWeaknesses: The labs feel somewhat disconnected from lecture material. I found myself being able to complete the labs simply by following the instructions, but not really coming away with a greater understanding of how the circuits functioned."

This course is great at showing how all the basic circuit analysis ideas in EENG 200\/203 tie together; I think it makes circuit analysis more interesting because you finally see abstract ideas being applied to achieve something concrete."
