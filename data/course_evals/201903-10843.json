    "how to conceptualize inflation",
    "I developed knowledge in growth models, consumption theory, monetary & fiscal policy as well as social inequality.",
    "I learned a lot about macroeconomic trends and the underlying math behind those trends. It really made me realize how much deeper economics really goes.",
    "I learned some of the mathematics behind the economic concepts that I learned in Introductory Microeconomics.",
    "How to approach topics with math",
    "I learned more specific details about long run growth models like Solow, Romer, unified Solow and Romer, Malthus, and consumption. In addition, I learned the different equations that cover short run business cycles (AS-AD model).",
    "I learned how to think about the economy on a broad scale and in a way I had never thought of before.",
    "I learned many foundational macroeconomic concepts and the mathematical models behind them (this class is very much like Marnix Amands intro course but with a lot more math.",
    "Macroeconomics, mostly a continuation of intro with more math",
    "The main big ideas were solow model, modern consumption theory, aggregate supply\/demand\/monetary policy, and income inequality",
    "This course has taught me a lot about the macro economy and the ways in which individual individual decision making contribute to the greater economy. Additionally it has taught me a lot about how the central bank manages and changes consumer expectations and consumer demand and how there are many contributing factors that go into allowing the macro economy to run smoothly. I learned about several different models that help to explain why there is growth in an economy and how growth and technology and knowledge prove to be essential along with growth and capital to grow income per capita. Additionally I learned how consumption factors into the macro economy and how all of the individual decision making contribute to aggregate supply and aggregate demand which in turn are manipulated by the central bank and the government by monetary and fiscal policy. We concluded our year with a discussion about inequality and about how there is enormous inequality among individuals but also returned to the idea of enormous inequality between countries. This class was truly an interesting class to learn about growth and to help explain a lot of the unanswered questions that we have about growth not only within countries but also internationally.",
    "I learned about development in the short run and long run and the economics of the federal reserve and its actions",
    "This course is very theory based.",
    "Learned intermediate Macroeconomics. Pretty dry class with a lot of seemingly unneeded math.",
    "Pretty advanced economic theories, such as long run growth, factors that affect short run output, consumption, all that jazz",

    "The first half of the course is on long-run growth determinants and models. The second part of the course focuses on the dynamics behind short-fluctuations in the economy, and the role that public institutions (Federal reserve and government) play in addressing those. Finally, we looked at what economics has contributed to the understanding of inequality in the US.",
    "I built on the foundational skills learned in introductory macroeconomics by expanding on ideas such as the Solow Growth Model and Production Function, and adding new ideas such as the Romer Model, and the AS-AD Framework for short-term fluctuations.",
    "macro knowledge further from intro.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of macroeconomics and how different mathematical models\/graphs can be used to explain trends in the economy.",
    "Long term economic analysis.",
    "The course is mainly organized in terms of theories of growth in both the long- and short-run, tying in implications for monetary and fiscal policy. Brief discussions of inequality throughout the semester and a few focused lectures at the end.",
    "I learned macroeconomics on a deeper level in order to create models that are more reflective of the real world. Also learned the effects of demand or supply shocks and how the government can get involved.",
    "Macroeconomics and how to apply to larger world problems such as inequality.",
    "Excellent insight into macroeconomic policies and approaches, both in terms of traditional modelling and its relevance to current affairs. Also, useful practice interpreting graphs and equations and thinking critically about both.",

    "I developed a Macro view on the economy, developed my algebra skills, and understood different theories that act as models for our economy over time",
    "Macroeconomic concepts like growth, inflation, and inequality with a mathematical viewpoint.",
    "Macroeconomic concepts, explaining the economy",
    "I learned how to think about macroeconomic concepts with greater detail and foundation.",
    "I learned some interesting ideas in macroeconomics. The specificity in which we delved into the material varied a fair amount from one concept to the next, so while we covered a lot, it was not all in depth.",
    "Quite a lot of maths and lots of building on intro macro knowledge",
    "General macroeconomic concepts and their applications. True understanding of how the world fits into our class",
    "Another econ requirement. Useless material and recap of macro with calculus",
    "Learned a lot about the ma for inimical levers that exist in the real world.",
    "An understanding of long run and short run macroeconomic growth trends",
    "This course provided a more nuanced and detailed understanding of the theories and models first presented in Intro Macro. Professor Peters also made a specific point to connect the learning to current events and trends in the macroeconomy.",

    "Understanding of core models in macroeconomics (long term growth, productivity growth, population growth; monetary policy, fiscal policy, business cycles). Ability to read everyday news and relate to the course material.",
    "I gained a very good understanding of different models of growth and their strengths and weaknesses. I also gained an intrinsic understanding of the interaction between monetary and fiscal policy, and how the Fed chooses interest rates.",
    "I expanded greatly on the knowledge I gained in intro macro. I learned many new models that are built on and improvements of models I had learned before, giving me a more up to date understanding of the economy. I learned much more clearly how the FED affects the economy through interest rates, and I learned how to take models and alter them in subtle ways and see how those changes affect the outcome.",
    "We cover the many different aspects to macroeconomics, starting with long run development economics and short run business cycles.",
    "About Econ",
    "I learned why models are needed in economics. Specifically, the main models I learned were the Solow model, Romer model, and Malthusian model.",
    "I learned a lot about monetary policies in relation to macroeconomic theory. The quantitative reasoning skills developed from the course also greatly help me process the intuition behind the economic theories presented. I also really like the In the News portion of the course as it helped students engaged in current macroeconomics trends.",
    "Gained thorough knowledge of economic processes related to long run growth in the economy as well as insight as to how to extrapolate the factors present in variations in the growth level and standard of living of different countries.",
    "I learned about more details of modern macroeconomics, which is exactly what was expected from this class. I also appreciated the extra class discussions of recent events in the news related to the subject, which was helpful in adding perspective to the course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Great lectures, good textbook, and very helpful Professor and TFs. I don't think that the course could have been done any better given the material.",
    "Strength: professor!",
    "Strengths: gives you a very theoretical approach and helps you understand macroeconomics conceptually.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures do not offer any practice problems and go more in depth about each concept. A weakness because the only way to get better at macroeconomic problem solving is practicing. Would have been helpful to be walked through more problems.",
    "This was an overall good course but I would change up a couple of things. First, I would have liked to see a bit more text included in the slides explaining the concepts. We cannot be expected to note down everything that the professor says in lecture, especially when attendance is not mandatory. I would also have liked to see solving more numerical examples in class, so that we could have been 100% clear of what we could expect in an exam. Additionally, I think that 50% weight for the final is way too much. It is by far the highest that I have seen for any final at Yale. I would have preferred to see the grading more evenly spread out, or even have a second midterm exam. Apart from the above, I would have also liked to see some more topic diversity rather than focusing all this time on monetary policy, interest rates, inflation, etc. Finally, I think that the piazza forum of this course was one of its strongest features. The TAs responded immediately and their answers were always super clear.",
    "I feel the course is very well structured. The slides are useful, sometimes though it can be difficult to get a grip on the material as the pace is quick. Sections are useful. The math can sometimes be difficult to grasp in lecture but the concepts are clear.",
    "Strengths: Builds seamlessly on past coursework, and the professor makes every class interesting with an \"In the News\" section where we're told about current events.\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that my success on the course was largely based on whether I knew the steps to certain weird key patterns of algebraic substitutions, which could not be learned in class but only in office hours from repeatedly watching the TAs and Peer Tutors do your problem sets for you.",
    "Great course because of prof and Zara",
    "The strengths are the structure with the regular lectures, psets, and then the midterm and final. It can be improved by having more preparation for the exams.",
    "The professor is amazing and the material is interesting, but the lecture slides themselves are hard to follow.",
    "Prof Peters version of this course is incomparable - very clear, organized, interesting, etc. I thought he did a really good job of presenting the material and relating it back to current events (we started each class with a in the news section). No weaknesses to report.",
    "The course focused too much on algebraic manipulation and not enough theory or traditional problem-solving; overall this made the work pretty boring even if the lectures were interesting.  Even intermediate micro had more fulfilling PSETs",
    "Strengths:\r\nProf Peters is awesome. He really truly cares about all his students even in a lecture and wants us to love the material. He also tries his best to increase engagement through bringing in current events.\r\nHe also really listens to students.\r\nThere is a lot of support for this course as in office hours and peer tutoring.\r\nThe lecture slides were also pretty solid. They really contained most of what you needed to know. \r\nGREAT TEXTBOOK. The most readable econ textbook I've ever had.\r\n\r\nWeakness: \r\nThis course was incredibly unengaging and it didn't force you to engage. I went to very few lectures (like 8 total) and literally one section and was still able to do the psets quite easily and get a good score on the midterm. Maybe add another midterm so people are forced to keep up with post-midterm material before the final. And the psets could be slightly more technical -- some of the book problems we had were extremely helpful in me understanding the material.\r\nIf you can manipulate algebra and combine equations this course is fairly straightforward. If you don't like math, this course will be more challenging. It is decently theoretical but you usually don't need to understand all the mechanisms in play as long as you understand the general ideas.\r\nHated the excel on psets. It was by far the most time consuming part of the course and honestly didn't help me understand things much better.",
    "The strength of the class were that many of the topics discussed had very real world applications and were clearly explained to show the connections to our world today. I was extremely impressed by the level of organization and clarity of the lecture slides and found them very easy to follow especially when we were studying for the exams. The weaknesses of the class where that the lecture slides were often much more simplified and the problem sets or the exams so to get a good feel of what the exam questions were going to be like, lecture slides were not sufficient.",
    "I liked how well organized the slides were, especially because he goes beyond the content of the book. However, I think that we focused way too long on solow and not enough on important topics like inequality or global warming. Knowing 3 variations of the solow model didnt help me understand the real world economy much better since they were so theoretical. I thought the last unit about the fed and monetary policy was more engaging because Id see it actually play out in the news. As for the exams, Im really unhappy about how he gives us so little time to do the problems of the exam. Yes, theres a curve, but this means that students who are good at math (and not necessarily Econ) have an advantage when he makes us simplify unnecessarily complex algebraic problems. You could demonstrate the same understanding of the link between the quantitative and macro without penalizing those who arent as strong with our algebra skills. I ultimately feel like the test was a test of algebra skills over macro when I couldnt even finish the test because Id make an algebra hour that would take 10 minutes to find when my answer doesnt turn out right",
    "This course was not as engaging as Intro Macro. Intro Macro really succeeded in that there were online quizzes that helped reinforce what we learned. I also feel like Intermediate threw so much information at us. It all seemed loosely connected. The biggest weakness of this course by far was that performance on the exams had more to do with one's level of math ability, than actual knowledge of macroeconomics. \r\n\r\nThis is a huge problem for a course on macroeconomics. I understand that math is crucial to developing models pertinent to the ideas we learn about in class, but the tests really did not test one's understanding of the lectures and lecture slides as much as they should have.",
    "Strengths: Peters is a good lecturer. \r\nWeaknesses: Psets are not adequate when studying for exams. Exams rely on cute \"twists\" to each problem rather than testing if you can actually do the material presented in class.",
    "Strengths: Lectures are, for the most part, interesting. Peters also puts a slide at the beginning of every lecture talking about current economic events which is really cool. Weakness: there isn't much study material",
    "Perhaps spend more time going over the math aspects of the models.",
    "They should provide more practice material instead of JUST two practice finals\/midterms.",
    "Strengths: Great Professor (M. Peters); good TA (Zara); interesting content; good explanations; not too difficult",
    "Professor Peters is a remarkable professor. He takes his time to explain the concept such that everyone understands. I also really appreciated his focus  on inequality in the last week of the course. One weakness might be the dissonance between Professor Peters pedagogy and his exams. He often discussed the mathematics as if it was not the core part, yet the exams seemed to test you quite some bit on your mathematical ability.",
    "Some units felt rushed and not super relevant to the rest of the class. This included the Malthus long-run growth model, consumption, and investment. I thought the AS-AD unit at the end was most interesting and could have been expanded.",
    "really boring lectures. good slides though that you could learn from. hard psets but good tfs to help",
    "I thought this course was extremely interesting, and the material was very engaging. Although a lot of the content was challenging, I thought the peer tutors and the TAs were great and really helped provide additional support. In terms of improvement, I thought that some of the models in the beginning of the year (Romer, Malthus) could have been taught more slowly as the models were a little confusing. I also think it would have been really interesting if we spent more time on inequality too.",
    "strengths - professor Peters is a great & kind lecturer, Problem sets not too difficult & a good review of material learned in class\r\nweaknesses - none if you go to all the classes & you actually enjoy math and theoretical Econ",
    "Strengths: well-organized and well-paced, clear expectations on assignments, psets do a good job of working through the models step-by-step, Prof. Peters is engaging as a lecturer\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of weight on the final exam\/very little weight on the psets despite how much work they required",
    "Course is fine, professor adapted to student demands well",
    "I think while the material was explained well and thoroughly, the pace felt very slow. I felt that only coming once a week when exercise sheets were due was sufficient for keeping up with course material.",
    "Strength: Prof. Peters incorporated a current-events section into the class and it worked really well with the materials we learned in class as well as knowledge about finance and macroeconomics that are valuable in life. The section of inequality in the U.S is also a highlight.",
    "It's a huge lecture, which is almost never good. Prof. Peters is doing his best, but it was often hard to follow him as he'd spend a really long time on random tangents. Some of the filler material is also pretty useless, as it never comes up on the problem sets. Hard to pay attention, but this might have been because it was in Loria 250 (bad sound system and awkward low light).",
    "I think that this course was run very well! The problem sets were very helpful for studying and the teaching was great. One weakness is that the lectures were a bit repetitive, but it served as good review from the previous lectures, so it could be thought of as a good thing as well.",
    "Strengths of this course were the time devoted to discussing what's in the news today. Weaknesses are the teaching of the macroeconomics math and concepts. They were hard to understand, and we often went pretty quickly. As well, problems sets took very long and were not completely connected to what we learned in lecture.",
    "More time in math less on theory because even though the theory is was more interesting the math is what you are tested and graded on.",
    "Strengths: Great professor and great knowledge. Lots of outside resources from TAs (peer tutors and OH).\r\nWeaknesses: Too much dependency on algebra, so much so that it stunts the economic learning.",
    "I had to go to office hours every week to complete psets and still struggled with exams after reading the textbook chapters and going to all the extra help available. I dont think that the lectures prepare students completely for the problem sets.",
    "The course follows a very understandable flow and is in a lot of ways structured for easy intake of information. The exams, on the other hand, tend to be much more complex than the class content; the qualitative parts tend to not reflect what was discussed in class.",
    "Strength: learning was in-depth\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: exams were not enough concept-based, but focused on pointless algebra",
    "Strengths- Nice professor, relatable current events \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Lecture style can make class dull",
    "I thought everything about this course was fantastic.",
    "Strength - The slides were well arranged and easy to learn from. Weekly problem sets, while frustrating, forced me to understand the material we were covering. Section was very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeakness - Even with a great professor, such a big lecture class makes focusing and learning very difficult. Additionally, The problem sets did not always cover relevant material.",
    "It was a lot of interesting material and lots of references to current affairs. The lecture slides werent always useful so difficult to study later",
    "Section could be improved",
    "Professor very strong and lectures easy to follow. However, felt as though problem sets didnt apply to classwork as much as they couldve",
    "Less lecture slides, focus on the stuff thats most important.",
    "the professor was great at explaining and breaking down concepts, but a weakness was not going over problems in class and having to figure them out on the problem set",
    "I think the course's strength was firstly that Professor Peters is an amazing professor, but also that the material itself is very interesting. I think a weakness of the course is that the assessment structure (one midterm and one final) can mean lots of material on each one.",
    "The strengths of this course was the lecture structure, organization of materials, and design of assessments. There were multiple ways\/paths given to students to learn the material.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course was the design of section. I think, at the end of the day, it is hard to design a section that works for everyone. Going over homework might be helpful for some, while others may want to rehash lecture material or do practice problems. Not sure if this is easily fixable.",
    "The psets were okay but I found the exams very challenging",
    "Problem sets are good practice and prep for exam",
    "The strengths were the staff. Prof. Peters an incredible instructor. He was very knowledgeable and passionate about teaching. Also, the TAs were really helpful. No significant weaknesses at all.",
    "I wish there was more discussion of bigger picture. In other words, especially in the beginning of the course, it was sometimes hard to follow the \"logic\" of the course, the way we move from one model to another and we do that. Also, more practice materials for the exams and less data based problem sets would be great.",
    "I thought the course was very strong in highlighting the applications of various concepts and how they fit into the real world. I think it could be improved in eliminating some of the shorter, less significant topics we covered, and introducing one additional major topic like exchange rates, inequality, etc.",
    "I think the lectures were very well done, and the professor was very engaging. Class input was also necessary every class, which was impressive especially for a huge lecture such as this. \r\nSome of the problem sets were much longer or harder than others, so maybe it could be smoothed out a little. Also, I feel like sections weren't utilized to their fullest; most of the time they just went over what we did in lecture, which is great sometimes, but mostly it meant that it was hard to motivate myself to go if I felt like I understood lecture. I held on longer than most too; by the 3rd time around It was usually just 2 people including myself.",
    "A big strength of this course is Michael Peters.  He makes lectures so engaging and actually worth attending. He has a great skill for dissecting complex topics and making them somewhat more digestible.  However, I will say there is a heavy focus on the math that goes ignored in lectures and that the TFs didn't do an amazing job of unpacking.  Sometimes I felt very lost in the math and at times I felt myself needing to go back to the basics to really understand the insights being explained.",
    "Strengths: \r\nI like that the problem sets are similar to the exams. Because of this, doing the problem sets by itself helps me prepare for the exam well. I also enjoy that the TAs and TFs are all very helpful by offering their time.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI think the lecturer tends to talk too slowly, not actually slowly, but in the sense that he tends to stay on the same idea for too long.",
    "Professor Peters is a very organized lecturer, though I did think that sometimes we spent too much time reviewing already familiar material instead of elaborating new content.",
    "The strengths of this course were definitely the peer office hours provided, I believe that the difficult and tricky concepts that were encountered in class were made much more clear when relayed by peer instructors who were immediately familiar with them. \r\nThe weaknesses of this course were the lack of connection to the economic concepts that were encountered to real world events and phenomena. While the course does well to help students understand the theory and math behind the concepts, it rarely helps students find ways to connect it to economic trends exhibited in reality.",
    "The course was very good overall and the instructors were great. The lecture slides provided were very clear and need no improvement. There was some logistical confusion with the final exam, but aside from that the semester was very smooth."

   "comments": [
    "If you're an econ major, then you don't have a choice in taking this class. I would absolutely recommend that you take it with Professor Peters though, he made the class really enjoyable and interesting.",
    "Yes, certainly. Professor Peters was a good lecturer who kept the class time very engaging. I feel that I have learnt a lot.",
    "If you are trying to learn more about macroeconomic concepts in a somewhat mathematical way this course is great. Definitely not too difficult for non-majors and Professor Peters is great.",
    "I would not recommend this course to non-majors because they can learn all the concepts in Intro Macro without the esoteric math tricks. If you're an Econ major you have to take it so no comment.",
    "Yes",
    "I would only recommend it if you are truly interested in macroeconomics or need it for the major. It is not an easy class by any means and is graded on the regular econ curve. However, do note that even though some people dropped the class after the midterm, those people were no longer included in the curve for the final.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to anyone interested in macroeconomics because it does a great job of going into greater detail than intro macro.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! If you have to take this class for the Econ major, take it with Professor Peters!",
    "Its a requirement",
    "Yes absolutely. It's a requirement for most people but it is also pretty interesting. Just make sure to keep yourself accountable. This is a course you could very easily skip, spend like 2 hours on the psets and still do well in. This is dangerous. I feel like I didn't get as much as if I would have been forced to listen to Prof Peter's lectures.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. The student must know that the course is much more math intensive than I had expected and that great comfort with derivatives and algebra is absolutely essential. The course covers a broad range of topics all of which help to explain the macro economy, some of which are more interesting than others. The student should know that this course requires a sufficient amount of work but is extremely interesting and explaining the world we live in today.",
    "Only if you have to take it for the Econ major. I just think we spent too much time on less important concepts and not enough about what actually matters. His in the news also took up way too much time and then we were left to examine the nuanced details of the slides on our own",
    "It's required, so I suppose. Professor Peters is a nice guy too, so that helps.",
    "Only take this if you have to. The exams are annoying and there tends to be a ton of algebra.",
    "Yes, but just know that it's a lot of math and algebraic manipulations. The theories are kind of hard to understand but interesting overall.",
    "psets will get you if you don't go to office hours (OH are so helpful!!! especially the peer tutors!! they really saved my life), but you can also get by from the slides. You will need to know how to do the psets to do well on the exam. Algebra will be difficult and tricky but honestly that is just a fact of econ at Yale. Michael Peters is a great professor I just wish he made the exams easier pls",
    "Yes, if you are interested.",
    "No, not unless you have to.",
    "Yes, take it. Very chill course. I went to lecture about 4 times and section once and I don't recommend this because Michael Peters is actually a really good professor and very engaging. The material is quite interesting with a lot of algebra and a bit of calculus involved. Math 112 is good enough to get you through this. I got a bit screwed for the midterm because I didn't study for the topic on consumption and didn't do the problem set coz I though it would not be in the midterm based on the past midterms posted. He ended up bring a 15 point question on consumption so I knew I was not scoring above 60\/75 on my midterm. So, be careful of the practice midterms.",
    "Yes, and take it with M. Peters. He is one of the best profs at Yale. A true gem. Prof. Peters is a teacher who KNOWS how to teach properly. He cares about his students, and he makes lectures engaging and interesting. Classes are great. Intermediate macro will be foundational knowledge for other classes, so you probably have to take it to take other classes you're interested in. If you have the chance, take it with Prof. Peters because he makes it all worth it :)",
    "I would recommend this course to students beyond the economics major. You learn about a number of dynamics that profoundly influence politics and the world around us. I think the course also has a lot more to say about history than one might assume at first sight. I think there things in the course that will interest students from all kinds of backgrounds.",
    "If you're taking this class, it's for a requirement of the econ major. Honestly, it wasn't terrible and I thought Michael Peters was a good professor.",
    "yes but only if you have to for econ. i dont think its very useful for anyone else",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other people, and I already have recommended this course to some of my friends. I think that it's really cool how we apply the models and math we use in class to the real world.",
    "Yes. Vital for understanding the past, present, and future of our world.",
    "If you are intending on being an Econ major, take this class with Professor Peters! If you're not, you'll need to really love math & theoretical economics to enjoy this class. That's the fault of the material, not the teaching.",
    "I think most people are taking this because it's required for the econ major, but that said, I would say it was pretty worthwhile. Prof. Peters does a good job of making it clear how these theories are relevant to real life, which is helpful, and he does a great job of walking through the models very clearly in lecture.",
    "Yes it is import for economics",
    "If you are an economics major, this is the intermediate macroeconomics course to take for sure. It was definitely worth the wait. However, if you are not an economics major, or not thoroughly interested in explaining macroeconomic theory through algebra, it is not worth it.",
    "Yes - this is a great course! It (along with intermediate micro) get a bad reputation because EP&E and Global majors take them and find the math hard. However, if you're interested at all in economics, this is genuinely a really interesting course, and not particularly difficult. You'll definitely have to do the weekly psets and devote some time to studying, but it's nothing crazy. Professor Peters lectured very clearly, and the material itself is great.",
    "You are probably taking this class because you have to take it. If you don't have to, you probably shouldn't, but there aren't many other options for macroeconomics at this level.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students that have strong quantitative skills and can keep up with math.",
    "Id recommend the course to someone who likes challenging theories with math",
    "If they're interested in economics, yes.",
    "Yes. It leaves you with a great understanding of macroeconomics.",
    "Yes, but be ready for the kind of quantitative reasoning you have to train to.",
    "Only if the student both enjoyed economics and doing unnecessarily difficult algebra quickly.",
    "I would recommend this course.  The professor is great and the material is somewhat applicable to the real world.",
    "I'm not sure I would take this course if I weren't an econ major, but it definitely could be worthwhile if you are interested in some of the big ideas of how markets function.",
    "Its a prerequisite for Econ. If youre not econ then no",
    "Yes, Id recommend this to any student that is looking to major in economics",
    "no unless required",
    "Yes to Econ majors",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who is genuinely interested in learning macro-economics or if they must take it for the major.",
    "Yes, this class is much better than introductory macroeconomics and not that much more difficult to understand. Highly recommend for anyone interested in economics.",
    "Many of the things learned in this course didnt seem super relevant, some were interesting, but I wouldnt recommend this class unless its required for the students major",
    "Yes, solid class",
    "Yes, this is likely a required course but regardless it was a really well taught class.",
    "Yes, if you have to take it, I would advise taking with Professor Peters.",
    "I would recommend this course -- not only is it required for the econ major, but it gives you a great understanding of financial systems and allows you to take that understanding into international development and policy classes later on.",
    "I personally am a bigger fan of macro economics vs micro, so if you want to take an econ class because you are  curious I think this isn't a bad option if you feel that intro might be a little elementary or slow for you. These lectures are also EXTREMELY professor dependent, so make sure you find out about whoever is teaching it, but I really liked professor Peters, so if he's teaching it I'd recommend it for sure.",
    "I mean most people taking this course are required to. But if you have to take it, TAKE IT WITH MICHAEL PETERS. Literally this man is amazing he is genuinely the kindest professor I have had at Yale and he genuinely cares for each and every one of his students' successes.  The course is tough, and definitely pretty math intensive, so be prepared to brush up on your algebra and basic calculus, but yeah take it with MP.",
    "Yes, I believe the course offers some insight into what macroeconomics really is about and can give a better sense to the student whether economics is the right field to study.",
    "Yes, it's a good class to get a good understanding of the economics that we often hear about on the news: unemployment, inequality, Federal Reserve policy",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as I see it as providing the necessary tools needed to understand the theory behind long run trends in growth between countries as well as the factors that go into that growth. It also teaches students how to utilize mathematical concepts to extrapolate conclusions based on data gathered on economic data.",
    "Yes, the course is interesting and pretty effective in teaching the material. If you are an economics major, you need to take this class anyway and you won't be disappointed."
