                "The class did indeed cover some of the topics which are listed in the syllabus. However, not only did we not get to many of the later topics (which were marginally more interesting), but spend too much time on the theoretical aspects of the topics rather than exploring the functional real-world application of the topics.",
                "Strengths: great introduction to real-world topics that anyone interested in going into business should know about. College students should really know more about this stuff, and I don't think there is any other Econ class that would teach you about this\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes a little too theoretical (studying models without zooming out to look at big picture), lectures are a bit monotonous, there are few evaluations\/assignments so everything is worth a large percentage of your grade",
                "Well-organized",
                "Prof Clayton is a great professor -- his lectures are very clear and he moves at a good pace. The psets are challenging, but doable and very rewarding once you figure out how to do them. The exams are also very fair (both take-home) and help you master the material. Overall, a wonderful class! One weakness may just be that the psets took a while to complete (I would recommend making them slightly shorter, perhaps 2 long problems instead of 3).",
                "Strengths: Lectures and slides were good. Office hours were helpful\r\nWeaknesses: OH were helpful but only twice a week. Didn't get to cover a lot of material because I felt like we spent too much time going over each concept. Would find it more interesting to look at data\/numbers moreso than the micro models. Minor gripe: didn't grade homework on the document so it was kind of tedious to go and have to compare the answers and my homework. Psets felt really hard at times because the examples were not super similar to the lectures.",
                "Good professor, interesting material. Lectures could be more engaging sometimes though.",
                "The professor was great, and was always very clear in lecture and OH. The TA helped as well, and was always responsive in answering questions over email. Lectures in general were fine, but could be a bit dull at times--not really because of the professor but more so because some of the content. It's more theoretical than you might expect from a corporate finance course, and similar to other ECON courses at Yale. Problem sets are long but not too many of them, so it balances out.",
                "Course was good. Maybe more examples",
                "Professor Clayton and the TA Tianhao are extremely kind and always willing to help students understand concepts. I liked that there were four problem sets throughout the course (as opposed to weekly) because this gave students the time to digest the concepts before needing to work on them. I especially liked that the two exams (midterm and final) were take-home. This significantly reduced the stress associated with this course and created flexibility that was particularly fair due to COVID circumstances. \r\n\r\nI wish that problem sets would be returned with not just a final grade, but also with comments on where\/why points were taken off. I also wished that we covered a wider breadth of topics in the course. For example, we spent over two lectures on banking, and over another two lectures on the financial crisis. This led to us not getting to the later half of the topics outlined in the syllabus. I wish that we used a short amount of time to cover those topics (because they are already discussed in depth in other econ courses) and instead took time to do other finance topics that we couldn't otherwise learn about at Yale that were in the syllabus: M&A, for example.",
                "The lectures were incredible concise and the lecture slides were really really helpful. It would have been nice to have shorter psets more frequently.",

                "The strength of the course was the vast amount of material that you learn. However, the problem sets were often times challenging and much harder than what was taught in class.",
                "Amazing course",

                "I appreciated the pace of the lecturer, allowing one to take all of the notes in the allotted lecture time.  I do think that the homework and exams sometimes went beyond the scope of what we learned in class, so maybe that could be improved upon.",
                "Problem sets didnt correlate with lecture material",
                "It is a very bland topic and there's no way around it. But it is a useful topic to know and is presented clearly for the most part. Some of the examples we go over in class can be simplified or maybe we can spend a little more time dissecting the details of the examples for future classes.",
                "It is a good introductory corporate finance course and teaches students the basics of corporate structure, which is very valuable and seems to be hard to come by. However, based on the syllabus, it seems that the course could be restructured a bit to cover all of the material, since our class did not get around to a significant portion of the topics on the syllabus (though perhaps this is because of difficulties due to the online format)."

                "Yes, this is a really great introduction to corporate finance. You don't need a ton of previous knowledge, and you will actually learn a ton over the semester. Anyone interesting in working in a for-profit company would benefit from knowing this stuff.",

                "Yes - interesting and useful",
                "Yeah, I probably would. It's more theoretical than I was expecting, but I think that's just how a lot of ECON courses are at Yale. I enjoyed Professor Clayton--he was always really nice and spoke well in lecture. Because there were only 4 problem sets this year, this class wasn't too bad in terms of workload, although the problem sets can take a while, and they aren't graded entirely on completion like some other courses. The two exams are relatively straightforward, but definitely took longer than the timeframe supposedly allotted for them, so they could potentially be difficult when this class is in person. Overall, a solid elective to take and pretty accessible to anyone studying ECON.",
                "Yes, I learned a lot.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this course to another student if they were interested in finance. However, they should know that this course takes a theoretical, academic approach to understanding corporate finance. While we did cover some facts about the industry, that wasn't the focus of this course. Also, the student should be prepared that the problem sets (and exams) are not a straight-forward application of the lectures but rather require you to go beyond.",
