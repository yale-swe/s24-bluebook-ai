    "Strengths: high engagement, AMAZING professor (Miglianti), manageable workload, didn't feel like a burden",
    "The daily rigor was very helpful, but I wish there could've more emphasis on poetry and music as a means to learn the language.",
    "The strengths of this course are the Italian only rule meaning Italian is the only language allowed to be spoken during class and having quizzes before the exams help with doing better on the exams. A weakness of the course could be the small amount of incorporation of the chapter vocabulary into the course.",
    "Very engaging classwork",
    "Great class, the amount of work is just right but it does require a lot of engagement.",
    "The course incorporates a lot of discussion  and practice speaking, which is great. I think the 3 required events can be difficult for students to attend and I personally didn't gain much from them.",
    "Good pace of material and workload",
    "This is a very strong course, I would only suggest more opportunities to exercise what we have learned and make mistakes."

    "Very fun language to learn.",
    "Would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to be able to actually speak the language after a semester. Knowing another Romance language definitely helps.",
    "Yes! I think I learned a lot in one semester and I really enjoyed it.",
    "Yes, teacher was great and Italian department is very friendly",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to those interested in learning Italian."
