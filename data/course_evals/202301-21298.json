                "Strengths: Reading list was fabulous. Framing for essays and comments on essays were really helpful. This class significantly improved my writing; and you have a lot of room to write on what most interests you. Prof. Hammer (particularly on essays) is fabulous and incredibly kind. Such a joy for a 9am class. Only thing I might change about this course is White Noise on the syllabus and maybe Don't Let me be Lonely.",
                "have only one type of essay assigned and having to write it three times was difficult, especially because i struggle with close readings. although each one was an opportunity to get better, i do not think that this is always the best mode of essay writing to engage in literary analysis. it would've been ideal to have more creative analytic exercises...",

                "Yes, 100% would recommend and with definitely take it with Professor Hammer. Our section was really small which meant you could really take discussion in a direction that interested you (although, admittedly, sometimes made it difficult to go deeply if not everyone was prepared).",
                "I would only take it as part of the american studies requirements; otherwise it isn't particularly targeted towards my literary interests, and I only enjoyed at most half of the syllabus.",
                "Definitely; you get a bigger picture of types of American literature, and you learn how to have conversations with your peers about texts, essays, and more."
