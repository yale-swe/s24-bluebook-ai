                "I learned about antitrust policy and competition economics through the lens of cartels and collusion, vertical and horizontal mergers and acquisitions, and unilateral monopolization and anticompetitive conduct, with a primary focus on the U.S. antitrust enforcement atmosphere and some attention to the European Union. Antitrust policy is incredibly relevant to everyone's daily lives, and this course taught me just how much this topic is often glossed over or ignored.\r\n\r\nThis class was a perfect combination of economic theory from competition economics as well as legal doctrine/jurisprudence all of which contribute to businesses' competitive strategy decision-making as well. It was a really cool experience to have classmates who were mostly School of Management and Law School students, which made all of the discussions we had super thought-provoking and informed by peoples' real-world experiences, and it was great to be able to work in groups with them. Professor Scott Morton is an amazing and engaging professor, and I always looked forward to class - it is well worth the 8:30 am start time and is by far one of the most insightful and interesting classes I have taken at Yale. It was great as an undergraduate to have this exposure to this type of class.",

                "I learned about the history of antitrust law and economics in America. The course taught me to read law cases, connect history to modern issues, and to understand the importance of antitrust to innovation. Skill-wise, I had to do light modeling, research about a recent antitrust case, and write papers.",

                "The course's biggest strength is Professor Scott Morton and the diverse student population that takes the class. It is rare to have such an interdisciplinary student population in one class.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness, I believe, was the fact that we had a group project, paper, and final exam all within the last 2 weeks of the semester, which was a little bit overwhelming. I would suggest eliminating the paper aspect.",
                "Really interesting material with a lot of relevance to deals and transactions in the news! I particularly enjoyed the first half of the course that focused on horizontal mergers. The second half felt a bit more disorganized as we jumped from topic to topic.",
                "This course is very well taught and organized. Prof. Scott Morton gives interesting and engaging lectures and the assignments are well designed to support the learning experience. If I were to make one suggestion, it would be to eliminate the final paper at the end of the course. The paper is mostly a re-do of the final project and creates quite a bit of work for students towards the end of the semester. Otherwise, this was a very well designed class.",
                "Strengths: Fiona is an amazing lecturer who really cares about her students. Course material is very clearly organized.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the second half of the course is less organized by topics and more by firms, which can make it harder to see the larger picture in the class",
                "Professor was fantastic and lectures were very engaging. Perhaps spacing out the assignments (psets) and final paper/presentations more evenly throughout the semester would make the work flow more easily manageable."

The course gives you a primer in such a niche but important area of study, and in an area where law enforcement is relatively weak and toothless, which has resulted in damaging ramifications for society writ large when monopolists are able to run amok. It is by far one of the most insightful, engaging, and intellectually stimulating courses I have taken at Yale.",
