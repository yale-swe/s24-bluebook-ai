   "comments": [
    "Through this course, I was able to gain a thorough understanding regarding the General Chemistry I material. Throughout the course, I felt very confident in the material being taught.",
    "None",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge of how to construct and evaluate chemical equations. I learned how to construct basic chemistry models. I learned about atoms and subatomic particles and interactions between molecules and substances.",
    "Basic introductory chemistry, nothing more or less.",
    "A thorough understanding of the basic concepts of chemistry, such as chemical reactions, bonding, states of matter, thermodynamics, naming compounds, aqueous reactions and forces of attraction (among others).",
    "Analytical mathematical skills.",
    "Good introduction to Chemistry",
    "Though I studied some of the units presented in high school, I gained a deeper love and understanding for the science that explains all around me.",
    "Learned what louis dot structures are and how molecules bond",
    "I gained lots of knowledge about chemistry and quantitative processes. It gave a very good base in chemistry that will be helpful in future classes.",
    "I developed and foster better study habits while learning the material. My knowledge of the basics of chemistry was strengthened.",
    "Time management",
    "I learned basic chemistry stuff - electrons, orbitals, compounds, reactions.",
    "For great course with a great professor. He was very good at explaining concepts and was always willing to explain things in multiple ways if difficult to understand. Overall, this course allowed be to develop more critical thinking skills and apply them to problems involving multiple steps and equations.",
    "In this course, we learned about the basic concepts of chemistry, such as stoichiometry, atom size, shape, electron arrangement, chemical reactions, etc."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weaknesses: There was no peer tutor for the course, so it was hard to get help on Problem sets. Also, the TA was absolutely horrible. Her office hours was at such a bad time.",
    "There was a lot of practice to do per chapter with practice problems, problem sets and discussion section problems, so I got to really learn the material.",
    "Overall, I have no complaints with the course. I found the course very enjoyable as a result of Dr. Cooper being able to explain the material in different ways and keep the lecture engaging.",
    "Speed way too fast, not enough emphasis on problem solving or actually understanding material",
    "The course was designed very well. There were a lot of opportunities to learn as much material as possible. Professor Cooper made himself very available.",
    "Strengths: You learn a lot about concepts and theories, which helps you understand the problems you have to work through in the p-sets better. This class was the right level of difficulty for an intro chem class; it was not too difficult for an introductory course, but it was also not too simple; I felt like I was challenged on exams\/in the p-sets but not to the point that I couldn't figure out what was going on based on what we covered in class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It moves very quickly! Also, I think we should have done more in-class examples of the types of questions that came up in the problem sets.",
    "Strengths: Paul Cooper\r\nWeakness: section where the section leader spoke at all",
    "Well structured and organized. Easy to keep track of the material we were expected to learn.",
    "There is just so much dense information to memorize. it's not even even learning its just blatant memorization.",
    "The strengths of this course include the way classes are set up and the sequence in which material is taught. \r\n\r\nOne thing that could be improved is section. Our sections did not feel like they added much to our understanding because the TA did not really explain concepts. She just gave us a worksheet and then wouldn't really tell us how to do anything. A more structured setting that went over answers would be appreciated.",
    "The Sapling exercises were a definite strength of the course. The differentiation between the practice problems and the problem sets was also a good choice.  These exercises allowed students to practice chemistry knowledge gained in the classroom and apply them. The general pace of the course was nice. One weakness of the course would have to be the discussion sections. They did not help very much (may have been the TA or the general setup of discussion section). I believe the discussion sections would have been much more beneficial if there was more group participation and collaboration on exercises (some people worked alone). Also, posting the answers to the discussion problem questions would have also been helpful in studying and reviewing them (directly after discussion sections have concluded for the week instead of posting all answers directly before the midterm).",
    "Strengths: small class\r\nWeaknesses: I believe, because it was taught by a different instructor, that students did not receive the benefit of having their lowest midterm grade dropped.",
    "Strengths: the organization of the course, the way the textbook and class is laid out is pretty conducive to learning; also, if you can get Paul Cooper, he is amazing! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes, the information is a bit dry. even though the actual content is pretty cool, you dont have the theoretical framework to appreciate how awesome\/groundbreaking the information is! A lot of questions are answered by \"you'll learn that later on\"",
    "Practice problems and problem sets were all relevant and very helpful for solidifying concepts covered in lecture. Lectures were clear, and the professor was very open to questions.",
    "There were very few weaknesses in this course. The only thing I can think of is having a more productive section.",
    "I believe that the way the course is structured- having the second trimester of content be the hardest part of the course- is not exactly the best order to learn the material in. I believe that what we learned in the last trimester of the course would've been better to know before the content in the second trimester. In addition, I believe that having the psets due in person rather than an online version is better for learning and getting feedback."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yup, butter class for any STEM major, but also a prerequisite so theres that",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if taught by Dr. Cooper.",
    "Yes, please offer follow up on the fall",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in chemistry or chemistry-related fields.",
    "I would only recommend it if required as prerequisite. It isn't a very exciting or interesting class but isn't bad either.",
    "Yes, if you are looking to gain knowledge about general chemistry or want to gauge your interest in the subject, I would definitely recommend taking this course; it is a nice introduction to the basics of chem, yet still challenging enough so that you have to think through the problems you are doing and take the time to study the course material as you go.",
    "If your taking it you have to",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, but only because it is mandatory.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to students who are interested in chemistry. It definitely takes work but is doable.",
    "Yes, particularly to beginners who have lesser knowledge of chemistry. It provides a thorough foundation to chemistry.",
    "Yes, because it's a smaller class setting to the required pre-med course.",
    "Yes! Many students take it as a prereq, but I did not and I enjoyed it. if you like chemistry, take it!",
    "Yes! This was a great course that provided a good foundation in chemistry. Anyone interested in chemistry should take this class (but with professor Cooper).",
    "I wouldn't recommend the course to someone unless they are interested in chemistry or need it for their major. The professor makes a difference in the outcome of learning and course assessment, so if someone is able to find a wonderful professor who is teaching this course, then I would recommend it."
