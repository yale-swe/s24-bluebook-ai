There are a lot of support systems built into the course, from extra practice sessions to review sessions before each exam. Since there are so many people who take the course, however, information about exams, especially study resources, were poorly communicated, and instruction from TAs was less effective than it probably would have been with the actual professor.",

                "The structure of the course is clear and easy to follow using the textbook and doing the problem sets to ensure understanding. The classes were quite long and I believe adding just one class and making the average time per class would be better for learning. The explores were a great tool to think about content before the classes, though it seemed that the professor was not always aware that they were there and that they could connect their content with the explores. A formula sheet per chapter would have been great for better connections of content learned.",

I do not recommend this course to someone who isn't willing to attend office hours or some sort of peer tutoring when they're confused. You will be left behind and the exams will not be kind to you."
