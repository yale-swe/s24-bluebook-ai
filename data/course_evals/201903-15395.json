    "I learned the language to discuss complicated cultural, political issues, and borders.",
    "This course encourage learning in knowledge of content and methods. Focusing on the Middle East, as a region, the course utilized ethnographic works to draw out broad themes in specific locations, the work of most cultural anthropology. Our own writing was born from such texts.",
    "Learned how to analyze and critically review an ethnography. Also, how to view societies and situations in the Middle East from a human perspective.",
    "This course has garnered my appreciation for anthropology. Through analyzing various cultures through religious, political, and cultural frameworks, S&P of ME culminates many styles of anthropology to paint a picture of the similarities and differences across Middle Eastern countries."

   "comments": [
    "I loved being taught by two professors, but specifically these two. They brought different opinions and perspectives to each week, and both were incredible. It was also great to read full ethnographies rather than collections of things (which we also did).",
    "This course was highly engaging and thought provoking. The seminar discussion was both focused on the specific readings of the course and themes and ideas beyond these works. The discussions were well directed and opened up space to both better understand the theory or facts behind each topic or country covered, but ask both professors and fellow students real questions to which insightful answers were provided. In this regard, this course was taught exactly how seminars should be, striking a balance between professor and student engagement that enabled actual learning. This course also assigned full books, but often over the course of two weeks. The reading amount was on par with other classes, however, it felt more cohesive and meaningful than many.",
    "Being co-taught was a definite strength. Professors Adlparvar and Siamdoust were both incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about their areas of expertise. Switching off who taught helped keep the class interesting and felt like having two different experiences. They helped facilitate conversation and made speaking up feel easy. Reading half a book a week was also a fantastic idea. Left feeling satisfying about finishing a book and getting to discuss multiple topics of the book without having to cram 400+ pages of reading into one week.",
    "Strengths: With the course being co-taught it allowed for a unique class every week. Additionally, meeting once a week allowed the course material to sink in better rather than having a discussion numerous times a week.\r\nWeaknesses: The reading responses were not graded throughout the course and made it difficult to gauge the quality of students writing to the professor's wishes."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Especially to work with these professors.",
    "This is an excellent course to take for anyone interested in the Middle East, cultural politics, and\/or an introduction to anthropological methods. It is also a great course for anyone not super interested in any of those things but wants an engaging class which encourages student growth.",
    "100%. The professors are incredible. They are so knowledgeable about the course material and very willing to meet outside of the classroom to meet and help their students. They teach very well together and facilitate classroom discussion well. The subject matter is also important, especially in this day, about looking to see the Middle East through a more humanistic perspective.",
    "Yes, but only if the are really interested in the material. At times, the specificity of the topics, such as drag racing in Saudi Arabia, may seem arbitrary compared to discussions of revolution and political upheaval, for example."
