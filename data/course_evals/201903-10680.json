    "I learned more about the field of tech law.",
    "Legal analysis, basic knowledge of internet infrastructure",
    "I found that copyright is super interesting, which I didn't realize before! Professor R-- Brad made it funny and accessible.",
    "I learned how to assess and interpret the law when it regarded copyright law, fair use, cybersecurity, and the tangential effects of the Internet on society. I also learned how to interpret court cases with a legal emphasis on technology.",
    "I learned a lot about how technology is progressing at a rate that society is not necessarily equipped to handle",
    "Knowledge: understanding of shortcomings of copyright law",
    "I learned about law (previous I knew nothing about law!)",
    "A lot about the law. Copyright and the works. A lot",
    "I didn't think that I had learned that much, but when the time came to write a 20 page paper, it turns out I somehow knew a lot of information about the law. It's definitely a class based on Brad preaching, but he does make sure you learn some stuff.",
    "I developed a greater knowledge of copyright law and fair use. Brad made us think critically about what the law is versus what it should be and the gaps in our current legal system.",
    "Knowledge of the boundary between fair use and copyright infringement, privacy, etc.",
    "We learned in class about the intersections between modern technology and the law: first amendment rights, fair use, privacy, etc",
    "In this course, I developed the skills to read, understand, and intelligently argue about legal cases.  In particular, I gained in-depth insight into copyright law, and the law related to technology in our modernizing times.",
    "I learned about fair use, copyright law, and also discovered a lot of great Youtube material and memes",
    "I learned some anecdotal pieces of knowledge but nothing of note.",
    "Copyright, fair use, search and seizure in the digital age, privacy, access, and all sorts of good stuff",
    "I learned so much from this class. The entire classes focuses on different ways the law governs, or attempts to govern, cyberspace and interactions that take place online. Much of the class is spent focusing on copyright and fair use. We also discussed privacy, defamation, hate speech, piracy and much more.",
    "Learned a lot about copyright and fair use; what we can, can't, and should say on the Internet; libel and slander; privacy and security -- and the important legal cases that go with each of these topics.",
    "great overview course on the law's role in tech.",
    "I developed specific knowledge according to constitutional laws and court cases around the transofmring world of technology. It's really interesting looking at how our world is changing by analyzing new laws and specific issues that arise with advanced technology.",
    "We explored the intersection of law, social norms and our use of technology. This class really showed how legality does not equate to morality, and how the law often cannot keep up with technology. We also delved into interesting and pressing concepts, like privacy, copyright and fair use, etc.",
    "I developed my critical thinking skills in this class, as well as my reading skills when it comes to law cases.",
    "Intersection between law and technologt",
    "How to make logical arguments and think critically about existing technology law",
    "I learned the basics of fair use, copyright, defamation, privacy, and lots about memes and music videos.",
    "I learned about copyright law, free speech on the internet, and technology's impact on society. Beyond that, I gained an affinity for Claire's, an appreciation for being a college student, and a good selection of videos to show my friends.",
    "This class is super interesting. I came in expecting that the readings would only be court cases and we would have in depth analyses of the law. Rather, we talked about more broad concepts and about how technology affects our society in ways that we could relate to. Brad also made the class super fun and engaging because his lessons would include pop culture connections and give out cupcakes to people who participated.",
    "This class teaches you a lot about the problem of the law in the age of technologies. There were a lot to do with copyright and privacy laws.",
    "How to think independently and remove oneself from bias, how to analyze dense pieces of writing, how to challenge currently held beliefs, and much much more",
    "Basic understanding of copyright law as it relates to technology",
    "I learned about copyright law and fair use, what constitutes transformative fair use, and how online identity and anonymity is evolving.",
    "Not much ngl. I guess I know more about fair use now?",
    "- Broad understanding of and exposure to current tech law, ranging from copyright and fair use doctrines to the difference between parody and satire",
    "Copyright law and laws reflecting technology in general",
    "I learned about the ins and outs of copyright law, free speech on the web, privacy, and technological mechanisms important to these concepts.",
    "The main skill that I developed by taking this course was the ability to analyze a situation in through a legal perspective and figure out how the scenario relates to legislation. I gained much knowledge on copyright, information privacy, technology, and the legal loopholes and legislation gaps our current system has.",
    "I learned about the intersection between law and technology. It was particularly interesting to see how the nuances of law dramatically affected the interpretation of law and how the fast development of technology has made it difficult for regulation.",
    "Important cases and analyzing legal documents for arguments.",
    "basics of copyright law",
    "I learned about how the law responds to advancements in technology and have gained a deeper understanding of the inequality between the law's intentions and its practice. This was also my first time reading court cases so those are much less intimidating now.",
    "Analysis of material",
    "basic knowledge about law relating to technology and media",
    "I didnt gain any new skills. A handful of readings taught me more than all the lectures I went to combined. I say the lectures I went to because at some point I realized they were mostly a waste of time. Seriously. People skip going to this class not just because its known to be an easier course but because going to lecture is just not helpful. Brad will talk about the relevant topic for maybe 10 total minutes? The rest of the time is Brad trying to be funny\/gimmicky\/relatable before he gets lost in rabbit holes about how wacky\/funny he thinks he is.",
    "Learned a lot about many subjects surrounding the law and technology, including fair use, privacy and hate speech. Because of Brad's teaching style, I feel like I learned this in a way that will stick, rather than in a way I will forget.",
    "I learned much about the specific law regarding technology and how it can't keep up with technology's rapid pace.  I also learned so much more about the role culture plays in both those things through looking at case law, legislation, tech advances, and cultural phenomena.",
    "I developed a new understanding and appreciation for the study of law, our legal system, and how it all relates to our modern remix culture. Some of the major topics covered were copyright, privacy, fair use, and free speech.",
    "An awesome overview of copyright law, free speech  intertwined with current topics such as YouTube, twitter, etc.",
    "Copyright \/ fair use law, legal standard for defamation, net neutrality, privacy, and more topics intersecting law with technology",
    "I now have an understanding of copyright law, privacy, fair use, free speech and how it applies to our current digital world.",
    "This course is a fabulous and unique introduction into copyright law, privacy law, and free speech. Brad is such a fun, unconventional lecturer, and you will learn so much without even realizing it. This class gives you a unique perspective into the link between technology and the law and how the law fails to keep up with new issues that arise with growing technology.",
    "amazing class!!! so fun so relevant!",
    "I learned so incredibly much by taking this course.  I was previously not particularly well-versed in the legal side of technology policy, let alone specific cases and their decisions, but I learned all of them through this class. If you want to understand fair use and free speech law, as well as early internet culture, this is a great class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There were a lot of readings, and I think more people would've done more readings if the amount expected for each class was lowered slightly. Strengths: Brad is an incredible lecturer and people were engaged because of him.",
    "AMAZING",
    "I think that there could be a more standardized way of grading that was more responsive. I think the sheer volume of text required for the reading responses made it difficult for TAs to grade and return them in a timely fashion.",
    "The strengths are the quality of the teaching, class discussion, as well as readings selected. The weakness could be a lack of communication on grading and general communication between TAs and students.",
    "People need to listen to Brad when he says to start the reading responses early",
    "I think this course was not very well structured for student learning. There's no syllabus, the readings are posted very late, and the class is oftentimes cancelled last minute. I understand that this is a part-time job for Brad, but it really feels like just that - a part time job. I truly believe that Brad cares about the subject and about fostering a classroom environment that was missing when he went here, but oftentimes I feel like his charisma and jovial spirit are the only things that make this class worth going to.",
    "Strengths: repeats same topics in way that you won't forget them\r\nWeakness: class cancelled often, not much feedback",
    "The major strength was Brad -- an incredibly knowledgeable and energetic professor.  This course's major weakness was the feedback system -- I had submitted two reading responses before October recess and didn't get one of them back until after Thanksgiving.  I still haven't received two of them back or my midterm.  While the TFs' workloads increase throughout the semester (for both grading in this class and their other activities), this is entirely predictable and should be planned for in advance.",
    "Great class. Amy was super annoying though... I cringed every time she said something. Also, some of the favorites kept talking too long",
    "It's actually a lot of reading, which is sometimes hard to get through. It's not always obvious which readings need to be done - some are really important and some are just dumb YouTube videos that Brad likes. Lecture is entertaining - if you like Brad. Figure that out before you decide to take the class. I didn't receive a single grade back all semester and the semester is now over.",
    "Strengths: cupcakes every class, unique teaching style, unique class experience (aka watching an hour of youtube on some days). Weaknesses: the syllabus did not seem planned out. Didn't most grades. If you're ok with a slightly disorganized and ambiguous grading system then that won't be a problem.",
    "The class is super engaging but structurally flawed.",
    "Strengths: extremely entertaining, \"easy\", interesting, totally unique\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not a ton of structure, unpredictable\/uneven, no feedback",
    "There are several strengths of this course.  In particular, I would say the course is successful in training students to think with a legal mind.  It is one of the few courses at Yale that gives students practical experience in law.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint may be that no assignment but the first was returned with a grade.  However, our instructor was available to answer questions about grades if we were concerned.",
    "This course is absolutely incredible, I wouldn't change a thing except that I wish it lasted forever",
    "This course was terrible. Brad was condescending, arrogant, and not helpful. The TA's just picked apart every piece you wrote in an assertive \"I'm better than you\" way. The lectures were not engaging and the assignments were pointless. This class was a waste of time.",
    "Reading responses take *forever* to be graded",
    "Brad is the biggest strength of the course. Engaging doesn't even begin to describe his teaching methods ... he yells, curses and memes throughout the entire class. A HUGE weakness of this course is the lack of communication between the professor\/teaching team and students. They did not return our reading responses on time. For example, I'm completing this evaluation over reading break and I've only received 2\/5 of my reading responses. Keep in mind, I turned some of these in in October. I haven't even gotten my midterm grade back yet!",
    "needs more structure and clarity on how students are doing in the class rather than giving us grades at the end of the semester",
    "Strength of the course was how contemporary the course work was which made every class really enganging. Another strenght is definitely Brad Rosen. He is absolutely one of the funniest and best lecturers I've had at Yale. I would definitely recommend taking a class with him if you have the opportunity. A weakness is the TAs. I got all my graded work back AFTER I left campus after finals. I had no idea what my grade was until AFTER the final project was due which was incredibly stressful. They either need more TA's or better ones.",
    "Weaknesses: it is hard to really gauge your performance in the class. \r\n\r\nStrengths: with a few exceptions, the material is incredibly interesting! The reading responses were helpful in making us think more profoundly about the readings which contributed to our understanding and to class discussion. It is a class that is fun to go to because the material is presented in an interesting and informative way.",
    "I like how this class was taught in a lecture style. However, I it took a long time for me to receive my grades in this class, and I submitted my assignments on time.",
    "There was minimal feedback throughout the course by way of grading and things, didnt get grades back until semester was over",
    "Brad is a very engaging and memorable lecturer  he teaches you things without you even realizing. The course is low workload, but the midterm is challenging if you don't keep up with the readings.",
    "This class could be improved if some basic things could be stated a bit clearly. For instance, if memes are always fair use, it would be great if Brad would just say that memes are always fair use. Although Brad was really clear, I felt that sometimes he talked a little fast and could be hard to understand occasionally. Also, it would be great if we got our grades back sooner. Overall, the class is amazing and Brad really cares that everyone learns and has fun.",
    "Strengths of this course are the reprieve it provides from traditional classes at Yale, the lectures that will engage you, and the learning of technical concepts through real-world examples and personal anecdotes.\r\nThe weaknesses are the amount of readings you have (the lists are very long for each class), the midterm (kind of scary), and the general unknown state of your grade until the end of the semester.\r\nIt could be improved by having a platform to view grades and speeding up the response time for reading responses.",
    "The course, although very fun and interesting, is not very organized. I had absolutely no idea what my grade would be until the very end. The issue is that the grading scale is very arbitrary. I do not know what a 3\/5 means on a reading response vs. a 4\/5. I wish there was more transparency on the grading process - but other than that, the class was fantastic.",
    "The strength of the class will definitely be the professor. Brad is an amazing professor who will tricked you into learning. If you do the readings and pay attention in class, you will do fine. The weakness is that grading does take a while to grade and there doesn't seem to be a rubric on how your reading response is graded.",
    "Interesting readings, but lecture is not so productive. It can be lots of fun, but Brad frequently goes off on tangents unrelated to the class or spends time during class searching Youtube videos to watch. The discussion of memes and internet culture should be updated or the class should be prefaced as focusing on the early 2010's internet culture.",
    "This was honestly one of the worst courses I took at Yale for several reasons. First of all, Brad mentioned how the readings are required for lecture, but honestly most of what we did in lecture was look at Youtube videos and memes. I can honestly say I learned absolutely nothing from lecture and I attended them all. Also, the professor was pretty abrasive and I feel like he did not create an effective learning environment at all. Also he canceled class at least 6 times, which some people might like, but if you're like me and want to get the most out of your Yale education this was somewhat annoying, especially because he assigned a pretty difficult take home midterm. Lastly, the TAs took an extremely long time to grade the reading responses.",
    "Very engaging, I dont think it could be better outside of being more clear about how to achiever certain grades, although for me adapting to the absence of that felt like part of the learning.",
    "The course is exceptionally structured. I genuinely don't think the content could be improved, although I wish that future readings were posted further in advance (rather than on a Monday night for Wednesday's class). The cupcake flavors were never great, although Brad is a sweetheart for the gesture",
    "This course was very entertaining as in I never struggled to be interested by the material or lecture",
    "Strengths: awesome professor, interesting material that I have never studied before but that is very relevant, fun lectures\r\nWeaknesses: timely grading of reading responses\/midterm, readings can be very long (although I presume you could skim them but then you're missing details), lots of cancelled lectures, untimely posting of weekly readings",
    "\"Lecture\" is an absolute disaster. I ended up in this class because a friend went to the first lecture, said it was funny and the class seemed easy, and it fit well with the rest of my schedule. Big mistake. While Brad can admittedly be funny at times, overall he's just obnoxious and eager to prove he's always right about everything. Somehow, Brad never fails to make me cringe even though I usually agree with him (although the proportion of class when I can follow his rambling well enough to agree or disagree is quite small). The assignments for this class were equally absurd, with scattered reading responses that don't really have to respond to anything in particular and a midterm that's indescribably annoying. I guess, though, I'm still not sure how exactly to feel about the assignments because even as I'm writing this--a week after final exams--I have only two grades in this class, which collectively comprise 12.5% of my final grade. I've experienced some slow grading in my time at Yale, but this is on another level. In other words, please grade my assignments Brad, and apologies if this is scattered or hard to follow but you really shouldn't expect anything else.",
    "- Brad is an amazing instructorknows how to keep the audience engaged and easily tied in relatable personal stories and anecdotes into rather dry excerpts from Supreme Court cases and doctrines about Internet law",
    "Great class learned a lot",
    "Strengths: Brad Rosen is an incredible professor. Hes able to teach very complex and nuanced topics with ease while keeping everyone engaged.\r\nWeaknesses: feedback for reading responses is often very late and unhelpful to improvement.",
    "Strength: great lecturer\r\nWeakness: grading scale was non-existent \/ misleading, it was very difficult to get feedback since most assignments were graded after the class ended. The reading assignments could also be posted all at once in the beginning of the course so that there is sufficient time to work on the reading responses.",
    "Although the material\/teaching style was engaging, assignments could have been returned in a more timely manner.",
    "This course is not designed to facilitate student learning. You absolutely won't get any grades back until literally AFTER finals.",
    "Brad's teaching style, where themes of the course were constantly repeated and got drilled into your head, worked for me. Sometimes it felt like there were too many readings to digest in preparation for a class period. It would have been nice to have the readings posted with more time in advance so I could get ahead when necessary.",
    "Strengths are that the coursework is interesting and fun, no real weaknesses",
    "brad is a very entertaining lecturer, and everything is very well explained (how grading will be done etc), but the assignments and midterm were quite confusingly graded.",
    "Strengths\r\n-theoretically interesting subject matter!\r\n-the readings were good!\r\n-pretty easy class (Brad is insecure that people call this course a gut and will tell you, repeatedly, that it isnt. It absolutely is. Its tied for the guttiest gut Ive taken at Yale.)\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-Brad\r\n-you dont get any grades back before winter break (literally between me and 4 friends, only one of us had had even a single assignment graded before the course was fully and completely over)\r\n-lecture is completely useless",
    "Strength is Brad! He is an incredible professor and cares so much about his students and their learning. Most engaging lecture I have ever had. Somehow even in a lecture of 100+, Brad is able to know and develop a relationship with students individually in the class.",
    "I really would have loved more time to do the readings.  \r\nAlso getting feedback on my reading responses earlier would have been grand.",
    "Having a much more detailed syllabus would be very helpful.",
    "I thought this was a really great course.",
    "Great Professor and TAS",
    "This course was great in how interesting the material was in and of itself, and how engaging class time was with Brad. However, the class could be improved by having more feedback throughout the semester (I submitted reading responses in regular intervals, and I still did not get most of them back until the last week of the semester \/ during winter break).",
    "The weakness of this course is pretty insignificant, which is that you dont know how youre doing in the class for a very long time. Even if you do get your reading responses in at the start, you wont get them back for a while. There are so many strengths to this course: Brad, the videos we watch in class, how entertaining class is, and how application based the course is. Brad is so engaging (if hes your teaching style, for some hes not) and truly transforms seemingly mundane laws and topics with his classes.",
    "The course is fabulously taught and has very interesting material, but you don't get grades back until after the end of the semester, so it is hard to figure out how you are doing. Regardless, grades at the end of the day are extremely fair.",
    "so engaging. a lot of reading that theoretically isnt required to do well in the class. but you should do it anyway!",
    "An excellent course, and very engaging.  It will keep you engaged and, if you go to lecture, you'll learn"

    "Yes, if they are comfortable with ambiguity regarding their grade and are willing to put in a significant amount of effort to do all the readings.",
    "YES; SO FUN",
    "I think if you're looking for a fun fifth class then yes, but it's not a class to be taken lightly--it's not nearly as fun if you haven't done the readings and so you can't follow the discussion\/contribute to the conversation.",
    "Definitely shop the class to see if you like Brad's teaching style. The reading responses are a lot more work than they seem to be - they have to be pretty long and include a 'thesis.' Also, be prepared to not receive many grades back: he told us that this happened in the past because people submitted responses too late in the semester, but I submitted most of mine in the first half and did not receive feedback until the last week of class or later. Lectures are entertaining, but when it came to the midterm I didn't feel like I had actually learned much that could be applied.",
    "Yes! It is an excellent course to learn a variety of topics relating to the cyberworld that are so important in a digital age.",
    "yes i would! learn about super cool law stuff! very intersting class",
    "Yes. Absolutely. Very different from other lectures. Sneakily informative. Very informal and entertaining. However, Brad's brashness is not for everyone.",
    "Shop this class, but don't confuse entertainment with education. Brad is funny, energetic, and charismatic, but make sure you think twice about if this style of teaching is right for you. It is for some people, and it isn't for others. That being said, if you end up taking this class, you will have a BLAST and will NOT be bored.",
    "Yes, Brad's an interesting lecturer",
    "I'd whole-heartedly recommend this course -- many great learning opportunities structured in fun ways, but know the following caveats before taking it:\r\nA. Feedback is slow\/non-existent.  We still haven't received comments\/grades on our midterms or most of our reading responses.\r\nB. As a result, if you're self-conscious about *needing* an A, this class may not be for you.  My understanding is that grades all work out fine in the end, but  the specifics are blurry.\r\nC. You need to do the readings to understand the details of what's going on in class :(.  \r\nD. Brad's a character -- shop lecture before sealing your schedule so you know what you're getting into!\r\nAdditionally, here's the list of assignments for the class, since I couldn't find them anywhere before the semester:\r\nA. 5 Reading Responses (lowest is dropped)\r\nB. Take-Home Midterm\r\nC. Final Project",
    "Go during shopping period and make sure you can stand Brad. Hes rambunctious, but will make you learn. Also, dont take notes, its better that way",
    "I can't tell if I'd recommend this course. You have to really like Brad's style, which you can figure out during reading period. The grading being so slow is honestly a huge negative on the class. I wish I had gotten a single grade back all semester. It's definitely a gut, but if you don't do the reading you'll hit a brick wall on the midterm.",
    "I very much enjoyed many aspects of this class, but I would not recommend it for everyone. Brad has a very particular personality that many people can't handle for a whole semester. I would think critically while shopping: he acts the same way twice a week for the whole semester. The cupcakes are great, and I found the class very interesting and though-provoking. I found the readings pretty boring because they were mostly court case reviews, but that is mostly personal preference. All in all, if you want a unique experience, can handle an ambiguous syllabus, and like his flamboyance, go with Brad.",
    "This course is great for a student who's sick of the typical old professor lecturing or running a seminar about super intellectual topics because this course is fun, engaging, and employs modern technology like memes and youtube videos in order to teach.",
    "If you are a student who needs a lot of structure and feedback, don't take this course. Otherwise, you should just see Brad lecture and decide for yourself!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.  It is one of the few courses for which attending each lecture is truly a pleasure.  You will absorb a lot of knowledge and skills through listening in lecture before even touching the course readings, which is a remarkable testament to Brad's wonderful teaching.  The course readings are also very engaging; many are online articles and blog posts that you may have stumbled upon and wanted to read anyway.  Nothing in this class will ever feel like a burden; it is all enjoyable.",
    "Absolutely. Brad is an incredible professor who finds innovative ways to engage students and get them to understand and apply the material. Definitely sit in on the first class and see if it's for you, and if it's not you shouldn't stay, but if you do you will have a great time.",
    "No. This course was terrible. Brad was condescending, arrogant, and not helpful. The TA's just picked apart every piece you wrote in an assertive \"I'm better than you\" way. The lectures were not engaging and the assignments were pointless. This class was a waste of time.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a student who is excited to learn about the internet and is not bothered by a lack of organization. Good luck!",
    "You've probably heard a lot about this class --  just shop the first lecture and see if you vibe with the teaching style. It's not that different from other courses in that yes you can get away with not doing a bunch of readings, but then you just learn less and are confused in class. Brad's stories are fun and sometimes you watch a lot of videos in class (believe it or not that can get old and sometimes you actually want Brad to lecture more). The topics are interesting, the midterm is fair, and the final project can be fun if you have a group to work with.",
    "Yes - it was a really fun class that dealt with really interesting material that I just haven't really learned about. It was a great look into many aspects of the law without diving too deep into it.",
    "I would recommend this course because of Brad Rosen and the combination of low course load and interesting topics. It's definitely not a computer science course so don't let that fool you into thinking it's computer science level work. The class is light-hearted and if you pay attention the responses are a breeze plus there are only 5 of them and the lowest grade is dropped. P.S. Claire's cupcakes in every class!",
    "Yes, especially if you are interested in the topics it explores. Brad is great and the class is really interesting (this was the class I actually looked forward to going to the most).",
    "I would recommend this close to another student l, especially because I got a lot out of the combination of a law class applied to a STEM field. Although law classes are intellectually challenging, I feel that this class helped develop my critical thinking skills.",
    "Yes, make sure you're actually interested in the material because if you are and actually do the readings, you'll get a lot out of it, but Brad is a fantastic lecturer so definitely worth it",
    "I would, but I would say to tread lightly if you are one who is worried about your grade because the lack of feedback and clear guidelines\/standards for work submitted can be frustrating",
    "Yes, please take it! It's so much fun and you get cupcakes!!!",
    "Yes! If you find your schedule is a bit bland and you want something to spice it up, this is the course for you! If you may want to go to law school, this would be a great course to take! If you have some friends\/ acquaintances that you want to take a class with, take this with them!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to someone who would like to learn more about law in a more casual classroom setting. Anyone interested in pursuing computer science should also take this course.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they are somewhat interested in learning about privacy, copyright, fair use, etc. Furthermore, this class may not be for everyone if you don't like the way Brad teaches. At times, the readings will to be tedious. However, the themes of the reading interconnects and it would be fine to quickly skim it. I was definitely unfamiliar with the format of the reading responses and was worried when I received my first grade back. However, the score does not correlate to a regular grading scale so don't be too worried. As long as you do the assignments and pay attention, this class should be pretty easy.",
    "Absolutely not. Don't waste a Yale course on watching YouTube videos all lecture. I only learned things from doing the readings and felt that Brad did not actually teach us anything that was useful for the midterm.",
    "110% yes. If you put the effort in, do all the readings before class, and actually engage with the material, this is literally one of the best courses you could possibly take both in terms of information received as well as skills gained.",
    "Absolutely! Brad Rosen is a brilliant and engaging lecturer, it is a unique experience and the best Ive had in my 3 years at Yale",
    "Absolutely--you MUST take this course. Hilarious professor, very intellectual content, and a great time overall.",
    "Yes if you're okay with Brad's teaching style. This will not be a very typical course where the professor just lectures off the slides and you take tons of notes. Brad offers lots of anecdotes and challenges the class with hypotheticals",
    "Overall, yes I would recommend but there are a few things you should know...\r\n\r\nPros: Brad is awesome, funny, and very entertaining. I honestly looked forward to lecture and he does a great job of highlighting the main concepts. The final project is a fun and not stressful way to end the semester that still lets you incorporate big ideas from the class. He gives out cupcakes in lecture for asking\/answering questions. \r\n\r\nCons: I think Brad's teaching outweighs these cons BUT here they are:\r\n-I didn't receive my graded reading responses or midterm back until late December (over break) despite sending many emails to the teaching team. They either ignored me or said they were busy. Not having any feedback makes it very hard to actually improve your thoughts\/writing about the readings.\r\n-We had 6 cancelled lectures. Since lecture is actually enjoyable, this was a bummer and a missed learning opportunity.\r\n-The readings for Monday classes were usually posted on Saturday, allowing little time to do all of the readings and write a good response by 10:30pm Sunday night (responses are due the night before lecture). A lot of times the readings are the same as last year's but it would be so easy for Brad to post the links sooner (which I did ask him about but it didn't happen)...it's kind of disrespectful to put us in a time crunch on the weekends like that.\r\n-Sometimes the readings are repetitive and simply way to long. I understand Brad is trying to familiarize us with case law but sometimes there will be a very long case that we read but never discuss in class and we could have just gotten the gist on Oyez or something like that. \r\n-the names of the TAs\/ULAs weren't posted until over halfway through the semester (also asked about this) so other than the TAs that handed out cupcakes, we had no clue who the other ones were",
    "Definitely not. Arbitrary and opaque grading with zero structure or coherence. Learned more about technology and the law from reading the news each morning.",
    "- If you are looking for a relatively chill course that will introduce you to the very important and applicable world of tech privacy and law making (and if you are a particular fan of Key of Awesome videos), you will enjoy this course! A CS background is definitely not necessary to enjoy this class.",
    "Yes great class",
    "People either love or hate Brads style of teaching. If you do the readings, come to lecture, and try to cultivate a friendship with Brad, youll get a lot out of this course. If youre looking for a straightforward Credit\/D, you can also have a good time. Definitely recommend, though its not for everyone.",
    "Yes! It is a very important class to take to take for anyone who uses the internet.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students simply because it provides an insight to how modern technology (which we all use and will continue to use at an increasing rate in the future) is ill-regulated and may be used against us.",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely not. Unless it's a pass\/fail 5th class situation, don't take this class.",
    "I would if you can handle Brad. He's eccentric and wonderful and very much a lot and that feeds into the class. I'm not going into law but I feel like I can really engage more with issues in tech affecting me like net neutrality and fair use and that's pretty cool.",
    "Yes, the skills i gained in my ability to analyze material were furthered by the course",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, this is a great course to get a good understanding of law as relating to our current world of technology. It is a good credit D but you will still have to put a decent amount of effort in.",
    "Good course if youre looking for a gut. Not so great otherwise.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student at Yale! Brad's teaching style is different great for some but not for others who prefer more traditional (I'd say dry) classes so definitely shop the class and see if it's for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. This course radically transformed my understanding and appreciation for law. There is never a dull class; it is always very engaging. Brad Rosen is quite a character and is intimidating at times, but he is part of the reason this course is amazing.",
    "Yes!!! I definitely would. Its not the classic style for learning, but you remember SO MUCH and the material is super interesting.",
    "Yeah It's fun",
    "I would recommend this class if you like Brad's teaching style (you'll know from day one) and are interested in the ways that we can or cannot control\/supervise\/govern online behavior and practices.",
    "Yes  a million times. If you can take this, please do!! It was one of the best courses Ive taken at Yale. If you take it, GO TO CLASS. Class is by far the best part of the course and Brad is so fun and enthusiastic about everything we talk about. You will also be way better off on the midterm because youll actually have material\/examples to use (that arent covered anywhere in the readings) and you wont be totally lost and freaked out when it comes to the midterm. Youll also get a better grade if you come to class (Brad will directly tell you this) and its so worth it.",
    "If you are interested in the link between technology and the law I would highly recommend taking this course. Anyone who is going into the tech or law sectors should take this course.",
    "yes! very different from any other yale class you will take",
    "Would highly recommend for Brad Rosen alone, to say nothing about the course material"
