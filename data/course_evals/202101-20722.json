We concentrated on learning the basics of the language during the first half of the course, but by mid-spring we were reading Plato's Apology in the original Greek and analyzing the text with an eye to the syntactical, stylistic, philosophical, and historical details embedded throughout.",

You learn so much Greek grammar and reading a real text really helps show you the most common things to expect and to look out for going forward.

                "I found the structure of this course to be great in that it was difficult, but well paced, with multiple opportunities given to pick up and practice concepts. As long as one is willing to put in a significant amount of time each evening, effectively making Greek 1/6 of their life, they will succeed.",
                "The strengths of this class are many. The grammar portion of the class was very thorough and comprehensive, and the prose composition exercises were extremely helpful in fitting all of the different pieces together. I really enjoyed the drills and exercises we did together in break-out rooms, which were very helpful for solidiyfing concepts. I also liked that we practiced reading Greek out loud together, as this showed me how the language would have sounded when it came to life. We were well-prepared to read the Apology in the latter half of the term  it was truly thrilling to see how far we had come in our study of Greek.",
                "This course is great, honestly there is no way to improve it. And the main reason why is Prof. Robinson. He loves his students and is such an engaging and kind lecturer. He is always super energetic and loves helping his students learn greek. Ive never had a teacher more dedicated to his students than Robinson! Also hes a absolute hoot, so funny  and has great stories. This man is an all around gem!",
                "The course is extremely fast pace and you will definitely need to put in the time and effort to keep up. We went through 18 units in the Hansen & Quinn textbook within the span of 2 months with additional grammar topics sprinkled throughout that were not covered in the textbook. Afterward, we read through the entirety of the Apology in a month which is significantly harder (but doable) than anything seen in the textbook. That being said, the large amount of topics covered in this course makes for an immersive and enriching experience. Despite being difficult, the progress you will make by the end of the semester will be immense. The only weakness of this class is the fact that there really isn't a syllabus until you begin reading the Apology but I don't really think that's the fault of the professor. The rate at which the class goes changes from year to year and Professor Robinson adjusts the schedule based on his assessment of the class and how comfortable everyone is. I personally think that makes the learning even more enriching since he ensures that people are ready and able to move foward.",
                "None. Professor Robinson was outstanding.",
                "Strengths: You will learn a lot if you are in this course. It is an excellent way to get a solid knowledge of the Ancient Greek language. Professor Robinson is also quite (possibly too much so) understanding about absences or unwillingness to translate at a particular time. If he sensed we were getting bored with translation, he would tell us some story or ask a philosophical question about the text, which made it a little less monotonous. Weaknesses: The class can drag on a bit and feel a little monotonous, but it is still worth it. Two hours every morning is a lot, and if possible would be better served by being later in the day. Professor Robinson can also occasionally be a little harsh if you don't understand something quickly, but this doesn't happen too often.",
                "Its a very intense experience! I think it could only be improved if it were offered in person.",
                "Strengths: frequent meetings each week kept the information fresh, and the prose comps were very engaging and helpful applications of what we had learned; also, reading real Greek as a class bolstered our understanding of poetic meter and the flow of Attic Greek.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not necessary something that could have been helped this year but physically being in a classroom and having to read Greek in the presence of other people (opposed to a screen) would have demanded more confidence and capability",

Generally, you cover 2 or 3 units a week with around 20-30 vocab words per unit and weekly prose writing assignments on top of that. Plus Ancient Greek is not an easy language either. The amount of grammar that is taught is immense and there are some linguistic topics in between as well. Ancient Greek can be confusing and difficult but Professor Robinson is an absolutely amazing professor! He will ensure that you are on top of the material and is always willing to help you catch up or review any topics. Take this class if you have any interest in Ancient Greek and are looking for an immersive experience! The work is definitely a lot but the amount of knowledge that you will learn will make it worthwhile.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Robinson is a true gem. He obviously loves Greek, antiquity, teaching, and, most of all, he loves his students. He is a truly bright light not just in the classics department but at Yale at large. I am truly honored to have taken a class with professor Robinson.",
                "If a student wants to learn Ancient Greek, I would highly recommend this course. If a student is simply looking to fulfill a language requirement, I think this course is not for them as it is a substantial commitment. I would also caution any student who is planning to take this course to select their other courses carefully, as this will consume much of your time and energy.",
                "If you want to learn Ancient Greek, this is the class to take. You will learn a lot, and the more you apply yourself, the more you will learn. It is not an easy language credit by any means, so only take it if learning Greek is your goal.",
                "Absolutely! It opens up the door to ancient Greek literature! Its intense, but definitely worth the effort!",
                "Absolutely\r\nProfessor Robinson is a remarkable teacher both in competency and in humility, and his course includes content and insight that would not easily be found elsewhere.
