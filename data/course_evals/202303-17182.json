                "I learned a lot about the history of the Roman Republic by analyzing primary and secondary sources along with Professor Johnston's lectures.",
                "I learned so much about ancient Rome from its founding to the end of the Republic. I also learned the historiography which is a key element in understanding ancient Rome. I feel like I know everything about the Republic now.",
                "You learn the history of the Roman Republic very thoroughly, but you also learn about history in general  how to engage with it, read primary sources, how history is written (historiography), etc",
                "Learned Roman history from the very beginning to the end of the republic, as well as insights of historians and primary sources like Livy and polybius.",
                "This course provided thorough and engaging discussions of the Roman Republic.",
                "I developed a much greater understanding of Rome and the culture of the time.",
                "I learned, generally, about the origins of Roman history and the Republic.",
                "Writing, grasp of historical sources",
                "This was a great overview course of the rise and fall of the Roman republic. I went into the course not really knowing anything about Rome and this course does a great job going chronologically through its development as an imperial power while also highlighting cultural, social, political, and economic development that coincided",
                "I learned so much in The Roman Republic, not just about history, but also about Roman culture and thinkers who would shape the later empire. I greatly enjoyed Professor Johnston's lecture styles and organization as we drew back on earlier elements of Roman identity throughout the course and events covered.",
                "The best skill learned from this course: to always be interrogating and analyzing historical (and present) sources! We can rarely take Roman sources at their face value, and this course was a wonderful introduction into examining sources for what they say, what they do not say, and how the political, cultural, and other contexts surrounding the author may have affected and biased their writings. This is an incredibly valuable skill for all areas of life, and I think that it was great to develop it with a topic as interesting as the ancient Romans.",
                "Nice insight into the Roman republic",
                "understood the Roman Republic a lot better, feel confident with this part of history. drew a lot of links to help me understand the relevance of the Roman republic for modern day western society and politics. I loved this course, one of the highlights of my week",
                "I gained a greater ability to explore classical antiquity. I had never taken a class in Classical Civilization before, but this class led to a further appreciation for Ancient Rome and Classical Antiquity. The lectures were very engaging and the writing assignments also allowed for me to explore topics of interest."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths:\r\n- Immense breadth of material, both primary and secondary, amplified by additional reading for section.\r\n- Fascinating lecture slides filled with images, artwork, maps, diagrams, archaeological findings, pictures, scrolls, etcenlivens the lecture and provides a comprehensive perspective into the Roman Republic\r\n- A passionate and fast-paced lecturing style\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Huge variability in the experience of the section instructor\r\n- Occasionally excessive judgment of ancient figures based on a contemporary framework",
                "Lectures are a little long and therefore rarely completed in the designated class.",
                "This was a great course but there were a lot of readings, so my only improvement would be to scale back on the amount of assigned reading",
                "Strengths is that Professor Johnston is a great lecturer and very passionate about Roman history. He could talk about it for hours. You learn a lot and it is challenging in terms of amount of work and knowledge that you need to retain for midterm and final. Weakness is the amount of information that you have to retain that it feels a bit overwhelming, but I think this is just the nature of the course.",
                "The course has a high workload that might dissuade some people from taking it, which is unfortunate because it's such an incredible course. The weekly quizzes are the hardest part, but they are meant to push you to be actively engaged, and it works, so I can't really say anything should be improved or changed. Lectures are so intriguing and fun, tests are fair, section is dope.",
                "Strengths: lecture notes and reading posted, professor is engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a ton of reading, not always doable or necessary",
                "I loved this course and think the lectures are incredible. The sections were also very helpful in going beyond lecture material. The only weakness I would say would be the final paper and exam being due so close to one another.",
                "The lectures were really very good.",
                "Strengths: Professor Johnston is an amazing instructor. His lectures are lucid and his depth of knowledge is apparently infinite. Another strength of the course is its rigor. Two exams and two papers is a significant amount of work, but I found that it pushed me to become a better historical thinker. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: In my experience, the course sections were misguided. The sections are on a different track than the lectures. In principle this is effective because it broadens our understanding of the period. In practice, however, I found this strategy to be ineffective. The course assigns a great deal of reading. As such, rather than reading still more only to spend a handful of minutes glossing over it, I would have appreciated the opportunity to deepen my understanding of material that we were already assigned to read.",
                "One of the main strengths was the lectures. They were very intriguing and well taught. Professor Johnston is a great storyteller and he clearly knows his stuff so well. I was genuinely excited to go to lecture and it helped me be more excited about doing the assignments. One things thats less of a weakness but more of a caution is that it does have a decent amount of work. Not only are there weekly graded quizzes but you also have a mid term, mid term paper, final and final paper along with a weekly section and the required readings for that. Fortunately if you are interested in the material its not as difficult to do but if its something youre not sure about I could see the work becoming a little overwhelming or tedious. Also because there was so much work it seemed like it became a lot for the TAs, who are grad students so still also in school, to grade very fast. This meant that assignments wouldnt come back for a while.",
                "I did not find any weaknesses in the course. I enjoyed all of the writing assignments, and found the quizzes helpful in memorizing the most important elements from each lecture.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-The lectures are incredibly engaging, Prof. Johnston is a great professor, and his lectures are definitely worth every second you spend in them.\r\n-The TFs. The sections were quite well done, and my TF, Andre, was very helpful for the planning and preparation for the final essay.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Test timing. I understand that this is more a thing with the registrar, but the final essay (3000-4500 words), was due a day before the final exam (which consists of 3 essay questions). Professor Johnston gave us ample time to complete the essay, but I think that having the deadline right before the exam invariably meant that one would spend valuable time working on the essay, and have little time to study. I spent a long time on my essay (around 35 hours in total), and it took me around a week of time (I could do other things but had significant chunks devoted to researching and writing), and having the deadline one day before the exam naturally meant that the editing process would expand to fill this time. I understand that this is a time management thing on my part (I did well on the exam anyway), but maybe next time the final essay could be released a bit earlier, and have a slightly earlier deadline to compensate, leaving some cushion for the final exam.",
                "Teacher was awesome",
                "weekly quizzes aren't overbearing, lectures are interesting and I was so sad when I missed them! the only criticism is that we had a good few video lectures to watch at home, which was difficult to fit into my schedule",
                "Strengths: Professor is an incredible lecturer and his passion/knowledge in the coursework was displayed during every class. He also made the midterm realistically easy to prepare for and succeed. Weaknesses: Too much information squeezed into the semester. When the professor couldn't finish the lectures, he'd add it to the next and the information just piled up to the point he made us watch videos in class. We also had sections, and had to read separate texts to prepare for section outside of class. Incredibly high workload.",
                "Strengths: Professor Johnston is a brilliant lecturer. Genuinely one of the best public speakers I've ever seen. And the course content is a lot of fun. The textbook is particularly good. \r\nWeaknesses: Prof Johnston's slides are great, but he always ran out of time, and they format without animations on Canvas, so it's impossible to read some of them. Also, the amount of assigned reading is excessive and no one I know did much of it, except for the stuff needed for section. Assign less and expect more! Students will be more likely to do the reading if it feels do-able! It was also a pain to have the final essay due the day of the final.",
                "Strengths: I loved the multitude of different readings and sources Prof. Johnston gave students to further our understanding of the time period. Although not all were required, many of these sources peaked my interest and allowed for me to have a greater understanding in the historical implications of different events in the Roman Republic.\r\nWeaknesses: To make the lectures more engaging, the lectures could have used video reenactment of certain events from trusted sources. There also could have been some more comparative studies between Rome and Greece, something that peaked my interest greatly."

                "Without a doubt. It is indispensable to have an understanding of the Roman Republic and this course fulfills that necessity spectacularly. The professor is passionate about the material, provides a wide range of readings and possible interpretations, and willing to assist at an individual level. Lectures cover historical facts and general themes. Although the contemporary connections were sometimes strained, they helped us recognize the relevance of the Roman Republic to today. The best part of the course was the slidesartistic, propitious to student learning, and filled with information.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was my favorite class that I took this semester as Professor Johnston's lectures are amazing!",
                "Yes I would. This class teaches you to engage with historiography and challenges you to push yourself. I would not recommend it for a First Yea unless they have learned Roman history before. For anyone else I would recommend this but be prepared for a challenge. It is worth it and Professor Johnston is a great lecturer.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Johnston is the greatest lecturer I've had at Yale. He's a true gem. Now, the courseload is high and the course requires active engagement from you. As long as you are prepared for that, then this course is perfect. Prof Johnston makes the study of not just Roman history but history in general fascinating and fun and inspiring.",
                "Absolutely. This class is one of the best at Yale. Professor Johnston's enthusiasm for the Romans is infectious and the breadth and depth of his knowledge is astounding. The course can be a significant amount of work at times, but only during the midterms and final period (definitely start the paper assignments early). Section readings are always manageable and Johnston's sections are some of the best organized at Yale. Besides that, the extra readings are really optional and there for you if you have the time and interest to dive deeper into a specific topic. This class had me thinking about the Romans every single day. You get what you put into this class and I can't recommend it enough!",
                "Yes, if youre into Roman history. Otherwise, choose something else or do it for the humanities credit.",

                "Yes",
                "Absolutely. I am so glad to have spent time studying this period, and I can think of no better person from whom to be introduced to Rome than Professor Johnston.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student.",
                "Absolutely. Rome comes up in politics and social settings more than one realizes and its cool to actually be able to see through the myth and know a thing or two about what has become an almost fantastical society in some modern portrayals.",
                "I already have recommended this course to several friends who are interested in taking more History classes or considering a Classical Civilizations course. I enjoyed how much was covered, and also appreciated the structure of the sections that allowed us to explore more of Republican Rome rather than just review lecture.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course! It is a wonderful introduction and survey of Republican Rome, and you really gain a lot of insight into historical analysis, as well as gaining an appreciation for the interrogation of sources from any time period.",
                "Yes",
                "yes, absolutely",
                "Only if interested in Roman history prior to Roman Empire and willing to undergo a huge workload for just this class. Otherwise take Roman Empire!",
                "Yes. Romans are worth learning about and republic I think tells you more about who they were and how they viewed themselves than Empire. Johnston is a brilliant lecturer. It's never just the Romans either. He connects the Romans to so many other things that matter---ethnography, political theory, contemporary politics, warfare, nationalism, the 20th century, the 21st century, colonialism, genocide, religion, identity, myth-making, ambition, everything. Lectures would be worth attending even if you weren't in the class.",
                "Yes, especially those interested in Roman history but anyone can take this course. The student must be aware that reading beyond the required sources for the week should be done to completely understand the lectures, especially in time for the weekly quizzes.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. There is so much to learn, the logistics are excellent and the TFs great."
