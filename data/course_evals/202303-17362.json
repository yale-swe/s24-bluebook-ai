I learned about the elements that make for a compelling story, and how to weave a narrative that excites readers. We discussed various writing techniques and how they differ, and examained the styles of writers both in and out of class. I also learned how to give and receive feedback in a writing workshop setting.",
                "I developed my ability to workshop both my own pieces and the pieces of my classmates. We regularly engaged in interesting discussions on elements of writing that appeared in our workshop submissions. Prof Bertino also gave insights on the publishing industry which were interesting.",
                "I learned how to develop ideas into stories, how to map 2 different storylines onto each other, how to edit, how to give and receive feedback in a conductive and positive manner, what to do if stuck on a story, and specifics of my writing style that help/harm stories as well as how to look out for them."

                "This course is absolutely fantastic.  Professor Bertino couldnt be a better guide for everyones writing and my classmates were the loveliest people.  Honestly I could go on and on about the strengths of this course.  I think the only weakness Id identify is itd be great to get a bit more clarity at the beginning of the course about deadlines and due dateswhat needs to be printed and turned in and when.  Other than that, this course is fantastic.",
                "I genuinely cannot think of any weaknesses. The structure, level of engagement, and no-judgement, collaborative atmosphere were just some of the strengths that made this my favorite class.",
                "Strength: Very comfortable environment to submit. I always left workshops with about a 100 edits I wanted to make, but never felt embarrassed or bad about anything I submitted. The class environment was welcoming, and discussions were engaging.\r\n\r\nWeakness: None really, but this is one of the few classes where I almost wish we had time for an extra assignment, just because workshopping was so fun.",
                "This class fostered an amazing community of writers and a space where I never felt judged, but instead felt encouraged to share my ideas and writing, no matter how outlandish or \"not done\" they seemed. It provided great workshop opportunities and a good format, and pushed me to keep writing in a way that didn't feel stressful."

                "Yes! This is a wonderful workshop for fiction writers, though not quite as intensive or challenging as I might have hoped. Professor Bertino was very welcoming and fun to work with. I looked forward to this class every week.",
                "Yes, 1000 times yes. If you are at all interested in learning how to write fiction, do yourself a favor and apply.",
                "Yes! If you want a great space to write and receive thorough feedback, this is the class for that. I would only recommend it to people who are passionate about creative writing, though.",
                "Absolutely. If you're a creative writer looking for a community of writers, or even someone who enjoys writing but doesn't know how to edit/finish stories, this course will help a lot. It's really powerful without being too work-intensive or stressful."
