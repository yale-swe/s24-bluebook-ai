                "This class helped me think more critically about the intersectionality of multiple fields that impact medicine, specifically within the context of francophone countries. My reading and listening comprehension improved, as our homework consisted of analyzing a wide variety of media.",

                "Strength: a lot of presenting and open conversation, exposure to lots of different genres of French language (movie, documentary, TV, article, novel, ...), many writing assignments and very, very detailed feedback\r\nWeakness: maybe a very high workload if you actually do all assignments at 100%...",
                "Strengths: The course is very well-designed; the syllabus was posted at the beginning and hardly changed throughout the semester. The Canvas page is well-organized and feedback is clear and reasonably on time. M Tertrain is a very nice professor and very accessible through email.\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't feel like my French improved significantly, especially given that it improved so much when I took my last French class. Perhaps we should be forced to use the vocabulary/phrases from the vocab lists in our compositions.",
                "Excellently structured and run course. It's clear Professor Tertrain puts a lot of research and preparation into each class. Assignments are reasonably sized and feedback is detailed. The materials chosen for the course are also excellent.\r\nThe only improvement would be making the films earlier in the semester available outside of the film archive easier.",
                "This course was very engaging, and Professeur Tertrain was able to ask sufficiently pointed questions that would prompt insightful student responses. Although there would be lulls in the discussion, the material that we would review for homework would be interesting enough to spark discussion. Professeur Tertrain was always very knowledgeable about the materials we would analyze, and I appreciated his attention to the small details that might indicate cultural nuance. Any vocabulary that might be new or in the realm of jargon would be defined before the discussion in class, reducing barriers to discussion. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the only issue I had while taking this class was the length of time that it would take to do the homework: it would sometimes be overwhelming when we would be assigned a feature-length film to watch before class (this would be even more difficult if these films could only be watched with a DVD player).",
                "Strengths: Very discussion heavy and engaging, with interesting material.\r\nWeaknesses: Very work-heavy, but manageable.",
                "Even though effort was made to create three different types of presentations, in the end I think all three ended up being very similar. I thought one-on-one conversations with professors has been a helpful means of evaluation in the past, because it forces more off the cuff responses, rather than more or less being able to memorize what we wanted to say for the presentations."

                "Yes, highly recommend!!! Even though it is a high workload, your French improves enormously over this one semester and the instructor is simply amazing. So caring, understanding, well-organized, and great at keeping the conversation going for us to practice speaking :)",
                "If you're interested in medicine/public health/bioethics and hope to take a fairly easy French course, this is the course for you. You will be asked to watch a lot of movies, sometimes two ~2hr movies for a single week.",
                "Yes, highly. If you have an interest in medical topics / public health, but it's also great for any student interested in the culture around medicine in the French speaking world. It is mostly france focused, but various units pull from around the world, and a few of the papers focus on study of non-france countries",
                "Absolutely. Professor Tertrain was very engaged in the course and clearly wanted to help all students learn as much and as well as possible. The course is very interesting, even for students without a medical background or interest in medicine as a career. Your French will improve.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, although the topic of the course is rather niche. I think that any student in L5 French would enjoy taking this class, even if they are not pre-med or interested in STEM. The organization of the class is conducive to any French student that can watch films or read literature being able to contribute to class discussions. Not only did I become more aware of recent topics and controversies in global medicine, but I also became cognizant enough to discuss those topics in an informed and nuanced way.",
                "Yes! Whether you are interested in the medical field, I feel like I learned a lot about various topics!",
                "Yes, definitely"
