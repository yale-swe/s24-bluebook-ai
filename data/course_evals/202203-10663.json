                "because the class it taught in only Portuguese, I learned how to listen and comprehend very well. The downside of this, is some of the lessons I was unable to understand what was going on.",
                "Strengths: The sustained contact and pedagogical techniques employed by the professor really enhanced my listening, writing, and reading foundational ability in Portuguese. Professor Ximena Gonzalez Parada genuinely cares about her students and actively works to create a collaborative and engaging learning environment. Also of incredible importance, the asynchronous day is a phenomenal addition to the course that allowed me to more fully engage with the course content,\r\nWeaknesses: At times, the course can feel a bit disorganized with no notable underlying theme to the structure. The syllabus wasn't correct in terms of identifying what our final project actually was and the dates didn't coincide with the notable events (exams, presentations, or group projects).",
                "The professor is amazing and the class is very interactive",
                "I really enjoyed this class and learned a lot in a great academic environment. It could be improved by including more english-speaking to allow for a better understanding of the Portuguese.",
                "We could have learned more grammar.",
                "Very engaging and interesting/relevant material. Some more focus on translating, sentence building",
                "More English teaching.",
                "My strength is reading Portuguese. My weakness is speaking Portuguese.",
                "Definitely a more laid-back language learning environment than other Yale Departments. Made it more fun and enjoyable, rather than stressful.",
                "The strengths are that it is really helpful in learning the language. At times it can be confusing though as the class is taught mostly in Portuguese which is challenging as a first time learner.",
                "I think the course is very fun and engaging; I always looked forward to attending class!",
                "I appreciated the frequency of class meetings and the length of the class, as it gave me constant practice with the language but also didn't overwhelm me. I also liked the focus on pronunciation and communication with others as opposed to solely grammar.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was the way the homework assignments were structured- some of the work didn't give me enough practice with specific vocabulary, and I would have liked more opportunities to practice memorization of verb endings and vocabulary together as a class.",
                "A strength was the Professor\r\nA weakness was the fact that the assignments sometimes felt like busy work",
                "Strengths: It is well designed to get students interested in Portuguese and excited about the language. Weaknesses: We did not learn that much Portuguese and personally I do not feel like it prepared me well for future studies in the language. The good news is you can always make that up."

This course is a great introduction to Portuguese, and strikes a good balance between teaching the subject matter and not overloading students with content (like some other introductory language courses at Yale). It is a wonderful choice to fulfill a language requirement, but is also a great option if you just want to take a class for fun.",
