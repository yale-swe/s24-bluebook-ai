    "I learned how to conduct close-readings on the different texts we read. This class helped me think more critically about the choices authors make in their writing and what effect it has on the reader.",
    "I learned so much about not only South Asian literature, but also it's history as well. This course was a great look into the different aspects of the subcontinent, its rich cultural diversity and also the conflicts that it has endured. I also learned how to read critically, and the insights and hidden meanings within many of the texts were truly exciting to uncover.",
    "We learned a lot about South Asian history and current events through South Asian literature.",
    "Social issues, literature, prominent writers, and many other aspects of South Asia.",
    "I learnt a lot about how politics, history, and culture all intersect and are reflected and challenged by literature",
    "I learned more about South Asia and South Asian literature. I learned about various historical moments and their significance to the development of South Asia, as well as how those moments were reflected through literature.",
    "I learned a ton about not only South Asian writing, but also culture and history. I felt like I became a better writer."

   "comments": [
    "I can't think of any weaknesses. Personally, I enjoyed all the readings, and all our class discussions were very enriching. A lot of the books explored the theme of violence, and yet, each had a unique perspective. Professor Mukhopadhyay is one of the biggest strengths of this class she taught us how to think differently and critically about themes of language, identity, perspective, violence. It was especially interesting to learn about effects of colonialism and what it means to be a post-colonial country.",
    "The teaching was amazing for this course and the texts were interesting as well, although I will say the level of intellectual complexity of the texts varied greatly. For example, some of the essays we read were very challenging to read just because of the language used and that made it less enjoyable to read as a whole.",
    "Strengths: the readings were very interesting. The time provided for each reading was reasonable. \r\nWeaknesses: some of the countries studied felt rushed.",
    "Strength- very interesting collection of readings \r\nWeakness- not many collaborative projects",
    "Strengths were I liked how the course was structured to look at different topics which all felt related. Weakness is that we could have had more guiding questions or points to look at while reading the works for the first time ourselves",
    "I felt like the information taught was really insightful and taught well. I thought the course could have had more interaction between students, in a class so small it would have been nice to do a group project."

    "I recommend this course to everyone. I loved this course. It allows you to explore literature and authors from places that you may not have prior exposure to.",
    "Yes I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in South Asian literature and history. It's a great overview of the different watersheds moments of the subcontinent and sheds light on places and cultures that are pretty unfamiliar to me.",
    "Yes because it provides a unique perspective to South Asian history and current events.",
    "Yes, I have explored topics I never even heard of before and broadened my understanding of our complex world.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, it changed my perspective on a lot of things. I felt like I definitively learned a lot more in this course than I had in other courses."
