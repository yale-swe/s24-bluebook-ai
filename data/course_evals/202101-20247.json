                "I developed a deeper ability to create longer creative narratives, and learnt how to structure them within a screenplay. Similarly, I developed a keener eye on how to analyze good scripts as the workshopping aspect of the class allowed me to critique my fellow classmates' scripts, hence improving both my writing and reading ability."

                "The class is very strong when it comes to feedback. As soon as you're script is ready, the whole class and professor will provide detailed thoughts on what could be improved, what didn't make sense, what should be expanded upon. Another strength is the flexibility. People can choose to write about whatever they want. There is a clear structure of the class and the assignments.",
                "The workshop format works really well on Zoom. It allows us to look at the screenplay we're critiquing and our classmates at the same time. This course is great online. I wish there was time to discuss professional screenplays to learn what they do right and why they work! As of now, the clips do not always communicate clear screenwriting lessons.",
                "Strengths: you have freedom to write about what you want, and it's helpful to have a class of inquisitive readers to workshop your script. It was a fun class with good discussions. Weaknesses: I think this class could use more structure. We did not have set deadlines for scripts, so we just hoped that people would finish them each week. The result was that sometimes we only had one day to read people's scripts and write up feedback. \r\n\r\nAlso, Prof. Lapadula almost always kept us late after class. Sometimes we went 20 minutes over. I know he means well because he is just enthusiastic. But I think he should end class on time to be considerate of students' time.",
                "Marc Lapadula is a very experienced professor of screenwriting and is very good and finding any and all notes and details that may need to be corrected in screenplay formatting, as well as providing feedback on general critiques for story development. The seminar also provides an opportunity for a great class community, as you spend a lot of time workshopping classmate's work, and outside class meetings with other students is highly encouraged and at times required.",
                "Both an easy and a tough class to bring online, as the work is fairly simple but the virtual environment makes it really easy to tune out. Random reviewing of clips at ends of class not particularly helpful.",
                "Great professor! Really cares about his students and is very passionate about the subject, both are very apparent.",
                "The biggest thing about this class is that you must put in a lot to get a lot out of it. It's a commitment, and writing a screenplay can be difficult. But it's worth it. Lapadula provides structural feedback, as well as critiques, and your peers will do the same. If you want an environment that encourages you to write, Intermediate screenwriting is the class for you.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is Marc's ability to involve all members of the class, allowing students to receive feedback from a diverse set of brilliant minds. In this environment everyone feels as though their words and opinions carry weight. The only weakness I can think of is just the fact that I wished we read more specific screen descriptions as a class and could discuss both their uniqueness and whether they were successful or not.",
                "The strengths of this course are Professor Lapadula and his enthusiasm and expertise. Professor Lapadula does a fantastic job of making sure each students'  work is highlighted in the class and is given proper time and effort to break down what is good, and what can be improved. The only way this class could be improved is if Professor Lapadula could teach more sessions of it."

                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Lapadula is a great teacher and gives amazing feedback, which allows students to improve their writing. You also get the chance to hear feedback from your peers who all offer different perspectives and insights. You do coverages on your classmates scripts. You have a ton of freedom in what you write. Even if a peer recommends something, it is your script and you get to make the final decision whether you agree or not. This creative freedom allowed you to write what you're passionate about. It is helpful to have taken intro screenwriting or the screenwriter's craft or to have prior screenwriting knowledge.",
                "Yes! It's a great opportunity to write a screenplay, learn more about screenwriting (from Professor Lapadula and your classmates), and develop a much deeper appreciation for the work that goes into telling stories for the big screen.",
                "Yes and no. If you are on the screenwriting track of the film major or just took intro screenwriting, it's a pretty good way to keep improving. But it's not a very structured class, and it didn't feel like the best possible way to improve my writing.",
                "If you are interested in improving your screenwriting, or plan on taking the screenwriting track for film, this class is required.",
                "Yes",

                "Definitely yes! Lapadula is a great professor, and its really fun to hear other people's story ideas. Your script writing will see improvement if you take this class!",
                "Yes, Marc is an invaluable teacher and a great person. The short form screenplay is an important skill to master especially if you plan on moving on and writing feature length scripts.",
                "Absolutely, if you hope to become a screenwriter, or pursue screenwriting in any way I highly recommend taking this course. It will give you a better understanding of the craftmanship, and will also force you to create something of your own along the way."
