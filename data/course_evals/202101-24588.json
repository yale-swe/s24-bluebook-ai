                "I got a much better understanding of Army Infantry and SF tactics, as well as the issues young officers face in a deployed environment. Reading about Afghanistan, and SF gave a lot of insight into these fields. The class was also good practice for structured writing.",
                "I learned a lot about military operations and the varying diplomatic hats that a US soldier must wear when conducting operations abroad, specifically: the officer traininga and pipelines, conventional military operations, counterinsurgency, and special operations.",
                "I gained a greater understanding of our nation's military at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. Additionally, my writing and communication skills improved.",
                "Developed a greater understanding of tactical leadership and the application thereof",
                "I could write an essay on the skills and insights that I gained from this course. First and foremost, as a communications course, I learned how to condense contentious and extremely complex topics into well-crafted essays. That alone would make the course worthwhile, but I also gained valuable knowledge about the role of the soldier diplomat--the challenges of counterinsurgency, partner force planning, and more generally, working with those who have drastically different lifestyles, but share in a greater cause. That quality of insight could only come from an experienced and organized professor like MAJ Eidemiller.",
                "I developed an understanding of all aspects of tactical and operational leadership, as well as insight into current conflicts. I also developed as a writer in this course, as Maj. Eidemillers capped essay prompts forced us to be direct and trim unimportant details.",
                "ability to understand political, military, and operational levels of engagement with military affairs and operations globally\r\nstrong focus on the war on terror, specifically in Afghanistan\r\nstrong understanding of the mission and capabilities of the Army Rangers\r\ncaring and connected mentorship groups for career and personal advice\r\nability to write with many different citation styles and paper goals \r\nextended practice with research on tactical, historical, and organizational aspects of military engagements abroad",
                "Knowledge: Incredible insight into the military world, future US policy, global power interactions\r\nSkills: The skills taught included leadership, writing, speaking concisely, asking good questions, and being bold in communication. These were taught very well and through practice as well as reading examples and guest speakers"

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Extreme depth in the coverage of tactical and special operations in the Middle East; Great readings and current discussions of modern day military topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Too many guest speakers, tried to cover too much information and only really got to discuss the tactical special operations field, would have liked to explore strategic policy more, and the grading seemed a bit arbitrary with feedback usually inconsistent and not comprehensive.",
                "This class has a really strong reading list and a lot of potential if you take it. The topics covered are interesting and Prof Eidemiller brings in very interesting guest speakers who can provide a unique strategic or tactical perspective on issues (We got to talk to a deputy secretary of state and a bunch of the top SOCCOM leadership). The subject and the interplay of strategy and tactics as well as the different roles that soldiers and policymakers take on is stimulating. Prof Eidemiller truly unmatched potential resources to understand the subjects. The mentors he assigned us were very helpful in understanding the topics in class. Being able to discuss current natsec issues with a good group of fellow students was also a plus. There is a lot of material that Prof Eidemiller tries to cover in this class, so to fully absorb it you will need to set aside time. To this end, the class feels like it's trying to pack too much into a class period sometimes. I think it could improve by spending more time delving into the topics and concepts presented in the slides - they felt a bit rushed between guest speakers at times. This would help on some of the essay prompts, since they were sometimes on things we touched on but did not get to elaborate on too much in class.  I thought the class did a very thorough job covering the tactical side of SF and infantry, but that we didn't really deeply explore operational and strategic ways of viewing things. This was a bit of a disconnect since the last couple of assignments were strategically focused. Overall, I think the class was truly unique in the caliber of the reading list it provided and the resources Professor Eidemiller provides you, but could be improved by being a bit more focused on key topics and touching more on the operational\/ strategic level in addition to tactics.",
                "The only weaknesses in this course were due to its virtual format. I applaud Professor Eidemiller for still managing to provide an incredibly engaging and intellectually stimulating course, despite the difficulties associated with Zoom. This was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale, as it provided interesting coursework, great discussions, and a plethora of guest speakers to learn from.",
                "Professor Eidemiller puts an enormous amount of effort into this class and it shows. The course weaves together fascinating first-hand experiences and important academic sources to give students a more well-rounded and complete picture of the topics we discuss. No other course I have taken at Yale offers such unique personal connections with practitioners in the military, intelligence, and national security spheres.\r\n\r\nThe only possible weakness is that we sometimes have to rush through material, but that is also a testament to how much ground we cover throughout the course and how many cool activities Professor Eidemiller has planned.",
                "Course is very strong in that it offers an incredible wealth of knowledge from the professor and all the guest speakers, allowing students to really soak up wisdom and experience. However sometimes the essays can feel slightly disjointed and some material seems superfluous- perhaps streamlining class material to more higher-level concepts and case studies, and taking out some of the knitty gritty technical terms about military operations could streamline the class and make learning more effective.",
                "I can confidently say that this course was the best I have taken during my time at\r\nYale. It exceeded nearly every expectation I possibly could have had--the chance\r\nto speak to some remarkable individuals, impeccable lesson planning,\r\nassignments that encouraged a real connection to the material, and the\r\ncommitment of my peers only scratch the surface. It was truly an experience I will carry\r\nwith me for a long time. There is absolutely nothing I would change other than having the course in person!",
                "The strongest aspect of this course was the outstanding balance of lecture materials, class discussion, and guest speakers. The class flowed very well, and the material and guest speakers built on each other instead of being redundant.",
                "Strengths: \r\ncovers a lot of area very very quickly, connects students with mentors who can help shape careers in a variety of directions, only assumes a small amount of military knowledge to start, read many different perspectives from different individuals about military strategy especially in the Middle East during the war on terror, organized class schedule with clear due dates and readings, notable guest speakers and Col Griffin \r\nWeaknesses: \r\nmoves very very fast, slides were zipped through, over-valuation of discussion vs achieving proper balance with instruction, feels like much of the material was thrown in for relevance rather than importance, guest speakers over-utilized to the point where readings went undiscussed",
                "Little to none, this is an excellent course",
                "The number one strength of this course is without a doubt the professor and his skills and extensive experience. Beyond that the speaker lineup was unparalleled with many well know national figure speaking as well as many topic specific experts. The mentor program was well intentioned but a bit hit and miss in efficacy. Could very well be user error however. Other improvements could be a more interesting first essay topic that follows in the vein of the situational\/practical essays 2,3, 4. A few of the very specific\/detail based class lesson sections near the late middle of the course dragged on and were not super beneficial in comparison to traditional class time use."

The unbelievable speakers that we were able to meet with via zoom (commanders of Special Operations forces, senior civilian leaders, etc.) only added to the value of this course.",

It also allows you to meaningfully wrestle with military issues. If that interests you then, I would recommend it.",

                "Absolutely. This was definitely one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. It is unique in its focus on the tactical level of military affairs but also touches on important strategic considerations. You will get the opportunity to engage with prominent leaders and talented commanders who offer insight which you cannot get in other classes at Yale.",
                "Highly recommend to anyone aspiring to work in the military\/government fields. The detailing of tactical level leadership",
                "In a heartbeat. As I noted in another section, this course was far and away the greatest academic experience I have had. The lessons you learn in this course and the people you are able to meet will provide worthwhile and long-lasting impacts for anyone (even if they have no desire to serve in the military or even in public service).",
                "Definitely. It was the best class that Ive taken at Yale. The class is definitely ROTC heavy, but I would still recommend it to any student given how dedicated Maj. Eidemiller is to the class and students.",
                "I would recommend this course to students interested in military strategy, especially on the operational level and especially in counter-terrorism operations. You learn valuable insights on Counter Insurgency operations and the relevance of counter-terrorism campaigns coming out of the Middle East, alongside learning a little bit about the functional roles involved in making these campaigns possible (ambassadors, chiefs of staff, variety of COMs, etc.) Nick has extensive experience in these areas, and utilizes his network to engage with class with a variety of perspectives. \r\nIt is Definitely a writing credit, and your writing skills will be engaged on all levels, so that's a consideration for those who've not had writing-heavy classes before.",
                "Yes -- the course is engaging and unique.  Much of the material covered in the class is not covered outside this class",
                "Best class I have ever taken. Would undoubtedly recommend and it would be a shame if it was not offered again. Incredible professor and great speakers. Many chances to improve writing and communicate more effectively in a way that every student needs to learn before graduation. However, you get what you put into this class to an extent more than any other class I have taken as it is not easy to get the full experience. To do this it helps to be interested in the subject area but not necessary if you just want to improve writing and communication."
