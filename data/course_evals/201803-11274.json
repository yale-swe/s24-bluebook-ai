    "This course is already fantastic. I would not change any part of it!",
    "class was enjoyable, content was cool. not many improvements",
    "This course was very disappointing. The class discussions were always all over the place and most students agreed that the professor's lectures were very hard to follow since they had no direction and were very all over the place.",
    "To speak with perfect frankness, I enjoyed the course a great deal, but do not think that having high schoolers in Yale College seminars is conducive to the best learning environment for Yale students. The class ends up having to be run at two different speeds - at no fault of the professor's - and I would really re-think having this program for high school students in place at all, at least in seminar courses where so much of the learning relies on discussion and engagement from students"

    "Yes! I definitely would recommend this course to another student. In fact, I already have told many friends to take this course if they can!",
    "Yes!",
    "I would not recommend this course to other students because it was extremely frustrating. As a STEM major, I was trying to earn a humanities credit that would be fun. This class was not fun at all and was very confusing. DO not take it unless you are very seasoned in the course topic as it isn't an intro class.",
    "Definitely! I greatly enjoyed the course material and assignments, and thought professor Syrimis was engaging, thought-provoking, and approachable. I would, however, warn about the high school thing. There is no hate to the high schoolers - I couldn't have engaged at a college level when I was in high school either, because I was in high school - but it really made for a difficult time getting really engaged in discussions, especially when the professor had to prompt many of the kids to speak at all",
    "I would. It was really engaging and the professor was interested in helping us improve."
