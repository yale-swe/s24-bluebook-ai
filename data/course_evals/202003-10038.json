It was an especially interesting class to have taken during the 2020 election year.",

Studying the history of Black Liberation provided me with new context for and insight into today's movements.",
                "I learned about Black freedom movements from the 1960s to the present, with an emphasis on Black feminist leaders such as Flo Kennedy and Angela Davis.",
                "I developed a deep understanding of how Black activism and experiences have changed over the last 80 years, from the days of Ella Baker to the Black Lives Matter movement today. Professor Lafargue made sure to provide us with a broad understanding of how Black activists redefined the norms of their own time and thus imagined new political possibilities for the country and the world.",

                "I really enjoyed the books chosen for the class and the discussion based class set up. I think the discussion aspect of the class really kept everyone engaged. I think I would've like to hear more of Dean Lafargue's perspective on certain issues and more guidance on some class discussions. I do think student presentations took up a lot of time and people in the class had trouble staying engaged with them (most turned cameras off during this time). We also never talked about the written homework assignments and didn't receive a lot of guidance on how to do them or how they fit into the class structure.",
                "One strength of this course was that Dean Lafargue is an excellent professor. Also, I really enjoyed all of the books that we read. Sometimes the instructions for the assignments were slightly confusing but Dean Lafargue always clarified and was very responsive to student questions. Overall it was a great course!",
                "I think that the biggest strength of this course were the readings, which were all engaging and interesting. This course could be most improved by greater clarity around the assignment content and due dates, as they were sometimes confusing and the final paper did not actually appear on the syllabus.",
                "Strengths: The books we read are fascinating. The assignments allowed us to create different media such as podcasts and interviews in addition to traditional writing assignments. Weaknesses: Dean Lafargue did very little actual teaching--student presentations took up almost the entire class period, since there were 2-3 presentations given each class. Pretty much all the knowledge I gained was from reading the books. This was really disappointing. If I hadn't read the books (there was an entire book assigned every week and I didn't make it through all of them), I barely would've learned anything except random specific topics the student presentations chose to focus on. I wish Dean Lafargue had actually talked about the significance of various protest movements, movement leaders, etc. I am sure he has so many valuable insights and knowledge to share. In addition, we had assignments that asked us to use techniques Dean Lafargue never even mentioned in class--like writing about historical theory, methodology, \"change over time,\" etc. If you wanted to learn anything from the professor, you had to go to his office hours.",
                "Strengths: Interesting readings, well structured assignments, Dean LaFargue is the BEST\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The online seminar format just seemed to necessitate a little more structure. Sometimes there was a lot of silence in the call during discussion because we didn't know what parts of the readings were going to be discussed. When Dean LF had discussion questions beforehand the discussion seemed to go smoother",
                "This course offered an incredible selection of sources and always included thoughtful conversation in class. One weakness was that I think Professor Lafargue could have spent more time lecturing in seminar just to provide everyone with a common baseline before we launched into discussion.",
                "Strengths- great readings, strong engagement with the presentations",
                "The classes were quite unorganised at times, but that can be expected of online schooling. Also not much guidance was given for assignments\r\nThere are many strengths of this class including that it was a safe space to discuss sensitive issues",
                "This course is perfect! I wouldn't change it at all.",
                "This course is great. Dean Lafargue does an awesome job of running the seminars and makes everyone feel like they can contribute. I really liked the assignments for the course as well, including the open response, vlog, interview, and more.",
                "Generally an engaging lecture experience, could be improved by being a 2 day a week course that is one hour long rather than a 1 day 2hr lecture course.",
                "One strength of this course was how much student involvement was incorporated into this course. That made it very engaging because we were able to cover a wide range of topics beyond the syllabus based on the interests of the students. One weakness, that had nothing to do with the class itself, was that it was over zoom, which made the seminar style class a bit challenging.",

                "This was my most engaging class of the semester BY FAR. I think the expectations of keeping cameras on made everyone more engaged. Other classes I've taken encouraged students to leave themselves unmuted when their surroundings allowed, and I think this could help students stay more engaged too.",

I think the assignments were well laid out, but could have been made a bit more clear or have more guidance provided on expectations for the assignments, as some of them were unclear.",

                "I would HIGHLY recommend this class to another student. This was one of the most engaging and enlightening classes I've taken at Yale. If you have any interest in the history of black activism that preceded and paved the way for the BLM movement, this class is for you. It also provided an interesting look at other topics such as voter suppression, intersectional activism, feminism, and the impacts of capitalism and explored how all of these things are related. I got so much out of this class and could not stop talking to my friends about the interesting discussions we had in class.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. Dean Lafargue is an excellent professor and the material we covered is extremely important and relevant.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class because it teaches critical and necessary sides of history that are often excluded from dominant narratives. The discussion in this class was always engaging and interesting, and I am glad that I took the class. I especially appreciated the student presentation model, which allowed students to learn from and with one another as well as the authors of the reading and professor.",
                "I would recommend this course if you're prepared to be rather self-directed in terms of your learning. There's a book assigned each week--it's up to you whether you make the time to read it since the seminar was so big, there wasn't time for everyone to speak every class. The assignments, which are spaced out throughout the semester, are extremely vague and never mentioned in class, and you'll have to go to office hours to get a sense of what Dean Lafargue wants you to do. The final research paper is quite long (12-15 pgs) and completely open-ended, so again, if you're an independent learner who has an idea of what you want to get out of this class, you can make it happen, but the professor isn't going to hand it to you.",
                "Yes! It's a great survey course on AFAM history",
                "Yes! I think this course provides a very helpful background to understand why and how the BLM movement formed, and what historical legacies the BLM movement draws on its activism. I also think the course is really great for understanding a lot of broader issues that the Black community has faced and continues to face, such as mass incarceration, voter suppression, and urban segregation.",
                "Yes! Whether youre black or not, American or not etc it provides a comprehensive history on racial discrimination in the last 50 years",
                "YES! I already have done so many times.",
                "Absolutely- this was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. A book a week can seem like a lot, but the reading list is amazing and Dean Lafargue facilitates great discussions",
                "Yes. One of my favorite classes at Yale.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course if you want a seminar class about black history, but be aware that the final grade is mostly determined by the final paper and the final presentation.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is extremely relevant to the current climate of race in America and how it came to be that way. I would especially recommend this course to non-black students in order to gain a better understanding of the dynamics that Black people have to face on a daily basis.",
                "Yes, I think the readings alone make the course worth it. And Professor Lafargue is great at connecting the topics to modern moments and organizations etc."
