                "Excellent, immersive experience into the world of screenwriting and embodying characters. Learned a lot about how to write realistic dialogue and structure a story",
                "This class was a wonderful experience to undertake screenwriting. There were so many aspects of screenwriting which we ultimately covered: conception of idea, to the 3-act structure, to what it takes to write, feedback with the writing itself, etc.\r\n\r\nI certainly gathered a greater appreciation for screenwriting and what it takes.",
                "Transformed my relationship with screenwriting, allowing me to see it as a form of writing that comes from the soul and the heart as much as it does the mind.",
                "I learned how to think creatively, be a part of a team, and appreciate film. I learned so much in this course, and I loved every second of it.",
                "This was perhaps the most personally enriching class I have ever taken at yale. One essential thing I have been missing here for my undergrad years has been true mentorship. Often, classes feel like a hurdle to get over or another hamster wheel that is a part of the meritocratic race. Camille's class was qualitatively different."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Camille gives such kind and specific feedback on your work that encourages you to keep writing; the class is very academically diverse (there are as many film majors as there are STEM majors) so you get a lot of different perspectives; the class sessions are extraordinary well planned and bring the class closer together.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had more in-person screenings of entire movies. We only had two at the beginning of the semester, and one got canceled.",
                "Truly no weaknesses. The strength of this course was absolutely Camille, who structures every class carefully to give you a balanced overview. I don't think you spend a single second doing something repetitive or without educational value. Also, Camille is one of the most caring and empathetic instructors I have ever had",
                "A strength is Camille. She's one of the few instructors at Yale who really stands out to me as incredibly intelligent, kind, and caring. Office hours were built into the class expectation and I really enjoyed that. It gave us a chance to talk to Camille one on one too.\r\n\r\nI think a weakness of the class is the pace. It's either extremely busy or not at all. I think it'd be better if the workload were more uniform.\r\n\r\nIn terms of improvement, I think there could've been more peer discussion. We had one exercise where we talked with each other about each other's scripts but I wish there were more of it. Similarly, we had many group discussions about each other's stories but we didn't even read every script so many times you felt a little lost in the discussion if it didn't pertain to your story or one that you read. On a similar note, I think it would've been good to have more writing deadlines, more times for us to have more of the script figured out. On another note, I think that we should be encouraged to be critical about the topics we choose to write about--if it's too sensitive to you, don't write about it! \r\n\r\nA thing to remember, this really is a class where you get as much out of it as you put in. Camille will meet you at your level of effort. So, if you need a push to write, Camille can't really help you there. But, if you have a lot of drive then Camille can help you a lot.",
                "Its primary strength was the enthusiasm for screenwriting and filmmaking that Professor Thomasson brought to each and every class. I had to consistently get out of my comfort zone to learn and grow as a writer. \r\n\r\nOne weakness, however, is that we spent far more time watching scenes of movies than reading their respective screenplays to see how they looked on the page. Professor Thomasson also gave away the ending to each and every movie we discussed, which does not ruin the film but certainly takes the punch out of ever watching them at a later date.",
                "Strengths- OMG there are so many. This course is very personal and makes you take a deep dive into yourself and your writing. You learn so much about film and about the general structure of film. Camille is a big plus to the course as she acts as guide to your writing if you were to get lost. This has honestly been one of my favorite courses that I have taken, and my other favorite is the other class that Camille teaches (Classical Hollywood Narrative). This has been such a highlight of my Yale experience, and I simply cannot recommend it enough. \r\nWeakness- NONE!",
                "The course was great. I loved the mix of activities, peer review, and screenplay studies.",
                "This course was a meditative experience for me. It was a rare opportunity for genuine self-reflection as a writer, and talks with Camille became essential elements for the intellectual/aesthetic composition of my semester. The activities and assignments we had to complete were assigned with great care and deliberation. There was not a single class where I felt lethargic or uninspired."

                "Yes! Even if (honestly, especially if) you arent a film major, this class just teaches you how to tell stories in a meaningful and powerful way. Camille is so supportive every step of the way and makes you feel like you have a voice. You also get to read and watch amazing movies! Its so fun, and its such a nice break from the normal, intense Yale seminar.",
                "Absolutely. If you have the opportunity \r\n to take this class, do it. It's unforgettable and Camille does a good job of picking a variety of students from interesting backgrounds.",
                "I definitely would recommend this course to another student. Camille is a phenomenal mentor, and any interaction with her is gold. Camille's teaching, but also her life philosophy are so great.\r\n\r\nAlso, this is a great opportunity to come in and work on a script idea. So, the smartest thing to do is come in with a series of ideas and to really be diligent about working through it. If you do this, I think this class is absolutely phenomenal.",
                "Yes, but only if they've taken some sort of screenwriting class before. This class is a bit like an advanced screenwriting course in the way that it engages more with the idea of screenwriting than the practice of it.",
                "Yes! This is a good way to tap into your creative brain. Unlike many of the science classes that I have taken, this class doesn't make you adhere to a formula. This is a great course and anyone would be lucky to get the opportunity to take it.",
                "Absolutely. I would recommend it to anyone interested in film, screenplays, or creative writing.",
                "To anyone who is looking for profundity in their lives and craft, I would highly recommend. Such energy and kindness are extremely hard to find/feel as we live in a world that does not incentivize human interaction. That being said, I would be interested to see students with more background in writing to become a part of this class. Spots are limited, and I can see how it can benefit those who are serious about their craft more highly than those who explore."
