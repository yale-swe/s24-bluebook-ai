It might seem difficult, but Russian is actually a really fun language to learn, and you forget that it's one of the hardest languages for English speakers to learn pretty quickly, because professor Titus is so fantastic. To anyone that has started learning Russian and is considering continuing with a summer program, do it! I'm assuming it's even better when you actually get to go to Russia, but learning over the summer is a great way to not forget everything by the fall semester.",
