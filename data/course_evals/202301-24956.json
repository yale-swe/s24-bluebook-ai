Although the workload is a bit high (probably about 80 pages of reading per week, four papers, and a long final paper), I personally enjoyed the challenge and felt that I became much faster at reading anthropology and archaeology papers in the process. The topic area is really interesting, and I always had new information to tell my friends that changed the way that I saw the world!",

                "Absolutely. This class was not only fascinating, but helped me develop important writing and analysis skills.",
                "DEFINITELY YES. You learn so much about what food is good for you, how we burn calories, optimal macronutrient proportions, the impact different foods have on our development, etc. So many applications to your personal life. Also, Thompson is super chill. I do recommend doing the readings - the entire class is just using them as a jumping-off point for discussion."
