                "Greatest strength was the use of perusall app for student engagement and discussion with one another about the readings.\r\nThe Wednesday lectures were also always very interesting",
                "Professor Gandhi clearly knows this subject very well, but I felt like discussion was focused more on the interpretation of very specific stories\/paintings\/pieces of art, and not as much on the readings or even how they related to Mughal India.",
                "This course is cross-listed as both a history and a religious studies course, however, it felt like more of a religious studies course. We focused greatly on the religious aspects of Mughal India and its emperors, but not as much on the historical events of the time. This was slightly disappointing as I had taken it wanting to learn more about the history of the Indian Subcontinent.",
                "Strengths --> great readings, incredible discussions on the Perusall app.\r\nWeakness --> Not enough discussions in class. Felt a little staged because there was a lot of intervention from the instructor at times.",
                "Sometimes the connection between class material and the readings was evident",
                "I really liked this class! Prof. Gandhi was definitely a strength--she is very knowledgeable about the subject, she frequently makes herself available for office hours, and she is generous about deadlines and giving us interesting assignments. I appreciated the opportunity to write an \"unessay,\" or creative research paper, for my final project. I do wish we had received more feedback (aka grades) throughout the term, because while writing this comment in preparation to view my grade, I have no idea what it will be.",
                "Professor Gandhi is so lovely! Readings can be a bit boring sometimes though",
                "The organization of the course and the discussions we had were excellent, but Prof. Gandhi does have a tendency to use South Asian jargon very casually without explaining the words\/terms. Because I've grown up with a South Asian background, I could understand most of the terms she used, but I imagine anyone without that background would struggle. She sometimes does the same with South Asian historical facts; she would casually talk about certain Mughal emperors or practices, or Islamic faith\/practices, even though many of us (I assume) did not have a formal background in those histories. But otherwise, the course was really, really good. Prof. Gandhi really does care about you as a person, and she does not hesitate to offer any help on projects, meet with you, or restructure the course to best suit your growth. The Perusall tool was really neat and encouraged me to read more attentively and pay attention to the insightful annotations of my classmates. The lectures and readings that Prof. Gandhi picked out were always interesting, and although a bit on the longer side, they were never a drone. It doesn't take long for one to realize what an immense wealth of knowledge Prof. Gandhi has in this subject. This was a really well structured history course and one that many will find to be quite insightful!",
                "This class is very solidgood organization, great teaching, and fun projects \/ readings.\r\n\r\nOne suggestion would be that it might be nice to read more of Prof. Ghandi's book, since we were only assigned a few chapters! Dara Shukoh is awesome... :)"
