I also determined through this course that while the math department outlines strict and understandable guidelines for introductory courses like these, the actual implementation of these course schedules seems unreasonable. For example, we had to submit an extra problem set early the week of each midterm, which put a lot of stress on me and prevented me from going to the review sessions, which were on the same nights that the bonus problem sets were due."

I didn't like the video delivery style of material in this course, and the homework questions were much too difficult, often times trying to trick you. There also was not very good feedback on where I had gone wrong on problem sets, and I eventually gave up trying to correct my work because no answer keys were provided and the Gradescope comments were often vague and confusing. Ultimately, I had a very negative experience with this course."
