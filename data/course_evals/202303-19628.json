The course had a heavy emphasis on speaking practice and the daily pair conversations were very helpful in getting in more speaking. Back ssn. also carefully curates the assignments for this class so it was never overwhelming.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While this can't be changed, it is a very fast paced course. In L1 and L2, you cover 9 units from the textbook. In L3, we covered 18! It felt very rushed at times, especially near the end. A bit more practice throughout the course on grammar points we learned earlier on would help in making sure we actually learned the content.",
