    "Thesis is obviously mandatory, but it's what you make of it! I learned a ton about research in general, as stressful and as rewarding as that can be.",
    "It was an incredibly valuable growing experience to have worked through a scientific research project so intensively and for such an extended period of time, and it was a very important part of my education at Yale. It was a valuable experience in thinking independently, developing scientifically robust methods and experiments, in scientific literature review, and in interpreting one's own results. These are all things that are fundamental to the scientific process, but that are not necessarily learned in most classes. I really appreciated the chance to do research since it is a research-based career that I ultimately want to pursue. I think I became a better scientist and became much more prepared for graduate school because of it, which I appreciated a lot.",
    "I learned a ton from working on my senior thesis. I learned how to do climate modeling, how to visualize data in NCL, fundamental and important insights about how ocean currents are related to climate patterns, and how to conduct scientific research rigorously."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This is totally advisor-dependent, but I think G&G does a good job of pushing students to really perform great research without making theses overly stressful.",
    "I think the course is set up very well - its expectations of what it wants from the students (a full manuscript as well as the presentation in front of the department) are reasonable but still challenging enough to be something robust and rigorous enough to be proud of. It was easy to find an adviser and a project, which is another strength. The senior thesis in this department is flexible enough to let people decided wholly for themselves what sort of project they want to do (for the most part), which I would say is the greatest strength of how its set up. I can't think of any major weaknesses. I generally like how the senior thesis course is set up and conducted. I would say that longer presentations (maybe 20 min instead of 12 with questions) would have been better, but that could be an opinion specific to myself.",
    "It's an incredible opportunity to be able to dive in deeply to a geoscience project for a whole year with mentoring from excellent faculty, and I've perhaps learned more from my thesis than from anything else in the department. Of course, research isn't easy, and it comes with both expected and unexpected setbacks, and that was a bit isolating. A suggestion for improvement would be weekly or semi-weekly group thesis meetings where seniors can talk about their projects, have workshops on how to write papers etc., and receive feedback from other students."

   "comments": [
    "A two-semester thesis can be exhausting but it is definitely rewarding, I think one semester is not enough to really get into a subject.",
    "Yes - I mean you'll have to do a senior thesis if you're a major, and I would recommend this over the essay for the same reasons the DUS spells out in the course description document. A scientific project rather than an essay will probably teach you more not necessarily about the topic but about how to do scientific research. So if that's something you want to pursue, definitely take this course. Even if you're not going into a research-based field like academia, I imagine the full project will be more satisfying than the essay and will allow you not only to learn about and pursue a topic of your interest more intensely - you'll get to come up with your own question about it and answer it for yourself! You'll also learn valuable organizational, scientific (analytical techniques, experimental design, etc.), and academic (interpreting data, writing, presenting) skills that I don't think you would get from just doing the essay. Definitely would recommend!",
    "Yes - G&G seniors should definitely write a thesis!"
