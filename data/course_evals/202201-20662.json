                "I gained knowledge about the philosophy of race/racism, various philosophical theories on justice and repair, some historical background of harm done against Black Americans, and proposals for reparations for slavery. Importantly, I was challenged to apply philosophy to a real-world issue, which is a unique task within the philosophy department.",
                "Learned a lot about the evolution of racism and racist institutions in the United States. Prof did a good job of choosing readings that walked us through the evolution of slavery to convict leasing and share cropping to red lining and mass incarceration."

                "The readings were often long and boring, but class discussions were great. All of the students in my class were really engaged, and prof Darwall inserted valuable comments without taking up all of the space. The papers were pretty difficult to write, since prompts were very vague, and the syllabus changed a few times to alter paper lengths and due dates, which was frustrating.",
                "Strengths include Professor Darwall, who is openminded and designs a great (if long) selection of readings. Classroom discussions were engaging, and he did a good job of getting everyone air time despite a large class. His feedback on essays is helpful, and he's extremely open to talking outside of class. \r\n\r\nI think there were two weaknesses with the course. One was the fact that there was just so much reading, it felt like we were never quite giving anything its fair time. The second is that the syllabus didn't have any critical race theory on it. We talked a lot about how racism and other problems still exist in present day America. I don't know why we couldn't have done that by reading about structural racism. I think that would be a great addition to the course.",
                "I think the course could benefit from more student discussion or maybe a smaller group? I felt like we did not hear as many voices as wouldve been productive.",
                "Its an absolutely incredible course that everyone should take. The only weakness was that often there was an unrealistic amount of weekly reading, so most people did a lot of skimming. But the course itself was fantastic.",
                "Strengths: interesting and relevant readings, engaging seminar discussions, tying the material to current events, amazing professor \r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The course has excellent material and discussion. I wish it were smaller, more like 12-14 people, as the classes were not very long, and getting to everyone sometimes meant a cursory discussion of interesting material. Also the readings in the couple weeks were not as differentiated as throughout the rest of the course. Overall, excellent readings.",
                "This is my favorite course I have taken! Class discussion was always really engaging  Professor Darwall bases it off of the readings and your responses to them, so it felt very student-driven, with a lot of buy-in from everyone in the seminar. I cannot recommend this course more than I do.",
                "This class is exceptional.  Professor Darwall is a fantastic professor who creates a welcoming and engaging seminar environment.  He always has a great story to tell, but is so passionate about knowledgeable about the material.  I would take anything he's teaching in the future just to be in another class with him.  Additionally, the class effectively combines history, philosophy, and politics, allowing students to draw from a wide range of experiences and perspectives to better understand how we can go about conceptualizing a just scheme of reparations.  \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses.",
                "This course was fantastic. The readings that Professor Darwall chose were all incredibly meaningful, and the way that class discussion was facilitated through student posts on Canvas kept things engaging. One weakness, I think, is that the reading could get to be very long (sometimes even 300 pages a week). This made it difficult to fully enjoy and absorb the information from the texts, since skimming was an inevitable necessity.",
                "Strengths - how much you learn about racism in America and it's evolution. \r\nWeakness - too much reading, and I think the beginning philosophy readings were bad? I think there are many more modern and interesting philosophy we could be reading to give context to the issue of slavery than the ones that the prof chose."

It's also a great \"intermediate\" philosophy course. It's one of the few 400-levels that isn't cross-listed with the grad school, so it's a great way to transition from easier classes to really difficult ones.",

                "yes if you're prepared to do a lot of reading and really engage! because it is so much content, you're only gonna enjoy it if you dig into it. if you only half go into it, it just kind of goes over your head."
