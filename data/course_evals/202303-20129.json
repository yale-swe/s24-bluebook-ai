                "An in-depth analysis of the novel as well as the social, economic, political, and cultural background of the time.",
                "I loved having the opportunity to read Les Mis. I probably otherwise never would have. It was really satisfying to finish the entire novel. I also thought both writing assignments were great.",
                "Thought creatively and analytically about Les Mis, in its book form (read for the class), adaptations, and in its cultural history. Engaged in close reading, historicized, and analyzed the work through the two papers and a presentation delivered before the class.",
                "This course was amazing! I am not a \"humanities major\" by any means, but I learned so much about Victor Hugo, Les Misrables, and French history in general.",
                "A great knowledge of 19th century French history and culture, as well as an incredibly detailed understanding of Hugo's novel.",
                "I now have a better understanding of how to integrate historical themes and contexts into understanding the content of a novel, especially one as political and wide-spanning as Les Mis. I also learned how to analyze and draw information from research papers that analyzed historical trends in order to present trends, which I hadn't been exposed to in a course before.",
                "I learned so much about everything related to Les Mis! French history, Hugo's life, Napoleon, Paris sewer systems...you name it. This is such a fun course.",
                "I learned about many different components of life in 19th-century France, including history, social issues, and more, as relevant to Victor Hugo's Les Misrables. I gained an understanding of the meaning of Les Misrables in the context in which it was written, as well as the political and social implications of its contents. I compared the novel Les Misrables with a variety of adaptations to better understand the novel."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: focusing deeply on one novel, the student presentations every class giving historical context\r\nWeaknesses: too many students for a seminar, it often felt like Professor Samuels was only looking for one correct answer (which I disagree with in the study of literature), the first essay assignment requiring us to blend personal experience and analysis was incredibly difficult to craft (in a way I don't believe Professor Samuels intended)",
                "I loved everything about the course. The presentations were a nice touch.",
                "Professor Samuels is a huge asset to this course: he does a great job facilitating the discussion. The assignment structure on the whole was a strength everything was well-spaced so you could really just focus on engaging with the reading. I do wish there would've been more guidance on the final paper. The biggest weakness of the course was its size. In a 25 person seminar, it can be really difficult to have meaningful back-and-forth. Oftentimes, everyone would just share their individual perspective, without actually building the conversation.",
                "Professor Samuels did a great job in facilitating the conversations and making strong points. I do wish that we had gotten to know each other more in the seminar because of how large it was, but overall, the spacing of reading was very digestible and a good pace.",
                "The instructor is very talented and knowledgeable. He also knows how to organize in-depth discussions well. My fellow classmates are also very dedicated in terms of the readings, presentations, and in-class discussions, which make the class experience very enjoyable.",
                "Prof Samuels and La were excellent discussion leaders. Not sure there are any weaknesses. Weekly reading was also very reasonable - 100 or so pages.",
                "The course is really fantastic in its workload, subject, and approach. Its reading load is relatively low (~100 pages per week), meaning everyone does the reading and the discussions are great! Prof. Samuels leads a fantastic discussion, wielding all of his expertise and introducing really nuanced points about Hugo, the book, and French literature generally. In the best way, the class feels almost like a book club. There are few weaknesses, except that the first assignment being due so early doesnt allow for much in terms of assignments all the way until the final. It might be helpful to add a rough draft submission for the final paper in advance of December; I would have liked to have a little more feedback on my topic and idea for the final paper. Also, the class was awesome but was a bit large and unwieldy as a result; it would probably be ideal to cap the course at 15 or 17 people. Overall, however, this is a fantastic class!",
                "I think the seminar size of the class was conducive to having in-depth, critical discussions about topics ranging from policing, urban reform, and gender roles in 18th-century France. The pace of the class was also good (only met once a week and were only expected to read ~100 pages for each class).",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Les Misrables!!! This book is amazing and it is a joy to do the weekly 100 pages of reading. \r\n- Prof Samuels is so knowledgable and is very good at guiding the discussion\r\n- The weekly presentations are a) so much fun to reserach since you can pick the topic that most interests you, and b) incredibly informative!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- The class had around 25 students which is far too much for a seminar. It felt as though some people were speaking simply for the class participation points and obstructing the flow of the discussion. A lot of students repeated one anothers' points either because they weren't listening, or just wanted to say something and it just detracted from the level of literary analysis we were creating.",
                "Strengths: Professor Samuels is wonderful! He does a great job building conversation in this course and shifting from personal opinions and reactions to the novel to the greater themes and agendas at play (especially Hugo's purpose in writing the novel and his stylistic choices). Having a diverse population of students with varying exposure levels to Les Mis made for very interesting and varied interpretations for each week's readings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class size was a little too large to be able to engage with at times. A smaller seminar would be more favorable, as during the semester discussions were often halted by multiple students expressing the same points after one another simply to get their voice out rather than to present different opinions or carry the conversation forward.",
                "Professor Samuels is the biggest strength of this course -- his excitement about the material and care for his students is palpable. I loved the format of the seminars (two student presentations at the beginning, and then a deep-dive into the section of the novel we'd read that week). Class discussion flowed well, even though there were a lot of us, and we got through a lot of material. I honestly can't think of any weaknesses!",
                "The best part of this course was undoubtedly the weekly readings, given that Les Misrables is such a riveting and fascinating novel. I also greatly enjoyed the weekly presentations which provided key knowledge that enhanced my understanding of the novel and provided some variety to the classes. The discussions were well-structured, and I appreciated that the professor guided the conversation towards several key topics in each class and allowed students to share their perspectives while also providing his own interpretation."

                "It's really a great opportunity to read the epic Les Miserables, so for that I would say yes. The course also supplies a lot of historical context which is nice. Discussions aren't great in class and the few assignments are draining, but if you're really interested in the novel\/the history I think you can enjoy it.",
                "Absolutely! I loved it, from the book to the professor to the TA!",
                "Yes! I learned so much.",
                "Yes! For anyone with a passion for this text or just excited to really learn about one novel, this is a fantastic course.",
                "Absolutely. I took this class so that I had a structured was to read this 1200 page novel. You also learn so much from each other's cultural history presentations.",
                "This course was a great opportunity to thoroughly dive into Hugo's Les Mis, and in a way, you decide how good of a choice it was to take the course throughout the semester, as a conjunction between the quality of the professor, discussion, and, perhaps most importantly, the novel. Samuels was a fabulous professor and wonderfully supportive during seminar and outside of class. Being a large group, the seminar felt a bit cramped at times, but that also bears strongly on the quality of the course. What held the seminar back from becoming one of my favorite courses is, ironically, the novel, which is the reason why I took the course. Hugo's style of writing, highly dogmatic and pedantic along with prone to rambling digressions, is not the most conducive, in my opinion, to the regular treatment of profoundly worthwhile questions, but clearly Samuels tried to do the best with what he was given.",
                "Yes, this is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I would suggest checking out the Modern French Novels class taught by the same prof as well.",
                "Yes!! Great opportunity to read a classic book. Loved learning from Professor Samuels and La. Also, the workload is not overwhelming and the writing assignments are actually fun and interesting  especially the final.",
                "Absolutely! This course focuses on one of the most important novels of the 19th century in a pretty chill way. Its fun, and you really learn a lot about the period, book, Victor Hugo, and French history, too.",
                "Yes! I think the class could get boring if you're not interested in Les Misrables, Victor Hugo, or French history in general.",
                "Yes! The class is a lot of fun while also offering a great lens onto French history through literature. As a fifth class, doing the reading can be a great way to relax while being productive. The workload is relatively low - one presentation,  two essays, 100 pages of weekly reading, and particularly so if your presentation is in a non-essay week. This is a class where you get to learn from your peers and delve into one of the most emotive books in the history of literature - take it! Just beware that because it is crosslisted with the French department and obviously has ties to musical theatre, it is not a straight literature class. While some students are taking it for a literary purpose, many are also taking it just for fun which can affect the class make-up and atmosphere.",
                "Yes yes yes! This course was an INCREDIBLE introduction to Les Mis and Victor Hugo's works. The pacing of the course was very manageable, and discussions were always varied and fascinating- I looked forward to our Wednesday class every week. Not only was the book itself phenomenal and a natural page turner, but Professor Samuels was a fun and engaging professor, and the students in section made each seminar enlightening and a blast. The historical presentations also provided useful context for other courses I was taking, as many of the themes from 19th century French history were relevant to my other courses.",
                "Absolutely! Probably the best class I've ever taken at Yale. Even if you've never heard of Les Miserables, this class is still a must take for everyone.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course! It's a chance to read a really engaging novel and have great class discussions.",
                "Yes absolutely!",
                "I recommend this course to another student, no matter their background or relation to Les Misrables. I came into the class having already read the novel, and this class gave me a much greater understanding of the novel's content and relevance to the time in which it was written. I'm thankful to have had the opportunity to revisit this novel, and think the class is a great opportunity to discover or rediscover one of the greatest novels of all time through a perspective that is strongly rooted in the understanding of Hugo's goals, beliefs, and values."
