                "Everything from how to handle conflict with a friend to how to practice mindfulness while eating cookies. This is  a choose your own adventure course. You can learn anything you want to.",
                "Having taken \"The Self and Other, In Theory and Practice,\" I've developed a profound understanding of mindfulness and self-awareness, learning to practice mindfulness techniques effectively. This course deepened my self-awareness and self-acceptance, enabling me to cultivate a consistent presence and clarity in my daily life. Additionally, I've gained significant insights into the complexities of interpersonal dynamics, especially in areas like projective identification, friendship, romance, and conflict resolution. This has enhanced my ability to engage in meaningful relationships and manage conflicts constructively. The course also equipped me with practical tools for self-exploration and personal growth, particularly through exercises like guided meditations and reflective writing. This experiential approach, blending theory with real-life application, has profoundly impacted my personal and professional interactions, fostering a more empathetic and comprehensive understanding of both myself and others.",
                "This course positively transformed the way I think about self-reflection and important life topics. Including: how to engage in conflict and have difficult conversations, how to better approach my relationships, projection onto others and where that comes from, thinking more deeply and creatively about my own actions and life, expressing and receiving gratitude and compassion"

                "Alex and David are amazing instructors! I very much enjoyed the structure of the course which was a combination of in-class activities, out-of-class activities, and lots of in-class discussion. It was very refreshing to be in a course where you focus on being present and intentional with yourself and those around you.",
                "I can't speak highly enough about this course. Dave and Alex are the most knowledgable, approachable, and genuinely caring instructors I have had. Each topic covered an aspect of life that I was very eager to explore. The out of class assignments were incredibly helpful for putting our findings into practice. The only way it could be improved is if it went on for the full year because there are so many areas of life to discuss and we only have so much time. I wish we could have met every day.",
                "Near perfect class needs to be offered for all of yale. I cannot believe we dont already have a class that teaches emotional intelligence.",
                "In reflecting on \"The Self and Other, In Theory and Practice,\" I found the co-teaching approach by David Berg and Alexandra Simon to be a major strength. Their collaboration brought a dynamic and multifaceted perspective to the course, making the learning experience particularly rich and engaging. The diversity in their backgrounds provided a comprehensive understanding of the subjects, blending philosophical theories with practical, real-world applications. Another significant strength was the course structure, dividing the curriculum into Intrapersonal and Interpersonal units. This allowed for a deep dive into self-awareness and mindfulness, followed by an exploration of interpersonal dynamics, offering a holistic approach to understanding the self in relation to others. The course's experiential nature, combining theoretical frameworks with applied behavioral strategies, was incredibly effective in reinforcing learning through real-life practice. Overall, the course was thoughtfully designed, offering a balance of intellectual rigor and practical application, greatly enhanced by the synergy of the co-teachers.",
                "Strengths: This course only had strengths! The out-of-class activities directly related to that week's topic and allowed for meaningful engagement with the course material and our actual lives. It isn't often that your \"homework\" every week is something focused on directly improving your life. David and Alex clearly spent a ton of time making sure each week's class was well-organized and planned with a nice balance of discussions and activities. Having two professors with different life perspectives was really helpful (and entertaining!) for getting more out of the class. They also provided really detailed and thoughtful feedback on everyone's weekly reflections and our papers, and they made themselves very available for meetings to talk about the course. The in-class partner\/small group activities were also a ton of fun, and we all really got to know each other by the end of the semester. I will very much miss this class!\r\nWeaknesses: The only weakness I can think of is that I can't take the class again!"

                "More than any other course I've taken. The class, discussion, and readings are all fascinating and incredibly easy to engage with because they're so interesting, but you also leave the class with reflections that apply to your real life and change you more significantly.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course! I think Yale students would benefit from more courses like this. The insight you gain into yourself and others is really eye-opening and the skills you learn, the mindset you develop, is invaluable.",
                "Absolutely. The focus on personal growth and the increased awareness of my growth are so valuable and the course is an incredible opportunity to devote time towards consciously thinking about that. The class community is also tight-knit- I feel a genuine bond with everyone who took the class with me as we have seen each other grow.",
                "This course is only for the people that have a genuine interest in learning about themselves and others. If you do not have a desire for self improvement and deep introspection and reflection do everyone a favor and do not take it.",
                "\"The Self and Other, In Theory and Practice\" is hands down the best class I've taken at Yale.  The way David Berg and Alexandra Simon co-teach is incredible. They bring such different perspectives, and it just makes the class super engaging and insightful. The course itself is split into two parts: Intrapersonal and Interpersonal. So, not only do you get to dive deep into understanding yourself, but you also learn a ton about how to better interact with others. And it's not just theory  they have us apply what we learn in real-life situations, which is super useful.\r\n\r\nWhat I loved the most was how it wasn't just another academic course. It felt more like a personal development journey. You get to explore mindfulness, self-awareness, relationships... it's all in there. Honestly, if you're looking to learn more about yourself and improve your relationships, you should totally take it. It's been a game-changer for me.",
                "ABSOLUTELY 100% YES YES YES!!! Best and most impactful course I have ever taken and will ever take! I think I told every person I know about this class and did not shut up about how much it made my life better. David and Alex planned each week with incredible thought and care, and I was always excited for my Tuesdays because of this class. I loved the wisdom and life stories they shared with us that helped us dive deeper into the course concepts, and the small group activities were equally engaging and interesting. I loved completing the out-of-class assignments because they were focused on actually DOING and implementing the things we were learning. Before taking this course, I considered myself to be self-aware, but this course pushed me into a far more meaningful version of self-reflection. We had an amazing classroom camaraderie, and that is a testament to how amazing David and Alex are. The fact that 13 of us stayed for 4 hours at our end-of-semester class dinner during reading period says everything it needs to about how meaningful the course was to all of us. I could go on and on and on listing all the wonderful things about this course, but I'll just end by saying it genuinely changed my life!"
