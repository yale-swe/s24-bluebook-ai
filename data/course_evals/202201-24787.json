                "More engaging sections",
                "I really enjoyed this course and its content, professor, work, and TA.",
                "Strengths: engaging lectures, very interesting content, the papers allow you to choose a topic you're interested in and aren't too long\/difficult\r\nWeaknesses: disorganization of the class (multiple dates listed for assignment due dates, papers aren't announced in class until the week of), professor doesn't respond to student emails, sections and TAs vary widely and you can get stuck with a really boring TA who just regurgitates the info in lecture",
                "strengths - expansive & well qualified (seems like we touched on everything we needed & then some), guest lecturing helped fill out the course in an exciting way \r\nweaknesses - organization & planning w\/ due dates lecture slides",
                "this course teaches some really important stuff, and i think the papers in particular are excellent, reasonable assignments to take the knowledge you learn in class and synthesize it into research papers. weaknesses may be the difference in what the TFs teach in each section, and also general lack of responsiveness from teaching staff",
                "All great! Tests were easy, lectures were engaging and really nice Professor",
                "Several interesting guest speakers. A lot of the info felt very basic and not super intellectually challenging. The midterm and the final were hard not due to material but due to the format and time constraint, which was frustrating. The two writing assignments were also pretty harshly graded on minor details.",
                "strengths: detailed lectures, guest lecturers, good section\r\nweaknesses: not enough time to do alotted work on exams, unclear expectations for writing assignments",
                "Professor Fallon is great, and the work load is very manageable. I also enjoyed the guest lectures.",
                "There was not much more content than what was written on the slides",
                "Professor Fallon made lecture a bit more engaging to students. A weakness would probably be the poor structure of the midterm and final. These are two exams that are a big part of the students' grades and yet it was poorly structured.",
                "Totally fine class. Lectures were straightforward and topic was interesting.",
                "Professor was organized, but sections didnt correlate with relevant info",
                "This was a great intro course! Really good coverage of interesting and engaging material, lectures could be a little bit fast sometimes which made the material hard to absorb",
                "I understand that this course is supposed to be about breadth rather than depth, but the material felt almost frustratingly watered down at times. I appreciated the guest lectures because I felt that they were more appropriate for a college level course. I did appreciate the range of topics covered, and certainly learned some material, but felt that the format of the exams (especially the midterm) ran contrary to the very notion of the interdisciplinary nature of global health that we were supposed to appreciate. Everything was so formulaic, and T\/F questions are not a good way to assess comprehension of these themes. I also felt that there was a grading disparity between TFs.",
                "I think a strength of the course is the content and the amount of review we get for the concepts. In addition, the concepts, since this is more of an introductory course, are accessible and easy to digest. One weakness is that you lack a bit of guidance in terms of the writing assignments. In addition, it is clear the professor does not want this to be a \"gut\" class and puts a lot of effort into ensuring you can't coast, even though the material may be relatively easy.",
                "The TAs were not grading things equally. There was no standardized grading process.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Fallon really cares about student needs. If you have an issue, you can go to her and she will totally get it and help you. Also great guest speakers. \r\nWeaknesses: Lack of TF alignment  Different sections had radically different engagement and grading. Midterm was strangely specific  asking about specific stats from lecture for example. Some TFs took off a lot of points for things that were not clearly asked for. I just wasn't super engaged.",
                "A strength is that the course touches on concepts regarding public health, a topic not discussed enough. A weakness is that I find the content is repetitive and too general in that in every section of the course, the reason for poor health is poverty. Reducing the cause to simply poverty removed accountability from other stakeholders and antagonizes the developing countries discussed.",
                "The guest lectures were super interesting but sometimes section was repetitive",
                "Strength: prof Fallon is a great lecturer and the topic is interesting even to non-public health and non-pre med majors",
                "Lessons are very clearly organized and there are reviews for the midterm\/finals.",
                "The strengths are that the class is very interesting and has a generally low workload. The weaknesses are that the class feels somewhat repetitive and its hard to remember little details for the exams.",
                "I loved this course. The only weakness is that the lecture slides would sometimes not be uploaded for a while, making it hard to take notes in class\/ review after if I had to miss a lecture.",
                "The tests are too long for the time allotted.",
                "I think that discussion sections could be used more effectively. Guest speakers were very interesting.",
                "The strengths are that the course is introductory and broad- we learned a huge amount of important information but didn't go into so much detail that it was overwhelming. It also isn't too STEM focused for those of us not majoring in STEM fields, and felt very welcoming as an introductory course.\r\n\r\nOne major weakness is that the lectures are only 50 minutes, which is helpful in some ways but also causes us to rush through material.",
                "Prof. Fallon is super enthusiastic, engaging, and I enjoyed the guest lecturers that she brought in. The course is also well-organised to include a wide range of topics & does not go in too much depth on any one topic. However, I felt like the course was too easy  there was not much nuance in course discussions within section, the exams felt like a mere repetition of facts, and I didn't really learn anything particularly new or, in some cases, that couldn't be found in a simple google search.",
                "Strengths: Material was clearly organized and straightforward to understand, decently interesting subject matter, some very interesting guest lecturers, can get by easily without doing the reading. Weaknesses: lectures and section were both verbatim the slides, course was very factual content (not deep analysis) heavy, tests were extremely time-pressured and content-recall heavy, some guest lecturers spoke about very granular aspects of their work. Course could be improved by: making it so that lecture is not just the professor reading off the slides, more class activities and thematic analysis, less memorization; make tests less time pressured",
                "Strengths- the readings were easy to understand and provided more context for the topics discussed\r\nWeaknesses- The instructor always seemed to be in a rush to cover the intended content during lectures. Maybe instead of having a 50 minute lecture, the time allocation could be increased to 1h or 1h 15min",
                "The strengths are that the material is extremely interesting and the only thing you have to do every week really is to go to section and participate, you don't really even have to do the readings. The biggest strength and my favorite part was the guest lectures as someone interested in going into global health, as people working in different facets of the field came and talked to us. However, a weakness is that Fallon tended only to just read off her slides and didn't record the class (which is about global health), and that there weren't many assignments to be able to really understand where you were at with your grade and be able to show your understanding of the information. I also thought that the TAs difference in grading and teaching styles at their sections was a big weakness."

                "Yes I would recommend. The lectures are interesting and the workload is very manageable. Professor Fallon and the TFs are great.",
                "If you're interested in global health, it's a great way to gain exposure to lots of different areas. I think the description for the breadth of this course was \"a mile wide but an inch deep.\" You won't go super in depth in any particular topic but you will get a broad overview. Professor Fallon is a great lecturer and is very engaging but it's unfortunate that she doesn't respond to student emails. The TAs can be hit or miss as well and there will be like 4 different due dates for the same paper listed in various documents on canvas which is extremely frustrating. I missed an extra credit opportunity because the actual assignment word doc file said one due date but the assignment submission portal on canvas said another. So prepare for the disorganization but overall the content was really interesting.",
                "Yes, if they are looking for a cursory overview of what global health is and looks like.",
                "yes! i think its a good overview of global health in general, and its a super chill class. if youre interested in GH, its a must take. that being said, it doesnt go super in depth into anything, so dont expect to come out of it feeling very enlightened. a lot of the content is stuff we learned just through the pandemic",
                "Yes!",
                "Yeah, it was fairly interesting and pretty easy to understand, although slightly harder to get a grade that reflected your understanding than it should have been.",
                "Yes, I found it interesting\/informative",
                "Yes! This is a good introductory global health course that gives an overview of some of the key challenges in this field. Professor Fallon is wonderful, and the workload is not too high.",
                "Yes! Good things to know",
                "I would recommend this course to another student since it tackles a lot about the current pandemic that we are in. Aside from that, there is also the history of global health which I think is a relevant topic to get accustomed to.",
                "Honestly, I love Professor Fallon, but the organization of the course gives me pause in recommending it to another student. While the content is extremely interesting and well lectured on, the format of grading for essays and exams was a big detractor to the course. Regurgitating facts as quickly as possible was incentivized on the exams, and essays were graded inconsistently and, in my opinion, poorly and not based on the quality of argumentation. TAs did not grade consistently across groupings of students at all. It is very clear to me and other students that Joe was the hardest grader, Aish was somewhere in the middle, and Anissa was a slightly easier grader than Aish. If there was a reappraisal of how the course is graded, I would potentially change my mind, but the student interested in global health may be better suited to auditing the course in the form that it takes now.",
                "Probably",
                "Probably not",
                "Yes, if youre looking for an intro course to global health! This course provided the opportunity to learn a lot of interesting information in a short amount of time, and workload was relatively low. Not quite a gut because the grading was not always super easy",
                "If you are interested in global health or are going into any profession related to health, definitely. You learn some key concepts and insights that any person involved in health must keep in mind. However, it is not as easy in terms of grading as one might expect, so be warned.",
                "no, poverty is the answer to everything",
                "Not sure. It was a broad overview of global health. I thought the midterm was a bit punitive, but Dr. Fallon really cares (which is very important). Get to know her and talk with her if you have any issues and she will be there for you.",
                "Yes! Professor Fallon truly has so much passion for global health",
                "Yes! Especially after covid",
                "Yes, to anyone who is interested in health but wants to learn about it from a global perspective. Its also a great global elective.",
                "Yes. I think it is the perfect course if you are not sure if you are interested in Global Health. It is also a great class if you are already interested because you do deep dives into many interesting case studies.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student in global health. It provides a good baseline and doesnt take much of a commitment.",
                "If required it is a good class and you can learn a decent amount from it so I wouldn't be too sad if your program requires it. If it isn't required I would personally recommend some of the other global health classes, as they are a bit more difficult but have smaller class sizes and more advanced content.",
                "I would recommend this course as a good foray into global health and a good metric to figure out if they are interested in pursuing health further.",
                "Yes, but only if they are very passionate about global health and want to learn about a lot of specific content related to that.",
                "Yes. It is very eye opening",
                "I would because it is an easy course and very fun and definitely made me more interested in global health - I want to go into the field now! I think if you aren't a global health scholar you should still take this course because it is not too difficult to understand at all and the guest lectures are so so amazing. The material wasn't particularly difficult, it's just that some sections will be very well taught and you get something out of them, other sections the TA just summarizes that week's lectures."
