                "Throughout this course, I learned a whole new vocabulary with which to comment upon and understand art works by contemporary Chinese artists. Thanks to the individual meetings with the professor, I also gained new skills in my approaching to writing visual analyses, incorporating the new terms explained in lecture. Furthermore, the thematic structure of this class further help develop my understanding of artworks not as isolated pieces of work in visual culture, but connected to a web of historical and literary influences.",
                "I learned a lot about the study of art history and how to analyze art. I also learned about contemporary Chinese artists, an understudied group of people in my opinion. I was most amazed at the different representations of skin in Chinese art. I had a very narrow and stereotypical idea of how skin might be represented in Chinese art, but through this course I learned the multidimensional ways artists represent art and the meanings behind these representations.",
                "I gained an immense appreciation for art that I did not have before. When I visited museums over break, I found myself thinking more deeply about the meaning behind the art and mediums.",
                "I learned how to discuss art in context of their history, and current state of affairs, and also to question whether feminist art needs to be feminist and how to look at it both as a result of and despite the gender of the artist. I learned how to appreciate disturbing art, and express how effective it was in conveying their intent. I also learned a lot about materiality, tactility, and simulations.",
                "I learned a lot about the course material, which was incredibly fascinating, and learned how to connect different pieces of art across different mediums."

                "strengths: great range of artwork and artists studied, as well as topics. quincy was obviously very well prepared for lecture and knowledgable about the topics and artists. \r\nweaknesses: i wish there was a module on body modifications/tattoos/cosmetic surgeries.",
                "The stengths of this course are the excellently selected readings which well supplement the lecture material and the in person visits to the Yale Medical School and Print collection to view artworks in person. If anything was to be improved, it would be to include more visits to the YUAG or other collections to see more artworks first hand.",
                "Strengths: The material was interesting. I believe all students were engaged in discussions. I really liked the week where we shared skincare commercials from around East Asia.\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were very important as they introduced new theories through which we analyzed artwork about skin. Some of these theories were in our readings. However, I struggled in understanding the theories myself. I think the course could be improved by assigning discussion posts. In discussion posts, we would have the ability to express our ideas and questions before class, and then the instructor could review the posts and either tailor the lectures toward our discussion posts or bring up our questions/ideas in class.",
                "I really enjoyed the artworks chosen and the readings accompanying them--they were pitched at a manageable level, and so I felt like I could engage with them better than difficult, overly theoretical texts.",
                "I LOVED the course material. By far one of the most interesting, engaging, and endlessly fascinating collection of art that I've studied and one of my favorite classes for this reason. However, the classes often felt more like a lecture than a seminar - because everyone was required participated in every class, we often were only able to speak once and the first half of the class is a lecture given by the professor. I wish that teaching and discussion could be better combined rather than bisected into two different parts of the class."

                "Yes I would! The best part of this class was the large amount of time allocated to student discussion. I really felt that as well as being taught engaging material students were encouraged to take ownership of what they had learned and discuss it with their peers. I also felt that Quincys selection of artists included many less-well known artists that I wouldnt have otherwise encountered in my own personal research, making this class a very good resource into discovering new artists.",
                "I would neither recommend to nor discourage a student from taking this course. It is an interesting course on a unique and challenging topic. Few courses at Yale (and any other institution I've attended) focus on contemporary Chinese art and this is the only course that talks about representations of skin. However, I think the above suggested improvements are critical to the learning experience.",
                "Absolutely! The best class I have taken at Yale. The title is a little misleading, it's not at all about skin problems or diseases or medicine or anything of the like, it's more about the representation of skin in art and humanity. So interesting!",
                "Yes I would! It opened me to new artworks and artists that I didn't know about before.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course, but only if you're interested in the material. If you take a look at the material and don't find it interesting, the class itself won't be that engaging."
