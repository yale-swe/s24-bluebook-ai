            "comments": [
                "The material for the first half was very basic, and definitely covered in other intro courses such as basic chemistry concepts. Later on the material got better and was more interesting such as multi phase systems with 2 components, and energy balances on systems and this was interesting to learn. The problem sets were designed fairly considering the material covered in class. The exams (first two, haven't taken the final yet) were reasonable questions but a time crunch to complete, having more time would be great as a lot of questions involve drawing large diagrams with many components labeled before starting the calculations. Also for the recent homework's and most likely the final, we have to use textbook pages at the end of the book to find values for problems and this takes a while, it would have been great if the reference values we needed to sole the problem could have been included in the questions instead of spending time going through the appendices looking for it.",
                "Posted lecture notes were very clear and concise. The problem sets were very manageable. The exams were open note, but always harder than any examples given in class which made it difficult to know how to study at times.",
                "As it was Dr. Guo's first time teaching the course, the resources available towards the beginning of the course were limited in regard to exam preparation. However, Dr. Guo is very open to taking the advice of his students and quickly provided us with practice questions and readings etc. The pace of the course content is standard, so one is not spending an overwhelming amount of time on this class per week. For those who have taken, chemistry and physics at Yale, this class does not offer much new content. This course is more focused on building the intuition to deconstruct problems and solve them using material/energy balances.",
                "I think that some of the concepts were a bit too formalized, like defining the process of calculating degrees of freedom based on some subjective definitions. In addition, some of the problem set and exam problems were not written super clearly, however considering they were written this year, they were will thought-provoking. I liked the amount of opportunities to talk with TA/professor. The lecture notes were clear and concise."

                "It is not too difficult of a class; however, I would only recommend if you need this class as a major requirement or elective or if you are interested in learning how to solve problems regarding transfer of energy, heat, materials, etc.",
                "I think that this class was not what I was expecting in terms of chemical engineering, but it was a good introduction into thinking about physical systems."
