                "The course itself is great. The books used in this course (Le Petit Nicolas, L'Etranger, and M.Ibrahim) are all fantastic (especially the second and third ) and extremely interesting. The audio programs alongside the various activities we do in class make this a challenging but rewarding class to take, in that it takes up a lot of time but will also definitely improve your french across the board. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, the tests are downright ridiculous. A large chunk of the exam is a listening exam, meaning that even if you understand the concepts if you don't understand the prompt, you can't get the credit. That's the downside of this course as a whole.",
                "The online testing format was very stressful. The class is very good for conversational skills and reading.",
                "A major strength of this course was the small size, as well as the instructor's efforts to engage all the students. Also helpful was the instructor's use of myriad virtual activities aside from Zoom sessions. \r\n\r\nThe primary \"weakness\" for me was probably the amount of work. While I know that the heavy workload was directly responsible for my improvement in the language, it could still be difficult at times to balance the course load with work from other classes. Finally, I would have appreciated if the homework assignments were posted a bit sooner after class.",
                "I felt very comfortable but challenged in the class. I learned a lot. The choice of texts could be improved.",
                "The course is really complete, a great combination of reading, listening and writing. The materials are really engaging particularly, the books, movies and audios.\r\nI found that the main weakness was dealing with the speaking component, as it is hard to get feedback from recordings and on Zoom.\r\nAlso, I wish there could have been a more traditional and centralized reference to the grammar we were learning.",
                "Strengths: The class was very organized and I appreciated that I knew exactly what to cover for exams. The course packet work can be tedious, but it is great practice and helps prepare for participation in class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I found that the audio used both for the test packet and on exams hindered my progress at times. Background noise and very fast speakers made it hard to understand and complete certain exercises."

She would schedule outside revision sessions before exams, would have open office hours every Thursday (where we could just practice speaking french), and would try to make herself as available as possible (knowing that the virtual formatting necessitates increased communication). Additionally, her flexibility on deadlines was HIGHLY appreciated and made the entire course less stressful! I wish all my instructors would be as understanding of the global pandemic occurring at the moment and how that affects us as students.",
                "The seminar through zoom wasn't ideal, and the tests weren't that successful at actually measuring achievement. Otherwise I think the presentations, the activities and everything else was very well done considering the circumstances.",
                "This course was very well adapted to learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Aside from Zoom lectures, the instructor sent students into breakout rooms to prepare skits that they would later perform in front of the entire class. She also made use of Jamboards, Kahoot, online games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Pictionary, and Jeopardy, as well as other virtual activities, to keep students engaged while learning French.",
                "The virtual discussion was good but breakout rooms should be reconsidered.",
                "In general, I think it worked really well. My main concern was getting enough feedback when I was speaking over Zoom, at that was hard to do in a Zoom room with 9 students. Perhaps one on one tutoring session from time to time could help achieve that purpose.",

Though I understand that some students may be taking this class simply to fulfill a language requirement, I think this course is most fruitful for students who approach it with the mindset that they would actually like to use French in their day to day lives at some point. \r\n\r\nThe texts that we read in this course are varied, the small class size means that students have an opportunity to practice speaking everyday, and Professor Fields is very helpful and understanding.",
