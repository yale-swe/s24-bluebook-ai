The class broadened my perspective of French culture and literature, as well as make me think more critically about the way I write in French. I was able to listen, understand, and speak French more comfortably, and walked away with a better grasp of the language.",
                "This course was a fantastic intermediate french course. It was intense, meeting for two hours every weekday, but the reward was worth it! We covered all the material of L3 and L4 french, all the while improving speaking, listening, and writing skills.",
                "The first half of the course was mostly spent on refining the grammar we learned in the previous French courses, the second half was mostly devoted to new grammar (less conjugations, more structures). We learned a lot of vocabulary and improved upon our ability to speak and understand spoken French.",

            "comments": [
                "This class, and the intensive series in general (FREN 125/145) is arguably the best way to learn French outside of going to a french-speaking country. You will improve your french significantly and having started learning french in August, 145 offers you the chance to read actual french classics and french novels. The exchange with the French students was also a really great experience and a great way to make friends and practice your French, but I think with the exchange and moving to a new book every 2 weeks, it does feel like a lot that you are doing at once. You do get into a rhythm and you get used to it but often the work seemed to be kind of overkill, like the grammar worksheets. They are helpful, but especially towards the end of the semester, they just felt kind of unnecessary. Mme also knows that we are working very hard, and I do think the work you put in is very rewarding, so it isn't necessarily the fault of the course or Mme Skorupa how much work it is. This is an intensive language course, it's gonna be a lot of work regardless. Taking L3 or L4 separately is not easy either. Overall, this class was really great and you get super close with your classmates, but it can be draining at times, especially if you are taking a full course load.",
                "The strengths of this course is that it is truly an immersive French experience. You are listening and engaging with French in fun ways in class for two hours everyday that forces you to confront your language skills and improve them. The way the reading is structured is designed to help you exponentially increase your vocabulary and level of proficiency. Moreover, through the Tlcom exchange one learns a lot about French culture and can engage with people from France. Intensive French is truly defined to be intense, which includes the 4 or more hours of homework. One should certainly keep this in mind when signing up for the course as I believe that it is both the courses strength and weakness. On the one hand, it gives you a lot of practice that is worth while in the end; however, the quantity of reading and exercises can become cumbersome, generating burnout half-way through and making it difficult to stay engaged with the language.",
                "This course is very strong! There is a lot of homework, but it is mostly very applicable and helpful. One thing I would say is that the audio exercises can be somewhat tedious, sometimes going much too fast on difficult material, and then going very slowly on the easy material. Other than that, the course is very well organized and well designed.",
                "I think that the pace of the class was its biggest strength, it was fast but I felt like we spent an appropriate amount of time on everything; I never showed up to a test thinking that we didn't spend enough time on grammar in class. You do genuinely learn a lot of French (it'd be hard not to when you have class every day for almost 2 hours).\r\nThe biggest weakness of the course is absolutely the out-of-class workload. It's insane to the point where it actually had a detrimental impact on my French; I never had time to double-check my writing because I had to do more French homework, and I never had time to study for the tests. I never felt like the course-packet exercises were helpful, and just stopped doing them. I also didn't enjoy any of the books we read besides Le Petit Nicolas, everything went downhill after that (I think I would've liked Un Sac de Billes if we had enough time to read it, which we definitely didn't). The workload must be rethought and downgraded for this class to be successful and worth taking.",
                "Strengths: You gain a lot of exposure to French, so you become fluent aurally and comprehensively by the end of it. You also receive a decent amount of oral practice, although this is the hardest skill to learn fluently in any language. You learn French well enough to go to France and speak the language with locals on the street. Weaknesses: The workload... effective education strategies recommend less work but with substantive exercises. The way the class is structured at the moment is a barrage of exercises (some that serve no true purpose but accountability, like movie or novel questions, which don't help improve language given quantity over quality) and weekly exams. My recommendations: have fewer assignments taken for grades (this encourages students to read the material in depth or in more detail (without worrying about what material shows up on the exercises)), reduce or eliminate most of the workbook exercises, have set grammar days in class to make up for the lack of exercises in the workbook, reduce the number of movies that are seen outside of class (or incorporate them into the class times). It is a 2 credit course, but it feels like it should be worth 4-5 credits... The amount of work is NOT humanly possible. You need to live and breath French in order to do everything (and 2 hours per night is not enough for slow-learning people...). This defeats the purpose of the course. Without breaks to consolidate the information, you just forget it at the end."

                "Yes, yes, yes--if you are actually dedicated to learning french.\r\n\r\nBy nature of meeting 10 hrs/week (and likely more via office hours and study sessions) you hear a lot of French and speak a lot of French. It is kind of insane just how much you improve. That being said, this class is A LOT of work. It's 2 credits but essentially the same amount of time meeting as 2 classes, and it definitely feels like a 3 credit course. You have to do French every single night or else you will fall behind the test for the next week. Granted, it is a really engaging class and Mme Skorupa is a great professor and does a great job of engaging the class that it feels less like you do the work because you have a test every week, as I think I came to understand the importance of training your brain in French and I understood the importance of reviewing grammar after reading the books. It's great if that is what you want, but DO NOT take this class if you just want to get through your language requirement. This class will only be useful and beneficial for you if you actually want to learn French, and Mme Skorupa is a gem who will support you if that is what you want out of this class. You get what you put into it, so this class is arguably one of the most rewarding classes I have ever taken, but that is a result of having a good group of students that you inevitably get close with, Mme Skorupa, and the 2-4 hours a day that you will spend a night on this class. As everyone else takes language classes one level at a time and sleep at a normal time, you will question why you are choosing to take intensive french, but I do believe the intensive French series at Yale is a hidden gem that is actually so rewarding. \r\n\r\nI would also only take 2 courses along with this course if you are planning to take it. Having taken FREN 125, this class feels like it was even more work just because you have to read actual french novels and do grammar worksheets and watch movies and actually take the time to understand everything as opposed to just doing grammar worksheets in FREN 125. I took 3 credits along with this course, and that was only possible because the other 3 courses did not have a very high workload and were kind of gutty. Be smart about how you plan your courses. To really get the most out of this class, you have to be prepared to make the focus of your semester learning French and doing all of the work for the class above your major requirements for example.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is taking there studies in French seriously, such as if interested in the French certificate or Major. It is a great way to fast track and fully immerse yourself in the language. You will have an amazing mentor to encourage all along the way, and make great connections with your classmates and beyond. With that said, it is a lot of work and you have to go in with the understanding that the will take up the bulk of your studies for the entire semester. Time management is crucial and making sure that you are doing things that bring you joy outside of learning French is important. All is to say, if you have the dedication and want to challenge yourself this course is for you!",
                "I would recommend this course to others, but I would make sure they understood that the workload is quite extreme. I would certainly warn them against taking more than two other classes at the same time.",
                "If you want to learn French FAST, definitely.",
                "I wish I could, but I can't in good faith recommend this class. This class ruined my semester; I would love to be exaggerating but I'm completely serious, and I know my classmates were all also having a hard time. It's not just because it's intensive, I took FREN 125 and the workload was a lot but 1) helpful 2) doable and acceptable. It did suck that tests were on Tuesday nights for FREN 125, but that felt like nothing compared to the out-of-class time in this class. This class was not just 1 hour 50 min a day (which is already a lot!), because we had to show up 10 min early every Tuesday and had frequent movie nights. I know it seems stupid to complain about 10 minutes movies, but sometimes it was like adding a whole other class period to the day. There was no acknowledgement that this was extra time that we didn't anticipate having to spend, and no indication that we'd ever be ameliorated for it. Bottom line, Mme Skorupa is a really nice person, but it seems like she felt she had complete ownership over our time, with the extra out-of-class sessions and with the workload. I wasn't even trying to get 100s on every assignment, I was just trying to do the bare minimum. Even if I wasn't taking any other classes during the semester, this class still would've been too much because of the disregard for its students.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who want to gain a rapid basis of the French language and culture. However, keep in mind that the workload is insane. This is an intensive language course at the university whose French program is already one of the toughest in the nation. You need to remain motivated and keep your spirits up to stay up to date with every assignment. Thankfully, Madame Skorupa is very understanding, and she will give you extensions if you need them. The inherent structure of the course is challenging, though."
