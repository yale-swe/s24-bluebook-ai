It was a difficult class for me in that I felt often out of place, or that I didn't have the same foundation as other students who might have been in DS or had a stronger foundation in classic texts and poetry from their high schools. A lot of the terms were not familiar to me, the references I didn't always get, and was often afraid of sounding dumb. The professor was so so kind though and always welcomed my thoughts and voice, and didn't expect us to know any terms ahead of time. I feel very lucky to have had her as a professor."

                "There was an interesting selection of poetry, though I must say (despite our conversations on the nature of the literary canon) I was disappointed that the course left out so many of the poets whose names I've heard forever but have never studied (Eliot beyond one of his essays, Keats, Yeats, etc.) However, at the same time many of the poets felt unrelated and randomly thrown onto the syllabus, so I wish there had been more continuity in tracing the foundations of English poetry. The in-class discussions didn't always feel productive, and I was almost wondering if the course should have been taught in a lecture rather than a seminar style. Also, the essay assignments felt frustratingly specific at times, such that I couldn't explore a poem and draw my own conclusions but rather had to take the prompt and then find a poem to fit it.",
                "I think Alexander Pope and William Wordsworth shouldn't be the only two poets that are mandated for the Poetry II curriculum. It was these two poets - the white man poets - that my professor had to teach, it was through the other poets we were able to learn from women and women of color. Yale mandating two white men to be taught shows what the English department as a whole still values most. I think no poets should be mandated to be taught, or if there were two poets that had to be taught across curriculum, one, if not both, should be women of color. It seems silly that Pope and Wordsworth are the \"must reads.\" What is more important is that each curriculum is reflective of the vast history and diversity of poetry in this country - across all identities. By only mandating these two white men, it means a professor could pick the other poets as white men too, and have an all white male curriculum. I am grateful my professor chose women and women of color as the other poets!\r\n\r\nProfessor Levine lead discussion about the canon, and academia's role in creating and containing the canon, and I was grateful for that. She was a fantastic teacher. I liked our discussions (even though imposter syndrome would creep in here and there), the selections of poems we read, how one thing built on the other, and the end of semester project and the opportunity to do archival research was one of the most special experiences of my life."
