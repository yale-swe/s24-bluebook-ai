                "Strengths: MICHAEL FARINA!!! Exams were very manageable, as well as the coursework",

Micheal is really lovely, and he wants you to succeed, but make no mistake that this class requires effort. It's not a gut. You have to go to class, and you have to sort of play the game that Micheal creates. If you play the game, and do the assignments, Micheal will ensure that you do well, but if you don't... you're in hot water.",

Italian is the perfect language to learn at Yale for the language requirement --- great department (Michael Farina is absolutely the highlight, a fantastic professor) and great faculty in general, Italian as a language isn't very hard to learn especially if you've already learned Spanish or French, L3 is basically a review of everything you learned in L1 and L2 so, personally, it was the easiest of all the levels",
