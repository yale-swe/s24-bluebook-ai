                "This is an incredible course. It gives agency to the students to decide how they want to interpret the medium of photography. It is somehow both loosely structured and incredibly rigorous. I do wish that the first couple of weeks were a bit more structured, however. I would have liked more specific photography assignments (i.e. take a photo of a person), so that we could slowly develop our own photography practice throughout the semester. I also would have liked even more instruction on the history of photography and on past and contemporary titans of the art form.",

                "Was a super fun course wish we went out to take photos more in class",
                "I liked how exploratory it was -- ted just wants you to fall in love with photography which is amazing -- and part of it is just doing it yourself and learning through experience and we definitely were given the freedom and opportunity to practice. one thing I wished we did was more crits because that's when we got to see each others work and get feedback, it was very intimidating to just be given unlimited freedom so I wish we got more opportunity for discussion and structured help. don't know if this is possible but I loved how we learned and looked at so many other photographers, and wish we had mini workshops or something in which we tried to emulate a style of a photographer we talked about that week or so and learn that way",

I grew in so many ways and now feel like photography will be a part of my life forever. If I had taken this course freshman year I might have decided to be an art major.",

                "Yes it is such a great course",
                "YES IF YOU CAN GET INTO THIS CLASS TAKE IT YOU WON'T REGRET IT ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES AT YALE",
