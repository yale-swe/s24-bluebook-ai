I also learned more about the classic world's cultural practices and the context in which these works were written/read/produced. Most importantly, I learned how to write essays in a compressed amount of time.",
                "I learned a lot about good close reading and analysis, writing an effective college level paper, and how to participate in mature and intelligent discussions in a college setting.",
                "ability to critically analyze texts",
                "I gained a lot from this course: knowledge of foundational literary works, some of which I'd heard much about but never read for myself; a sense of the some of the throughlines in the Western tradition of storytelling; practice in analyzing texts in various ways, with an eye to details and broad interpretations.",
                "Besides getting to read, discuss, and write about some of the most amazing texts in the classical and medieval Western literary tradition, I developed my close reading skills in this class.",
                "This course pushed my reading comprehension a ton, and by the end I felt as though I could unravel things within texts that I never would have seen before. I also essentially learned how to write a proper literature essay and figure out what to focus on within a paper like that, which was super helpful."

                "Strengths: incredible array of texts that we got to read. I wouldn't change a thing really. Ample room to explore (creatively and academically) the texts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the texts were less compelling (Book of Matthew, St. Augustine) but that's more of a personal thing.",
                "Strengths: very organized, great discussion, and a syllabus with works of literature that are easy to put in conversation with one another. Weaknesses: I wish we could have spent more time on some of the texts, especially the ones where we bought an expensive book and spent a lot of time reading it only to focus on it for one class period, or sometimes even half of a class period. But that is a characteristic of DS in general, and I'm happy that we covered all the works that we did.",
                "great reading, organization, and arrangement of seminars; flawless in my view.",
                "I think the lecture-section structure of the class is really strong because it gives both professors and students the ability to draw upon what is discussed during the lecture in section. That said, I have heard vastly different experiences of and perspectives about DS Lit depending on the professor. There are such a great number of themes in each text that the professor must select relevant themes to discuss which can sometimes make section feel a little repetitive if the themes are similar across the different texts (which many are, and that may be the point between certain texts. When it is so, the discussion is incredibly interesting as we compare the texts. Other times the section can feel a little stagnant, but if a balance can be struck on old and new themes which each new reading I think the course overall could become more explorative itself and encourage higher level of participation in section.",
                "The course's main strength is a syllabus of works that strikingly build on one another to form a cohesive canon. In class, we regularly discussed those connections, which I think allowed us to understand each text fairly deeply despite our very limited time. The lectures were excellent, too. As far as weaknesses, the volume of reading, though essential, is tough, and making progress in the course sometimes requires assumptions about prior knowledge or skipping over important aspects of a reading.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Amazing selection of texts (probably my favorite across all three DS tracks), which enables you to trace some of the most important themes and motifs through the development of the Western literary tradition. \r\n- Professor Yeazell is phenomenal. Among other things, she does a great job of introducing texts and leading class discussions, she critically engages with everybody's comments during seminars, and her feedback on essays is incredibly smart and thorough. I cannot recommend her highly enough!\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- If I could adjust the course structure, I would cut out the Andalusian poetry and spend more time on Dante; I would cut out Genesis from the syllabus (we didn't even end up getting to it) and possibly also the Gospel of Matthew.",
                "Yeazell is an incredible professor because she understands so much and sees things within texts that I would never even dream of, but this is a double-edged sword in that it makes the class slightly scarier because I would worry the observations I made weren't worthwhile. Overall, though, I found our class environment really engaging and I learned an incredible amount and am so grateful for both Yeazell's insight and that of my classmates."

                "Definitely! If you're looking to improve your writing and reasoning skills, you should enroll in DS. The literature track is especially equipped to ensure you a plethora of interesting texts to engage with.",
                "Yes, especially with Professor Yeazell. She is so smart and so good at introducing texts in a way that is digestible but also interesting, and she really cares about each student and each paper they write. DS Lit is a great introduction to a lot of important works of literature, and forces you to adapt to college level reading and writing.",
                "Yes. Terrifically interesting content.",
                "Yes, I think I grew as a writer and reader in an undeniable way. This course challenged me in all of the right ways and I learned an incredible amount about the texts we're reading and \"literature\" in general.",
                "I'd recommend DS to another student, so long as they're prepared for the load of reading and the pace of seminars, which can leave you behind if you don't stay on top of your game. Lit may have been the highlight of the fall semester.",
                "Absolutely! If you're a DS student, you don't have much choice, but for what it's worth, DS literature was my favorite track this past semester. The texts were consistently interesting and engaging. You do have some degree of choice about your professor, and to that end, I cannot recommend Professor Yeazell highly enough. She made the class that much better.",
                "This was an incredible class - Yeazell challenged us both within class and throughout papers. Because of the high level at which we were expected to perform, I definitely became a much better reader and observer. I would absolutely recommend it, you just have to know what you're in for (a lot of reading)."
