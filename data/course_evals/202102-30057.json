                "I learned about the development of contemporary Chinese films, including the different expressions of the fifth and sixth generation directors in different periods, as well as the context of new cinema in Hong Kong and Taiwan. At the same time, I also learned the technical terminology of scene analysis, which I have never learned before. Moreover, I feel that I have a deeper thinking about the cultural connotations represented by \"Chineseness\" and \"Pan-Asian\".",
                "I learned about movements in contemporary Chinese cinema, such as the Hong Kong New Wave, as well as how to analyze a scene (equivalent to close-reading a paragraph in a novel). This skill was by far the most useful takeaway from the class. I can now identify details including types of shots, use of lighting, etc. and this skill will be applicable if I take another film class in the future.",
                "Film analysis, and also some improvements to structuring written essays.",
                "Introductory knowledge on film studies, mainly scene analysis. Greater understanding of Chinese history and film movements in China.",
                "Lots of historical knowledge on China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong filmmakers around the 1980s! Also gained insight as to how formal elements of cinema are used by directors to enhance the stories they tell.",
                "In this class, I learned a lot about how to analyze films, such as camera angles, shadows, and details of objects.\r\nI also learned some skills about appreciating movies or understanding the emotions that the director wants to express.\r\nMost importantly, I learned about a part of Chinese history that I had not been exposed to in this course because of the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television of the People's Republic of China's control over this area. That had a big impact on me, to learn about these different histories. I also got a lot of new inspiration from it.",
                "I learned how to analyze the formal elements of a film and the history of Chinese cinema.",
                "I developed the ability to do a shot-by-shot analysis for a scene within a film, the knowledge of the formal elements of cinema, and insights on how Chineseness is defined by Chinese cinema and other aspects of China."

                "The advantage is that Ms.Wang recommended many high-quality papers and books, and the discussion part in the class allowed me to understand the views of other students. The disadvantage is that I feel that the topic content is so rich that I have no way to absorb it immediately.",
                "Strengths are a very well designed course. The order of units is smart and the assigned readings and films make a lot of sense. Weaknesses are in the pacing of class sessions. It often felt like there were a few talking points Prof. Wang wanted us to discuss, so she would often prioritize these points over free-form discussion. This often meant that it felt awkward participating in class because there wasn't enough space to reflect on individual opinions and reactions to the films.",
                "Strengths: It's really interesting course material that's rarely focused on. It's also meant as an introductory course of sorts, as it teaches the formal elements of cinema as well as other content. \r\nWeaknesses: It's not particularly suited to be a summer coursetoo little time is devoted to each individual movie, and there's not much of a chance to digest the information we get. It kinda hits like a barrage; even now, I'm not really certain as to specifics.",
                "From my perspective, this course can add some films about different period in China, such as the period before the war against Japan.",
                "I think the discussion in class couldve been structured to allow for some guided questions and free flowing conversation as well. Some of the texts were quite convoluted while others were much easier to digest."

                "Yes. I really like the teaching style and enjoy this course.",
                "Yes. Watching films under an analytical lens may sound taxing, but it is extremely rewarding and worth it.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in Chinese history or to somebody who is looking for a good introductory film class. The class was definitely structured to make film studies approachable to people who have no experience in it. That said, I think an interest in China and some basic understanding of its modern history is helpful, especially because a lot of the films are related to history.",
                "Yes, because it's interesting content. If you're not a film major focused on the Sinosphere for movies, it's very likely you've only seen one of the movies in the syllabus. For diasporic Chinese (which I am), I think it's actually an incredible course. If there were a chance to take this during the normal school year, I would. As for the summer, it's a maybeit's not really that suited to be a summer course.",
                "Of course. \r\nIf they will be engaged in the profession of directing or choreography, I recommend this course very well. Because they are able to learn more basic knowledge about films.\r\nIf they are a part of student who are interested in Chinese culture, I also recommend this course. They can obtain so unique vision to learn the history of China.",
                "Yes, as an introductory film survey course.",
                "Yes. This class is great if you want to take a class different from your major or if you want to learn more about film analysis. Also, the class is a great opportunity to watch a variety of Chinese films (both iconic films and some films that may not be internationally popular but are still extremely good)."
