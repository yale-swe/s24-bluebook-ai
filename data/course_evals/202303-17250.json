                "I consider myself a very positive person. However, I would have to be utterly delusional in order to find any strengths in this course. The lectures were severely lacking in engaging material. As an escape, at times, I would run off to the bathroom during lectures to clear my mind amidst the feeling of boredom that would overwhelm me if I stayed sat during the entire class. While I appreciate Professor Wells' kindness, she simply cannot maintain an audience's attention because she is constantly stuttering and switching from one thought to the other. I sincerely recommend that she practices her presentations ahead of time to avoid appearing as unprepared and mindless as she did this last semester with the aforementioned behavior. The material may be appealing to students who have a real interest in arthropods, but these lectures were so excruciating that they held the power to suck away my passion for Ecology. I hope that she can apply this constructive criticism to improve her instruction in future semesters so students can enjoy the course as much as she seems to enjoy teaching it.",
                "Strengths: all the videos of bugs doing cool things! Marta must have scoured all of the nature documentaries ever to get these videos. they're super helpful for both understanding the content and just for being entertaining",
                "nothing really much!",
                "Strengths: Interesting, fascinating subject with a lot of videos and exmaples to keep students engaged. \r\nWeaknesses: A little disorganized, professor gets mixed up frequently and often is not able to respond to student questions."

                "Marta has a lot of enthusiasm, and if you're interested in learning about bugs, you will like the course! If you're taking it as a gut... definitely possible but the three midterms can be a lot. You will need to really know the material. But otherwise, there is no required work between classes which is nice.",

                "YES a must take class Marta is an amazing teacher.",
                "Probably not, unfortunately. I LOVE insects, and I don't regret taking this class, but it's a little too disorganized and I personally found the teaching too confusing to recommend it to anyone else."
