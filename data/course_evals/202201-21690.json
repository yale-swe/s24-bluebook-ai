                "Exams and mid-terms are far too long. I found that there the assessments would have been just as effective in testing our command of the material w/out the extreme lengths.",
                "Strengths: relaxed class. Mwalimu is very kind.\r\nWeaknesses: I think the L2 curriculum is pretty impractical if the goal is communication. There's a huge focus on perfecting different words with all the noun classes (pronouns, prefixes for adjectives, verb prefixes, etc.). However, I forgot a lot of vocabulary this semester, and the lack of speaking practice makes communication really difficult. I think this class could benefit from focusing on the most-used noun classes (and coming back to them in later courses) and learning topics that will increase students' ability to converse/write on a range of topics.",
                "strengths:\r\n- really nice teacher and fun energy in the class, everyone enjoys being there\r\n- good emphasis on practice of speaking in class\r\n- lots of interesting learnings about culture in Kenya and Tanzania\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n- all types of exam were very similar, would be cool to be graded on an improvised oral conversation too\r\n- more varied homework, assignments were often monotonous - more cultural research would be fun",
                "Strengths: It has a manageable work load and I felt like I learned a fair amount of Kiswahili.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I dont think enough speaking and listening practice were built into the course.",
                "I think more emphasis on speech production and understanding other students Swahili would be helpful.",

                "Yes, Kiswahili is a really fun class to take that I'd recommend to anyone unsure about which language to take at Yale. It's engaging, you get to learn about a fairly different language from English from a very different culture and the workload is more manageable than some other languages.",
                "Yes!!!! Class is so fun, and you learn so much without even realising it!",
                "Absolutely, The teaching style is engaging and personable. My professor brought in toys to help us understand words and helped us practice actually speaking the language and engaging with others trying to talk to each other."
