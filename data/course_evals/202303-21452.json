                "This course has aided me in developing a myriad of knowledge, skills, and insights. The practice of Film and Scene Analysis was one of the first skills we touched upon, and through that, I was able to see film in a different light  one far more rigorous. What motivated the director's decisions? What effect does the scene have on the audience? What ethical issues could exist with depicting disaster? Beyond tangible skills, I found that I have learned so much more about Japan as a nation in the face of disaster  this notion of \"Japanese-ness.\" This course has expanded my image of disaster beyond the typical \"boom! *explosion*\" type disaster; rather, the mental agony, the aftermath,  the memory and nostalgia, and its proper archival. This course definitely made me appreciate the idea of \"home,\" and moreover, foster sympathy for those who can't go back to the place they were once so attached to.",

                "The strengths of this course lies in its structure: it is incredibly organized, readings are engaging, and seminar discussions are always a highlight. Plus, the films we got to watch were awesome! We would watch films, then come to class the next day and make fascinating connections with the film to our readings, and the greater world. I never thought \"Your Name,\" one of the greatest anime films (and one of my personal favorites), had so much to do with disaster. The film on its own was already emotionally compelling  but after understanding the story it told from the context of the Fukushima Disaster, it resonated with me far greater. The opportunity to experience and watch all these films is something I am genuinely grateful for. I did not find any weaknesses.",
                "No weaknesses.",
                "I think that some strengths of the course are its structure and syllabus. The readings felt carefully selected to foster engagement with the films, and the films in total provided several unique perspectives toward nuclear disasters, capturing a wide range of cultural, social phenomena that occurred as a result of nuclear disaster."

You get to watch classic Japanese films like the original Godzilla, films that bring you to tears like In This Corner of the World, and modern masterpieces like Your Name. Then, you can develop an even deeper emotion connection with these films based off the readings and class discussions. It makes you see the world in a different light.",
