                "I learned about the historical and current landscape of performance art and practiced different approaches to creating individual and group performances.",
                "- I very much gained a much greater insight into the world of performance art, what it is, and what it could be. The class was a great way to gain insight into performance art as a medium of art. And most importantly, this class empowered us to do and create our own performance art pieces, and I think I gained really valuable insights into myself as a person and as an artist. \r\n- By allowing us to do our own performance art pieces, we were able to go on our own individual artistic journeys throughout the semester and also see our classmates work grow and evolve as well.\r\n- Performance art could really be anything and this class really showed me that.\r\n- Taught me so many interesting ways to approach performance art by providing readings about the history of performance art and highlighted many really interesting artists. And there's also so much creative exchange in witnessing my peer's pieces and also collaborating with them to make pieces. \r\n- I think the discussion and reflection parts of the class where we reflect on readings and our own performance serves its purpose of reflection really well and I think a lot of insights can be gained through these discussions.\r\n- Shilarna and Nick (our TF) are incredibly insightful and gave great feedback and guidance throughout the class"

                "I think this course is a fantastic theatre credit, and its interdisciplinary nature is one of the best parts   you can explore a range of mediums and really experiment with your creative pieces. I think the one weakness was organization  often times I would do the readings/material for the day and then we would end up doing something totally different in class, and the syllabus changed around quite a bit.",
                "This course is brilliant. Period.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Shilarna and our TF Nick are deeply insightful and supportive. They are knowledgeable about the subject matter and gave great guidance all throughout the class. \r\n- They also did a great job building a low-stress, welcoming, safe environment where we felt welcomed to create our own performance art pieces and as a small class, I think we really bonded and trusted each other and respected each others boundaries and it really created an excellent space for performing and experimenting. Shilarna and Nick did great in making everyone comfortable and emphasized the importance of safety and of respecting people's boundaries. It was a great environment to try things outside of your comfort zone and grow. \r\n- The performance art pieces everyone created were SOOOO GOOOD, and it's by far my favorite aspect of the class. Every week, I saw thoughtful insightful pieces from my classmates. And certainly, the performance art pieces we examined and read about were also deeply interesting and inspiring and really gave us a foundation to jump off of and provided a tool box of ideas to experiment and refine our pieces through\r\n- There was a great amount of flexibility for how many times you wanted to perform, so you did not have to perform every week but you certainly could if you wanted to\r\n- We received a lot of feedback on our pieces, some in a group setting, other times it was one-on-one with Shilarna and Nick, and the feedback was always respectful and helpful\r\n\r\nSemi-Weaknesses:\r\n- I think the first two or so weeks of the class could be a little disorienting as you settle in and learn what this class is about, but once you're like three week in, and we officially get into the cycle of having readings and then doing performance art pieces, the class really gets rolling and just becomes better and better.\r\n- The reading are very interesting and the artists and pieces we talk about are also incredibly cool and mind-stretching. Though, the sheer density and occasionally amount of the reading could be a lot and I think you really need to set aside time if you want to read through everything. However, there's still a lot of value to be gained even if you skimmed through a reading and if you skip some readings you can still get by. \r\n- I think a minor weakness of the class is that sometime the schedule is a little disorganized but the disorganization is mostly minor and at times charming"

                "Yes! I think it's a great course for theater and art majors but anyone interested in art would probably get a lot out of it. It always felt like a very chill class but the creative pieces being produced were incredible  I was really blown away by my classmate's ideas and work (and learned a lot from all of them).",
                "Take this class. Take this class. Take this class. I hope the subliminal message has been planted successfully. This class is EXCEPTIONAL! Performance art is really fascinating, but this class is particularly incredible for the opportunities you have to just be creative. Each student in our class brought really different experiences, from visual arts to theater to film to no arts background but a lot of enthusiasm, and everyone made a number of brilliant works throughout the semester. The opportunity for weekly performance responses was so creatively rewarding. I can't recommend this course enough. I literally wish it was a required course for everyone at Yale. It changed the way I view performance, the way I view art, and the way I view the world. Easily one of favorite classes I've taken at Yale. I grew so much as a student, creator, and explorer of the arts. Take this class!",
                "I highly recommend this class to really any student even if you don't quite know what performance art is. And I especially recommend this class if you have at all an interest in any form of art, performance, theatre, performance art, etc."
