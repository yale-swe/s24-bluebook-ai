Previous reviews said you don't really get to learn a lot of advanced features of Ableton and won't be able to produce something really well by the end, but I think that's BS. You really get out what you put in. Dr. A and the TFs are SO knowledgeable and if you want to learn more advanced things, they can show you. You get 24/7 access to the EDM studio too.

Its actually pretty incredible to reflect on how much we managed to cover in just a semester  its just a beautifully constructed courses. It runs like clockwork. \r\n\r\nMy advice is to use the provided access to the Yale music technology lab in order to spend as much time as possible practicing using Ableton. Its addictive and before you know it youll be feeling super comfortable in it.",

                "This course is taught in a lecture format with powerpoints, which is not very conducive for learning a practical skill like music production. Often times lectures felt long and unengaging, and the powerpoints were not helpful. A simple way to make the course so much better would be to do away with the useless powerpoints and to cut straight to showing us how to implement the skill in Ableton Live. It would also help a lot of the demo Ableton files used in class were not already fully completed. Seeing audio effects implemented and adjusted step by step would make learning them so much clearer. I also felt that the assignments were uninspiring and tedious due to over-specification of instructions. If the assignments had a bit more freedom for us to be creative in making our own music, they would have been fun instead of tedious. The only assignment where I really learned a lot was our final project, which was completely open-ended - make a tune or remix in Ableton.",
                "The labs are amazing! I wish every class featured lab work where we got to engage with the features rather than learning about them in a presentation mode for 2 hours, but otherwise it's great.",
                "lectures were often dry and ppl often missed class, but the projects were super fun and the teacher is really cool and sweet, i loved the class",
                "I loved the structure of the class' assignments. Very practical and engaging. Lectures were slightly unstructured at times.",
                "The EDM example tunes played in class are excellent and really showcase each individual technique.\r\nHowever, showing Ableton screenshots on a slide show is not the most engaging & easy-to-follow way to demonstrate how to use an app.",
                "Absolute perfection. Such amazing fun. And a special word for the TFs who make this whole thing work - my TF, Benjamin Webster, really made my experience what it was!",
                "Strengths: final project really brought many students together. Dr. A and the TAs are very skillful in production and the demos sounded wonderful! \r\nWeaknesses: More opportunities for creative freedom (such as with the final project) and collaboration with the many other talented peers. The material in the lecture slides, while helpful for reference, could have been presented in a more hands-on, interactive way. More room for trial-and-error would be awesome.",
                "I loved having weekly lab with my TF - I definitely learned the most from the hands-on exploration. One weakness was that the class went incredibly quickly sometimes, which made it hard to follow/learn all the content.",
                "The professor and TFs are clearly well versed but the lecture format of the class was not very engaging especially for trying to learn to use a software.",
                "I think the class would improve from having two one hour lectures a week instead of one two hoir lecture. We often took in a lot of information at once at once and it could sometimes be hard to retain it. But the weekly discussion sections were very helpful for that reason.",
                "Strengths: listening to EDM in class was always instructional, learning ableton was great, and the final project was an amazing opportunity to learn tons and make something satisfying \r\n\r\nCons: the lectures were often hard to followits the nature of the material perhaps but I learned a lot more by doing. I wonder if it might be better if the class was structured more like Composition Seminar in that was more self directed and composition based from the beginning",
                "I wish we were given more freedom to explore and exercise creativity in the assignments for this class. The assignments were very formulaic and hand-holdy, and we didn't get the opportunity to actually make music until all the way at the end of the class, for the final project. I learn best by experimentation, and I feel like I only really started feeling comfortable making music in Ableton by the last week of class, when I was working on the final project. I don't see why we couldn't have the current final project as a midterm project, and get students started with making music as soon as possible, so that by the time the final project rolls around, they have some experience under their belts. After all, if your final project song is also your first song ever, how can you really expect to grow or improve at all? Listening to my classmates' final project songs at the end of the semester, I was blown away by how talented some of them are. I just wish we could have had some sort of listening/critiquing session in the middle of the class, so I could get feedback from my peers and improve as a musician in time for the final project.",
                "Super easy and interesting! Fantastic lab section! Wish there were more actual creative production projects.",
                "Lectures were very thorough in showing us all the different possibilities in Ableton, and labs were especially helpful for getting hands-on experience and really internalizing the techniques. Sometimes the material didn't make any sense to me until I got the vivid in-person experience of working in the actually program, and so I wondered if labs should be covering a lot of the material at a more rudimentary/step-by-step pace before it was then delved into in more technical detail in class lectures. The lab assignments and projects were very fun and helpful for learning the material!"

                "I recommend this class because it is one of the rare music class offered at Yale about popular music. The music department has been neglecting contemporary popular music and tend to only focus on what is considered academic music. The EDM class is a great change from that constraint.",
                "Highly. Take this class if you at all can. Everyone likes music - if you like other music, find out how it can be produced electronically and how you can enrich those genres with EDM elements. And if you like EDM, then get ready to have a ton of fun.",
                "Yes! A fun, exciting experience especially if you are a music producer!",

                "Yes, its very fun!",
                "I would recommend to anyone interestsed in composing with some sort of music background. Without that, its pretty impossible to do the assignments well. However, the grading is pretty easy so even without background, you can pass.",
                "Yes! If you have some experience producing music, even if its garage band, and you are at all enjoy electronic music, I would definitely recommend this class! I would still recommend it even if you have no experience, but you will probably have to put in more time on the assignments. And the highlight of the class is really producing a tune at the end. You could also choose to do a research presentation but I think you should only do that if you are really struggling with Ableton.",
                "If you want to learn Ableton and learn about EDM absolutely - if you dont put anything into the class you wont get much though. The class itself is very easy so doing the bare minimum means learning very little. If you really put in effort it will be wonderful.",
                "Yes if you are looking for a gut music class. No if you actually want to learn anything. I was very excited for this class when I first saw it on coursetable - it looked almost perfect on paper. But in reality, this class was pretty disappointing. I learned almost nothing in this class. Granted, I have some experience with music production, but I think I would have learned 10x as much by spending that time making beats on my own. In lectures, Dr. A would demonstrate some of the effects that are possible in Ableton, but we were never given many opportunities to actually apply that knowledge in our own songs, since almost all of the assignments were about matching a template by following a step by step list of instructions (eg. set the velocity of this note to 70) and had no room for creative input. I took CPSC 035 my freshman year and learned so much more in that class than in this one, despite the fact that it was a first-year seminar with no prerequisites, and this class is an upper-level music elective *with* prerequisites. All in all, I felt like this class was extremely hand-holdy, and the expectations for students were so low that we were never really given the opportunity to learn anything. And it's such a shame, because I know some of my classmates are extremely talented musicians, and this class could have been so cool if we were simply allowed to exercise our creativity and run wild with our imaginations. Music production is one of those skills that you can only get better at by practicing a lot, and in this class, were were really only given one single opportunity to do so, and that was the final project. The best part about this class, by a long shot, is getting access to the music studio on the 4th floor of Stoeckel Hall. Everything else was pretty pointless in my opinion.",
                "Absolutely. Super interesting, fun, and actually useful if you want to learn some basic production skills. Lectures are rather monotonous and boring, but the slides are great and the lab sections are golden hands on experience with ableton (production software). Also incredibly incredibly easy.",
                "Go for it! I was intimidated by Ableton at first but it's very fun :)"
