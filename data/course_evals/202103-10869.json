                "Cooper is a good professor and I learned a lot from his teaching style!! weaknesses: don't take section with Facheng if you can avoid it",
                "Basic concepts were explained in depth, while difficult concepts were not explained thoroughly",
                "Weaknesses- TFs were generally unhelpful, discussion sections did not help me engage with the material, tests seemed more like speed tests than tests of knowledge",
                "Good class overall",
                "The strengths in this course were that the content was taught well for the most part and both Professor Cooper and Dr. Lant were wonderful. Weaknesses in this course were the discussion sections, which gave me more people I knew in such a big lecture but didn't actually benefit my knowledge of chemistry.",
                "The professors in this course are very kind and do seem like they genuinely care about helping students to learn the content. However, the organization of the actual course content was very unintuitive, and I would often learn a concept several weeks after learning other concepts that should have been taught afterwards. I used Khan Academy to learn much of the course content, as the Khan Academy lectures and exercises were set up in a way that made much more sense from a pedagogical perspective. Parts of Unit 3, molecular shape, helped me to understand content that I had struggled with in units 1 and 2, and I truly feel that students would reach a higher baseline level of understanding much sooner if the content were organized in a different way. There also seemed to be little communication as to what was expected of the Teaching Fellows in section - my TF was wonderful and very helpful, but I've heard from friends that they had TFs that basically didn't care and would just sit silently while students did the quizzes. I understand that an introductory course might not be the most engaging thing to have to teach, but I feel that the structure of the course could use some attention, especially given that basically every STEM major at Yale has to take it. The content and pacing are fine, but the content needs to be rearranged.",
                "strengths - not much work. you only really have to do work leading up to the midterms and exams to prepare for them.\r\nweaknesses - discussion sections were rarely useful. online exams are not great in my opinion, but it seems to be preferred by the instructors because it makes things easier to grade, but online exams harm students in my opinion. also, i used to very much enjoy chemistry, but this class made me dislike it.",
                "The strength of this course is that there was basically a routine weekly schedule. The weakness of this course is that it is very large and difficult for the students to engage with the professors. Emails were left unread and midterms were placed at awkward times which did not give students much time to prepare.",
                "I think this course is hard to improve as it stands. Gen Chem won't ever be the most exciting course, but given that you have to take this class, you really will learn the content in a mainly nonstressful way.",
                "The course provides a good coverage of gen chem topics, and I liked the short lectures . The class slides were helpful as well. In terms of weaknesses, there was a wide gap between the level of chemistry we learned in class and the level that was expected on exams. You never knew what you were going to get on the exams, and the free response questions were sometimes unclear in what they were asking for. I also wasn't a fan of the remote exams because I prefer being in an exam room and working on paper.",
                "Strengths: lectures were engaging. workload was manageable. \r\nWeaknesses: lectures only scratched the surface of the material we were tested on. lab sections did not really help understand material better.",
                "I like that Dr. Cooper implemented the online format for exams. For me, it took away the stress watching people leave before I finished or hearing pages turn and other small distractions you get when taking an exam in a large room.",
                "I believe that this course does its job in teaching chemistry and offering many slots to get help if needed. However, I believe the discussion sections for this course need to have time devoted to an overview of the topic before we work on the questions, because more often than not, the class does not understand what it is that we had just discussed in lecture and it does not help us to go into the discussion questions completely lost. Sure, we can ask questions in discussion, but I still believe that some portion of our discussion time needs to be devoted to a brief review of the subject. Additionally, I did not feel like all of the tests in this course were fair in their ability of testing our knowledge on the subject. For the first test and the final, the test was entirely to long to get through for most students. Additionally, for the same two tests, the questions we were given (specifically, free response) were like nothing we had seen before, which made it difficult to even approach in the first place. Not that a test should be easy, but a test for this class in particular is designed to test our knowledge on the subject matter, it should not be a speed test nor a test of how well we can interpret one's question-formatting. Overall, I felt ill-prepared for the tests because of this, no matter how hard I studied. The professor failed to prepare us for these types of questions, and initially was opposed to the idea of even providing any practice for us.",
                "The course did a good job of making sure we understood chemistry topics, but I wish that there had been more support in preparing for exams, which were very difficult.  Dr. Cooper didn't provide us with a lot of resources for reviewing the material we'd learned, so we often felt unprepared for exams.",
                "The final exam was very unnecessarily painful to take, but overall Dr. Cooper was an effective lecturer. I wish the lectures had been recorded.",
                "There were many times where I felt underprepared for midterms as the questions on them were ones we had never seen before in class\/homework assignments. This was especially apparent in the final exam, where a huge portion of the questions were ones I had very little idea how to approach. Sometimes, it felt like we were rushing through the content and it would have been more helpful if Professor Cooper had done example problems that would show up on quizzes\/exams. There were also many times in which the answer keys to some questions in our discussion section work were simply wrong, which made the content very confusing to learn.",
                "The tests should not have been online. Upwards of 70% of the class just openly treated it like it was an open book exam and our professor somehow didn't seem to care which just disadvantaged people who weren't cheating which was a frustrating entirely unnecessary position to put us in. Also just FYI zoom proctoring does not keep people from cheating in the slightest. Really seemed like the professor just didn't care about this at all which was very frustrating because it definitely affects the curve of the class and the students.",
                "The lectures were very helpful for thoroughly understanding the material and I enjoyed how example calculations were worked out in class. This allowed us to learn how to properly carry them out and how to think and problem-solve like a chemist. In addition, the resources available to students were also helpful, such as peer tutoring, review sessions, and office hours. A weakness of this course would be that practice materials and homework problems weren't challenging enough to give us adequate practice with the materials learned in class. The exams consisted of problems that were much more difficult than the problems we were given outside of class, which made exams somewhat difficult to complete, as we weren't able to practice much with problems that connected the different problems we learned about.",
                "Needs greater feedback on homework.",
                "One of the strengths of the course was how many opportunities to ask questions and get help there were. One weakness of the course was that it was difficult to find practice questions and know what we needed to study. I also felt that sometimes the exam questions were overly elaborate and unnecessarily written and that there were better ways to test our knowledge of the material.",
                "The lectures were very difficult to follow and the slides did not help clarify.",
                "From my point of view, the assigned homework and in-class problems do not reflect the exams. Dr. Cooper does not send any practice exams, believing people will only study and focus on the content present on  it. However, I wish we had more practice problems that were similar to those that would show up on the exam.",
                "Weaknesses:\r\n-Not enough review time before assigned midterm. Went straight to covering new material that would not even be mentioned in the upcoming material. Another weakness is there was not enough review material available that actually matched the format of the midterm and final specifically. I feel like study groups should be encouraged more and there should be a better system in place for that to happen (filling out a survey so people can get matched). This should be done at the beginning at the semester. There should also be answer keys for the midterms afterwards. This is more preferred than meeting with a peer tutor, because there is a chance that all the material will not be reviewed in the allotted time.",
                "The only strength of the course is that everything was pretty straightforward in terms of how grades worked. In preparing for the exams, if you go through answer keys for the discussion section questions, half the answers for each packet were wrong and group work was not facilitated well. I also thought due dates for Achieve assignments were quite arbitrary. I think the course needs better material to work with so that students can actually prepare for the tests in more ways than just looking over past Achieve assignments and looking through notes that we don't fully understand. I think that the lecture slides were usually unhelpful since the bulk of the pertinent information was said aloud in class and it was very hard to access good notes because lecture was never recorded (which should be changed throughout the entire college and not just this course). Even if you don't start recording lecture next semester, it would be very beneficial if the annotated lecture slides were uploaded on canvas. In addition, the answer key to problems from the textbook were uploaded but some people could not afford the 6th edition textbook and worked with the 5th edition instead. However, the problems in the textbooks are different and it would have been nice to see an answer key to problems from the 5th edition. Lastly, for exam prep, I know a number of students who skipped lecture on exam day to study because they knew that the topics talked about in class would not be important for the test. If we spent like 10 minutes out of the 50 minute class generally summarizing concepts to study in our last minute review, I think you would have seen much better test scores.",
                "The course is obviously a requirement for many majors and for pre-med students, but for those of us (like me) who didn't see a need for chemistry in their major or careers, it didn't feel the most useful, and therefore my engagement was relatively low.",
                "The class is very straightforward and not very stressful. I believe in-person exams would have definitely helped the learning experience.",
                "Slides are very easy to follow along in lecture. Professor Cooper is a good lecturer as well.",
                "It would be beneficial if lectures were recorded, especially because of the 'Yague' that was going around campus. I did appreciate that the lectures were not overly complicated.",
                "A strength of this class may be that lecture was somewhat clear to understand. Slides for the class are also always available to students and are somewhat engaging. Weaknesses may include the lack of midterm\/final test preparation material since no other materials written by the instructor are given to students in order to prepare besides a few practice exams. Lectures are also not recorded if a student is not able to attend class.",
                "Main strengths of this class were the teaching, slides, and achieve homework\/psets. Practice exams were very helpful when given. The professors are also huge assets to the class as they explain things very clearly, make expectations clear, show how to work out problems (especially helpful), and are understanding, kind, and responsive. Discussion sections were largely not very useful as there was definitely a disparity in TA's that wanted to help and teach and those that did not. Also, more practice questions\/exams with questions similar to exams would be helpful to get used to the format and review.",
                "This course was taught in a easy way to understand but the math problems were difficult.",
                "Very well taught. Clear and easy to understand. \r\nExams were a lot harder than they should have been, not reflective of in class problems and discussion section problems.",
                "Strengths were the assignments given for practice.\r\n\r\nWeakness was the lack of peer tutors. I often went to peer tutors for my other courses and I wished that there were some for this class.",
                "Strengths were that there was a lot of support and office hours. Achieve homework was really helpful, and section worksheets gave us a time to ask questions. Lectures were incredible. The grading policies were really harsh before the first midterm, but afterwards were a lot more fair.",
                "Information presented really thoroughly in lecture",
                "The lectures were very fast paced and I enjoyed the teaching of our instructor but it disliked that there was not opportunity for review really.",
                "Strengths\r\n- multiple options for understanding material \r\n- discussion section offers more one on one learning \r\n\r\nWeaknesses \r\n- Not a lot of engagement from students \r\n- exams seemed out of line with in class material",
                "A weakness of this course is how ambiguous the grading is. I have fully completed this course and I still have no idea what letter grade I am getting and it has pretty much been like that the entire semester. Although the professor gave out rough cutoffs each midterm for each letter grade, they were still estimates so it was complete guesswork trying to gauge where exactly you fall in this class. I feel like addressing this ambiguity is necessary to making CHEM 161 a better course in the future so that students have a concrete idea of how well they are doing in order to determine how it is that the students are to allocate their time accordingly.",
                "Strengths: great lecturing, good stuff overall. Can't really think of many weaknesses, except that the possibility of other people cheating during exams and thus making the curve punish honest people like myself was a bit worrisome for me. But it seems, based on the test scores, that if there was any cheating at all, it probably wasn't super widespread, because people (including me) still mostly scored badly on exams when just looking at their raw score out of 100%.",
                "Course is extremely fast-paced, which makes it difficult to keep up if a single day is missed; course teaches a broad array of material, which sets students up well for organic chemistry\/gen chem 2; could introduce more days in lecture for practice problems\/review before an exam rather than constantly doing new material",
                "Its a good course overall but I wish the lectures were recorded.",
                "One strength of this course is that the slides were always posted on canvas for us to see and learn from. I also think a strength was the amount of office hours available for students to use and study from. I think one weakness is because the size of the lecture was so large, it felt a little less personal.",
                "Discussion sections helped as an addition to lecture",
                "Something that I found really frustrating was that the answers to questions given during discussion were not always correct. Additionally, I felt that some of the questions asked in midterms \/ the final did not align with how questions were asked in homework or the questions we did in class.",
                "This course could provide more accessible office hours and peer tutoring.",
                "The course was pretty good at teaching the basics but there were not a lot of resources given as far as practice problems and exam prep.",
                "Lectures were easy to understand, weekly quizzes did not feel like they reflected the key material very well",
                "It was a difficult class to study for, you really only have your own notes, the slides, and some sparse practice materials (in addition to the homeworks, which didnt always match tested material). Dr. Cooper and Lant were extremely understanding and accommodating in a variety of subpar circumstances throughout the class. As a con, less than ideal circumstances would arise due to class averages or format, but the professors were very willing to work with the class.",
                "The course was very interesting and the lecturers were extremely thorough. The class was taught very quickly, however, but I am not sure based on the amount of content that that could be done differently.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it is fairly easy to follow the lectures and the homework assignments and discussion section practice proved useful when studying for midterms. The weaknesses included that peer tutoring often felt inaccessible and not useful and the time commitment was much greater than most other classes.",
                "I think the exams would have been better had they been in person.",
                "Strengths: Dr.  Cooper gives great lectures and there are plenty of office hours with TAs.  \r\nWeaknesses: not enough mock exams or practice problems that will be on exams.",
                "Good!",
                "A strength of the class is that it covers a wide breadth of material. A weakness of the class is that there is little help offered to aid with the speed of the class.",
                "A strength is that students get lots of practice with concepts through the homework on Achieve. Some weaknesses include the pace of the class, which is very rapid and the lack of correlation between practice problems in class and the questions on midterms and the final. The level of difficulty of the content covered in lecture was not very high compared to the level of difficulty and understanding expected on exams, which is really unfair because the exam grades did not reflect how well I understood the content I had been exposed to. This could be improved by having practice problems in class and for homework that will resemble those on an exam, especially since exams are worth a significant part of the grade.",
                "Not enough preparation for the tests, more difficult problems should be gone over in class",
                "The lessons could have definitely been more aligned with the tests.",
                "Strengths: Engaging lecturers\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of recorded lectures",
                "I thought the pacing of the course was good. However more time could have been spent on the later chapters (8 and 9). We were also not able to see corrections for multiple choice questions on exams which could have been helpful.",
                "I feel like the homework questions are very different in style to the class and exam questions. The exams are also quite difficult compared to homework and class content. I also disliked how close the final exam was to the last midterm.",
                "It was well-structured. The discussion section wasn't that helpful.",
                "Strengths of this course include the lectures and achieve homework, which were very helpful for grasping the content. A weakness of this course was that the textbook did not always coincide with what was being taught. Also, no practice was provided specifically for the exams and the difficulty of the exams compared to the course assignments were very stark. There was little timing between learning new content and having to do assignments based on it. One thing that could be improved is how the exams are given, as they were online and proctored. However, the quality of proctoring depended heavily on the TA, and the surroundings of the student were not required to be shown. This should be improved by making the surroundings of where the exam is being taken be shown to ensure that academic integrity is kept intact for the overall course.",
                "Lack of communication between lecture class and lab class. Also lack of preparation material for difficulty of tests",
                "Strengths: I though Professor Cooper did a good job lecturing and simplified the chem content really well. I think I would have appreciated having a separate notes document that could have been used with the powerpoint slides given for each Chapter. I usually wrote my notes on the chapter slides themselves and it sometimes made the problems more difficult to solve.\r\nI think the note sheet would be used specifically with problems involving moles\/ balancing etc.",
                "One strength of this course is that the lectures were engaging and I learned a lot in lecture before even doing the homework. Professors were also always available to answer questions. One weakness of the course was that homework was posted on a different site than all other classes, which made it more challenging to keep track of when homework assignments were due than other classes. I think that assignment due dates being posted on canvas would be helpful.",
                "Especially with COVID-19 and sickness going around, it would be very helpful if online Zoom options or recordings of the lectures were available for students who felt uncomfortable attending the large lecture in person. At the peak of the cold\/flu season, coughing and sneezing came from all corners of the lecture hall.",
                "Lectures were not the best, but he is very kind.",
                "More collaboration\r\nMore content incorporated into tests",
                "I wish for there to be more practice for the exam because there was no part in the course where we were prepared for the exams or its questions.",
                "Strengths of this course were the adaptive quizzes and chapter homework through Achieve witch was very helpful in learning the content taught during lecture. Weaknesses of the course were the heavy weighing of the midterms and the final.",
                "Fairly well taught- however, I had previous knowledge in many of the concepts. If I had not, I think I would have struggled with the way topics were introduced.\r\nGrading was very reasonable and we were given many chances to obtain a deserved grade.",
                "It is very impersonal and often times the people in charge think that all you care about it your grade when in reality you are concerned about not learning anything of value.",
                "Strengths - availability of additional support via office hours, peer tutoring. The slides used in class were also quite concise and easy to review. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- the homework, quizzes, discussion section problems, all class material pretty much -- did not always prepare students well for the exams in my opinion. There was material on the exams that went well beyond the level of understanding indicated as required during lectures.",
                "Professor Cooper's teaching is confusing. He spends a long time on the easier material and then either skims over or confusingly tries to explain the harder material. The before-section quizzes were unnecessarily stressful. The day before my section was my busiest day of the week so it was hard to find time to complete the quiz within the 24-hour window. And having the individual quizzes be graded hindered my learning because I spent more time worrying about that grade and less time actually learning the material. The section worksheets were not organized and weren't helpful.",
                "Strengths: mostly taught clearly, slides being posted early was helpful\r\nWeaknesses: online exams, no way to test out. \r\nI had learned every single thing we did the entire semester other than molecular orbital theory in previous chem or physics classes. Not sure why I had to take it again.",
                "The strengths of this course were that it taught basic concepts of chemistry. The course could be improved if the discussion sections were devoted more to teaching the material as opposed to being a space where we sat silently and did practice problems.",
                "The course teaches very complex material and the discussion sections seemed rather useless to me as a student.",
                "Strengths: long answer questions, electron configurations\r\n\r\nWeakness: multiple choice - could improve by taking courses on how to do these",
                "More useful discussion sections",
                "Strengths are the workload and timing of tests. Workload was very manageable and we had adequate time to prepare for tests. \r\n\r\nA Weakness is the lack of lecture recordings. It would be nice to have recordings so that we can watch them again if we are confused during the initial lecture.",
                "The large lecture style can become very difficult to pay attention to I wouldve liked a smaller class but professor cooper was very engaging",
                "I think that especially for those without a solid background in chemistry, the foundations need to built upon a bit more before having more complex questions on the midterms.",
                "Strengths: slides are comprehensive \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: exams are poorly written and dont reflect the homework or lectures, office hours never consistent, and discussion section is a waste of time.",
                "The slides are very accessible and organized but there are not a whole lot of resources for the class in terms of preparing for exams.",
                "The concepts were well presented and organized",
                "Strengths: organized, lectures\/slides were usually pretty clear and comprehensive, Dr. Cooper was very willing to answer questions during class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: test problems were far harder than anything we saw in class or on homework, moved through material really quickly so I usually had to read the textbook, use google, and go over slides on my own to learn material",
                "The strengths of this course included being a good overview of a lot of topics. A weakness is that there was often not a lot of time to do practice problems during lecture and then with the discussion section problems the answers weren't posted until the end of the week and by that point I'd often lost my train of thought from the problems. Additionally, if I hadn't had a good understanding of chemistry from AP chem, I can see how this class could have felt quite fast-paced.",
                "Big lecture, hard to stay engaged\r\nLearned mostly in section",
                "I felt as if most of the material, homework, and worksheets did not sufficiently prepare for the exams.",
                "A strength of this course was the structure of the homework. A weakness was that the lecture were not very engaging.",
                "Zoom lectures were not readily available and tested on questions we have had zero to no practice or experience with",
                "There are a lot of resources that can be used for help if you're struggling in the course so help was always readily available. The professor was also really approachable and ready to help at all times. I don't really have any weaknesses for this course that I can pinpoint.",
                "The structure of the classes wouldve been better during exams (as in offering review sessions or better practice exams and such). Also, I thought that the tests, specifically the final, had problems that came from far out of left field.",
                "Professor Cooper's lectures are well-paced, clear, and easy to follow. The tests are quite fair and the curve is generous; the p-sets were also very straightforward.",
                "Cooper was very engaging in his lectures, which a a definite strength. A weakness would be the lack of adequate exam study material.",
                "Strength was that the material was presented in a clear way. Weakness was that there could have been more clarity in terms of grading and exams.",
                "Weaknesses: I felt like the resources were severely lacking when it comes for preparation for exams",
                "The course was not extremely engaging, but many people are taking it for a pre-requisite or for pre-med. I felt that the strength of the class was that it was well organized and difficulty level was just right.",
                "the discussion sections weren't very useful for me.",
                "I thought the biggest problem with the class was that they werent recorded. If I was sick or had to miss class for any reason, I found it so hard to catch up. Especially in times of covid, people should be discouraged to come to class when they are feeling sick, and this can only happen if the classes are recorded. \r\n\r\nThe Achieve homeworks were smart because it makes us stay on top of whats going on.",
                "The strengths of the course were the format of the lecture and accessibility of the slides. I also enjoyed having discussion sections to supplement the impersonal lectures with learning through collaboration. The weaknesses were that I wish there was more guidance and materials for studying for midterms, such as practice problems, and especially with studying for the final since there were no review sessions and the practice problems we were given did not correlate to the final.",
                "This class was hard and I would've liked more support from my TA",
                "This course was very well structured. The units had a clear progression, and the evaluation of the course was fair. (I think we did not deserve some of the extra help we got. It was totally our own fault that we bombed Midterm 1, and it was very kind of the instructors to take pity on us.) I really liked having 3 Midterms, one at the beginning of each month. This meant you knew exactly what was coming and it was up to you to deal with it. I also liked that we had a Midterm so close to the final. That material was fresh in my mind and made studying for the final better.\r\nThe material was taught well and there was lots of options available for help if you needed it. I went to office hours many times and they were very helpful; all my questions were answered. \r\nHowever, I would organize more review sessions for exams and structure them better. I went to one review session before a midterm, and it was kind of a waste of time - people asked very specific questions and I left quickly. I therefore did not attend such a session again. It would be useful to have review sessions by topic, or themed peer tutoring hours. \r\nIt would also be cool to have more optional, exploratory links to how this relates to important things going on in the real world. The last two lectures of the course were interesting. But what about how chemistry applies now, not just when the universe started? Dr. Cooper and Dr. Lant - what chem related news are you reading? Share cool articles and papers with us! I know you love chemistry and want us to feel the same way. Show us how cool it is when applied to things that we can see happening around us! You could also tie them into the lectures, which would make them a lot more colorful and interesting.",
                "Strengths was definitely the coursework and the lectures. However, the lack of time for the exam with the large amount of questions was the weakness.",
                "The system of adaptative quizzes, the psets, and the platform of achieve itself are strengths of the course since they allowed me to have an organized learning experience.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was impossible to get a slot in the bookable office hours since a few students booked all the office hours since the beginning of the semester. Furthermore, to study for the midterms and the final I could only use questions from the discussion sections and sometimes psets because the problems of the adaptative quizzes did not reflect the difficulty of problems found in midterms and finals at all. I would be nice to have a bank of hard questions that do reflect the difficulty found in a midterm or final to study.",
                "Strengths: well taught, homework felt useful, exams were challenging but not unreasonable, adapted to student concerns \r\n\r\nPerhaps this course could be improved by making each class before an exam a review session, but this isnt necessary and honestly I think the course is just fine the way it is.",
                "The course had a high workload especially when taking into consideration students are taking the lab simultaneously. I think having the homework and discussion sections cater more to what students might see on the exams would have been helpful. The exams themselves were more based on speed and how quickly you could answer the questions even if you demonstrated understanding, but the partial credit on the open ended was helpful for this.",
                "This course was difficult, and took up a lot of time. However, there are many resources available to you at all times. If you attend lecture and put in a lot of time outside class, you learn a lot and come out with a good basic system of knowledge in order to learn more. Section for this course was not very well organized, and mandatory attendance did not feel like a good use of time because the TFs were not always very helpful nor were they interested.",
                "A strength of this course is the problem sets and practice problem sets on achieve, which allowed us to try some example problems before attempting the actual PSET. A weakness is that it is a very large lecture, so it is hard to get to know the professor well.",
                "I think teaching fellows should very briefly review course content during discussion sections.",
                "Greater availability of practise questions which match the assessment expectations of the midterms and final.",
                "The strengths were that the course was very well structured, and lectures were easy to follow. A weakness of the course is that adequate resources for preparation for exams was not provided. The style of the exam questions was different from those of the discussion section worksheets and Achieve homework assignments, and I believe that more practice problems with the same format should be provided.",
                "The strengths of this course include great teaching by the professor in a way that is simple in interesting to learn; however, there are weaknesses in the way exams are structured, giving students an inadequate amount of time to complete the exam and making the questions more complex than necessary.",
                "The incredibly large amount of material that is covered in such a short amount of time is the main strength of this course. The weaknesses of this course include very difficult tests and quizzes as well as quite long problem sets which can also be fairly difficult. On a less important note, all the midterms were on Monday nights which made the weekends beforehand quite unpleasant.",
                "One strength within this course is the large number of resources. There are many opportunities to speak with the course instructor and teaching fellows to ask individual questions. Additionally, the small group discussion sections also help the material not feel too overwhelming. One weakness in this course is a lack of outside resources besides the lectures and textbook. Since the class is a large lecture, some concepts were hard to understand just through lectures. I was able to find great outside tools from my section leader and peer tutors, but it would be helpful if more outside resources were made available through Canvas. Also, I think that more opportunities for practice could be useful.",
                "strengths: helpful practice questions and problems on achieve, good slides and organization of material, helpful if practice problems from slides would have solutions posted online as well \r\nweaknesses: would be helpful if there was like an enrichment section each week to review because the material builds up quickly",
                "The grading on the tests is a bit confusing; I would like more clarity throughout the year on this.",
                "The class was hard to keep up with because of the workload and the lack of resources for help. The lectures were unengaging and confusing, and the examples in class and the discussion sections were not like the questions on the exams.",
                "I thought it was really good some of the tests were hard though.",
                "The main strength was that it was a clear and systematic overview of chemistry at a high level, and the information was explained in an organized manner. I greatly appreciated this because the class moved very quickly.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was that often, what we studied in class and what was done in the general chemistry lab were covering different units, creating a bit of confusion among students. It would be nice if the two classes could synchronize the units they covered.\r\n\r\nAlso, having three midterms was a bit of a rush at the end, since we had a midterm on three units of the class while we were preparing for final exams and writing essays for other classes, which was a bit stressful. One possibility could be that the last midterm only covered two units and therefore save one week, so that the students could have time to focus on that exam and their other final exams separately.",
                "The structure of the course was well thought out, as the information built off of previous units.",
                "This course took a very methodical approach to introductory chemistry, and it was apparent that it was geared for individuals who hadn't taken chemistry before or for quite some time. I appreciate the fact that it went gradually, but it makes me even more confused by the feeling I had throughout the course that, if I hadn't taken chemistry before, I would not have been able to navigate the coursework. Lectures moved quickly without much review, and lecture recordings were never posted. The homework Achieve assignments were somewhat helpful, but often they felt rote and repetitive, and they didn't engage any critical thinking. There was never any practice material available outside of discussion sections, which made it very difficult to review or prepare for examinations. Review sessions for exams were sparse, if they even occurred, and overall I don't think that there were ample support systems to help students understand the material if this was brand new to them. Exams, too, were often baffling: expectations constantly varied, and we had no way of knowing how to prepare for examinable content. It seemed apparent that the professor's only goal was to establish a nice curve and \"weed out\" those who were struggling, rather than making resources available to help them. I think that this class could be dramatically improved if lectures focused on APPLYING material in more depth and academic support was far better. Discussion sections, though, were a saving graceDr. Lant was kind and extremely helpful, and working through problems with others helped synthesize content far better.",
                "strengths: lecture - engaging, packed with just the right amount of information, enough time for questions\r\nweaknesses: discussion section - not engaging at all, did not learn anything, just basically 50 minutes of us sitting there while the TF was on his phone\r\nimprove: section by making it more of a learning space than a review session where the TFs work through the problem with you",
                "I wish there were more practice questions. The powerpoints, notes, and homework assignments were helpful, but we weren't really given much else (like there weren't extra practice questions, test banks, etc. provided). It was sometimes frustrating that the material on the exams would show up differently and in new ways than was presented in class and on homeworks.",
                "The strength of this course is the level of peer tutoring and external help for the course. The weaknesses are the variability in the quality and content covered in discussion sections -- I heard from suitemates taking the same course that their discussion section was poor and did not cover much, but mine was amazing.",
                "Having access to lecture slides for each chapter was helpful in studying for exams. I feel that the level of difficulty of the homework assignments was significantly easier than the free-response sections of exams, while discussion section problems were often much more difficult than most exam questions\/were not helpful for studying. I think that it would have been helpful to have access to more practice problems that matched the level of difficulty of free-response exam questions.",
                "The weaknesses are the discussion sections were a waste of time and useless. We did not do anything productive and the questions were not answered well by the TAs. However, the lecture was very valuable to learn content.",
                "Strengths: engaged instructor and preceptor, organised slides to teach content, review sessions hosted by TFs before midterms and finals, office hours were very accessible\r\n\r\nImprovements: more practice problems and resource provided by instructors and\/or teaching fellows",
                "Lectures are effective, but quick. Homework questions never line up with test questions in terms of difficulty.",
                "Content moves really fast so i learned mostly by homework rather than in lecture. Would be nice to go in depth more in lecture"

                "yes if you have to take it then take it with Cooper! his teaching style is straightforward and engaging",
                "I would only recommend the class if it is necessary to fulfill a requirement. Otherwise, there are much more engaging STEM classes to take.",
                "No, only as a requirement. Skip if you can (jump to higher level chem if you need chem). Explanations aren't always clear, content doesn't match tests, and it's not a true 'introductory' class - you're much better off if you've already had exposure to chem, which puts those w\/o at a disadvantage.",
                "Yes",
                "This course is a necessary requirement or many majors. It is a good introductory class, but if you have prior experience learning chemistry I think it gives you a great advantage in this class compared to someone who is learning chemistry for the first time.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are deciding if chemistry is a good fit for you. I thought that I would use this class to further my knowledge as a prospective MCDB major and walked out knowing that chemistry is interesting, but not what I see myself doing in the future. The professor was fantastic, the content was interesting, but I sometimes felt like my work did not reap the reward I wanted when it came to the midterms and my level of understanding the course concepts.",
                "If you have to take it, take it. I would recommend taking it off-sequence for what I imagine would be an easier curve and a smaller class size, perhaps with more individual attention.",
                "No lol. People should not take this course unless they're pre-med or if it's required for their major.",
                "Not unless it is necessary.",
                "Yes, it is good for learning the fundamental concepts of chemistry.",
                "Yeah I would! I really liked Dr. Cooper. I felt like the students overall were too hard on him, but he really cared about our learning and understanding. You'll learn the material at a quick but fair pace and coming out knowing a ton. Slightly more transparency in where your grade will land on the curve would be nice, but the curves seem fair.",
                "I would recommend this course if you need to fulfill your gen chem requirement.",
                "not really, unless its a requirement",
                "I think I would. It is very general chemistry that you learn and you are appropriately challenged throughout the class.",
                "Yes, if they need it.",
                "If you're considering this course, it's probably to fulfill a requirement, but overall I'd say yes, it does a good job of building a foundation of chem knowledge.",
                "Yes, if necessary! It's required for many majors and is a straightforward introduction to chemistry.",
                "If they needed it as a prereq and the exams moved to in person or open notes maybe.",
                "I would recommend this course because it helps to build a strong foundation in chemistry. The material is taught a good pace that allows students with no prior experience with chemistry to be able to understand the material.",
                "Yes. Requirement most likely.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who love Chemistry. I did feel pretty behind though than other students who had previous Chemistry knowledge, but the course is definitely doable.",
                "I would not particularly recommend taking this course unless it is a requirement.",
                "I took it because I am pre-med, so I don't think my recommendation will actually make a difference. However, I would not take gen chem unless you actually need to, there is no need to put yourself through this stress. Having less work does not equate to a class being easier and it might just come and screw you over in the end like it did to me.",
                "Only if they have to take it.",
                "Yes, if you enjoy chemistry, but you don't plan to pursue it. If you want to learn more, I'd recommend a harder class.",

                "I would only recommend if they had to take a chemistry course.",

                "Yes. Great professors who teach well and want you to succeed\/learn. Also builds a great basis for introductory chemistry knowledge.",
                "This course is very useful for students studying chem or a chem related major.",
                "Good for building basic courses for future.",
                "Only take this class if you need it as a prereq. There should be no other reason for you to take it.",
                "Not unless it is required for your major.  It isn't a bad class but if you're not using it as a prereq there are more interesting and easier science credits.",
                "Definitely. Super enriching.",
                "No, it is not a fun class but you will have to take it for many stem majors.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if and only if they are truly passionate about chemistry and\/or are STEM\/pre-med. Otherwise, the constant pressure of being on the higher end of the curve is pretty stressful. The concepts are somewhat easy to grasp if you take your time with the homework and study the material consistently.",
                "Yes! Good stuff. Much learning, able to do well if you work hard.",
                "If they absolutely have to take it, yes; if they are just looking for a QR or science credit, no.",
                "Its very dependent on what major they want to consider and if the course is at all plausible then yes Id recommend it.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are interested in the sciences and\/or want to be a pre-med student. This class is a generally lower level chemistry course, so it could fit all types of students if they want to take this course.",
                "I think the content is interesting but the way grades are calculated is extremely stressful. So it depends how much they care about their grades",
                "Yes. Chemistry is an excellent stem foundation!!!",
                "I would recommend this course only if it is required for major or pre-reqs.",

                "Yeah",
                "Youre probably taking it because you have to. Otherwise, there are plenty of interesting topics, and the breadth can be a strength. If you dont like something, youll move on soon, but if you do, the same is true. And everything will be in the test.",

                "Yes! Good intro.",
                "I would recommend the course because I think it builds character. Its interesting material and the class is taught by an engaging professor. Its very difficult at times but still worth it.",
                "Yes, as it is a requirement for many STEM majors",
                "Do not take this course unless you need to or have an affinity for chemistry.",
                "Yes, only to fulfill a prerequisite for an intended major\/pre-med track.",
                "I would recommend the course to any student interested in STEM or science. The course goes over some basic concepts present across all the natural sciences.",
                "I would recommend this course to those interested in chemistry or those who need it as a prerequisite.",
                "Yes, only for prerequisites though.",
                "Yes since it is a good foundation",
                "I would only recommend this course if it is a required prereq",
                "Yes, if they are using it as a requirement for their major or are interested in chemistry in general. Keep in mind this class is in a large lecture format however Dr. Cooper is open to all questions throughout the lectures",
                "I had to take this course as someone on the pre-med track, but I would recommend it because I feel that I didn't just memorize information but retained it over the course of the semester.",
                "Yes. For many students on the premedical academic track, General Chemistry is a prerequisite course for medical school.",
                "You need it for many majors, so yes I recommended",
                "Yes for pre-meds",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any students interested in a beginning level chemistry course and those interested in being premed.",
                "Yes, if a Chemistry course is needed.",
                "No I wouldn't because it's discouraging. You work so hard only for the class average to be a 70 and somehow it's expected for you to know how to problem solve without ever practicing in class.",
                "I would recommend this course only if a student was truly interested in chemistry, because the time commitment it takes to understand all the material and prepare for the exams is quite high.",
                "Only if required. I loved chemistry in high school but really disliked this course because of the teaching style. Pick a section time that's later in the week. My section was on Tuesdays, and the material needed to do well on the quiz was almost always covered the following day in class, so the people with Thursday section had an advantage.",
                "I don't think I can really recommend or not recommend it. If you have to take gen chem, it's fine, and if not, I wouldn't recommend it as a fun elective.",
                "I think this course would be extremely difficult if one had not taken AP Chemistry in high school. So, if a student does not want an extremely challenging class and did not take AP Chemistry in high school, I would not recommend it. However, if a student has a solid base of chemistry knowledge and wants to dive deeper into chemistry, then I do recommend it.",
                "I only recommend for those who have to fulfill a requirement, not for the enjoyment of learning.",
                "Yes, very good as a base for chemistry, needed for understanding higher levels",
                "Good introduction to university chemistry",
                "Yes, the work load is very manageable and the course leaves you with a good foundation of chemistry concepts for future advanced courses.",
                "Yes I would I think the TAs do a wonderful job talking to the students and encouraging them to improve their grades also I love chemistry so if somebody enjoys this class itll foster that love",
                "No, not unless this class is a requirement for your major. If you have not taken AP chemistry before this class will be a lot harder for you than it is for others and not that much help is offered by the department.",
                "No. The exams are unfair and you will basically have to teach yourself everything with YouTube videos because the instructor is a terrible teacher and there are almost no test prep resources given to you.",
                "Yes, but a prior knowledge of chemistry would be really helpful because if not you have to go above and beyond to adequately cover all necessary material for exams.",
                "Yes if you need to take chemistry to fulfill a major requirement.",
                "I would recommend this course since it provides a nice and organized introduction to chemistry for people who haven't taken chemistry before and a great and in-depth review for those that have taken chemistry before.",
                "I would if they enjoy chemistry or need to take chemistry as a requirement. To be honest I enjoyed chemistry more before taking this course than I did after, however I need the course as a pre-med requirement as do many of my peers.",
                "Only if you need to take it",
                "Cooper does a great job going over material and accommodating to students needs",
                "Only if it is a requirement for your major",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this course to another student. It's a great intro course for students who haven't really been exposed to chemistry and a perfect balance between a refresher as well as a class that facilitates learning for those who have prior experience in chemistry as well. I'd also recommend taking the lab, CHEM 134L, at the same time for a better grasp on content. This class is where you learn the content and then the lab is where you apply the learning. Those two in conjunction with each other definitely deepened my understanding of the material.",
                "Yes if its required- otherwise prob not bc the exams, which make up most of the grade, are really confusing",
                "Yes! I know most of you will only be taking this to fulfill requirements, but I actually really enjoyed this course. If you've taken AP chem in high school, this course should be really easy.",
                "I would, but with emphasized caution. Its a great course, but only if they are willing to put in the work.",
                "This course is pretty much required if youre pre med or any science major. Would take it.",
                "Yes, I would recommend the course to another student. It is a good introductory chemistry course.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student. The course provides you with general chemistry information which is useful in further pursuit of chemistry, and the professor does a good job of explaining the different course concepts to the students. Additionally, the discussion section can be useful for answering questions students might have.",
                "Only take it if you need to.",
                "Yes, this course is overall a great intro to chemistry and a foundation to many STEM majors. Although it is not the most engaging course, it still provides a good glimpse into the field of chemistry.",
                "yes, it is a good set up for chemistry and future yale courses",
                "If they just take chemistry for their major. Its a fast-pace course.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. This course explained concepts general chemistry well and promoted my learning.",
                "yes, must take for many prereqs",
                "It is often a requirement",
                "Yes. This course is fundamental. It is well structured, interesting, and with many resources to help you succeed. I didn't do that well on the exams because I chose not to spend hours memorizing chemistry formulas and instead spent them networking, but if you really wanted an A then you can get it if you put in the work: all the resources are there.",
                "Yes I would recommend this courses to other students especially if they plan to take higher level science courses.",
                "I think it is a great introduction to Chemistry and science in general. However, you need to take into account that the problems may get tedious. If you are genuinely interested in learning about the subject, this won't matter, but if you don't like repetitive problems, you should consider looking into another course.",
                "Yes especially with this professor. This is a very solid intro gen chem course. It is not too difficult but also gave me a good foundation.",
                "I would recommend it only if you are interested in chemistry or this is a prerequisite for something.",
                "If you have to take General Chemistry for a major, it should not deter you from the major. But if you want a fun, easy science class, this is not the class for you. The exams are very challenging and the workload is intense, but you come out of the class having learned a lot.",
                "Yes if they are interested in chemistry this is the perfect intro course to get them started.",
                "Yes I would recommend another student taking this course, especially if they are considering a biology major or pre-med.",
                "I would! I think this course can help develop your critical thinking skills and prepare you for Organic Chemistry.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they have not taken AP Chemistry in high school, because it provides the necessary foundational skills required for further learning in chemistry.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course because it helps deepen our basic understanding of chemistry.",
                "This is an intro course and a difficult one at that. You cover a huge amount of material and there are weekly quizzes and problem sets. With that being said, I would only recommend this class if you need it as a major requirement as it is a lot of work, especially if you take it with chem lab.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who has only taken one year of high school chemistry. It has given me a clear foundation on key ideas of chemistry and It was not too difficult to become accustomed to the rhythm of the course. A solid understanding of chemistry is important to many fields so I would definitely recommend this course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student that needs it for their major, as well as any student with an interest in chemistry. The pace can be a little fast if you have no experience in chemistry, but with some high school background the course is not very difficult.",
                "yes, it provides a good foundation of chemistry but would not recommend as a fun science course",
                "Yes, but only if they have not prior experience with chemistry otherwise theyll be relearning material.",
                "I would only recommend this class if it is a requirement for a major or track. It's not worth the hassle if its not required.",
                "Yes it was fun and I learned a lot.",
                "I would since it is an excellent overview of chemistry and provides all the tools necessary to be a good chemist.",
                "I would recommend this course because even though I had never seen or taken chemistry prior, I now feel well equipped and enthusiastic to continue the chemistry sequence.",
                "I only took this course as a requirement of the premedical curriculum, and that's the only circumstance in which I would recommend this course. For a student interested in chemistry as a discipline, I would suggest one of the higher level introductory courses. This class was paradoxical in that, even though it moved as if designed for new students to chemistry, the only ones that I know who felt okay in the class were those with extensive chemistry experience. If you've taken chemistry before, you won't get much intellectually from this class, so I'd only recommend it if it's a requirement.",
                "yes, in the sense that it provides strong foundation for chemistry but i wouldn't recommend it for someone to learn just for fun",
                "I would not recommend this course to other students because it was a lot of work for little reward. I felt it was a lot more work than other classes. If you take the course, you must advocate for yourself in order to improve because you only get help if you seek it.",
                "Only if it is needed for your major, or if you just really, really want to learn Chemistry.",
                "Yes, but only for standard educational purposes as an intro science course for STEM majors and\/or pre-meds",
                "Yes, as a prerequisite. Definitely not something that I would recommend taking for fun.",
                "I would recommend this to any student who needs to complete this as a prerequisite or requirement, or to any student who wants to pursue chem or any other science either seriously or casually.",
                "Not particularly, but its not horrible. Its just not very interesting or fun, but its not an awful class."
