Not only did I write a paper that I felt confident in and proud of, but I also walked away from the course with more insight into being an active and engaged participant in a small seminar. I also feel that my ability to be critical of assigned texts improved over the course of this semester, both through this course and through others.",

                "This class gave such a comprehensive look at US Immigration History, right from the very beginning. Dr. Shanahan was fantastic at making sure we had a thorough look at some of the most important moments, eras and changes in the long history of US immigration policy. Of course we also learned important writing and research skills  Dr. Shanahan was very careful with his edits and comments on our research papers, ensuring we knew how to best improve. He gave better feedback than any other professor I had this semester."

                "The structure and assignments of this course were very strong, in that they encouraged me engage with my final paper subject early and also helped me hone some of the writing skills I would need for the final throughout the semester. I was grateful for the opportunity to analyze some primary and secondary sources and get feedback on that writing before turning towards my final. Overall, I was quite satisfied with the course, but think that discussion could possibly be improved by more guidance surrounding readings and perhaps an optional discussion board to post (very brief) questions or throughts before class meetings.",
                "The best part about this course is Dr. Shanahan - he is the nicest and one of the most helpful people I've encountered in my time at Yale and his enthusiasm about students' work made the class worth taking. Definitely important to note that this is a class on immigration policy and not just immigration history in general. If you're not super interested in law\/policy the readings could be a bit dense at times.",
                "The greatest strength of this course was definitely the engagement of Professor Shanahanhe gives extremely thorough feedback on your writing and is genuinely determined to help you understand and engage with course material. I thought our discussions were always really interesting and I looked forward to class each week. One weakness is just that there is a lot of reading (sometimes almost a book a week) so that is worth keeping in mind.",
                "A strength of the class is the way that Dr. Shanahan led discussion, asked fantastic questions, and structured the class in a way that facilitated engagement. The class was structured in a way that allowed us to read some of the best scholarship on immigration, paired with a primary source document that had synergy with the other readings. All in all, this allowed each week to be organized in a way that ensured the conversation was always on track. Dr. Shanahan also was careful to listen to our concerns as students (especially during a tough pandemic semester) and was kind and considerate with listening and keeping our research papers on track."

He is extremely passionate about the course material, which makes it easy to stay engaged. The reading material for each seminar was generally well selected, and a great balance of primary and secondary sources, so our discussions were both thorough and eye-opening. If you are at all interested in immigration history and how legislation has evolved, I would definitely recommend this course!",

Dr. Shanahan will make it worth it with his thoughtful dicussion guiding questions and the class members' thoughtful conversation about some of the best readings on immigration policy throughout history."
