                "This course opened my eyes to the many social aspects of reproduction, which encompasses far more than just pregnancy. I learned about the history of reproduction as well as current technologies that are changing what reproduction means for certain populations.",
                "This course was a really terrific bridge to sociological methods of approaching gender and reproductive politics. I enjoyed getting additional exposure to sociological research methods that aren't usually taken in history of science and med. The seminar is set up with readings to really push you to make connections across disciplines and help to strengthen your understanding of how intimately connected reproduction is to politics and broader social themes.",
                "I learned to think about reproduction in terms of power: who has control, and who does not. I learned about historical influences, but I gained a more comprehensive understanding of modern issues. I learned how to think critically; I learned that these are issues that are far, far from black and white. I learned to ask and consider questions that I knew I would never have an answer to. I learned to disagree with classmates but whilst respecting their opinions.",
                "I developed a robust understanding of reproductive justice, contemporary discourse surrounding reproductive topics (abortion, birth control, IVF, adoption, etc.) and their historical antecedents. Very fun, and wide swath of information.",
                "I learned so much about various aspects of reproduction in this analysis that expanded what I believe to fall under reproductive justice and rights in this course. We discussed how all of these themes were connected and also influenced by various forms of oppression.",
                "This course provided a framework for thinking about reproduction from multiple different angles. I learned how to think about the influence of different structural and social layers on how we perceive, control, and think about reproduction, as well as expanded my understanding of what relates to reproduction and my own internal assumptions."

                "Liked the themes of each week's readings and discussions and the focus on learning rather than grades. Sometimes I found the readings to be a little on the heavy side, so I would have really enjoyed having some multi-media \"readings\" like movies or short youtube clips.",
                "Despite the course being virtual, there was a really great learning environment set up that made it comfortable to discuss reading every week. I think a big strength is the guided format of the seminar which I hadn't encountered much in past small classroom settings. Prof. Almeling guides the discussion much more hands-on than other profs usually do. This takes some getting used to, but also made sure we got at the main takeaways and were able to have cohesive and constructive discussions. The writing assignments were terrific. They were very low stress but high reward, because they were based on your own interests and applications of themes and frameworks, pulled from readings. Everything felt like there was a purpose.",
                "Strengths: I loved that we had excerpts of several readings each week, and we put those into conversation with each other. I liked writing the weekly memos, because they helped organize my thoughts about the readings, and gave me something to say in class. It is definitely a strength that the weekly memos were pass\/fail, because without the stress of worrying about a grade, I was able to do work that would benefit me the most, and I think I got more from it. They were very transparent with grades throughout the course; there was detailed feedback from my first project that allowed me to substantially improve my second project. Prof Almeling and our TF were both very approachable and understanding, and facilitated a welcoming class environment- an extremely difficult thing to do over Zoom.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: My biggest complaint is that the readings were sometimes quite long and dense for me- especially in a semester where everything is online, it could get exhausting, even when the readings were really interesting. I would suggest using a variety of mediums; a couple readings plus a 30-minute documentary, or a podcast, or something like that. Varying the media would be a really good way to keep us engaged.",
                "Strengths: The workload is very manageable, the projects were really fun to do, and the discussion was probably the best of any class this semester. \r\nWeaknesses: Just one week's reading were a bit redundant and boring, but we already talked about changing it for next year. Every other week the readings were really interesting and encompassed history, sociology, anthropology, and some epidemiology.",
                "This was actually one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale, it completely changed the way I think about reproduction and my own relationship with the subject. The discussion was excellent, the response memos were sometimes hard to motivate myself to do but it was always really clear what was expected.",
                "Even virtually, the seminar format worked really well! I like the brief, weekly reading responses, which kept me motivated to do the readings, but weren't long\/intensive enough to feel burdensome to do on a weekly basis. I also enjoyed the individual projects we completed, which were fun and interesting to do."

                "Prof. Almeling tries really hard to engage everyone week to week, even including additional times to socialize or review additional material for fun. Along with the flexibility and kindness she displayed during the pandemic with due dates and assignments, it was very clear that Prof. Almeling genuinely cares for her students and was incredibly helpful during this semester.",
                "I've said this above, but using the weekly memos as jumping off points made it easier to participate in class and elaborate on ideas that we were able to begin in our memos. I think I personally would have preferred more break-out room activities as well. The transparency about expectations and grading was incredibly helpful. Flexibility with deadlines and assignments also made a really big difference. The main thing, I'll reiterate, is that I think varying the media of weekly \"reading\" assignments would do a lot to keep the class engaged through a long and draining semester.",
                "Succeeded: Manageable workload, Professor Almeling cancelled the third project which I'm sure we all appreciated, the projects themselves were also engaging and enjoyable to do. \r\nCould be Improved: Don't know, was the best class this semester probably.",
                "Prof. Almeling went out of her way to include extra optional events to engage the class, which I really enjoyed, and I also found the project format to be a fun departure from writing papers and doing readings during COVID."
