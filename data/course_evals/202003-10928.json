In particular, Professor Lee equipped us with the vocabulary, grammar, and cultural knowledge that would enable us to communicate with Korean people and navigate Korea on our own. Furthermore, she provided us with insights of Korean culture, which is her own culture, and I will carry what she has taught us with me for the rest of my life.",

                "This was a fantastic introduction to Korean class, one that truly stimulated my interest in learning this beautiful language and its culture. This class developed beginning introductions, grammar tenses, and allowed me to learn a good size amount of vocabulary to aid my explanations and conversations."

                "One weakness is that the course is not recorded. So, reviewing material is solely based on in class notes and canvas.",
                "The strengths of this course are that Professor Lee encourages us to try our best, welcomes us to make mistakes, and fosters a class that is really like a family. Our learning is assessed through creative projects that we work on with our peers and develop with Professor Lee's help. She provides feedback during the process which helps us strengthen our end result. Furthermore, she provides us with feedback on every assignment we turn in in order to help us improve our speaking, grammar, reading, and writing skills. This course is entirely geared towards our learning and towards our advancement and success in learning a new language. It is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. This class has no weaknesses.",
                "This course is a fantastic introductory language course, as it makes learning fun. I went from knowing absolutely zero Korean to being able to read proficiently and speak basic Korean. There were no weaknesses from my point of view",
                "Professor Lee is the kindest and she truly cares about seeing you succeed! For any introductory language course, it is very important to put more emphasis on individual improvement rather than worrying about your grade; in this course I learned to easily accept and improve upon my weaknesses in order to become a stronger speaker. Professor Lee created such a warm and welcoming atmosphere; I loved attending class each day.",
                "There are a lot of projects that help you practice speaking and pronunciation. The structure of this class in general I like. However, I wish there were more quizzes or benchmarks to reach, it is easy to not push yourself to study with all the stress of your classes and without a specific exam to study for.",
                "Strengths: Very interactive through individual conversations each student had throughout the duration of each class period. Weaknesses: Absolutely none.",
                "The strengths of this course are that the emphasis is less on grades and more on the actual language learning, which actually pushed the class more effectively in expanding our language skills. Most assignments were focused on constructive feedback than on deducting points for accuracy, which makes absolute sense for a language class. One thing that I think might be helpful to incorporate given the structure of the course would be a mid-semester assessment w\/ the professor to help us get a better idea of where we are in terms of progress and expectations."

We are students balancing heavy course loads, extracurriculars, jobs, and so much more on top of grappling with a global pandemic that undoubtedly is a trauma we are all facing. Professor Lee acknowledges that we are only human, knows that we are doing our best, and is an incredibly phenomenal and compassionate educator. Furthermore, she incorporated exciting assignments and methods to keep us engaged over a virtual class setting and to bring us happiness during a dark time in our world. Really, I cannot further stress that this class was successfully conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
                "In this class, we met everyday on Zoom. It actually worked quite well for the purposes of learning Korean, as breakout rooms allowed us to get to know our classmates in small groups, and general learning happened in the main zoom.",
                "I think Lee Sunsangnim made a lot of use of break out rooms, and that really helped a lot. Some of the projects were not as great due to the students not being able to travel outside much, and that not everyone was on campus.",
                "There were more projects that involved group work which required zoom calls and recording our conversations. This allowed for more thorough practice with our peers and getting more comfortable with the language. It was very successful."

That is to say, I had to learn an entirely new writing system, which is Hangeul, and new modes of grammar construction. It was intellectually challenging and stimulating. I always appreciate learning about a culture that is not mine and you really get the chance to learn about and appreciate Korean culture when you take this course. Again, this is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, if not the best, and I would recommend this class to anyone that is looking to learn a new language! I would especially recommend this class with Professor Lee who is one of the best professors I've gotten the chance to learn from at Yale.",

This class is fun, but also peaks the curiosity of all its students, if you're interested in learning an Eastern Asian language I would highly recommend Korean.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class!! Prof. Lee-Smith is an amazing teacher that makes the classroom a welcoming environment for the students to learn in. I never understood why Y*le has the reputation of having the \"hardest\" or \"most prestigious\" courses in some language departments, but this course is exactly how teaching language should be: less focus on how \"hard\" the class is and more focus on actually learning the language!"
