Not only do I have a basic understanding of reading and writing that goes far beyond the elementary level, but I also have a decent grasp of conversational Vietnamese. In addition to this, Thay Quang brings you a little closer to Vietnamese culture in his lessons on Tet and other holidays. Anyone who is interested in Vietnamese should take this course!",
                "Learned Vietnamese",

                "This class is very straightforward with expectations and fairly simple to keep up with. Professor Quang is a great communicator and I'd say that contributes to the majority of his strengths. The only weakness I'd say this course has is a heavy reliance on large packets of work (17 pages at least) that are due weekly. They're pretty manageable, but maybe not for those who are taking an introductory language course with a really heavy workload.",
                "Great interactive class",
                "The instructors fostered a highly collaborative and fun space for learning, making the classroom a very inviting space for trying new skills. Professor Van and TA Nguyen cared deeply for the students growth in the language.",
                "It was hard to figure out exactly what homework assignments were required. A more organized week calendar would be better. The professor was very engaging and funny. I learned a lot in this course.",
                "Strengths: Many of the assignments and projects are done with partners which establishes deep connections with classmates and the class overall. This developed a strong community in the class and made learning Vietnamese fun, enjoyable, and less difficult. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A bit unorganized. Some assignments contribute to your grade and some dont. Deadlines are unclear at times and some units felt rushed.",
                "I like how flexible the course is and how interactive it is",
                "Strengths: instructors were very nice and willing to help\r\ngreat class community and environment\r\n\r\nweaknesses: very very unstructured and severe lack of planning \r\nus students were often (basically every week) confused about what homework was due, especially projects\r\nclass schedules could often be confusing about the actual due date of assignments, and they were infrequently released on Canvas (sometimes only given out in class and not made available to students who missed class that day)\r\nseveral times, there would be a quiz or test on the schedule which, when we showed up on class, was abruptly changed to take-home format\r\nhomework assignments were often repetitive and impossible to do without using outside resources (they included material that wasn't contained in the textbook or covered in class)\r\nafter homework submission was moved to Canvas, we stopped receiving feedback and grades on homework assignments"

Not only does this course allow you an understanding of Vietnamese far beyond the elementary level, Professor Quang teaches it at a pace that is easy to keep up with and interactive. Professor Quang has a very fun teaching style and is very easy to learn from. Anyone with a slight interest in the Vietnamese language or culture or even someone who simply wants to learn a new language should consider taking Thay Quang's Viet 110 course!!",

                "yes, but with extreme reservations\r\n\r\nif you're not a heritage student with a decent background in Vietnamese already, you should be prepared to do a lot of self-studying and\/or consulting online resources and\/or asking Vietnamese friends and\/or tutoring and\/or going to office hours outside of class, because the class isn't very organized, which makes it especially difficult for those starting from \"0\" with Vietnamese.\r\n\r\nhowever, the instructors are very nice and kind, and the class community was strongalthough partially because we felt united in our confusion about when homework assignments were due, what was going on in class, etc."
