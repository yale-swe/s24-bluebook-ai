                "In this class I learned to critically analyze various artworks from different time periods in the context of one topic: crisis. Every week we engaged with a new topic pertaining to crisis, and it was a great way to see the various aspects of crisis and its many meanings.",
                "A fantastic, super theoretical seminar approaching a transchronological timeline of artworks.  I learned a lot about how to practically apply super heady theory to the analysis of an artwork.  I also learned about what it takes to be a valuable member of an art history seminar.",
                "Everything about this course was eye-opening and insightful. Every reading peaked my curiosity and every class was so engaging where students felt so comfortable being vocal while professor fiduccia very effectively steered each conversation. My knowledge on artists, on crisis, on historical contexts and artistic technique has grown tremendously with this course."

In terms of weakness, I believe students would have benefitted from more guidance on some of the theories we discussed since they were occasionally very dense and confusing.",

                "Yes- if you are interested in modern art, politics, or other areas of crisis talked about in the course. From a history of art perspective, the course does much less close looking than other 400 level seminars, and tends to be a lot more discussion based. Readings tend even to be less about objects and more theory based.",
                "Yes! More emphasis on theory\/texts than on objects, but very interesting.",
                "I am not an art history major, but I really enjoyed this class. I loved that I was able to engage with so many different artworks, and my classmates pushed me to think of works, theories, and analyses in new or different ways.",
                "Yes.  A higher level seminar that draws together a group of super cool classmates.  Take it if you love art and lover other people who love art!",
