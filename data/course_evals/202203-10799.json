                "I learned about what manuscripts and archives even are, the ethical questions surrounding curating and collecting, and what Yale has to offer in terms of its vast collections. I left the class with more questions than answers, after speaking to various archivists and curators from the School of Medicine, Babylonian Collection, Divinity Library, British Art Museum, Silver Collection, and more. They all had different perspectives on the meaning of collecting and how we could use collections, whether it be research purposes, empathizing with very foreign groups, telling our own stories, and interpreting others' stories.",
                "I learned a lot more about the general archival process, and also some specific info about different collections here at Yale. Lots of discussions on topics I havent thought of before like how objects arrived to Yale",
                "I definitely gained a much greater insight into the history of Yale's collections and learned how to be more knowledgeable and introspective regarding many of the objects. It also taught me how to look deeper into the collections of many other institutions such as the MET.",
                "I learned a lot about Yales archives and the process it takes to build a collection at Yale and in other applications.",
                "This class definitely cultivated a curiosity in archival materials and artifacts. Yale's special collections are utterly awe-inspiring, and I feel that this class was quite effective at proving this fact. The class including a number of fascinating discussions, which largely focused on many of the ethical conundra associated with collecting objects from all across the world.",
                "How museums work, theory behind museum practice, the history of different cultural heritage institutions at Yale, researching objects from Yale's collections, writing a research paper.",
                "This course helps develop skills in interacting with objects from all time periods both physically and as ideas. It helps to develop critical thinking skills with regard to the contextualization of objects and what it means for objects to become a part of the archives.",
                "I learned a lot about close viewing objects, handling sensitive and fragile materials, and researching using objects from the university's various repositories.",
                "Extensive exposure to and awareness of Yale's many, many collections\/libraries\/museums etc.",

                "3H once a week is a bit too long for me to stay focused, particularly in the second half of the day. But Professor Franz was awesome and should remain as the instructor. She's open-minded, understanding, kind, knowledgeable, and supports viewpoint diversity in the classroom. Seeing so many collections was also an exceptional experience. I think it would be cool if students could choose which collection we visited for the penultimate class. Just an idea.",
                "Strengths - you really do get a huge breadth of content on Yales collections over the term. Anna is willingly to work with you and answer any questions. Work load is also very doable, with really no big tasks between September and mid November \r\n\r\nWeakness - you visit a new archive each week, which can be exciting, however some curators \/ presenters are better\/more engaging than others. So quality can vary a bit by week",
                "I definitely really enjoyed being able to travel to all the different museums and liked how we were always moving around. Although one thing I'd possibly appreciate would be to cut the course time to 2 hours or 2.5 hours. The 3 hours became a lot and everyone gets tired after a while. Also, if possible, I feel that it would be interesting if the course took us to museums like the MET in New York City during a weekend if students agreed to it. I think it would add a lot to the course.",
                "I loved the fact that we went to different places every week. It was a very fun and thought provoking class. The work load is low and mainly centered around discussion which I liked. This class is perfect as it is!",
                "The strength of this class was how engaging it was. Each 3 hour session flew by because it was so full of interesting experiences. I would say that the weakness was in the readings. There were two books assigned over the course which only rarely entered the class discussions. I think it would have been an improvement for readings to be more integrated into the course.",
                "This course is fantastic! It is very fun and is packed full of information about really diverse topics. Sometimes the weekly readings were a little dense and a big workload, but that's my only critique.",
                "The strength of this course is the fact that you interact with so many different types of objects. from many locations, time periods, and cultures. This course gives a taste of many aspects of the archives, that if desired can lead to deeper research in the future. It is also amazing to see all that Yale has to offer, given each week is a different archive. A small weakness of this course is the length of each class. While it only meets once a week, the three-hour time slot can feel like a lot sometimes.",
                "The strengths of this course were the diversity of collections and guest professors that we engaged with. In terms of weaknesses, I think we could have received more feedback from our professor about our habits (ie. canvas discussions, class participation) throughout the semester.",
                "The class requires tremendous patience and stamina. A three-hour seminar is a long, long time. Some weeks are interesting and the time goes by quickly, others less so.",
                "Strengths: It was by far my favorite class this semester - each class felt like a field trip and I was able to explore archives at Yale I would otherwise not even had a chance to know. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The length of the class (3 hours) made it hard to stay focused throughout the whole class."

                "I would recommend this course! It's fun, small, and Professor Franz is a wonderful instructor. Be warned that it's a 3 hour lecture on some pretty obscure collections, so you might want to check your attention span\/drink coffee beforehand. Overall, it's cool to explore the collections that most Yalies don't even know exist. I got to put my hands on real Mesopotamian tablets!",
                "If youre interested in library and archival studies, Id say so! I certainly do not regret taking this course, but Id say for people considering it, ensure youre interested in this content. Its sort of niche (in a good way)",
                "I definitely would! I felt that it really engaged me in a way that a lot of courses couldn't. I felt connected with the other students and we were always willing to help each other.",
                "Yes! This class is an opportunity to learn more about Yales archives and its history. It is an intriguing class that encourages intellectual discussions.",
                "I definitely would. It's incredible the resources that Yale students have access to, which I feel that many are unaware of or don't consider using. After taking these class, I plan on regularly visiting special collections out of personal curiosity.",
                "Definitely! If you like museums or libraries, this is the class for you. It covers a diverse range of topics from art to history to science, so every week is fresh and interesting. It's a super cool class. There's a lot of reading, but I can't recommend it enough!",
                "Yes, I would. It is a great course for getting to know Yale and the resources it has to offer. It pushes you to look in-depth at the ethics of archives and Yale's position as an institution with many collections.",
                "Absolutely! This class is incredible. The workload is manageable and is always interesting and engaging. The course also pushes you to interact with Yale's archives and explore ideas in new ways. It also is very exciting to be interacting with very old and rare objects on such a regular basis.",
                "Yes, I would! You get to engage with a lot of cool materials and ideas that you otherwise would not.",
                "Students deeply and authentically interested in history will love this class. Most others will lose stamina. I'd describe the class as more \"neat\" than \"fun.\" I'm glad I took it and that I've been exposed to so many resources so early in my time at Yale, but I'm also glad that my experience is now over.",
                "Yes definitely! This course allows students to explore history hands on, and make use of Yale's extensive repository. It analyzes history through diverse perspectives."
