Strength: the students are great and the discussions are very stimulating and interesting. The papers are also very fun.",
                "Great format and flexibility to discussions. The course progression was great. I wouldve liked an ability to send in drafts before final submissions",
                "Prof. Aslanidis is a passionate professor and constitutes an obvious strength of the course. The level of engagement can vary week by week due to the readings and response papers, which could be viewed as a strength or a weakness.",
                "Developing my own ideas",
                "This course was the worst course Ive ever taken (and Ive never given any course a bad review before). There are several reasons why:\r\n\r\n-The Professor has very strong moral opinions on many things about economics and public policy and various politicans. He also has opinions on students and has no issue with telling students that they are immoral (in his view but not really in the view of what most people think) to their face in class and in front of other students, resulting in students being very uncomfortable in class and worried he wont like them and will punish them grade-wise. This happened to me and to several of my classmates.\r\n\r\n-The aim of the class is to agree with his opinions and write things that he agrees with and not really say what your own opinions are which students learned pretty quickly during the semester. Also, the Professor has very specific requirements for essays that do not match usual Poli Sci essays and are specific to his class. \r\n\r\n-I do not think that his grading policy is fair because it was erratic in the sense that it isnt consistent between essays. Some of my essays met what he was looking for but that was not reflected in my grade while other essays that took less effort received a higher grade. He is definitely a very inconsistent grader and it is not always clear what he expects. Even if I did meet all the requirements, I did not receive the best grades while other times that I did not meet the requirements I received lower grades. Do not take this class for the grading."

                "I would strongly urge students to stay away from this class.\r\n\r\nThis class was by far the worst class Ive ever taken in my life. It hurt me emotionally, and mental health wise. Not only did the Professor make me feel uncomfortable expressing my opinions but he actively berated me in class one day because he did not like the fact that I was going into investment banking and thought the career was immoral. When I asked why he thought that he said because of competition with others and mortgage rates. Although the other students stood up for me in class, I still felt very scared to attend and participate in class the rest of the lectures. I was also scared it would impact my final grade in the class because he would not like me personally. I am not sure if his dislike of me did or did not influence my final grade but I was not going to take any chance.  I did not report the incident because I was scared it would effect my grade but now that the semester is over I am reconsidering doing so just because I do not want other students to feel how I felt in this class. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, he is lenient with students who have circumstances where they need to miss a class for a health issue and provided me with an extension on my final paper which I appreciated. \r\n\r\nAlthough I met all of the requirements that he asked for on my papers, my grades did not reflect the effort and work that I put in. For instance, some of my papers I pulled all nighters for and worked hard on and even met in office hours with him but received a lower grade than papers I worked less hard on so as a result I think that his grading is kind of erratic. This class caused me a lot of heart ache and suffering with all nighters and lots of stress around essays and the Professor did not seem fair in grading. It definitely was not worth the money and effort, actually it was the opposite of worth the money and effort in that it actively hurt my health due to the all nighters and stress that it caused, it hurt me emotionally do to the fear of his negative comments about me in class, and it hurt me GPA wise as well (which I can understand hard grading but feel that in this circumstance the grading was unfair). If I could, I would love to show any other Yale Professor my essay because I think I deserved a higher grade. I wish I could go back in time and not take this class."
