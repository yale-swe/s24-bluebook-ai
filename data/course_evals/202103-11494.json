                "I learned a lot about local hispanic culture in addition to South American political issues. We covered most grammatical tenses in this class, most of which I was already familiar with. The whole class was conducted in Spanish which I think helped my listening skills.",
                "I learned a lot about applying spanish speaking and language skills to real life situations such as the environment and the arts through plays, movies, and texts.",
                "I farther developed my Spanish ability.",
                "I developed my knowledge of Spanish vocabulary and grammar in terms of verb conjugation and tenses. Through the individual units of study, I learned the vocabulary from those units. Additionally, I was able to strongly develop my listening comprehension skills through the many shorts and movies we watched for assignments along with only conversing in Spanish in the classroom.",
                "I knew a lot of the information already, but it was a very strong review of material I knew. We went through basically all the tenses, and had a lot of good practice with skits and pronunciation.",
                "Taking this course I developed more skills in the Spanish language, specifically the different tenses and when to use them in writing and speaking. I also learned more about Latino and Hispanic culture through the various cultural elements we witnessed (movies, books, photos, projects) and took part in. (ELC's).",
                "The course has a strong focus on conjugating and all things grammar which I found very helpful because I felt like, coming into the class, conjugation was my biggest weakness in speaking Spanish. I have a much better grasp of those concepts now, particularly the different past tenses. We covered a lot of ground in this class, which was definitely too much ground. If we had slowed down and spent more time on lessons, assignments, and units, I think we would have retained much more information. After a while, you're completing assignments to meet the inundation of deadlines and not to actually improve your Spanish, which was frustrating.",
                "I learned obvious grammar lessons such as different versions of the subjunctive but most importantly I learned better pronunciation and speaking skills. I became more comfortable speaking Spanish."

            "comments": [
                "strengths: high engagement, interesting projects, lots of collaborative assignments\r\nweaknesses: the grammatical lessons were sometimes confusing because the lecture was in spanish",
                "Content/pacing seems inconsistent across sections and expectations were sometimes unclear. One strength was how my professor would start class by playing music, which was a helpful pronunciation activity.",
                "I think the course should work on speaking more. I feel as if my speaking skills declined. The assignments were often vague and the rubric was unknown.  However, when Sebastian was contacted regarding assignments, I feel like he was very helpful in his responses and very quick to answer.  Some of the grammatical work felt like busy work instead of being applied in a more productive way.  The readings were at a much higher level than the work we were doing in class.",
                "I think that the worksheets we filled out after watching the videos or doing the readings towards the beginning of the year were not particularly helpful in helping me understand or process the readings.",
                "I thought the course was very fair and the asynchronous Wednesdays, giving you the opportunity to master skills on your own, were a huge improvement than before covid when I took L1 and L2.",
                "The strengths of this course is its emphasis on group work and collaboration, as it allows the students to not stress about hefty individual assignments as much but instead enjoy learning with their peers as they complete each project or task. This also allows students to practice their speaking and writing skills to a higher degree as instead of solely thinking about Spanish to complete a task, they must also converse in Spanish with others and then write their conclusion. A weakness of this course is the seemingly undefined calendar associated with the assignments. Given the great amount of assignments in the course, it would be very helpful to clearly outline when everything is due instead of relying on others to notice a discrepancy in the calendar or many times informing the students only a day before a certain task is due.",
                "There was a lot of work, but I think if there was more discussion it would have been better. A lot of my Spanish is good, but I would like to practice more verbal skills and conversational Spanish. Even 5-10 minutes at the start of class to speak with classmates about what is going on in our lives at the time would be a helpful tip. I also think it would be cool to do a conversation with a school in Spain.",
                "The strengths of this class are that we had ample time to get engaged with the course material because we met everyday.",
                "This course has way too much busywork. Most of the time, I had more work in this class than in any of my other classes. I felt like the deadlines were very unreasonable (ex. a big group project worth a significant part of the grade assigned the day before it's due). This was disappointing because I think the course was very well organized in terms of a balance of media types (books, articles, short films) but I couldn't take time to digest new material because it just kept coming. The class could also be improved by facilitating more discussion among the entire class, rather than just in pairs. I found that I improved from the few days we spoke all together. The films and short films are extremely fun to watch and discuss/debate. The class is very topical. Less work would go a long way in terms of actual lesson retention. Sebastian Diaz is a nice guy, but he seems to favor his male students over his female students who he can patronize. He also did not give thorough feedback, which was surprising considering how much work we were asked to do.",
                "more structured syllabus",
                "A strength of this class is all the tasks are properly coordinated with what is learned in class, which helps to self-check your knowledge during homework. A weakness was an uneven amount of time spent on every topic, which led to knowing some material a lot better than other."

I think it truly advances your Spanish (verbally and writing). But, I would beware of the commitment to the course. It meets 4 times a week (the 5th day is asynchronous but you usually have a large project that day) so it requires of dedication to participate in class every day. Also, every lecture is in Spanish so it is easy to lose focus in class.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student pursuing Spanish or simply needing the language distributional requirements as the course explores many interesting media sources such as shorts, stories, movies, and other projects embedded into the curriculum which creates an engaging atmosphere conducive to improving Spanish skills.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course because I feel like it gives you a good recap of that you learned in high school Spanish while also expanding on that knowledge and becoming more proficient.",
                "L3 material is great for an intermediate Spanish learner. I would only recommend this particular section if you have a low workload in your other classes.",

                "YES. I really enjoyed my time in this class and definitely think it made me better writer and speaker in Spanish. The class was very entertaining and I looked forward to starting my morning with it. The material is not too difficult and there are always many resources posted on canvas if review is needed, which I found very helpful. Great course."
