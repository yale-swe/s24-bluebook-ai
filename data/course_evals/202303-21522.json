                "1) Think about incentive design - To stay in business, international NGOs have high indirect costs and compete for as many grants as they can. Their goal is not necessarily to build sustainable organizations or have the most efficient and effective projects. This misalignment of incentives suggests the current model of funding iNGOs has serious structural problems that impede sustainability and progress.\r\n\r\n2) Vicious Cycle - Because NICRAs are based on current indirect costs, they trap LMIC organizations in low indirect cost rates! This is part of a broader theme: being poor is expensive, and poverty is hard to escape. How can you make improvements to your organization if it does not have the funding to pay for those improvements?\r\n\r\n3) Keep adjusting your good ideas - The 10% de minimus rate exists to relieve the organizational burden of accounting for every dollar. It is unauditable, and thus is meant to give LMIC organizations more flexibility. I think this is fundamentally a well-intentioned and good idea. The problem is 10% is not enough to cover the IDCs of any organization and using the de minimus traps LMIC organizations in low indirect cost rates. This is a good idea, but it needs revision."

                "I think we struggled in the beginning defining our goal and staying organized. We spent a lot of time ramping everyone up to understand how grants even worked. This was very necessary, but maybe could have been done over the summer, so we could have jumped right in when the year started.\r\n\r\nThat said, I learned a lot about different funding mechanisms, why they are designed the way they are, and their successes and pitfalls."
