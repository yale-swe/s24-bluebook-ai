                "I got to read a lot of amazing modernist texts. I learned what the term \"modernism\" really means, and I understood modernist literature as it entered into conversation with other texts from the same period.",
                "Professor Cleary's course not only taught me about the modernist movement and the specific novels and authors we read, but his detailed feedback and peer review sessions greatly improved my writing skills over the course of the semester. Professor Cleary's seminars not only encouraged me to engage more deeply with the texts, but his frequent feedback on our discussion posts and essays continually pushed me to improve my analysis and prose.",
                "This course taught me to appreciate literature in a new way. Joe Cleary is a phenomenal professor, and fosters a wonderful seminar environment. I genuinely feel like I'm a stronger reader and more thoughtful writer after this course."

                "I loved the syllabus and the format of the class. I really enjoyed hearing from Professor Cleary, if anything I would have appreciated him speaking more. I always learned so much from him. I think that the reading responses are also helpful to stay engaged with all of the books. I would have liked one more week on a few of the books, but it makes sense that we have to move quickly to read them all. I would maybe have cut Death Comes to the Archbishop.",
                "The novel's in this class are incredible and Professor Cleary is just the best!",
                "This course is absolutely brilliant! Each Monday and Wednesday I looked forward to attending seminar. It was often difficult to have time to read the additional readings each week, but otherwise the reading felt manageable. It might be nice to have an aspect of engagement with other people's Canvas posts be necessary, since I often felt that there was little time/incentive to read what other people were saying, despite how brilliant their comments often were.",
                "One strength of this course is Professor Cleary, and his incredible questions. Another strength of this course is the people who choose to take it - everyone has done the readings, and is eager to contribute with thoughts and questions that furthered my understanding. \r\nOne weakness of the course is the reading load, specifically the secondary sources. Because the primary texts were already substantial, most people did not read the secondary texts that were assigned on Canvas. To improve this weakness, I'd suggest either explicitly structuring the class sessions to include conversation about the secondary text, or limiting the primary text reading. Either way, a change would need to be made in order for people to feel motivated to do the secondary source readings.",
                "The strengths of this course were the syllabus and Professor Cleary's teaching. As the class included many exceptional yet difficult novels, from William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying to James Joyce's Ulysses, both Professor Cleary's teaching and our seminar discussions guided me through these books in deep and meaningful ways. Nevertheless, Professor Cleary's frequent feedback and encouragement were hands-down the best part of the class. He provided me the most useful and detailed feedback of any professor I have had at Yale. This class has no weaknesses, although students should be aware that it has a heavy reading load!",
                "Professor Cleary's incredible care for the material and for his students is the biggest strength of the course. I always left each class feeling satisfied with a new level of understanding of our reading. The course is very dense (often a new novel each week), so I didn't get to spend as much time as I wanted sitting with a book before discussing it in class -- that being said, I wouldn't really want to remove any of the books from the syllabus. Really, the intensity of the course is just something to know before enrolling. You'll need to spend a lot of time on the material, but it will be completely worth it."

                "Yes! Absolutely. Professor Cleary alone makes the course worthwhile. Even without him, however, having a semester to read modernist texts made my semester better. The texts themselves even, dare I say, changed my life.",
                "Yes! Joe is a great professor who prioritizes class discussion and good writing.",
                "Yes! Getting to learn from Professor Cleary is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. He is amazing at structuring syllabi and class time, and also is amazing at creating a sense of community and camaraderie. The syllabus is also incredible. You will get out what you put in. If you're up for doing the work, this class will be highly rewarding.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Cleary was one of the best and most thoughtful professors I have had at Yale. The class syllabus was challenging and engaging, and Professor Cleary's seminar discussions on Ulysses were among the highlights of the course. Professor Cleary also provided the most detailed feedback I have received at Yale. He took each of us seriously as writers, highlighting both the good parts of our essays and the areas that needed improvement. I wish that I had taken one of Professor Cleary's courses earlier in my Yale career, as I would have applied for many more of his courses!",
