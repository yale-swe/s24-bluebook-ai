And that's a good thing, probably. \r\n\r\nAs for insights? The fact that thought, and language, is possible is totally nuts and amazing; normativity is one of the most basic preconditions that allows us to think at all; recognition of the fact that language isn't simply about propositions throws a wrench in a lot of the Quine\/Davidson discussions of radical translation\/interpretation, Thomas Kuhn should be taken seriously as a philosopher, not just a historian of science; transcendental arguments matter a lot.",
                "Developed a sharper understanding of the relationship between Kantian and Analytic philosophy and an appreciation of how the latter resolves problems in the former. Appraised the success of Analytic efforts to ground empirical knowledge. Honed my ability to draw unexpected connections between different sources."

                "Strengths: Professor Franks is a great teacher who is able to express complex ideas clearly; the structure of the seminar meetings\r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps more opportunities to interact with our peers by discussing questions in breakout rooms, but this isn't necessarily a weakness",
                "Although the rationality of the roadmap of the course eventually became clear, it wasn't always clear to me where the course was heading or how significant ideas related to the theme of the course.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Franks knows a ton and thinks incredibly deeply about our most basic philosophical assumptions; he guided us through some really, really dense material in a way that, I think, made it as lucid as possible (though I still went through the class feeling as though I understood approximately 40% of what was going on each time).\r\n\r\nI think that the material at the end of the course (the Fichte and Cavell, mostly) felt a bit disjointed from the rest of it. Those were the areas where P. Franks wanted to be gain new insights from the new connections he was drawing, I think, which was very cool and thought-provoking, but I think it could have been better developed.\r\n\r\nFrom a purely \"how hard do you have to think\" perspective, this may have been the single most intellectually challenging course I've taken at Yale. That's both a pro and a con, I guess.",
                "Strengths: fascinating connections drawn between seemingly disparate works in the syllabus (implicitly) and in class (explicitly); the topical focus allowed for cross-communication between Analytic and pre-Analytic schools; clear explication in the supplementary lecture videos. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: student participation was relatively enfeebled in the first few weeks. While it mounted greatly as we settled in, it was occasionally strained."
