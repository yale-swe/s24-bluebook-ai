The course highlighted the role of the federal bureaucracy in the policymaking process, which other course had not done so to that extent. Additionally, the course improves students' skills in evaluating research design and academic research papers to test the robustness of the investigation.",
                "Learned about how the interactions and constraints of the different branches of government impact policymaking and how to read and critically analyze political science literature",
                "I learned some game theory, and the basic literature that study the separation of powers, very helpful.",
                "I learned how the system of checks and balances works to ensure that no single branch has a monopoly over policymaking power. I also learned how to read analytical political science papers and how to write one.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. From a knowledge perspective- I had never taken a course on institutions and learned so much about how our government works. This class has really piqued my interest in institutions and I hope to incorporate institutions in how I think about my research going forward.",

                "Strengths: Professor Kinane is the greatest strength of the course, as she brings in a profound knowledge of the subject matter and is essential to the class discussion. Additionally, the course readings were excellent and truly informed the theme for a given week. Improvements to be made: at times, the reading quantity was a bit much for the class to have time to discuss during the seminar, though this was not an occurrence every week.",
                "The class is really well organized and does a good job of connecting the readings from each week. There is a lot of reading and some weeks have more than others, but the readings had a purpose and all tied to the course well. To improve the course, it might help to balance out the reading a bit so there isn't too much for any week and there is enough time to go into depth with every reading.",
                "The strengths are the readings and the discussion based setting, no real weaknesses",
                "I don't think there was a single weakness to this course! It was an amazing way to learn about the legislative process in the American government.",
                "The class was well organized with each week building from the previous. I feel like I got to learn about so many different parts of government. I found the content and class discussion very interesting and engaging. No real weaknesses from the class.",

This course will encourage a deep understanding of research design and academic studies, but the professor does an excellent job and making sure you understand the concepts. I strongly recommend this course.",
                "Yes. The material of the class is really interesting and Professor Kinane does a really good job of leading the class. There is a lot of reading, but it's important to the course and doesn't feel like busy work.",
                "Yes, please take it. Great class but hard material",
