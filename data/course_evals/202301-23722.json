It taught me so much about the way drugs work in our bodies, and it also provided a framework with which I can analyze drugs beyond the ones we learned about directly in class. \"Drugs\" in the most general sense, including OTC drugs like tylenol, which we interact with all the time. It was really important to learn about drug interactions, and I left with very practical advice like to not take alcohol with tylenol. It also covered historical elements of drugs and sociopolitical implications of certain drug policies. It was a really holistic overview in the best sense of the word, and it was a practical, almost a self-help course. I'll carry this knowledge with me for the rest of my life!",

                "strengths: the content is really important, a good way to get started in understanding neuroscience\r\nweaknesses: the lectures were essentially a regurgitation of the slides and most of the learning came from reading the textbook. Quizzes were INCREDIBLY inconsistent, with no indication when to expect them, and they were due within hours of being posted on canvas. Overall organization is very poor.",
                "having a final essay randomly and what is essentially two final exams is not fun",
                "Strengths: The material is well-paced and the lectures are very organized. The course is super interesting and perhaps one of the most applicable to daily life that you might take during your time here. Prof. Kober is AMAZING. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures sometimes moved a little fast but there are plenty of office hours to clarify anything you might have missed so it's fine. The assigned readings can be a little lengthy at times.",
                "Weakness: In a single lecture, a lot of material is covered. However, to fit it all in, Professor speaks really fast. Despite this, recordings are not shared afterwards. There is also an extra paper towards the end that feels like busywork\r\nStrength: interesting material and professor tries to make time for questions throughout lecture",
                "Strengths: the professor is incredible, the content is so so interesting and relevant to everyone, I liked the structure of the class since it incentivized staying engaged but didn't add too much stress with weekly assignments \r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "strengths: well organized, useful content, engaging professor\r\nweakness: the content goes SO fast and it is hard to keep up during lectures. and it truly is SO MUCH content",
                "Strengths: Kober is a great lecturer; lecture guides and pdf slides are good; \r\nWeaknesses: Breadth of information needed to learn is simply too large; I would appreciate more homework assignments because I found myself disengaged from the class until we had an exam. More sensitivity around drugs such as antidepressants, often felt lecture dismissed and\/or judged them waY too much",
                "Strengths: This neuroscience class covers interesting material that can surprise even those with prior knowledge of certain drugs. The course provides valuable insights into the biological basis of drug actions and the underlying neurotransmitter processes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While the class has potential, it falls short of expectations. It attempts to cover too much ground, including drug history, disorders, and legalities, making it difficult for most students to keep up with the professor's fast-paced lectures. The teaching staff doesn't provide lecture material in advance, which can be a challenge for non-science students. There are many quizzes and exams that determine the majority of one's grade, but the grading is often opaque or untimely. Some quizzes are just excluded from the class for unclear reasons. Overall, the most apparent weakness of the class is its logistics.",
                "So much information, and little work, so you have to be willing to put in the work studying in order to get a good grade.",
                "It should just be an advanced neuroscience elective cause that's what the expectations of students are. For the amount of content on exams and how niche the questions are you really need a weekly pset or some way of keeping up with the material. This class should not be marketed as an intro with no prior experience needed.",
                "I liked having choice on exams. I didn't like having to do the paper during reading week. The prompt should have been released sooner.",
                "TFs kept saying we dont need to memorize the tiny details, but that is in fact what you need to memorize. this course is all memorization and students are tested on very specific information from lectures, which is fine, but the teaching team just needs to be more upfront about it. \r\n\r\nA lot of information was miscommunicated to us, such as when quizzes were happening, some quizzes we only got from 5pm one day to 10am the next morning to complete, others before that gave us several days to take the quiz, there was no consistency, it was all a bit scrambled.",
                "Strengths - very interesting material, structured well to allow you to learn the basics of neurotransmission and the nervous system before learning the details of drugs\r\nWeaknesses - professor speaks very fast, and there are no recordings and limited prep material for exams",
                "The material in this course is very interesting and helpful! I enjoyed learning it, and I feel like I am walking away with a\r\nThe actual organization of the course was not great. The self-tests, for example, were not evenly spread, nor did they run on a consistent schedule. This made it really difficult to do well on or to plan. I also believe the class was needlessly strict. Calling out students for speaking when many of us had not noticed, needing a Deans excuse for a zoom lecture, it felt greatly bureaucratic. I thus did not feel comfortable reaching out to the TAs or the Professor for help.",
                "I thought it was honestly a great course along all lines. I also really liked having choice on exams, which I always thought I would implement myself if I became a teacher in the future. It just makes a lot of sense, because people study different things and have different strengths. It kind of removes the element of luck in exams, which is great.",
                "strengths = good content \r\nweakness = hard to gaugae how youre doing in the class, tests are hard (better to credit D and not have to worry), lectures were hard to follow (hedy spoke very fast) and not recorded and slides were not posted until after class. Hard to succeed",
                "The course was very poorly organized, and it was hard to know where I stood. The assessments were very challenging, too long and too specific. They were also not at all well spaced throughout the semester.",
                "The course covered a lot of content. I honestly think more assessments would be useful to help solidify learning. Also, lectures move very quickly so perhaps more review. Overall though the course is very thorough and comprehensive.",
                "Every question on the exams came down to memorization of topics that can be easily googled. Having learned so much, both in specific content and broader ideas, it would have been nice for the exams to cover these two aspects half and half. I also wish the second midterm wasn't two weeks before the end of classes.",
                "Strengths: I like how the course was formatted. Her lectures were very straight-forward and she was always eager to answer students' questions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The self-test format was really just a pop quiz with a vague heads-up given before hand. The study guides were not very helpful, it would have been nice to have a mock test or ones from previous years to prepare with. The review sessions were also not very helpful, I think the format should be completely revised. The test review format was also terrible, if the grades can be released on gradescope for students to see it on their own would be much more useful. If this is not an option, there should be a sign up sheet through calendly for student to select times to review their exams individually so people do not have to sit around for upwards of an hour and still not get to see their exams.",
                "The course material was interesting. I would have appreciated more frequent self-tests so that each individual one would have less impact on the grade. Also, the pace was a little too quick.",
                "I wish the course was more slow-paced. The lectures have very important and interesting content, but this class goes through a lot of content. The lecture recordings are not accessible to everyone, so you have to rely on the lectures slides (which are posted after lectures and sometimes late).",
                "The lectures for this class are so good! Prof Kober is an amazing lecturer -- honestly I think that if you focus 100% in class you will remember everything needed for the exam. \r\nNo weaknesses, though I think you need to be personally interested in the content to enjoy the class and stay attentive.",
                "This is class is interesting and accessible to non- STEM students, but it TAs office hours were hard to get to in order to get help.  Hours closer to evening or with multiple people allowed to attend at one time could be better.  I'm sure I had the same difficulties as other humanities majors, but we were all waiting in line to have a private session with the TA on Fridays.  Sometimes I went to office hours but then had to leave before I got my chance because so many people were ahead of me.",
                "The course content is intriguing and applicable to real life. Its structure is clear and helpful to facilitate learning: it begins with basic knowledge about the brain and neurotransmission, then discusses each drug in detail, and ends with treatment for addiction. It would be better to reserve more time for treatment, as we ran out of time to discuss CBT and MBT in more detail at the end.",
                "I feel that the content was well expanded upon but I also feel that these sections were moved through at a pace that moved too quickly. I think talking through the mechanisms at a slower pace would be helpful. I would have also really appreciate having access to recorded sessions so that I could review content after class.",
                "While Dr. Kober is a charismatic lecturer, she is by no means a successful teacher. Her lectures are just an hour and fifteen minutes of her info dumping at an unreasonable speed, but she did make some minor adjustments (like adding page numbers to the slides) that helped to offset the consequences of the fast pace of her lectures. The few grades you get in the class are incredibly high stakes and do not set you up to properly absorb the material. At the end of the day, this is a traditional lecture. It's unfortunate because Dr. Kober knows what she's talking about and the content is incredibly interesting, but the educational pedagogy underlying the execution of the course leaves a lot to be desired. There are a few incredibly easy adjustments that can be made for this course to make it more engaging in the future, however. For one thing, allowing for the self-tests to be retaken as many times as needed to get 100% would encourage students to master the material. It would also be helpful if the self-tests had been on a consistent schedule, rather than being randomly announced and being given a small window of time to complete them. Giving a full 24 hours at the minimum to complete the self-tests would have been helpful. In general, having more opportunities to receive grades in the course that could boost your grade rather than praying for the curve to serve you well on the three exams you do would have made this course less stressful. One of the major successes of the course was the fact that the exams are uniquely structured to allow students to select which questions they want to answer from the question pool provided. Another thing that would have been helpful is if she would have left up the text-heavy slides longer than she would the slides that were filled more with pictures or less text to allow for students to catch up on the content they missed.",
                "Strengths:\r\nReally interesting lectures and material. Prof Kober is 10\/10 the best. Puts so much effort into the class. \r\nImprove:\r\n- more efficient ways of viewing exams after\r\n- TAs didnt know the material in as much detail as we had to so they couldnt really answer all questions",
                "Self-tests and practice questions provided by the teaching team were a great way to evaluate your knowledge and identify gaps prior to exams, and the team was always responsive and readily available to assist with questions. Because each lecture was so information-heavy, at times it was difficult to keep up \/ know what the most important takeaways were. May be helped by slightly better organization of slides \/ more consistent summary slides to drill home the big picture.",
                "Strengths: lots of material covered, provides information relevant to people of our age group Weakness: slides arent very put together, professor talks too fast",
                "The class draws a lot from real life and incorporates everyday examples well. There is a _lot_ of material to go over. A lot of it is rushed through in class, and students are often not left with enough time to comprehend everything or write things down in class.",
                "I think we could've done more practice problems in class, application questions",
                "Strengths: This class is SO interesting. You are truly learning every single day. Kober is also a great lecturer and makes the class fun while also being serious in regard to the material being discussed. \r\nWeaknesses: This course is definitely more fit for STEM\/Psych majors, as it builds on previous knowledge of the brain. Even though it is advertised as not requiring previous knowledge, it is very science-based and will be challenging. I do think that another improvement would be removing either the paper or a test. Currently, the course has many examinations, and it makes it challenging to study for the final while also working on the final paper. I also think that if a notecard was allowed on the exam, this would be very helpful and place a higher emphasis on the understanding material rather than memorizing specifics about certain drugs.",
                "Not a beginner neuroscience class, LOTS of new material to know after every class and professor talks very fast and does not provide slides before class",
                "One of the main strengths of the course is that even though its an intro class meant for non majors, it still gives you a ton of information and knowledge that you will apply to your life. Also, the format of exams is great. The only weakness is that the professor is an incredibly fast talker, which makes it difficult to take adequate notes in lecture.",
                "i thought the professor talked too fast and most of the time when i understood a concept it was because i taught myself or a friend taught me. i wouldve liked to have q better understanding of how different concepts connected to have a cohesive picture",
                "Strengths: Prof Kober was incredibly interesting! She moves so fast during lectures, but you will learn so much. Just make sure to go back and look over the lectures later that day\/week instead of waiting until the week of the exam. There is so much information.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is more for me, but learning needs to be self-facilitated in this class. You really need to put in the time outside of class to do well. Doing the readings, going to office hours, sponging 2-4 hours outside of class each week looking at the lectures again in order to have all the information sink in because there is so much to learn.",
                "This is an excellent course although the exams are quite difficult.",
                "Please please get a better room for this lecture. The wifi on my computer would mess up every lecture and I would have to take notes on my phone. I also could barely hear a professor who self-identified as talking very fast.",
                "Strengths: The lectures were engaging and the textbook was really helpful. Weaknesses: The course was structured to incentivize cheating and disadvantage students who were honest. This felt really demoralizing at times. It could be fixed by either making the self-tests open-note or holding them in-class (closed-note).",
                "Lecture was way too fast and there was too much content to remember for each drug. This class was way too heavy on the biochemistry of drugs (brain) and less attention was paid to the behavior aspect of the class. There were spontaneous canvas assignments that did not have announcements, so if you were a couple minutes late to class one day you would end up with a zero on an assignment, with no way to make it up. The exams were also very difficult.",
                "strengths, prof kober has a great lecturing style and i love learning from her, but a big weakness in the class is the exam structure. i felt as if, after the exams, i wasnt fully preparing to learn the material needed and instead i had to just memorize because of the many exam questions and time restraints.",
                "I think the class moved a bit too fast at times, and I think the amount of material was a bit unrealistic for exams. I really enjoyed the material, and the lectures were very engaging and very interesting. I loved the course material and Professor Kober as a lecturer.",
                "The course was really strong until the last few weeks. The Professor really doesnt know what shes talking about when she got into the history of drugs and their prohibition she routinely spread misinformation and was not receptive at all to fact checking. It very much felt like she was trying to peddle an agenda.\r\n\r\nThe exams were also routinely misgraded. Errors made me lose several points on each exam, to the point that corrections boosted one of my scores by over a letter grade! The curve was also never clearly explained\r\n\r\nApart from those things, though  5\/5.",
                "Strengths are the content is interesting but weaknesses are there is way too much content for an intro level neuroscience class. It moves too quickly through the content and requires a lot of out of class attention for memorization and understanding",
                "I LOVED this course. Prof. Kober is incredibly passionate about the material and about her students, and really thoughtful about how she organizes the course, presents information, and adapts the course in response to feedback throughout the term. The ONE THING is that she has a tendency to talk very fast, which made her lectures hard to follow sometimes, especially as someone who has only taken one neuroscience course before this one.",
                "Strengths: Interesting material, passionate lecturer, workload is not too heavy day-to-day\r\nWeaknesses: The material is a little too advanced\/is taught too quickly for people without STEM backgrounds and exams are tricky",
                "The lectures were great, and the workload was not terrible. Material was interesting, and depth of coverage felt pretty good. Don't have much to say about its improvement.",
                "Professor Kober speaks really fast and it is hard to follow the course if you have no neuroscience experience, even though the syllabus says otherwise.",
                "The course was organized so very well. Professor Kober was an amazing lecturer, and she did a great job at explaining the material. The exams were graded quite harshly and even with substantial studying some of the questions felt tough, but the class is curved.",
                "Weakness: Learning the material or taking notes during class is very difficult because the professor glides through slides too quickly. Also, class recordings are not readily available despite the fact that the class is recorded",
                "Strengths: incredibly applicable to college life, really interesting, meaningful, and cool content that is fun to study, not a lot of reading and no psets, being able to have choice for the exam questions was awesome and helped with studying\r\nWeaknesses: class is incredibly fast-paced and you have to be hyper-focused during lectures which makes them feel very high stakes, rubrics for exam questions is pretty picky and looks for buzz words, both mid-terms (especially the first one) were very long",
                "The lectures were very engaging.",
                "This course has really interesting, manifestly relevant subject matter. Unfortunately, I found that this class was not set up to maximize learning, and was instead structured to promote competition and increase student stress. Often, the speed of lecture delivery, and the amount of time allocated to different subjects, made it difficult to understand and review the more complex dimensions of the subject matter. I felt that a lot of lecture time was dedicated to less science-y aspects of the material, and that the course, despite being labeled as not having prerequisites, relied on a very solid base of neuroscience knowledge that was difficult to gain just from the courses introductory weeks. In addition, I tried to attend office hours numerous times during which no TF was present, which made it hard for me to review concepts I was confused about. I ended up having to CR\/D this class to avoid having it ruin my grade point average.",
                "Strengths: enthusiastic, intelligent (and expert on the subject matter), caring professor; interesting subject matter; logical organization. Weaknesses: lectures went way too fast; exams were very difficult; it was difficult to get feedback on exams because exams were never returned and students had to review exams one at a time with TF's at office hours, which was inefficient for students and TF's.",
                "Very interesting content, but can be a little dense",
                "A lot of extra info that makes it confusing to filter",
                "Strengths: Prof. Kober is the main strength. She's an excellent lecturer and I usually felt engaged in class. The class was not overwhelming with homework or projects. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: You shouldn't have to go to office hours and sit 1-on-1 to get exam feedback. Also, such huge percentages of our grade were staked on just exams. Readings should not be used as -- if you read it you can get one more point on the exam.",
                "Exams were hard and a lot of material to memorize and learn. But super interesting.",
                "One weakness was that I think there were a lot of topics in the course the professor spoke about as if we should know, such as certain drugs and how they might affect the body. Students heavily involved in neuroscience definitely had an advantage. I also did not like how we were not able to see our exams unless we went to office hours with the TFs, which was pretty difficult to do. Also, the majority of TFs were not very helpful. A strength was that the professor was passionate about the topic and that came through in her teaching.",
                "The strengths are the Hedy's seemingly unlimited knowledge about every drug and their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, the lectures on each drug were well done and designed to teach effectively. I would have preferred one less lecture on alcohol in order to cover another type of drug, perhaps inhalants, but overall really great stuff.",
                "Many chances to improve grade. Interesting material,",
                "The content is occasionally interesting but the way the class is very poorly organized.",
                "Very organised, great slides, office hours, SUPER engaging lecture. Hedy is the best.",
                "Strengths: Hedy is a great lecturer and material is really interesting!\r\nWeaknesses: this class is not a gut and is seriously hard, especially if you're not a science (particularly neuro\/cogsci major). The material moves really quickly -- probably too quickly honestly -- and I struggled to study for tests because there's so much material it can be a bit overwhelming. Also the final paper, while meant to be a grade booster, just forced me to spend a few unnecessary hours during reading week when I could have been studying instead or doing work on more important assignments during reading week. I would have preferred a few problem sets over the course of the semester to 1. avoid having an essay and 2. so that each test mattered less (and so that I was forced to think about \/ review the material before the tests, which had so so much material on them). I feel like this class is farmed as an intro or accessible course when it's really not -- you'll probably end up enjoying the class since the material is really interesting, but you should be prepared to really grind or Cr\/D it (which a lot of my friends did) if the tests don't go so well. Also I wish it was easier to view our tests after getting our grades back.",
                "Definitely very science heavy... NOT a gut.",
                "This course requires a lot of time and energy, even though it is marketed as a class for non-majors. I think the expectations could have been much clearer. Even if the content we were being tested on could not have been shared, it would have been helpful to know the format of the exams beforehand. I also know that there were concerns about sending out lecture slides before the class, but it would have been helpful if the handouts that were sent out for 3 classes were more consistent so we could have a better frame of reference for what we were going over in class.  I also would have appreciated getting the prompt for the final essay a bit sooner than reading week when it was due, because there are many other assignments due at this time and not knowing what the expectations were made it difficult to plan ahead. While we were told that the paper would be simple\/not take much time, different people have different strengths, workloads, and experience with this type of assignment and the lack of time couple with the assurance that the lack of time was fine, did not seem to acknowledge these differences. Also the lack of consistency with when\/how self tests were administered made them less helpful than they could have been, especially because they died off by the middle of the semester, which meant they weren't as helpful for preparing for tests as I assumed they would be."

                "Honestly, no. Unless you are extremely intent on learning this specific information, you must be ready to put in the work and deal with the disorganization. The feedback I got from the course was extremely lacking, I thought the timing of canvas quizzes was random and unfair, and I felt that the lectures moved WAY too fast to learn from. I always had to go and read the textbook, even if I was paying attention in lectures. It is a lot of work, with an essay and three exams.",
                "no",
                "Yes! If you're not taking it C\/D\/F be prepared to study for exams, it's a lot of information (but totally doable). I think this is a great course not just for neuro or psych majors but just for humans in general. I learned a lot that can now help me make more informed decisions about what I want to consume. It's not DARE-style scare tactics and has some actually really useful information. Honestly, I'd take this course just for Prof. Hedy Kober, she's AMAZING-- so knowledgable about everything and so willing to help you with whatever you need.",
                "I would recommend this course if you're actually interested in the biological processes surrounding drug use and do not mind learning and remembering a lot of details.",
                "I would 100% recommend this class to someone, it is easily my favorite course I have taken at Yale and I would encourage anyone who is interested in the content to take the class",
                "Yes, if this is content that interests you, and perhaps if you already have some background in neuroscience and some sense of how drugs work. As much as the course is structured for people who have no science background, there is A LOT of content and it goes REALLY quickly, so just be prepared. A very very science-y science credit :)",
                "only those with neuroscience background or willingness to put in a LOT of extra time studying",
                "No. Even though the subject matter is genuinely intriguing, the overall experience of the class has been dampened by issues that have made it challenging to navigate, even for some neuroscience majors. Unfortunately, several ended up either dropping the course or opting for a credit\/d\/fail option.\r\n\r\nThe administrative aspect of the course has been a significant source of stress. While the professor advocates for a learning-centered approach, emphasizing that grades are not paramount, the course structure seems to contradict this philosophy. The frequency of quizzes and exams, in conjunction with the requirement to write a paper and complete creative assignments, suggests a high-stakes, grade-focused environment. This disparity has created a sense of ambiguity and insecurity among the students.\r\n\r\nCompounding this issue is the seemingly arbitrary nature of how certain elements of the course are managed. For instance, a set of quizzes was abruptly removed from the syllabus without a clear explanation, and the feedback on our work is often delayed or vague. This lack of clarity has led to confusion and heightened anxiety about performance and expectations.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the classroom environment, both in-person and online, has occasionally felt uncomfortable due to certain behaviors exhibited by the professor. Instances in which the professor singles out students, requesting them to be quiet with the assertion that \"other students can hear them,\" have created tension, especially when the targeted students were not noticeably disruptive. Such experiences have unfortunately led to a sense of intimidation, deterring some of us from active participation despite our interest in the course material.\r\n\r\nA disproportionate amount of time is spent on \"questions\" slides than actual content slides. When questioned about her teaching methodology, the professor tends to respond defensively rather than taking it as constructive feedback. \r\n\r\nOn a brighter note, the Teaching Fellows as well as the professor hold many office hours to facilitate student learning.",
                "I would reccommend if you find the lecture material interesting, however it is a lot of work when preparing for the exams so be able to manage that!",
                "NO NO NO!!! Do NOT take this class unless you are a neuroscience major. It is the farthest thing from a gut and really misrepresented on the syllabus. This is not at all an introductory class and without prior neuroscience knowledge, it will be incredibly difficult to keep up. The professor speaks so quickly in lecture and barely explains anything yet refuses to post the recordings so you only have her kinda confusing slides to study off of. Everything up until the first mid term is pure neuroscience and even after that, you only learn about drugs in the context of neuroscience which is so much less interesting than you would expect. I am not actually walking out of this class with a better understanding of if I should or should not take certain drugs, I know only know what neurotransmitters and receptors each drug affects. Her exams are so ridiculous, and she asks the most niche, specific questions of all time. It is an extraordinary amount of content you are supposed to know for each exam (most people's study guides were 40+ pages). You also don't even have weekly psets or homework which (surprisingly) I really wish we had. The only work outside of the three exams is a paper due during reading week (so yes you have a paper and final during finals) and you also never get to see your graded exams unless you want to wait in office hours to see it on her computer. There is no way to check your comprehension of the content week by week and it's super easy to fall behind. Moreover, you have no practice to really go off when studying for exams. She doesn't post past finals and only released practice questions for the midterms (she didn't even post any for the final) at like 6pm the night before. Your only way to study is memorizing her 100 slides per lecture.",
                "Yes! Just be prepared for very involved discussions every class.",
                "This is an interesting class, and you learn a lot of cool stuff. It is not a gut though! You will have to memorize a lot of details.",
                "I think this course contains a lot of important and interesting information, and I found myself talking about the lectures to my friends pretty much every week. However, I think it can be difficult. Usually workload is very low, but the exams require a fair amount of preparation. The TF review sessions were not helpful, there were study questions, but without answers, and study materials were not uploaded until a day or two before the exams. Professor Kober also speaks very quickly, so sometimes it was hard to get all the notes down, especially since sometimes the slides don't include all the information she says. However, there is a supposedly generous curve, and the content was pretty easy to memorize once you had it. I recommend the course if you don't have a difficult workload otherwise, especially if you already have some background in neuroscience.",
                "I'm not sure I would. I really loved the material, and I think people would benefit from it. However, it was a stressful course that didn't need to be so!",
                "ABSOLUTELY! This is knowledge that will enhance your human experience and information you'll carry with you for the rest of your life, in some way shape or form. Drugs are all around us, legal and illicit, both in use and related to policy, so it's important to be knowledgeable about them.",
                "No unless youre comfortable with brain neurotransmission",
                "No, I would definitely not recommend this course to another student. It seemed the topics would be interesting, but I found it very hard to link any of the information or get tested on it in a fair way.",
                "Yes, I would. The course is very interesting and you learn so much about drugs that are everywhere. I would not say this is a gut though; the exams are somewhat difficult (but fair), so be prepared to study a bit, and the lectures move quickly.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in the topic and don't mind science and memorization.",
                "Yes, if you need a science credit that is not to hard, but still want to learn this is a good class. It is not hard to become invested in this class, the content is super interesting.",

                "This is a good Science requirement credit, but very hard if you don't have a background in chemistry or biology.",
                "Yes! The class is interesting and relevant to our real lives, since drugs are ubiquitous nowadays. However, there is a lot of information to memorize in order to do well in the exams, so you will need to really understand the material. Some prior knowledge of neuroscience would be helpful, although not required.",
                "If traditional lecture-style courses work for you, I think that this is a decent course to take. It's an incredibly interesting topic, but absorbing the course's content requires a LOT of self-guided work. It is by no means a gut for a science credit, although it is one of the cooler science credit courses to take. I really wish the educational pedagogy of the course were different because I would have really loved this class had it been structured better to facilitate student learning.",
                "I absolutely loved this class. I am a global affairs major and the last science class I took was Bio the World and Us 3 years ago. This class was definitely challenging for me but I loved the challenge. Unlike most of my other writing, reading and Econ classes at Yale, this content is really digestible. Its just a lot to memorize and put together, but you can get a sense of what will be on the tests with the practice questions and not be blindsided by anything. Unlike challenging Econ or math tests, there wont be a question that you just stare at and have no idea how to start. It was a different way of using my brain and I really enjoyed the change up. Its just a ton of memorizing. I studied a ton for the first test; probably 12-15 hours of focused time, and did well. \r\n\r\nThe first 3 or so weeks of the class I was super overwhelmed with new content; genuinely 30-40% of the words said in lecture referred to parts of the brain I had never heard before and systems I didnt know existed. I walked out of every one of the first few lectures super lost. It got better as I reviewed more outside of class and as the semester went on. Its not a gut, but I was taking five courses and genuinely enjoyed this class a lot.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who has an interest in the neurobiology\/science of drugs, and who isn't afraid of denser lectures with science-heavy terminology.",
                "No, unless you are good at memorizing small, specific details or are passionate about neuroscience",
                "Yes, if you want to invest a lot of your time into learning interesting things about drugs. I would not recommend it for a science gut; it is NOT a gut.",
                "Absolutely. Take this course. The course is certainly challenging, but it is very fair. In addition, this class is genuinely one of the most important courses I've taken in my academic career  you'll learn important information about how drugs work in your brain, and I came away from the course with life-saving information. It's an interesting and engaging course, and generally a great time.",
                "I would! I learned so much, more so than an easier science class. It was hard but worth it",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to a NSCI\/PSYC major, but if you are simply thinking about taking this class as a science distributional, please consider that it will be a challenge. However, you learn so much about drugs and really rethink your previous misconceptions about drugs.",
                "If you CR\/D",
                "no",
                "Yes, if youre looking for an interesting science credit. Keep in mind that this is definitely not a gut",
                "if theyre willing to put in extra time to learn things and teach themselves \/ work with other students then yea - the material is interesting! it is a lot of neuroscience though!",
                "Read if you are thinking of taking for the science credit: this class is difficult. If you have no neuro experience, you will struggle. You'll learn a ton, but there is so much info that she breezes through very quickly that if you do not have the background knowledge it will be very difficult to learn. The class is super interesting though, so you should definitely credit\/D it. This was my first SC credit spring of sophomore year, so I didn't have the option to do so which I regretted. Definitely one of those classes that would be much more enjoyable without the pressure of the grade. Incredibly interesting nonetheless.",
                "Nope. Science background required to do well.",
                "Yes! It both increased my interest in neuroscience and provided information useful to everyday life.",
                "No, not unless they are going into biochemistry.",

                "I would absolutely recommend it. I would say that if you're new to neuroscience, as I was, be prepared for the first month or so to feel a little bit overwhelmingyou're getting a TON of information on basics in neurotransmission and how neurons work and what the various parts of the brain are etc. thrown at you, and a lot of other students have taken The Human Brain or comparable courses before this one. But if you power through, this course is SO rewarding and you'll leave with this really satisfying feeling that you Learned So Much, and such useful and interesting information!",
                "Yes, if the material is interesting to you, and you have some kind of background in it. However, I would not take it if this is your first introduction to neuroscience, and you don't have tons of time to commit to the subject. The material is not really introductory, and the class moves super quickly. It is interesting, but I was not prepared to devote the time necessary to do super well.",
                "Yes. Its very interesting. Very heavy workload on exam weeks as theres a ton of content. Be willing to put in a lot of time. But knowing about drugs and the brain is VERY rewarding.",
                "I would recommend it. As someone with no neuroscience background, I felt the material was presented intuitively. Everyone should take this class if interested.",
                "If you have taken the human brain, go ahead. If not, I would be cautious. The course requires a lot of memorization of receptors, neurotransmitters, etc. Without the foundation of an introductory neuroscience course, it is a lot to take in at once and hard to do really well in the class",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially Neuroscience and Psychology majors, BUT not if you have had no prior background knowledge of the brain. It is advertised as through it is beginner friendly, but I promise that its not. I was really excited to register for this course and to take it as a freshman, but now I regret taking it without taking The Human Brain or Neurobiology first. This was but my experience though.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to a student. Just keep in mind that a decent amount of studying will be required.",
                "Please don't take this class if you're looking for a gut science credit and you're not majoring in or (deeply) interested in Neuroscience.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in drugs or neuroscience. I absolutely loved this class and found it very useful for college life, and it made the content feel meaningful and worthwhile. However, there is an extraordinary amount of content covered in every lecture, and a lot of it ends up being memorization of small details. I actually enjoyed studying for the exams because I liked the content, but if this class doesnt interest you, studying would kind of suck. Dont take this class unless youre prepared to show up to lecture and pay attention, because lecture recordings arent shared with the class and Hedy talks so quickly that she sounds normal in half speed on playback. Although the course was not always the most well-run, it was very cool, engaging, and relevant, so I would definitely recommend it. There really aren't enough courses like this at Yale",
                "Definitely. A good psychology science credit",
                "I would only recommend this course to someone with a strong science (and esp. neuroscience) background. I believe the claim that this course is accessible to people of all experience levels is a fallacious one.",
                "I would, with the caveat that this course is not a GUT. There are a lot of really valuable insights in this course that every college students should know about drugs and drug use. The course was interesting, and I learned a lot about how the brain works that I'm already applying to my life.",
                "Yes but would not say it is a gut. There is so much information",
                "Only if they've already taken a neuroscience class. Most people in this class seemed to have done so and I felt behind from the start because I hadn't.",
                "Yes. I think every yale student should take a course like this. Though if you are not premed I would recommend pass failing it.",
                "Not really, unless you are very interested in the topic and have a background in neuroscience. DO NOT take this for an \"easy\" or \"fun\" science credit.",
                "I would recommend this course. Professor Kober's expertise in this field is unmatched and the ability to learn from someone with her background is a great privilege. The content of the class is very interesting and Kober makes herself available for students to ask all sorts of questions regarding content and personal experience.",
                "Definitely! Super interesting for all majors. And professor Kober is amazing",
                "No, unless you are extremely into drugs. There is a lot of memorization and it is often unclear what is going to be covered in exams. Many concepts are not fully explained and the way the assignments and exams are structured do not facilitate the learning.",
                "YES! Its so interesting and empowering. Its such a unique experience to get to learn about drugs in an academic setting. Im not a science person at Yale and it turned out to be my favorite class here!!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student with the caveat that they need to be really really prepared to work hard for it and study a ton. I wouldn't recommend this course at all to someone who's a non-STEM major looking for a STEM gut. I'd only take this course if you have the capacity to put the work in.",
                "If you want to learn about the science of drugs yes. If you are looking for a science gut, then no.",
                "Yes, I thought the material was interesting."
