                "Strengths: Professor Cohn is a brilliant professor, a musical wizard you can say. His writings are beautifully written. He is also a very kind person, and helps foster a warm musical community.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:",
                "Awesome structure--topic very conducive to discussion. Loved being able to hear other students' views on a piece and understand different hearings of a song/track/piece. Amazing instructors, good discussion leading. Good classmates too! Assignments are quite open ended and allow you to present your own interpretation of pieces. Opportunity to present our own selections in class was also awesome!\r\n\r\nWould love more focus on modern music! There was a healthy mix of it, but I do think the class was a little classical-heavy. I think it's the perfect class to engage with modern music theoretically.",
                "Strengths: material laid out very clearly and effectively. Professor Cohn is an expert in this field, and so it was a wonderful opportunity to explore an aspect of music theory seldom taught in other courses. The course draws strongly on all types of music (not just classical), including rock, pop, vocal performance/opera, symphonic, and even Ghanaian drum patterns. The assignments require a significant amount of thought and writing but are very reasonable considering the time allowed. Grading was fair and reasonable, and always came back with helpful comments. Professor Cohn and Mr. Cox knew that mistakes regarding terminology would be frequent at the beginning of the semester --due to the fact that we are all still adapting to the new vernacular -- but were very understanding and helpful. These naturally decreased as the semester progressed. \r\n\r\nI appreciate the flexiblility with which both Professor Cohn and Mr. Cox approached due dates and material given the pandemic year.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: basically none. Despite being a new class, this class was expertly organized and very well structured, and Professor Cohn was very flexible. I see a few things on the initial syllabus that we didn't have time to fully explore -- perhaps the only thing would be if the earlier half of the course (building the framework of meter) went slightly faster so we had more time to explore those! This, however is a VERY MINOR weakness.",
                "Strength: Great course for any student with musical interest, not too much background is required. You get to listen to lots of different types of music, not just classical music, but you get to see how musical patterns are present across multiple genres. \r\n\r\nWeakness: In person discussions could get convoluted if you didn't hear a certain pattern other people were hearing."

This allowed for a more dynamic experience where questions could be introduced and explored.",

                "100%. Prof. Cohn is fantastic. I am so lucky to have had him as my professor.",
                "Yes, as long you find the difficulty of the material a good fit! Most discussions didn't require any kind of formal theory background, and after taking a few other 200/300 level music classes I didn't find the concepts too difficult to grasp. Even then, the ideas presented in this course are super interesting  Prof. Cohn doesn't flaunt it, but he's kind of a big deal in the theory world and published influential work on this very topic (although the class doesn't quite get far enough to reach his level of theory). On top of that, it certainly changed how I listen to all kinds of music (classical or otherwise) and I feel like I'm much more attentive to any interesting metric/rhythmic aspects of any piece. Prof. Cohn is an absolute joy to work with and is incredibly understanding about all of the difficulties that came up during covid I would highly recommend this (or any other course with him)!",
                "yes. if you're new to music theory, take the plunge. I had no experience with the subject, but was attracted by the course number and description. I think it's a cool and unconventional way to get into music theory.",
                "I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in studying an aspect of metric theory seldom taught in other courses; here is a great example of a Yale-style course, which explores new and exciting ideas of meter and its framework. The class is very well laid out, and I highly recommend you check out the \"Strengths\" section for the reasons why the class was a success.",

You don't need to have experience performing or composing music, and even the ability to read standard Western music notation is not required. Take this course if you love music and you're curious about the inner workings of rhythm."
