They helped me engage deeply with the material in hands-on ways, and each project was different from the others. \r\nI felt that attendance to songlab was a more useful component of this course than I expected. That's a plus for songlab, but also... I don't remember seeing anything about songlab written in the blurb/short syllabus on the course signup website. (Maybe I just missed it.) It would have been nice to know ahead of time that the time commitment for the course would be more than just the Wednesday class period. \r\nGREAT class though! I really enjoyed the readings and class discussions.",
                "The seminar style discussions in this class were really engaging, and the assignments and readings were well facilitated to help deepen understanding of the material.",
                "Strengths: class engagement, clear presentation of complicated material, a guiding perspective overall of how to approach different concepts\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: less a weakness than a note, I think it would be beneficial overall to name/describe this course as one specifically looking at European music notations",
                "I think that in order for the course to remain to be structure as it is, it should be required for undergraduate students to take MUSI 350 as a prerequisite (or have other familiarity with medieval music). I was one of the few people in the class that had not taken 350 and/or was a graduate student at the School of Music. Because of this, I felt a lot less familiar with the repertoire from the periods we were learning about, making feel quite out of my depth when attempting to participate in group discussion.\r\n\r\nI think when the course was at its best was when we were working on the board learning the actual mechanics of older notational systems. On the same line, I thought the assignments were very good and helpful.\r\n\r\nI do wish we got a little more information on the final project for the class. All I really had to go off of was the canvas schedule that said that we did in fact have a final project to do and a comment made in class speaking about another assignment and how it might relate to the final project.",
                "The course material is very interesting, and prof Z.s lecturing is always clear and engaging.\r\nHowever, the readings and course content can be quite challenging, especially if someone doesnt have any knowledge of medieval European music before taking this class."

Dr. Zayaruznaya is fantastic, the material is incredibly fascinating and curiosity-provoking, and it's so cool to engage with notation in this way, especially if you're someone for whom it might be easy to overlook the fact that it has its own history and hasn't always been a \"fixed\" object (as it can seem to be in the modern day).",

The class is split between undergraduates and graduate students, so its a nice mix of varying experiences. The readings are manageable, and it is clear Professor Zayaruznaya is incredibly dedicated to her work and her teaching. She is one of the nicest Professors I have ever had at Yale, and she genuinely cares about her students.",
