                "In this course we learned the basics of Unity for making games and VR worlds, navigating VR, spatial sound, photogrammetry, and placemaking in VR. No 3D modeling in the traditional sense, though; the course did not cover Blender, Maya, etc. so if you wanted to use totally custom assets you'd have to teach yourself one of those programs.",
                "How to use Unity, Tiltbrush, and Altspace VR",
                "I learned how to make games and VR experiences in Unity, do photogrammetry scans and import them to Altspace VR, and had some really interesting discussions on emergent properties and artistic mediums.",
                "Good insight into how to use Unity and amazing for encouraging students to think differently about art, digital mediums, and how to use them to create unique and interesting immersive experiences.",

                "A strength was Professor Berrys commitment to the class and his students. For the same of my organization, better communication/organization in the class structure would be a major benefit.",
                "Strengths: Justin is an innovative, funny, and attentive teacher. You can tell he really enjoys the stuff we're doing, that he's excited about it, and that he wants us all to be excited as well. Everyone's work is discussed in depth and with respect. Weaknesses: I really wish this had been labeled something like \"VR Worldbuilding\" instead of \"3D Modeling\" because we technically didn't learn any 3D modeling in the traditional sense.",
                "The course had a very improvisational tone as Prof. Berry chose what to work on every week. I wish it had been slightly more organized.",
                "I would like more clarity and less ambiguity in various areas of the course, but I also understand that some of the class's strengths, especially openness, my be weakened by introducing this.",
                "A bit more time would have been nice on some of the later projects! I would have also liked more theoretical and art-historical material interspersed throughout the semester, rather than bunched at the beginning."

                "I would, but I would certainly clarify that if a student wants to take this class they have to be very very interested in the subject. A lot of this class required asynchronous learning, which is awesome, but a student definitely has to be very committed in order for that type of learning to be successful.",
                "I'd recommend this course if you want to learn about VR; there's no better place to learn it than at the CCAM. Unity/VR is not too difficult, although it may seem intimidating. You have to be willing to take ownership of your projects and be committed to taking them to cool places.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course, but youll get what you put into it",
                "We received Oculus Quest VR headsets and made VR worlds that we then explored in class - it was a super cool experience I recommend everyone try, even if just for the novelty of it. The readings and class discussions were fascinating as well.",
                "Yes, but I'd be slightly wary of taking this course if you tend to be bad at technology. I still recommend it, but you might get more out of it if you're comfortable with digital artistic mediums, especially 3D digital art.",
                "Yes! A great introduction to a really exciting world of thought and creation."
