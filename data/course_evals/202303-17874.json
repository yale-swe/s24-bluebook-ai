That is, even though I'm not super interested in Epistemology, taking this class made me a much better philosopher because it provides a unique insight into how philosophical theories and cases interact (and contrasts with ethics in that 99% of the time you go with the cases, not with the theory), and also spent significant time talking about philosophical methodology and meta philosophical debates about intuitions and whatnot."

                "Strengths: \r\n1. Very thorough coverage of the topics covered\r\n2. 3 short essays + 2 exams + final paper gave lots of opportunities to practice writing and get feedback\r\n3. KDR rightly assigns a lot of his own work, which makes the class very interesting since you get to see how a philosopher engages with the rest of the field, and you can ask him questions about his positions and stuff.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. Sometimes feedback was a bit short and uninformative\r\n2. The expectations for the 2 exams were a bit vague. It was unclear whether the focus should be on reconstruction or on forwarding your own idea, and the short time frame (especially for the midterm) made it difficult to accomplish both"
