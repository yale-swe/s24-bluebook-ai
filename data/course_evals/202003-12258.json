                "I learned a large breadth of information however, I felt like this course was often lacking in depth of information and I wonder how much of the information I learned will stick as I move to more advanced French courses.",
                "The discussion format worked really well and I feel like we really talked a lot in French. The materials we studied (books, movies, etc.) were interesting and helped illuminate different aspects of French we hadn't looked at before. In terms of weaknesses, it was just a lottt of work. It's clear signing up for it that you'll be in for a lot, but if it could just be taken down a peg or two, that would help out so much in terms of stress prevention, especially during COVID-19.",
                "This course was taught very well and had a great structure to it with the course packet, novels, and film with clips. I would not change anything. I do wish that my grades were uploaded to Canvas so that I could know how my grades were adding up. I also wish that when receiving my exam grades, I could be told what questions I got wrong with right and wrong answers and copies of the audio clips to check them again.",
                "This course, like many other language courses, seems to assume that students have no other classes or obligations that take precedence over it. The reality is that this course isn't too difficult, but burdens students with far too much homework in such a short time. Otherwise, it's a very enjoyable course and very instructive.",
                "One strength of this course is that we got daily practice speaking in large and small group settings over Zoom. Additionally, the listening practice in class was very helpful and the reading materials were very interesting and helpful.",
                "I wish there was a bit more time to practice speaking during class but that's obviously difficult because of the online format."

Canvas is really vital for online learning, though, and I really think the organization of materials on canvas could be improved. Some materials are on the umbrella site, some on the specific class site, and especially on the individual class site, there were very few folders, so if you didn't know exactly what the title was it was often very difficult to find specific files.",
