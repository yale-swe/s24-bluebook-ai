    "I read a lot of plays. That's the best part of the class for me.",
    "I learned to write compelling characters and high-stakes, event-driven drama. I also got to read a wide range of incredible plays, which helped me understand different approaches to playwriting and the career trajectories of incredible playwrights.",
    "I developed a better ability to analyze plays; a better eye for when something works and when something doesnt; and a richer vocabulary for thinking about plays in a holistic manner.",
    "This class is a deep dive into the literature of contemporary playwrights from the early twentieth century to the present. In addition, students work on their own plays and share this material with the class three times throughout the course.",
    "I learned the format and the general structure of playwriting. I also learned how to read a play quickly.",
    "I learned how to brainstorm ideas for plays and write scenes, as well as how Margulies' larger creative process works. The workshops taught me a lot about what worked in my head and what worked for an audience. I also learned about the importance of objects and urgency in conflict.",
    "I learned a lot about the modern dramatic canon and a lot of technical skills for playwriting. I also got to practice the craft which was the most substantial part!",
    "I learned how to write a one-Act play. We read the thirty best plays written in the last century and talked about them in class. We talked about how to write different types of scenes and how to create the world of the play. We found out how to gain creative inspiration for plays and to write interesting narratives based on prompts and photographic inspiration."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class would work better if it were a bit more about us as playwrights and less about us cranking out work to show to each other. It felt very very corporate, much less about what we want to say through our plays and all about what the play was about plot-wise. I felt a little bit stunted in this class.",
    "The course readings are excellent, and Prof. Margulies is very supportive and attentive. The one act assignment is the right level of challenge, and it was extremely rewarding to turn it in at the end of the semester.\r\n\r\nI thought workshopping three scenes over the course of the semester was not only unhelpful, but actually counter-productive. This structure of the syllabus led my classmates and me to write three unrelated, incomplete, out-of-context scenes in a play that we hadn't yet fully conceptualized. Often, people changed their topics, which I'd suggest is not a good thing. Plus, this workshop format meant that we had so many people to get through each week that we couldn't really dig into the writingyou can't give good feedback unless there's an opportunity for praise and then a longer opportunity for criticism, not just a de facto 1-2 comments per person rule. For myself, I found that rather than wrestling with my play as a whole, I wrote it piecemeal, which totally stunted its growth. I would have much preferred a syllabus in which 2 people turned in a completed draft each week, which the class would read for homework, and then the person could choose a scene to be read aloud. Then we'd have a more significant amount of time to discuss in class, and we could offer feedback on the play as a whole, rather than an out-of-context chunk. It would have been much more gratifying to have a draft, get my classmates' reactions to the whole, and then revise it for the end of the semester. I understand that this would force some people to turn in drafts fairly early in the semester, but I think it would be reasonable to allow theirs to be slightly less fleshed out, and then they would have more time for revision.",
    "A strength of this course is the project it entails- writing the play. I have the satisfaction of having written one now. Also the breadth of the plays we read was wonderful. However, I think the course could have done a better job of pushing us creatively- perhaps with more imaginative prompts, or a more active in-class format. That would have been beneficial.",
    "This class was structured well in the way Prof. Margulies requires talking points of the students; this is something you must submit before each class in order to show you have some 'talking points' about the plays assigned for the class discussion. This made me make sure to do all my readings, and all the readings are thoughtfully chosen to teach you what other plays do well, and learning this lets you apply it directly to your own new work.",
    "I really like the weekly assignments. Professor Margulies is very good at assigning exercises that challenge you as a playwright and allow you to grow. I would say that the sheer number of plays assigned meant that it was hard to concentrate on the writing when there is over 200 pages of reading a week plus a weekly response.",
    "The seminar format is great for discussion, and everyone in the class is very engaged and has awesome things to say, and the workshops, while long, are extremely helpful, even if its not your work being critiqued. The plays Margulies picked were just fantastic. So much great reading. Basically the curriculum of an English class without writing any analytical papers, just weekly talking points. The weekly assignments were fun and inspiring. And wow the final play, while incredibly daunting, was such a life-giving creative challenge.",
    "I loved being able to write every week and share work with one another. I think often the amount of reading and reading responses overwhelmed the actual writing  I noticed I spent much more time getting all the reading and talking points done than working on each scene I wrote, and it might be good to equalize that work load so that writing can get more attention."

   "comments": [
    "Sure. It's fine if you want to read plays and then try writing them. If you've already written some plays, maybe try to do the advanced one.",
    "If you're interested in reading plays and writing a one act, you should take this course. Prof. Margulies is very supportive, and open to meeting outside of class frequently. Class discussions don't dig deeply into the choices playwrights are makingthe discussions stayed in the realm of literary criticism. And workshops similarly felt a bit superficial. We didn't spend very long on each student, though each student had three workshops apiece, and we only workshopped a scene, rather than an entire work. But the class was fun, and it was very rewarding to write an entire one act over the course of the semester!",
    "I would recommend this course, with some caveats: you have to be really committed to pushing yourself.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student looking to become a playwright; the readings on the syllabus are incredibly important works that one should read and learn from. Prof. Margulies' practice is centered on form and narrative and character relationships and stakes and conflict, which is all so so important to learn to write well if you're looking to do playwriting.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone who enjoys writing and wants to develop voice without the crutch of internal monologue or prose. I would also recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in film or storytelling.",
    "Absolutely. If you have ever wanted to write a play, this is the exact way to do it. Every aspect of the class is phenomenal.",
    "Yes! A good introductory class to playwriting, good for practicing the craft and gaining exposure to the works out there."
