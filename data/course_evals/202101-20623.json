                "The professors are major strengths. They are both kind, approachable, and knowledgeable. It's also awesome to see how physics and math are used to describe biological phenomena. \r\n\r\nI think the decision to split this course into two separate courses was a good idea, as there's a bit of a disconnect between the two halves. This would also free Professor Sindelar to really dive deep into the math. There seemed to be some tension regarding the rigor of the math and physics in this class. On the one hand, a class on biophysics is only as rigorous as the underlying physics and there was something to be desired in this respect. I know the instructors probably agree with me but worry about students being alienated by the additional math. So it would be nice if there was a version of the course that went into rigorous thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, etc.",
                "Strengths: the first part of this course was really engaging, illuminating, and fun. I really liked Prof De La Cruz's lectures. Honestly, if EDC was teaching another course I think I would take it just because he was teaching it. Great prof, great guy, 11\/10 would recommend. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the second part of the course was really hard to understand and I felt lost most of the time. Prof Sindelair is also a really great guy, but his teaching is a little hard to understand. Things got complicated... really quickly, and I never quite caught up.",
                "First part of the course was easy to follow, but second part got very complicated. \r\nStrengths included getting to learn the science behind a lot of cool techniques.",
                "It was great. Perhaps better if the class was in person but that could not be helped. The meetings with TFs and the structure there was sometimes a bit unclear. Professors were both great however and this was a wonderful course towards the end of the MB&B major!",
                "The strength of this course are the knowledgeable and engaging professors.",
                "Didn't always feel like there was direction to the course or that we were building towards something.",
                "Strengths: Enrique's half of the course was wonderful. He covered each topic in a very engaging way, and his real-world analogies really helped us to better understand the content. For example, his 1 kT = $1.00 analogy was very helpful. The problem sets he writes are very fair and doable. Chuck's lectures on spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction cover topics in a more interdisciplinary way than I have ever seen, which helped to draw a lot of connections between fields of chemistry, biology, and physics and give students a deeper understanding. Weaknesses: Some of Chuck's lectures were a little disorganized and at other times simply unengaging. Having the slides in the right order would help. Perhaps the most unengaging part was when Chuck would go through a Fourier transform demonstration using the Google spreadsheet; it was very difficult to follow that in real time having never used the spreadsheet before, but watching the recording later was very helpful with the problem sets. Also, some of Chuck's problem sets seemed unnecessarily long, and dragged on much longer than Enrique's. For example, one question asked us to repeat a solvent masking algorithm 20 times, which just seemed like a waste of 30 minutes. I would suggest shortening Chuck's problem sets. Also, Chuck's exam seemed rather unfair. It asked many questions that we students simply were not prepared for. For instance, he asked us to go through an iteration of a Harker diagram, which he never really demonstrated for us, so it was impossible to answer that question without staring at the lecture notes for 30 minutes and making a lot of assumptions about the process.",
                "This course was very difficult to take remotely, as the content itself is very challenging. However, both professors were incredibly kind and understanding and made the course very engaging.",
                "I think the pacing could have been better so that we could have focused more heavily on the latter parts of the course. Sometimes the psets covered things that we hadn't gone over in class and some of the psets were buggy, so it could be helpful to go through each of the steps of the pset to make sure that they work. I don't think I gained much from the journal clubs since we had already done that sort of thing in the intro bio sequence."

The lectures are clear and cover key topics of biophysics. If you want to see this overlap, definitely take this course. However, if you are already familiar with the concepts of thermodynamics, reaction kinetics, spectroscopy, and x-ray crystallography, then do not take this course. X-ray crystallography is covered in a rather hand-wavy manner with more focus on words that don't really mean anything to students (such as Fourier transform) so even after taking the course I still don't really understand what XRD does. If you want to learn about x-ray crystallography, take the course that the chemistry department offers, which will give you a lot more information and understanding. The problem sets for the second half of the course just seem like a waste of time (they ask for Fourier transforms of images like duck contours that are completely unrelated to biology).",
