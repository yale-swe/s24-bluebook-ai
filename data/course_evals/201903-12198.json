   "comments": [
    "You'll know how to write a policy memo that's concise and to the point, which is definitely a useful skill.",
    "This class will teach you the practical side of foreign policy work, to understand the political underpinnings of every foreign policy decision and how individual and politics really influence the highest echelons of decision making. I developed skills in writing concise reports and considering foreign policy crises in a political lens, understanding how a politician and foreign leader would think about their win-sets, among many other things.",
    "A broad overview of American Foreign Policy in various administrations starting with Truman and ending with Trump.",
    "Learn about Presidents' administrations and their foreign policies, how to write a short memo\r\n\r\nHonestly the best part of this class was learning from and getting to know Gov. Dean",
    "The content of the course was thorough and the readings for each topic (LBJ to Trump) were comprehensive and insightful. But the true value of the class was from hearing the perspectives of Howard Dean and fellow students. From politics to evaluations of what worked and didnt work for foreign policy agendas to life advice, this class was a once in a lifetime learning experience!",
    "background in foreign policy",
    "I learned a lot about past foreign policy events\/history of US foreign policy, what constitutes strong and feasible policy recommendations, etc. A nice combination of history and current events as well as skills learning through simulations and individual projects.",
    "I learned how to write a 2-page memo on a foreign policy issue - super helpful to have exposure to a different kind of writing and learn how to present policy conclusions in a concise way.",
    "I learned so much about so many different topics: the Iran crisis, the history of the UN, the war in Afghanistan, and -- my favorite -- my classmates. It's rare at Yale to take a seminar and actually make friends, but because Professor Dean made it a priority, we all became close by the end of the semester. Overall, Professor Dean was willing to spend much more time with his students than any other professor I've had at Yale. I'd totally recommend this course.",
    "Prior to Governor Dean's course, my experience with policy memos was limited to a Gateway to Global Affairs course I took my freshman year. Now, at the end of the semester, I feel prepared to write a policy memo that is both clear and succinct. Also, feel like I walk away from the course having a better understanding of various American presidencies and the policies that were enacted under said administrations.",
    "increased my awareness and knowledge about foreign affairs and the role of the US in major events, different US presidents' approach to foreign policy; also learned how to write a policy memo and how the National Security Council is organized and functions"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Amazing guest speakers, interesting assignments and class discussions.",
    "The strengths are the professor, the material, and the great class the subject matter and instructor attract. Howard Dean is incredibly knowledgable, kind, forward thinking, and accessible. He really wants you to succeed and is open to talk, discuss, and be pushed on any of his ideas. He substantiates his poisitions and is not afraid to both challenge and be challenged by his students, which is invaluable in a seminar environment.",
    "The best part about the course is Howard Dean. The guy is incredible, so knowledgeable but also affable and open to meeting with students.",
    "Strengths: Gov. Dean is a really interesting professor to take this type of class with, and makes the class so good.  His insights are interesting, he runs a great class, and he loves getting to know his students--really actively tries to get to know everyone in the class.  The NSC simulation is awesome.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes too much focus on the presidents themselves--this class approaches foreign policy through the interpersonal interactions of presidents (biographies) which is very interesting but sometimes seems to limit analysis of foreign policy and other lenses that influence foreign policy.",
    "strengths: howard dean\r\nweaknesses: n\/a",
    "Strengths: You learn a lot, and Governor Dean is so knowledgeable on all of the issues you discuss in class, so it's really great to get his perspective. You get the history component, but Gov. Dean also gives you assignments that give you more applicable scenarios in which you need to develop policy recommendations. He also had several wonderful guests, including Emma Sky and Samantha Power. \r\nWeaknesses: There were classes where we went off on tangents and barely discussed the reading for the week; these other topics were still interesting though! There is a lot of reading as well. \r\n\r\nNeutral: I did not always receive as much feedback as I would have liked, but when I went to Office hours and asked more directed questions about my thoughts\/assignments, I got good feedback.",
    "You get to meet a lot of really cool individuals working in the foreign policy sphere (e.g. Samantha Power, Emma Sky - although the list changes year to year, I would look at the syllabus in advance) and hear about their background\/personal insights. Professor Dean is super generous with his time + feedback, and office hours are always available. There's also a NSC simulation that is a LOT of fun + a good learning experience. The only thing is that topics switch week by week so you may not feel there is sufficient depth on some of them.",
    "I think if less reading were assigned, we'd be more likely to actually do it (this seems counter intuitive but it's been my experience so far at Yale). That being said, everything I read was engaging and taught me a lot.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is hands down, Governor Dean. His philosophy about grading is what every Yale professor should aspire to replicate, and so is the level of care he shows to each and every one of his students. Other strengths include office hours held at the Creperie, conversations with experts such as Samantha Powers, and the infamous NSC stimulation. As to the weaknesses of the course, I really can't think of any. But, if I had to choose, it would be the fact that I cannot take the course again.",
    "Strengths: very experienced, engaging, and knowledgeable professor; topics are very relevant and important; NSC simulation and guest lecturers\/speakers; enjoyed writing the final group paper which allowed me to learn from my classmates and delve deeper into the topic \r\nWeaknesses: long, difficult readings (hard to determine what to focus on\/what was most important to take away from the readings); students had varying levels of background knowledge so sometimes material was hard to understand"

   "comments": [
    "Without a doubt. If you can get in, take it. Prof. Dean is amazing (really cares about his students, and ensuring that you get the most you can out of the class), there isn't that much work but when there is some it's interesting and engaging. Definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes! Professor Dean is incredible, the readings, the class visitors, and the discussions are incredibly insightful. You will learn so much about the politics of American foreign policy, how the political discourse impacts policy decisions.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course if you can get in. Governor Dean is one of the best professors I have had.",
    "Yes.  Gov Dean is awesome",
    "Yes! Take it if you get in! The content was definitely interesting, but the diversity of thought from the students as well as Deans expertise made me excited to go to class every Friday morning.",
    "Yes, great 5th course!",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes good class",
    "Definitely yes! While there's a lot of reading, the assignments aren't too bad and the class (and Gov Dean) is really interesting, and you gain so many perspectives on various foreign policy issues.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Dean is an incredible mentor and I've really appreciated all of the more real-life oriented skills I've taken away from this class, especially as someone interested in working in foreign policy in the future.",
    "100%. This course was a great introduction to the recent history of American foreign policy and we had fun discussions.",
    "If you can get in, YES!",
    "Yes! If you have the opportunity to take this class with Governor Dean, you should. He has a first-hand perspective and brings his personal experiences to every class. He is dedicated to his students and the class and is excited about teaching. He also is very approachable and accessible to students so definitely meet with him or go to his office hours if you can."
