   "comments": [
    "I learned how to watch and interpret movies, as well as so much about 20th century Latin American cinema and history.",
    "The course provided us with a strong overview of several key radical Latin American films, with a really strong emphasis on the historical contexts of the films and the relevance of what we were studying to current movements in Latin America",
    "The skill to analyze cinema and the skill to think of political movements through a real historical sense.",
    "I had never taken a film course before so I quickly learned the vocabulary and means of analysis for film. Also a greater historical knowledge of Latin American political movements.",
    "Radical filmmaking, recent Latin American history",
    "Prior to this class, I had never taken a film course. This course was such a gift in so many ways. Professor Fradinger is absolutely brilliant, and we covered so much ground in terms of film history and Latin American history throughout the semester. I feel much more confident in my ability to evaluate film and discuss film in an academic context. I also learned a great deal of historical knowledge about the political history of various Latin American countries.",
    "I learned so much about Latin America and Latin American history! Getting to learn about all the different directors and political motivations was truly fascinating and eye opening.",
    "It grants students the ability to understand and analyze complex filmography. Encourages critical thinking and makes the students voice their opinions and defend their own arguments. You also gain a comprehensive view of Latin American politics from the past century and a lot of insights into anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist movements in the continent.",
    "In this course I learned how cinema was used as a tool of revolution in Latin America, I developed an understanding of the techniques filmmakers use to transmit message to their audience and how we can critique these stylistic choices as well."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Moira and the TAs are incredible. The movies are absolutely spellbinding, and watching them is so enthralling. The workload is light: one comment on Canvas each week, one midterm presentation (for the Spanish speaking section), one class presentation, and one final research paper. The class discussions are very provocative and lively, and the mix of undergrads and grad students is very nice. The most difficult part about the class is the sheer amount of time it takes up: having to attend screenings from 7-11 on Mondays is pretty brutal - but definitely worth it.",
    "The course is definitely a large time commitment, but in all the course was excellent, with really engaging class discussions that really emphasized the relevance\/implications of the material we studied",
    "The strengths are, among many other things, the style of the seminars, the films, the supplemental readings, and the way the course is structured so that students learn from each other. Only possible weakness might be that the screenings can take a while but if a student is committed that shouldnt really be a problem.",
    "Strengths: everything\r\nWeaknesses: grad students at times taking over seminar",
    "Everyone is very invested, interesting material, Moira knows a lot, community surrounding the course",
    "The only weakness would be the long screenings on Monday nights, but I dont see an alternative to this issue. All of the films are valuable and I couldnt imagine skipping any for the sake of a shorter class. They are definitely worth your attention and time.",
    "This course is truly one of a kind at Yale. It is a unique and unforgettable experience for the student. You'll see films that you've probably never seen in your life and that you would never see otherwise, some of which are real hidden gems. The conversations and dialogues after the films are the best part, every student adds so much value to the class by sharing their thoughts. My only suggestion would be better control of time so that we could take more advantage of the class' length.",
    "This course becomes a great time commitment as there are many long nights of film screenings, and many film were produced in clandestinity and are difficult to access outside of the allotted class time, so if you are an undergrad juggling many classes and extracurriculars be aware. However this should not discourage you as it is a worthwhile commitment, I only wish that more students who are not of \"leftist\" or \"radical\" backgrounds would take this class, I think they would learn something and it would certainly make for even more heated debates."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. This may be the best class I have taken at Yale. You will get a chance to watch unbelievable films that you otherwise will probably never see in your life. Moira is fantastic, zany, hilarious, brilliant - and she always pushes back on people's statements, which creates a high standard of intellectual rigor in the class. Class discussion is always lively and sophisticated: everyone has a lot to learn and is encouraged to participate, whether they are an expert on Latin America or know nothing at all about the region. This is maybe the only class at Yale I wish I could take AGAIN - if only that were possible!",
    "I'd recommend this to any student who stops and wonders why they're at Yale. Your perspective on the world will change, and you will learn so much about the history and politics of Latin America in the 1960s - especially now that, as Moira says, \"The global south is rising up again!\"",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student that is interested in film\/Latin American history",
    "yes, if you can handle very long screenings (especially for undregrads)",
    "Absolutely, given that they have a reasonable amount of patience and are not afraid to try new things. I would recommend this course even to someone who has no interest in radicals, cinema, or Latin America because you will become interested in a matter of weeks. The course is so much more than a film course.",
    "Yes, but only if they are committed to the time it takes up, it is a life changing course.",
    "Yes! Very unique course",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes! This class is so interesting and fun and unusual! Its great for all majors",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Latin American history and the involvement of world powers in the region. For film lovers, the class is great as well.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student. My biology lectures went in one ear and out the other, but this class will stick with me for years to come. When I look back on my Yale experience I am certain that this course will be one of my fondest memories as my peers were highly intelligent, passionate and engaged individuals who brought their lived experiences to the table, and Profesora Moira only added to the camaraderie of the classroom as she encouraged us all to share our thoughts, even if we did not have a film\/Latin American background. This class will make you think about the past present and future, indignity, feminism, revolution, your position at Yale, and so much more, so if your tired of being in classes with students who appear to be devoid of any social context take this class and awaken your political consciousness."
