            "comments": [
                "This class covered a lot of interesting material but lacked a cohesive structure, making it difficult to understand concepts.",
                "Strengths: deliberate pauses during lectures to ask for questions, detailed summaries of what is and isn't important, important slides marked, lecture notes posted to Canvas -- all of these organizational features are surprisingly difficult to find among professors and make such a big difference for students. Additionally, I really liked the small group work/pair work during discussion sections. I also really appreciated the emphasis on understanding and intuition rather than memorization, as well as the generous partial credit he would give for an answer that used correct reasoning, even if it wasn't what he was going for.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course was a bit low-engagement. Aside from the pauses to ask for questions, lectures were 50 minutes of Professor Crabtree reading from a slide deck (which, to be fair, is true of most lecture courses). I wish that there had been more opportunities to work through problems as a group, or participation problems during classes, asking questions to the class for us to answer, etc. That being said, discussion section definitely provided a lot of that engagement. The other weakness would be the vague grading scheme. I had confidence that Professor Crabtree would work out the grades in a way that benefited us, but getting conflicting messages about whether or not the number grades matter and being told that the curve was based on class rank without having any way of knowing what that class rank was definitely created a lot of stress for me.\r\n\r\nI don't want any of this to come across as if I didn't enjoy this course. Professor Crabtree cares deeply about making great scientists out of his students. It's evident from the way he focuses on intuition over memorization, the way he taught us to avoid errors in our science, and the way that he gave generous partial credit to any answer that makes sense -- he wanted to reward good thought. I'm glad I got to take his course before he retires.",
                "The strengths of this course are, in my opinion, the sheer amount of material discussed and the wide variety of topics that are presented. I greatly enjoyed learning about organometallic and metallic chemistry, a topic which I had largely never seen before. The course is taught through PowerPoint slides, which makes locating the material much easier for problem sets and discussion sections. The professor, TA, and peer tutor were all very helpful and available outside of class time.",
                "A lot of material",
                "The information is poorly structured. Grading is stressful and harsh. Exams are so random",
                "In some sense, the strength and weakness of the course are the same: the material covered is very broad and\r\ncomprehensive, which is very intriguing and really allows students to explore the di!erent facets of inorganic\r\nchemistry (and perhaps research directions, especially when the Prof and TA are open to discuss their own\r\nexperiences) but also makes the course in some ways harder (to study for at least) than a higher level inorganic\r\nchemistry course. Then the individual student experience may be rather dependent on the TA and the study groups\r\nthat they form before or throughout the course.",
                "The course had a good balance between concepts and applications. I would have liked to have learned more about environmental applications of inorganic chemistry, such as water oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction.",
                "It was nice that it was recorded because I was able to go back and rewatch parts that I did not understand. The lecture format was overall extremely difficult to follow and would have been nice if it was more interactive. The way material was presented was so confusing that it made me confused about topics that were being retaught from previous chemistry courses that I already knew well. In the end I ended up trying to ignore what was taught in this class and go back to the way I had previously perceived the material.",
                "The lecture was not very engaging due to the virtual format and the slides were a bit hard to understand at times -- more practice of the material would have been very helpful.",
                "The discussion sections were very helpful for thinking of the lessons in a different way, and the lectures were done the same way. No weaknesses."

                "I love having recorded lectures posted to watch multiple times -- it really helps me learn. Other aspects of the course stayed largely the same. Professor Crabtree noted at one point that he got through his material in less lectures than normal because on a zoom with everyone's camera off and no interaction between him and the students, the material goes much more quickly. He added that he normally tells jokes, which he eliminated this semester as they are hard to tell over zoom -- I mourn the loss of what I'm sure are some excellent Crabtree jokes!!",
                "Not very effective over zoom. Pace of class was different from regular semester which hindered learning",
                "Success: The in person live components (with lecture being recorded, and section/office hour not) were really helpful\r\nfor this class in particularly for the students to stay engaged. It helped understanding and collaboration in lot of\r\ninstances (especially as some of the questions that people might have are class-specific as the Prof. has his own\r\ndefinitions and notations sometimes);\r\n\r\nImprovement: Practically nobody had camera on during lecture, and the Prof. had to turn theirs o! sometimes\r\nbecause of wi# bandwidth issues at home, so (as the Prof. re\"ects as well) the pace of the class was particularly fast\r\nbecause there was no eye contact or looking at how fast people are taking notes to slow down (and reduced the\r\namount of stories). We #nished the material almost four classes before previous years.",

                "I really did enjoy this course. I found inorganic chemistry more rigorous than organic -- there's a level of attention to detail and wanting to explain exactly how a phenomenon comes about that is sometimes replaced by hand-waving in organic lectures. Professor Crabtree is incredibly knowledgeable and cares deeply about the topic as well.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student; I think in past years, this class may have not received the rating it fully deserved. The course does review the essential topics of inorganic chemistry, and explores catalytic mechanisms, which I found the highlight of the semester. I greatly enjoyed my time in Professor Crabtree's class, and would highly recommend it to anyone considering the chemistry major. The reality is that he is retiring and thus will not be teaching the course in the future; I imagine it will be taught differently in the future. I will speak to the material: it is super interesting! We basically went through (almost) every chapter of Professor Crabtree's book, occasionally skipping over a few topics or concepts. I found his book very clear, and a great reinforcement of the material. A great class to take if you are interested in the chemistry major, wanting to determine whether to pursue chemistry, or simply interested in metals and catalysis.",
                "Not unless you have to. It wasnt that interesting and didnt provide too much value",
                "Most of the class is Chemistry majors (or at least strongly intended), though there are occasional Chemical\r\nEngineering majors in the class (unfortunately I don't think it wold count towards the degree). I do think the course is\r\nvery good for anyone interested related #elds especially bio-inorganics and materials sciences! (This being said, the\r\ncourse design and coverage will likely change in the future as it will be a di!erent Prof.)",
                "Yes. If the student has an interest in inorganic chemistry, this course is a relatively rigorous introduction to it without an overly demanding workload.",

I think that in different circumstances this could be a very interesting class, but this semester was just tough. However, if you already have a strong background in chemistry and are prepared to do some self-teaching then it could be a good class to take.",
