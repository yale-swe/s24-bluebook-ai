   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Solidworks, Matlab",
    "Solidworks, finite element analysis, computer graphics",
    "Learned Solidworks design and analysis. Incredibly useful skill! Helped me more quickly prototype for other classes and projects.",
    "This class almost exclusively used solidworks, a computer program used for engineering design. This meant it definitely forced you to think more creatively than your typical PSet and midterm\/final style class. Using CAD was a new experience for me as the last time I used a program like this was in high school.",
    "This course is a fantastic introduction to solidworks. We covered sketching and modeling techniques as well as advanced static, buckling, thermal, and fluid flow simulations.",
    "You will learn and develop great skills for best practices in Solidworks modeling and simulation. I got to design (and 3D print) a robotic spider for my final project, which was super cool!",
    "I now feel comfortable using SolidWorks to create 3D parts and assemblies and perform basic finite element, motion, and flow analyses. I also enjoyed learning a bit about the history of hardware and software development and gaining some background knowledge on how computer graphics work.",
    "I learned about CAD software and finite element analysis, both in principle and in practice. I became proficient in Solidworks, successfully modeling and analyzing complex systems. I also gained a basic understanding of computational geometry.",
    "I learned an extensive amount about SolidWorks.",
    "Great class, CAD is very important to the major. I wish this class were available for lower classmen",
    "This course taught me, first and foremost, how to use SolidWorks effectively for design, modeling, and simulation. Before this course, I was very inexperienced in SolidWorks, so having this course allowed me to have a more solid approach to using the software, which is crucial in mechanical engineering design. The course also included material on computer graphics and the evolution of computer graphics over time, but that was not the main takeaway or motivation for me taking this course.",
    "I learned a lot about how to use Solidworks and Matlab, and what goes into computer design programs."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The weakness of this course is the lack of assistance in the weekly assignments. There were a lot of nights where I spent three hours trying to fix something that had been mentioned--but not explained--in class. I wish there were some sort of assignment guidelines that were distributed to help students make it through the assignments, as they took plenty long without the silly obstacles that were sometimes encountered.",
    "all strengths! the lectures were clear, homework was very well designed to really learn the material, and material is interesting",
    "Professor Long is an incredible professor! He explains things clearly in class and always answers questions in class, office hours or even via email.",
    "Going though examples in class was definitely useful for getting the hang of how solidworks actually works. One thing that might improve the class is creating a \"cheat sheet\" that helps people with understanding some of the many many many functions of solidworks that are needed in order to create useful designs.",
    "This course was fantastic. The only thing I would suggest for improvement is more emphasis on modeling real life objects (rather than so much design) and more parametric modeling.",
    "It is encouraged in class to follow along with Prof Long as he goes through the Solidworks examples, but in reality my best advice would be to watch him go through the examples and take notes on what tools and functions he is using. It's very difficult to remember just what settings you should turn on to get your simulations to work appropriately. Also, having a TA would be VERY useful, for more office hours than just Long's limited offerings.",
    "Strengths: This class provided a great overview of SolidWorks capabilities for modeling, assembly, and analysis. I liked that there were a few Matlab assignments to break up our SolidWorks and teach us how to implement basic finite element methods and 3D graphics projections. The exams were low-stress and helped reinforce the concepts we learned during class and in our homework assignments. The final project was an awesome way to explore an area of personal interest, and it was really cool to see what other people in the class ended up designing and even prototyping. Prof. Long was also very willing to help after class and during office hours. Weaknesses: It was sometimes hard to follow along and stay engaged with in-class demonstrations on SolidWorks. As someone who hasnt done any CAD before, these demonstrations usually moved really fast; I liked that Prof. Long posted all of his files on Canvas afterwards, but it would have been helpful to also have some written instructions, links to tutorial websites\/videos, etc.",
    "This course was an excellent and comprehensive introduction to SolidWorks - I wish the class focused a little less on history of the industry and the theory behind the software.",
    "Great class, well organized and syllabus is a good overview of solidworks.\r\n\r\nWould maybe like to work more on assemblies to get a little faster and learn all the tricks to it",
    "I wish that this course could have been offered earlier in the curriculum, because these skills could have been put to use in other courses in the curriculum. That being said, it would be difficult with the 21 person cap, which was useful so that every student could have a computer to follow along with the practice material in class. Professor Long did a great job with teaching techniques in class and making sure we understood what tools he was using, although he worked quite quickly so it was difficult to keep up if something went awry. Additionally, while the background material on computer graphics was important, I don't feel as though it was truly fundamental to this course, and I had wished that the time dedicated to that material would have instead been allocated to more SolidWorks learnings.",
    "The course was taught well and left a lot of freedom to the student. I think this class was pretty perfect for what it was meant for."

   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn solidworks, this is a great way to do it. You will put in a lot of hours and be very frustrated at times, so I would not suggest this course on top of a heavy-workload schedule. However, all those hours will pay off and you will have gained a great understanding of the capabilities of the program and how to implement them.",
    "Yes! CAE\/CAD is such a useful skill and this class does a great job of teaching it",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It will undoubtedly be useful for the major or anything in engineering generally, and just a great skill to have. As long as you attend lecture and take notes, you'll be able to do the pset's and leave the class knowing how to use Solidworks proficiently.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Solidworks is a really cool program and this class is always really tough to get into because it's so popular. The only thing bad is sometimes solidworks crashes or the computer can't deal with how big the files are, both of which can lead to some extremely frustrating situations.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn SolidWorks.",
    "Yes, absolutely!",
    "Yes, this is a great class if youre looking to develop useful skills that have real-world applications! Some of the homework assignments and the final project can be extremely time-consuming, especially if you dont have any background in SolidWorks, but youll walk away with a solid foundation and understanding about the programs various capabilities. You also do not have to be in MechE to take this class. I took this class as a BME major, and after years of taking classes that mostly focused on biology and theories, I really enjoyed the opportunity this class gave me to gain hands-on experience with a more practical engineering skill.",
    "I strongly recommend this course to any mechanical or biomedical engineering major. Even though I had a substantial background in CAD, I learned a tremendous amount in this course. Ultimately, I would say it gave me a new perspective on engineering, and it may have altered my career path (in a good way.) Sometimes you tear your hair out a little when you're working on the psets. However, when you're done you realize you've learned some both fascinating and useful.",
    "Yes! It's probably the most useful course you'll take at Yale",
    "Yes! Great class, well balanced, and what you learn is key if you want to work as an engineer",
    "Would absolutely recommend to any student who needs to have a better understanding of SolidWorks, or wants to improve their design technique with SolidWorks. It functions as a great teaching course in this sense, and allows you to have a lot of practice in SolidWorks. Of course, this class is most useful to MechE and potentially other design students.",
    "Yes, for any engineer it is an essential course for industry work. Also useful for 3D printing."
