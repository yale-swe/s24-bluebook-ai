                "Department needs more guidelines\/aid. A bit too loose imo. Entire experience was dictated by professor and own personal initiative.",
                "Strengths: you get to conduct an independent research project with a professor of your choice. A lot of schools don't have this as a major requirement, so it's cool to get the chance to do something like this.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: CSEC 491 is extremely unstructured. Over the course of the semester, we got very little guidance on what to do - we were kind of expected to figure it out ourselves. There were only a couple emails sent out the whole year reminding us of deadlines, but they didn't contain any information or advice on how to find an advisor, etc. Compared to the CS Senior Project, which is a lot more structured (actually has a synchronous class meeting time, has more helpful resources on the website and through emails, has more intermediate deadlines to keep you on track instead of just the final project deadline), for the CSEC final project, you're pretty much just left on your own to figure things out.",
                "There should be more guidance, support, and standardization in the course. It would be super helpful to help students plan their projects in the preceding semester."

                "You have to take it for the major. I would recommend looking into finding an advisor early though because who your advisor is makes a huge impact on your experience (are they chill? do you find their area of research interesting?), and it can be stressful when the deadline to find an advisor is coming up and you haven't found one yet. The CSEC department website has some information\/guidelines for the project, but it's just the bare minimum and isn't actually that helpful. You should look at the emails and resources sent out from CS 490 to get advice on how to get started with your project. The process for conducting your senior project is basically the same, but unlike CSEC 491, CS 490 actually sends out resources on how to get started, how to find an advisor, how to pick a research topic, etc. Just search your email for CPSC 490. Good luck!",
                "URGENT ADVICE:\r\ndon't take this major. You're more likely to have a better GPA, impress employers, and have more free time if you just double major in Computer Science and Economics. Don't take the joint major. Just double. All my friends who doubled have better GPAs and have more time on their hands than the ones who chose to take the joint major. The joint major is a scam. Avoid at all costs.\r\n\r\nTLDR: you want good job and good GPA? Then double major in CS and Econ. Otherwise, take the joint major."
