                "This class gives you a really in-depth view of the development, usage, theory and dynamics surrounding Nuclear Weapons. The first half of the class is mostly spent discussing the evolution of the US's postures towards on nuclear politics from Hiroshima and Nagasaki to present day. Imbedded in each lecture are various leaders' approaches towards nuclear weapons and theories of the nuclear revolution. The fundamental question is: have nuclear weapons engendered an era of peace? To what extent are we experiencing a nuclear taboo? How have different US leaders envisioned nuclear weapons within their defense strategy? The second of the half is more theory based. Including all the different strategies of nuclear states, how do states get nuclear weapons? Why or why not are they successful?",
                "I learned a lot about the history of nuclear weapons and how the discipline of nuclear politics has evolved over time.",
                "I learned about the nuclear revolution, famous theories by leading political scientist like Thomas Schelling, and about main events such as the Cuban Missile Crises, India and Pakistan, and many events important to American politics.",
                "Aside from skills particular to the course, I definitely refined my PoliSci-specific writing style.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The class is well-organized and easy to follow. You get an in-depth view of nuclear politics that will make you the educated enough to speak well on the topic and form a deeper understanding of current politics surrounding nuclear politics. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like it gets a little drawn out. There were times in the semester where I wondered how much more can be said about this topic? My biggest issue with the class is the structure of the grading. Most of the assignments are ridiculously graded on a scale of 15 points where each part of the rubric counts for .25 of a point? It feels utterly arbitrary and unnecessary. If you do SOLID work: you could still get a 13/15 which is the equivalent of a 86? Also, the reading responses -- which are effectively 5 page essays -- cumulate to only 15% of grade while the midterm and final, which are rushed versions of the reading responses count for double. Shouldn't the emphasis be placed on our thoughtful, well-timed, well-researched work, rather than the make-shift arguments we can construct in an hour or two. The grading percentages and rubrics need to be reworked BIG TIME.",
                "Remove the lecture participation component and use sections. I was confused by the participation component and felt I could not express myself in the lecture. It seems like a good idea, but in reality, a section has much better debate and much more discussion.",
                "Professor Debs clearly put a lot of work into his lectures and the assignments. The content was presented in a clear and well-organized manner. In terms of weaknesses, I feel as though the assignments did not really align well with how the course was taught. The memos, midterm, debate statement, and final were all centered around making arguments about nuclear politics. However, the lectures presented us with very granular historical content (dates, theories, events, etc.), which seems more conducive for taking tests that require memorization. I felt that the lectures did not provide me with the skills to successfully complete the assignments.",
                "The course itself is very strong and unique. However the grading isnt at the same level as the rest of the course and very inconsistent with the course.",
                "Material was really interesting, but I felt as though lecture was not the best in terms of facilitating discussion because the class was so big. For a class without section to have participation being part of your grade, I thought that it was difficult to really speak in class.",
                "I like Professor Debs a lot, and the material was interesting (though sometimes in the middle when you're just reviewing different scholars' theories regarding different topics, it can get a little sluggish). Overall, though, the assignments were sometimes frustrating. The weight of the assignments was very drastic: one take home midterm and one final made up 70% of the grade, which meant that the other writing assignments you do throughout the semester are hardly significant, which didn't really match how they felt. The debate assignment was also particularly frustrating. The groups were formed before the midterm, which meant that many people dropped or credit-D'd the class by the time the writing assignment came around, and this screwed some groups over. The whole idea of a group debate was nice, but the fact that you're graded on a group WRITING assignment was very frustrating - group projects are hard enough, but writing an academic style assignment with partners proves very difficult and frustrating for grading. This was one of the only unpleasant experiences I had in the class. I also think that having a discussion portion of lecture was a great idea, but I found it a little frustrating that there was a participation portion of the grade - it was often difficult to make any good / unique points in the midst of a knowledgeable group of students, so I found myself forcing myself to say very average things, just with participation in mind.",
                "Strength- engaging professor, interesting material. \r\nWeakness- you can get away without doing the readings in class, which encouraged many people not to do them. But then again, if you don't do the readings it's hard to get by the exams, so maybe it's a self-correcting system.",
                "Strengths - interesting subject, good professor\r\nWeaknesses - attempts to have discussions in a lecture, a lot of writing",
                "The information is well presented and interesting, but a discussion is impossible among 40 students at once. I would consider breaking the class into smaller groups to discuss concepts so that everyone gets a chance to have a conversation every time.",
                "I think this class is very well structured. Id say my only recommendation would be to increase the grade percentage of the Debate Statement assignment. It felt like a lot of work, especially to do right before a final. Maybe if it was worth more in the final grade, and made the final worth a little less?",
                "Strengths: This class provided a lot of information on a topic I hadn't given much thought to previously. I also liked the debate assignment. Weaknesses: The participation part of this class confused me since I wasn't entirely sure how it was being scored. Additionally, I felt like it was a big ask to require participation in such a large class with such complicated material. I found it difficult to formulate something to add to the discussion, and often when I did, I wouldn't be called on since so many other people were trying to talk. The biggest feedback I have for the class is to provide more historical context in lectures/reading to help students understand the events we were talking about. I have studied a lot of American history but struggled to recall niche details about Cold War events and felt like proper explanations/resources had to be found outside of class.",
                "Strengths are the professor and the lecture format. Weaknesses are that there is no discussion section to better explain course themes and the discussions at the end of class are not class discussions but rather individual answers to questions posed."

                "I really want to recommend this class to another student. I wanted to like it. I think that Debs is a good guy and smart professor. The content is interesting and engaging.  But the grading system and amount of work really discourages me to do so. I appreciate the professors need to give homework over the break, but I had (no joke) two separate essays, 5 pages and 15 pages respectively due the Monday we returned. That's just ridiculous. There is no reason to give kids a massive memo due the day they get back from Thanksgiving, it really ruined my quality time with my family. Yale college limits students from writing more than 25 pages a semester. In this class we had two 5 page essays, a 15 page memo, a 5 page midterm and a 10 page final. It is unnecessary and excessive, especially considering the ridiculous grading. As a student who received high marks in the class, I had my partners for my memo project CREDIT D before the memo was due, leaving me to complete the entire 15 page project by myself. If the work load, allocation of percentages and rubric for assignments for the class are changed, then I have no problem. I think the error is on the TAs, but it is unclear.",
                "No, this course was very political science heavy, and not very interdisciplinary. This was my own doing, as I simply realized I did not like the content. Professor Debs is clearly a leading expert in this field though, so it was still quite interesting.",
                "This class is boring to many people, but I enjoyed the subject matter. Professor Debs is a nice man who really is excellent in his field. Given the narrow scope of the class, you really get a good grasp on the body of literature in the semester. Many people found the lectures dry but I enjoyed them.",
                "If you are interested in nuclear politics, but not majoring in political science or global affairs, I would recommend this course but to Credit/D/Fail it. That way, you won't have to stress about the hefty writing assignments and can just enjoy attending the lectures, which are quite engaging.",
                "I would recommend this course to students interested in international relations. It is very niche and could be boring to those uninterested.",
                "I would. Some may disagree but I thought this class was really insightful and I learned a lot about the history and development of nuclear power and weapons. If the subject itself sounds boring or dry to you, you aren't going to be amazed by this class but if you do have some interest, then I would definitely recommend.",
                "Yes, but it's definitely a no-frills political science course. Lecture is mostly interesting, but in the middle of the semester you find yourself just reviewing several different scholars' theories, and it can get a little sluggish. There is no section, which means there is a fun and interesting discussion portion of each lecture. However, this also means you don't get any face-time with TF's or Professor Debs, which can make properly engaging with / understanding the materials a little challenging. The mid-term and final were very heavily weighed for my semester, so make sure you meet with TF's beforehand to make sure you are well prepared.",
                "Yes, I would. Engaging class without too much workload, and no exams (just take-home essays).",
                "yes",
                "It's a fairly interesting course that isn't critically challenging. Debs is a great professor and speaker, and the material is fairly modern. If you have a deep interest in the topic, this class might not be a whole lot of new information, but Debs does a good job of framing the class through multiple lenses.",
                "If youre willing to do the readings and put in the work on the assignments, then yes. Definitely not a gut or an easy A, but also not impossible to do well either. If youre interested in the material, Id say go for it!",
                "If you have a lot of background knowledge about Cold War politics and find foreign policy/nuclear weapons super interesting, then this might be a good course to take. However, in general, this is not a course I would recommend. The course wasn't super well organized, and the lectures were not the most engaging. Much of the content was supposed to be learned through student discussion, but I would have appreciated that material being in the lecture or reading instead. I did not enjoy the topics in the response memos and found feedback on them pretty sparse. This course also seemed to require a lot of background knowledge which I lacked, making it hard to follow and learn.",
