   "comments": [
    "Learned about a variety of topics that I didn't know much about before! Lots of engaging conversation and debate with the topics.",
    "I've learned to think twice about assumptions about my body that I once thought were obvious and how to think differently about problems by taking them to extremes and by making analogies.",
    "Extremely interesting readings and class discussions. The material definitely made me change how I think about who owns a body and the different meanings and intents behind these ownerships.",
    "to be really critical of our own preconceived notions and understanding of pressing social issues; to consider how we would pragmatically effect social change in a post-apocalyptic world.",
    "I gained a whole new perspective on the ways in which we view the body. This course really challenged me to understand how society portrays the body and to compare and contrast that to my opinions in a variety of contexts.",
    "I learned about various legal issues regarding the body (i.e. fetal rights, transablism, genetic modification, etc.) via readings provided by dean L. In class, we had discussion of the reading as well as trying to debate some of the issues that come up. From this course I learned to think a little more carefully and thoughtfully about both sides of issues regarding the body.",
    "How to think creatively about the body, rather than just accepting preconceived societal notions.",
    "I learned how to fathom and approach controversial topics. I used to think that it could be quite difficult and may not worth the trouble to discuss such controversial topics other people and would avoid such discussion. However, dean L had provided us with such a safe place for us where we could unpack a lot of implicit pre-assumptions and face our own underlying biases. This was good practice for us.",
    "Opened my perspective about the ownership of ones body. Came in with a firm view, left with skills to question and explore different perspectives and instances of body ownership. Amazing class.",
    "Love this class. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "No weaknesses! Strengths were the quality of the in-class conversations, flexibility in assignments, and the readings (they were all super interesting and I actually looked forward to reading them)!",
    "The paper deadlines were very flexible which can be either a blessing or a curse based on what kind of person you are!",
    "This is by far one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. It is an incredibly relaxed, enjoyable learning environment. Professor Lizarribar is absolutely incredible; she completely understands that not only are we students, we are people with lives where sometimes things come up. The course is a fascinating survey of how we consider the body through multiple lenses: medically, biologically, religiously, etc. How do we think about organ donation and transplants? What do we want from legislation surrounding sex work? Are we ok with bodily mutilation and transableism? This course will force you to think about issues you may have never truly considered.",
    "Dean L is a very engaging and great person. The class is a very safe space, and Dean L always wants you to be as stress-free as possible and is a great person and professor. The seminar format of this class makes it so that you'll have to be ready to discuss, debate, and complicate topics that come up in the class. This is great if you're passionate about the readings, but if you're not that interested in the discussion, the weekly two-hour class discussion will feel very long. \r\n\r\nWe also have two papers that Dean L gives us a lot of time to write and very flexible deadlines, but they should be started before they're due and you should get a little done every week on them. Also talk to Dean L about whatever you're writing about and she'll be really insightful and helpful.",
    "Strengths: Dean L is so nice and funny and really crafted a warm, welcoming environment for us to engage in every week. The readings were SO interesting and spanned such a diverse array of topics and mediums. I like that we were able to pick and choose what and how we wanted to learn; that freedom is so hard to come by with yale courses. \r\nWeaknesses: as much as i loved the freedom of it all, it was a little overwhelming to try and come up with our own topics\/deadlines\/mediums. Would recommend a little more guidance\/structure on that front next year.",
    "The class was a seminar, but a bit too large to hold a genuinely open and comfortable conversation.",
    "The strengths of the course are that it takes away unnecessary anxiety off of the students so that the students can actually focus on the material. There have been many courses that were designed to make students overly competitive and anxious to the point that it hindered learning. However, the class taught by dean L was one of the most effective courses that delivered the content to the students and pushed the students to try their very best in a very supportive environment.",
    "Strengths: all\r\nWeaknesses: none"

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class! Dean L is brilliant and a great discussion leader. The readings are truly enjoyable and the workload is pretty low (Dean L is very flexible with deadlines). Overall a great class!",
    "Absolutely, amazing class if you have the chance to take it!",
    "Absolutely! An amazing class with interesting topics that you probably can't find in any other Yale course. Loved having a chance to pick the brains of my peers and have exciting debates.",
    "Yes. If you can get in, yes. This may be the best course I've taken at Yale. The class is basically just fascinating readings that you get together and discuss and argue about once a week. It's not too much work and doesn't really feel like any because the readings are so interesting and the discussions are so engaging. Dean L is absolutely wonderful (if a little busy with her outside work as dean) and really cares about her students being engaged and doing well and caring about the material. Absolutely, take this course.",
    "If you want to take a very interesting class with a relaxed atmosphere with an amazing professor, absolutely take this class.",
    "Absolutely. If you can get in (usually restricted to Juniors and Seniors) this is a phenomenal course that's worth taking because of Dean L alone.",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this course to another student. Its one of my favorite classes that Ive taken at Yale. The subject is super interesting and, as a science student it has made me think in new ways. Dean L really cares about us learning and enjoying the material and it shows. The workload mostly consists of readings, which in some weeks can be long, but these all prepare for weekly discussions on topics ranging from the body as property to zombies.",
    "yes - esp if you need a writing\/humanites credit. If you're interested in law regarding the body, this is the course for you. further, dean L is amazing!",
    "YES!!",
    "Highly recommend! Really interesting class with a very kind and understanding professor who really involves herself in class discussions in an appropriate way. I would just say that to be really involved in the course, you should actually do the readings (which can be long). The class makes up for that by having virtually no assignments except two papers (which can be combined into one longer paper).",
    "If you can get into the course, yes. It is very hard to secure a spot in this course, but I think this course is a must-take for Yalies.",
    "Yes. Dean L is an amazing professor and person and made me look forward to the class every week."
