            "comments": [
                "I really liked the async format, and I think it was the biggest strength of the course by far. I also really enjoyed the discussion sessions. One thing I would improve is making the problem sets a little bit more engaging, on a few of them I felt like i was not learning that much.",
                "Strength: I really enjoyed watching the recorded lectures; if I missed something, I could simply rewind the recording and re-watch it until I felt that I understood. The mini-quizzes at the end of each recorded lecture were a really helpful way for me to check my understanding (and I appreciated that we had infinite attempts, so that the mini-quizzes were stress-free). \r\n\r\nWeakness: I actually think I could have benefitted from more mini-quizzes throughout each lecture. Normally a lecture would have at least a few important concepts to learn, and just one or two mini-quiz questions that didn't touch on all the concepts. Obviously, there doesn't need to be a mini-quiz for every single thing we learn, but maybe one question per key concept would be nice. \r\n\r\nStrength: The discussion sections were a great way of ensuring that I could understand the week's paper, and also a good place where I could ask questions about general concepts from the course. \r\n\r\nStrength: I really enjoyed doing the final project. Studying one protein, learning how key concepts from the course applied to that protein, and reading primary research papers (or review papers) was a great way for me to solidify my knowledge of biology. I liked that it was divided into separate benchmarks that we got feedback on every week, and that the actualy final submission was relatively low-stress. I also liked that this project could be adjusted for each individual student's prior experience with biology.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Occasionally on the weekly quizzes, there would be a question that felt like it wasn't really about learning a key concept, it was just about memorizing a fact, one that I had no way of knowing beforehand that I would be required to memorize. For example, knowing whether transcription/translation goes in the 5' or 3' direction in quiz 3, or knowing the number of genes in humans not present in chimpanzees for quiz 6.",
                "I really enjoyed the asynchronous aspect of lectures, allowing me time to pause and review concepts as much as I needed, and the Ed discussions allowed me to ask questions whenever I did not understand. However, some of the videos were edited or cut off in many places, which made some topics harder to understand. Redoing, or editing those portions of the videos would greatly improve the lectures.",
                "Strengths: The asynchronous format is really nice since you can watch the videos at your own pace before the middle of the week and then have time to do the weekly homework, benchmark, and prepare for the next week's quiz. I think that the workload was really well spread out through the week because of this, and the course was really well-organized. I also really liked how you could drop one thing in each category since it made the grading portion of the course a lot less stressful. Additionally, I really liked the final project since I was able to become more confident in reading scientific papers and scientific writing!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the quizzes were a little weirdly graded. One of them had two \"select all that fit\" questions that were worth like 5 points each for a 20 point quiz while others were more spread out in point distribution with 9 questions each worth 1-2 points so that you didn't bomb the quiz by missing one question.",
                "There are no strengths to this course. Like all STEM courses at Yale it is taught in a way that is not conducive to learning. The lectures did not prepare students remotely for the weekly quizzes nor did they provide much aid on problem sets.",
                "Very well-organized and structured. Final project a bit boring.",
                "I enjoyed the lack of emphasis on memorization and regurgitation through this class. We understood while we were learning the importance and application of concepts rather than just told to \"learn the facts.\" The online lectures were a lot of content, however, and I felt stressed about studying for the synchronous quizzes. I do understand their importance so I am not sure what I would actually alter about those aspects.",
                "Strengths: was very manageable and expectations were clear\r\nWeaknesses: very virtual, which made it difficult to engage with. Felt like \"checking boxes\"",
                "Strengths were the format of discussion sections and weaknesses were the lectures being taught asynchronous.",
                "I like that the lectures are asynchronous, and that discussion sections help us either clarify the information or apply the unit to a different situation. I did have trouble with the wording of questions on several quizzes, many times it felt that the questions were unclear in either the background information provided or the even the question being asked. Many times, I found myself spending a lot of time trying to figure out the particular question being asked.",
                "For me, the only real difficulty was financial. I really struggled to find a way to pay for the textbook (I hadn't put it into my budget for school books before the start of the semester - I only put 'one' textbook for BIOL, and I think it was the BIOL 102 one. I had to pay for a number of unexpected medical expenses, so I really struggled to find the money for the textbook.",
                "The second half of virtual lectures were very unclear - I found the videos in weeks 4 and 5 hard to follow. The quizzes also were very particular and I think did not test on knowledge of the course or the week, but rather were quite arbitrary and easy to do poorly on.",
                "I think the format of the course worked great with my schedule and studying habits, but I understand that may not be the case for everyone. I don't see any apparent weaknesses; I honestly thought it was an amazing class.",
                "Strengths: well organized, appropriate workload, easy to get help if needed\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: lots of ways to interact even though it is asynchronous and the course is overall very organized\r\nweaknesses: lots of material in some weeks and less in others.",
                "The strengths of this course was that it taught me how to apply my knowledge rather than just strictly memorizing facts from a textbook. By allowing for this next step, it solidifies our knowledge. I realized that the concepts I used to connect to my independent project were concepts that I was much more familiar with. I think the course could be improved by more lessons on how to read the papers. Even with the discussion sections and annotations, I still find it extremely hard to read and engage in the papers.",
                "It's very good",
                "strengths were the enrichments session, really helped me learn material",
                "I think that Professor Koelle is such a good professor that in-person lectures would be beneficial and fun. The asynchronous format is easier and allows students to work ahead at their own pace, but I think that if these videos were to be posted for access if students wish and then everyone just did the in-person lecture then the course would be better. A guest speaker was also brought in for some videos and unfortunately I do not think she did a good job at teaching so if the virtual format is to continue, I think that filming new videos to cover that content would be extremely helpful. I also think that with such a short time to complete it, minimal growth in biology was gained from the final project. I think it definitely could have been more engaging.",
                "I really liked how we had asynchronous classes I feel like it taught me how to time manage but sometimes it felt a bit impersonal so I think it would be nice to have more interactive elements. The weekly tests felt difficult and often like the materia from the lectures were not enough to make me come to conclusions that I needed to in tests.",
                "The prerecorded lectures made it not very engaging. Also the guest lecturer was a little bit unprepared it seemed, in the lectures that were taught by the guest lecturer. Also, sometimes the quizzes had a lot of trick questions, and the homework was graded for key-terms rather than wholistic understanding, which was sometimes very frustrating.",
                "I love that this course offers enrichment sections to help students who feel the need to catch up on and familiarize content. The only thing I consider a weakness is that the amount of time it takes to watch and really understand the lectures takes longer than the period between Sunday and Wednesday; if we had more time over the weekend to get a start on watching these lectures, that would be very helpful!",
                "I personally would have been more engaged if the lectures were in person.",
                "The course presented information in an accessible way and created a pathway for students to find appropriate levels of challenge through the final project. I think that one general point of feedback is that there were a lot of moving parts in the course, benchmarks, homework assignments, quizzes, videos, and more. It was definitely overwhelming and it took a while to find the right rhythm. I think perhaps finding a way to \"simplify the formula\" would be an effective way to help students adjust to the course. Also, Prof. Koelle's lectures were great! His teaching style was easy to understand, properly paced, and effective. I believe that the addition of Prof. Kabeche to the course was intentional, however, I think that her teaching style inhibited my learning as many of her videos were repetitive, unclear, and cut in and out at times. For future course iterations, it would be great to find a way to improve those lectures.",
                "I am not a great test-taker, and the weekly quizzes damaged my grade. Though grades are not that important, it was discouraging to consistently score at/below average. As I came to understand, the first five quizzes tested \"depth\" of knowledge, and the last tested \"breadth\". As only one of our discussion sections took the form of a journal club, I feel as though it may be helpful to advise diving deeper during DS in preparation for quizzes.",
                "Strengths are it teaches a lot of info in a relatively short period of time. I felt engaged with the course as well.",
                "The course covers a lot of information but does so in compact sections that make learning easy. The use of study guides on quizzes emphasized the course goal of applying knowledge rather than memorizing facts. Sometimes the quiz questions were vaguely worded though, and the lectures on genetics were not as helpful as earlier ones.",
                "Strengths: Very well outlined weekly to-do lists, reasonable workload, very helpful HW sessions. Enjoyed the final project a lot (independence to explore what we were interested in and evenly spaced work + mentor check-ins), very helpful Ed Discussion site\r\nWeaknesses: discussion sections could be more engaging, less a recap on weekly content and more of an extension",
                "A large weakness of the course is that it is asynchronous. I know that myself and many other students cared less about the course because of this simple fact. This is also a strength because the lectures were allowed to be watched in one's own time. It would have been more beneficial if there were more in-person offerings for all students. I went to enrichment for the last two weeks of the course and this helped immensely with motivation. Another strength is the final project we have. This engages students in a real-world protein that we can research the valuable applications of. I really enjoyed this and it made the course much less monotonous.",
                "A strength of this course is that is well organized and doesn't vary much from the structure of prerecorded videos, 1 homework assignment, 1 benchmark, 1 discussion section, and 1 quiz every week. In that sense, the workload was very dependable. \r\n\r\nOne weakness would be the specificity of the quiz questions. I think the intent was to engage deeper levels of knowledge rather than memorized facts but I found that I did better if I rewatched all the lectures right before the quiz and used flashcards to memorize the information.",
                "I think that some of the recorded lectures could be hard to follow sometimes (especially the ones on the various technologies - sequencing, PCR, etc.). I also would have liked a couple of live lectures (maybe during section?) to reinforce the concepts. I think a large strength is the organization of the course. It was really helpful to have the \"Weekly To-Do\" lists and have that structure. I also did really enjoy the final project process.",
                "Strengths: The lectures were generally very clear and straightforward in illustrating the key concepts. The discussion sections were helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: Deadline of asynchronous lectures (Wednesdays) and timing of quizzes (following Mondays) don't match up very well. Some quiz questions are worded ambiguously",
                "Making lectures remote was beneficial but having them due in the middle of the day on Wednesday was difficult at times. Also, having certain assignments due before discussion put a lot of pressure on some students while others had multiple extra days to complete homework. A lot of content was covered and in some detail, but there wasn't enough time to fully learn and engage with one unit's material before moving onto the next. Monday quizzes meant trying to review the last weeks material while learning new material so that lectures/homework could be completed before the Wednesday deadline.",
                "I don't like how Bio 101 is online and Bio 102 is in-person. I feel like they need to decide on just one and stick with it. One great thing about this class is that the grading is pretty lenient. If you put in the effort and complete the assignments, you won't do poorly. I think this is an effective way to encourage students to complete the intro bio sequence. Also, I feel like a positive of this course is that there are a lot of outlets to help you learn, like your TA, the professor, peer tutors, and your individual mentor.",
                "I disliked strongly the online lectures. Professor Koelle is a great lecturer but I truly believe there is no substitute for in person lectures. The learning is unparalleled. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I liked a lot the material and how it introduced me to a big field in a way that did not feel insurmountable.",
                "I thought this course was taught very well and everything was explained very clearly. The teachers and TAs were always so helpful!\r\nMaybe there could be more ways to prep for the quizzes like practice quizzes, because I know many people struggled with them.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Koelle is a wonderful lecturer--he moves at just the right pace through lectures. I also loved the Benchmark essay...it was a joy to research a protein and write about it. The great part about the Benchmark is that it is self-paced, so I was able to challenge myself and have one-on-one meetings with a grad student. \r\nWeaknesses: As much as I love biology, I was a little disappointed by this half-term course. First, the teaching format was strictly lecture videos: I don't understand why Profs. Koelle and Loreng decided to keep video lectures as opposed to in-person lectures, considering every student fits into Marsh Lecture Hall for in-person quizzes; I would have much preferred in-person lectures. I learn better that way, and I know more than a few peers voiced similar feelings. Additionally, Prof. Loreng appeared very cold and unwilling to help the multiple times I approached him, from cutting me off in the middle of a question to not replying to a few of my emails. This attitude from the coordinator of the sequence was very discouraging, especially when I was trying to actively receive help and guidance throughout the course. Moreover, I felt that the quizzes were focused more on \"gotcha\" questions (this was  mainly an issue during the first two quizzes) but it made me feel that BIOL 101 cared more about testing my understanding of a specific word in a question rather than a general concept. Lastly, there is lots of ambiguity in the final grade, and it's very stressful. I understand why this is done (grade distributions change from year to year), but even something as simple as telling students what grade cutoffs were in previous years could alleviate some tension about grades and encourage, as the course puts it, learning over worrying about a grade.",
                "Strengths: topics are interesting, Prof Koelle is really passionate, lecture slides are good \r\nWeaknesses: quiz questions are often worded strangely so you do poorly even if you understand the concepts, there were too many moving pieces each week (lectures, quiz, hw assignment, benchmark, section, sometimes hw before section etc), lectures were too long to have to watch before Wednesday (watching them and taking notes typically consumed my entire Monday entire)",
                "Strengths: Adjusted to the level of the student. Help to external resources is very accessible (mentor, discussion teacher, homework study hall, enrichments). Workload is based on student pacing since lectures are online. Not having in-person classes. Grading is lenient with no midterms, mostly project based, dropped lowest quiz scores. \r\nWeaknesses: Online guest lectures by Professor Kabeche were unclear and not explained thoroughly. Lots of different kinds of assignments and platforms (benchmarks, psets, lectures, canvas calendar, EdStem page) that are hard to keep track of. Fast-paced. Feels like a superficial look into bio.",
                "The course was taught through pre-recorded lectures in Spring 2022. The material was presented in a straightforward manner, which made it easy to learn. The course-long individual project supplemented my learning.",
                "Strengths: The homeworks are relevant to the content and aren't time-consuming.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the quiz questions are deliberately difficult."

            "comments": [
                "Yes. Likely it is required for your major, but even if it isn't, it is a really great introduction to the concepts that allow life to exist and thrive. I learned a lot!",
                "Yes! I think that this is a great course for students who don't know much about biology and need to start gaining some foundational knowledge about the field of biology.",
                "Yes. Although you're probably required to take the class, I think it really does help you gain a good understanding of biochemistry/biophysics with the way the course is set up and isn't overly stressful. I also feel that the skills I acquired through working on the final project and learning about research techniques will help me in the future when conducting research in real labs.",
                "Absolutely not. Unless you have to take it either for pre-med or for your major do not under any circumstances take this course. Its a complete waste of time for anyone that likes biology and thinks they want to learn more.",
                "Yes, if you need to pursue further bio courses, this course is a great foundation and prepares you well. This course is pretty nice to be in.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in biological science or chemistry. It is a great start for the bio sequence and for many majors/career plans.",
                "yes, I think it would be a very good course to take if you have no prior biology background. However, if you have taken AP Bio, I would not recommend it unless you need it as a pre-req.",
                "I would recommend the course because I thought it was interesting.",
                "Yes, I would. I think it provides a great jumping off point and introduction to the science and it was very thoughtfully put together.",
                "I would definitely recommend this to another student. BIOL 101 was a great introduction not only to biology, but also the world of scientific research.",
                "Yes! Super great class and anyone can take it and learn a lot! Lectures were interesting and informational, and I learned so much.",
                "Definitely! I feel more prepared for biology at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it connects key principles in biology and chemistry. In addition, the professors are amazing for this course. I was given great feedback for assignments, and I appreciated the one-on-one mentorship provided. Unlike other classes, we are able to really connect and talk to the professor.",
                "It was largely a review of AP Biology content but required for certain majors if you didn't take the placement exam.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, great class for an introduction to biology and is required by many science majors as a pre-req.",
                "I would. I think that Professors Koelle and Loreng make this course all the more better. They have great teaching styles, are extremely accommodating for students, and are very well organized. I was lucky enough to be in Professor Koelle's discussion section and he created such a great, friendly environment. I never feel embarrassed or silly if I ask a question.",
                "Yes I think its a great introductory biology course and good for students who want to learn how to become more independent in their learning.",
                "No, it was not the best experience but was a necessary premed requirement",
                "Yes! Professor Koelle and Dr. Loreng were amazing in their understanding and clear teaching of the content.",
                "For a student who must take it to start the bio sequence, I would recommend.",
                "Yes, I would, however, if I had taken AP Bio more recently, I would not have taken this course. In many ways, I developed some strong scientific skills but feel as though the level of material was very comparable or even less challenging than my high school biology course.",
                "100 times yes. This is a smooth and clear transition into college-level biology that resolved the gaps in my own knowledge of certain biological processes. This is crucial if you are planning on engaging in research in the biological sciences too, being that it beautifully highlights insightful discussions on scientific material among peers and how to perform an individual study.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I enrolled to fulfill a pre-med requirement, but I left with a greater interest in biology and research methods as a whole.",
                "Yes! Great intro to biochem and biophysics at reasonable pace and engaging intro to more advanced scientific practices and literature",
                "I would recommend this class because it was tailored to each individual student.",
                "Yes, this course introduces you to basic biology so I think that if a student has any interest in biology, then they should definitely take the course!",
                "Yes! Definitely. I think it makes you think about biology in a way that's quite different from what is normally taught in biology class.",
                "This course is a prereq for a lot of things so taking it might not be optional. If you have no previous bio experience (especially if you haven't taken AP bio) be prepared to have a lot to deal with and try to take advantage of the support resources available. The level of difficulty of the course varies greatly based on your personal bio background.",
                "Personally, I wouldn't take this class unless it's a prereq for another class you want to take, for your major, or a pre-med requirement. It's a decent intro bio class, but there are other bio classes that appeal more to me.",
                "I would recommend it if they are looking for a comprehensive introduction of biochemistry and biophysics.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. Homeworks were graded fairly and I think it's so important that they made it clear how you can do well in the course.",
                "For all bio-related majors (including biomedical engineering), this course is a prerequisite. As far as taking it for the sake of learning biology, I do believe this course teaches students biological concepts, as well as how to apply them to new situations. However, I don't know that I would recommend this specific style of the course to another student: I would recommend students take a version of this course taught in-person with Prof. Koelle rather than online/via video.",
                "It's required for my major and pre-med so a lot of people have to take it. I liked the topics a lot but I disliked the course structure so I would probably not recommend it.",
                "This course is a pre-req for upper level bio courses. If you are a non-stem student, I think there are better options to fulfill a science credit. The course is relatively straightforward and advertised as open to all levels of biology students. Even having taken AP Bio, the quizzes still felt difficult at times and the course goes over a lot of content with many textbook readings and exposure to papers which can be overwhelming. But this intro sequence feels manageable.",
                "I'd only recommend this course if it's required for a major. The material isn't all that interesting. It's mostly stuff necessary to know as a foundation for a more in-depth classes.",
                "Yes if they have time and want to learn about cells. It's not overly specific but not super important general knowledge either."
