    "I would probably recommend this course, Avi has a great personality, but the 9 am lecture can be a bit hard to wake up for, and the exams are weighted very strongly, so you have to do good on them which is not easy.",
    "For those who took 323 and liked the computer architecture topics, this course is a very good next step. I actually enjoyed the content a lot and the exams are definitely a lot to study for but on a day to day basis it is pretty chill.",
    "Yes. I think any software developer should have a basic understanding of OS and Avi does a great job of laying the fundamentals."
