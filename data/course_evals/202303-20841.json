                "I gained knowledge of the multidisciplinary literatures that address meaningfulness of the world itself, as opposed to the representation of it. I was introduced to some of the foundational works of semiotics, including Peirce and Saussure, and learned how to apply semiotic processes to analyze human and nonhuman agents. I obtained insights from connecting very different works, from Aristotle's categories and causes, to posthuman and post-modern theories inspired by quantum physics. The course trained me to engage with complex philosophical theories and apply semiotic framework in my own research.",
                "I learned many critical theories about the relationship between meaning and materiality. I understand how past classic philosophors like Marx and current posthuman scholars like Bennet approach this complex relationship and the similarity/difference of their approaches. After taking this course, I learned that meaning and materiality is always intersected. Now I can critically use theories like semiotics and phenomenology to analyze this the relationship between these two in my own research."

                "The strengths of the course include 1) the choice of readings is excellent, which allowed students to make connections among divergent thinkers and get the gists of the most influential works; 2) the lectures are succinct, informative, and engaging, which added clarify and deepened my understanding of the complex texts; 3) the assignments are of the right amount, which included weekly reading responses and a final paper which helped me digest and apply what I learned. \r\nThere is not much to be improved. But we skipped the content of two classes for student presentation, and I might have learned more from the lectures. Perhaps the student presentation should be shorter to leave more time to cover class content.",
                "The strength is the comprehensive syllabus and the lecture's rich knowledge and insightful perspectives. No weakness.",
                "Many of the readings are very technical. They aren't supper long, but getting through them with a strong understanding can be difficult.",
                "I thought the course was relaxed and flexible which created a good environment for learning a somewhat subjective subject, but I struggled with the subjectivity of the grading and assessment. At the end of the semester I struggled to check my understanding of the course content against the expectations of the professor."

                "Yes. This is an extremely thought-provoking course that allows you to see the world and your work from a semiotic lens. The professor is very supported and dedicated to make complex philosophical works accessible to students. Highly recommend.",
                "I will highly recommend this course to other students. First, no matter you are major in anthropology, art history, or philosophy, the class will benefit your own research with its comprehensive content and diverse approaching of the fundamental academic question: meaning and materiality. In fact, the lecturer might be the most knowledgable scholar I have ever seen on this topic, who always provide clear thought and insightful comments on your questions.",
                "I loved this class! I thought all the readings were super interesting. It did take a little time for all the pieces to come together, but at the very end of the class, I could tell I saw the world differently. It isn't every day you get to take a class that engages with the real world by combining theory and pragmatism. I loved the way this class made me think and I think people interested in materiality in general will love it too.",
                "I would very much recommend this course to any student who is theory-minded, and is fond of clarity. Very rarely I see an instructor explaining the concepts and weaving them together in such a concise and effective manner. Everytime I walk out of the classroom feeling like learning important things.",
                "I would as a flexible fifth class."
