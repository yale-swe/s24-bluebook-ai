                "This course is very good at fostering an environment ample for learning and collaboration. There is a big sense of community with fellow peers as a result of Professor Back's policy of switching seats each day in order to practice Korean with other students. This allowed us all to get to know one another and to be comfortable when working in groups of 3 or more for skit presentations. One weakness would be how scattered the lesson becomes sometimes. There are a lot of tangents on vocabulary and grammar not included in the formal lesson and difficulty in understanding whether the material was important or not. Furthermore, although the final group project was fun, there was too little time to create a script, record and edit a video, and present it in class. Not everyone has the skills to manipulate video editing software so the bulk of the project falls on one student. Perhaps it would be better to allocate more time between the creation of the video script, editing and comments from the professor, and the actual execution of the video and the due date."
