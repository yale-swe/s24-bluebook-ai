We went beyond the basics, and I learned so much from the preterite to the subjunctive to culture in Spanish speaking countries.

                "I thought that we did not spend enough time in class discussing the new verb tenses we learned and practicing how to use them in a structured way. Over the course of the semester, I felt like I got lost in verb soup, where all of the different endings got mixed up in my head, and there wasn't any real opportunity to work past this confusion in the classroom, or in the homework. I did really appreciate the asynchronous day.",
                "It was pretty straightforward but also not super engaging stylistically  and lots of learning has to be done on your own and it moves fast",
                "Weakness was definitely LinguaMeetings",
                "I think the course moves too fast and requires too much work outside of the class considering it already meets for 5 hours a week.",
                "It was a lot of work!! I felt the jump from Spanish I to II to be completely overwhelming at times. I spent 2 to 3 hours on homework most nights, and found the weekly projects/activities to be a lot. If I had a more rigorous course load the past semester I probably would have felt completely lost, but was lucky I could spend the time that was needed most nights to complete all assignments to the best of my ability. But it was a lot. I feel like it is tricky because there are so many students who do have much greater experience, and so I often feel self-conscious, especially with presentations, even if I put in a lot of work preparing and practicing. A strength I think was learning about the culture and systems of different countries, which we did less of last semester, so I really appreciated that! I really enjoyed looking at art too, and learning about, for example, the health systems of different countries. I also really enjoyed doing the cultural project and the play. Overall, I think it is a good course, and I learned a lot, but wish the work load was a little more manageable and there was more understanding of the different places everyone was coming in from."
