                "The basic knowledge about psychology is broad areas such as memory, personality, brain, consciousness and unconsciousness, and so on.\r\nI learned to preview by myself and have divergent thinking.",

                "As a high school student, I have never taken a college level course, and I think this Introduction to Psychology class is very different from AP Psychology. This course covered many fields of psychology. After the classes, I believed I had a better overview about what psychology is about. I understood more about the experiments behind numerous phenomena and theories that I had learned from AP Psychology. I also gained knowledge how humans are both an unique and not unique species."

                "Good lecture and discussions.",
                "The biggest strengths of this course are the instructors, particularly our TF, Kate. Kate was incredibly kind and understanding, and she was very passionate about the subject. I always looked forward to going to class because of the energy and enthusiasm she brought as well as how she cultivated a really amazing class environment. She lead class discussions really well, and they were always organized effectively. I really enjoyed getting to learn from her as well as Professor Dunham, especially about their own research projects and interests. The structure of the class was also really good, and I liked how open to feedback Kate and Professor Dunham were, so we modified things as the course progressed. The only weakness of the class in my opinion is that some of the secondary popular press articles felt somewhat out of place. I understand they are meant to show us real-world applications of the material, but we often did not discuss them during class, so maybe reducing the number of articles would help students better engage with all of the material.",
                "strengths: The professor TA taught courses clearly, covering basic information in videos and reading materials, which is good for reviewing.",
                "The course provides material that I actually enjoyed reading instead of it being a trudge to finish. This strongly supports the discussion portion of the class and gave plenty of points to talk about. I think a clearer structure of what we will be learning would be a good improvement, as I felt that the topics jumped quickly from one another without much linkage.",
                "The content covered was usually very interesting and brilliantly delivered. Organizationally, I would have enjoyed seeing even more how the specifics of each topic in class related to the larger topic. I think the psychopathology lecture did this brilliantly. I preferred the reading responses that required more thought beyond the ideas as they were recited in the lecture, but overall they all did help solidify my understanding of the material.",
                "It's an interesting overview of the field of psychology that introduces you to some thought-provoking findings.  However, there is a breadth of material, both in lectures and in additional readings, so it can be hard to know what to prioritize when it comes to studying for the exam.",
                "Please download New Yorker articles as PDFs for future classes since they have a monthly article limit for non-subscribers.",
                "The strengths were definitely the discussion sections that were made to be less review but more utilizing the concepts learned. Weaknesses were probably the final exam format. The scoring on the short essay questions did not make a lot of sense in terms of time. The sentences were meant to be short and to the point but when graded, the feedback was that the writer should've written more when unable to. I did not like that the midterm questions assigned each week were due the day before the discussion section giving us insufficient time (half of one day) to watch the lectures, take notes and complete the questions thoughtfully.",
                "I enjoyed the discussion format of the course and the detailed feedback we received on our twice-weekly written assignmentsit helped my engagement with and understanding of the course material. I would, however, prefer a more creative discussion format: answering questions that repeated what we learned in the lecture was a bit dull.",
                "Well taught and well organized.",
                "The class was more discussion based, and I really enjoyed this method. It can facilitated more interaction between the professor and student. However, I also think that there were not many discussions among students themselves. Maybe more discussions among students can help them understand the material faster and foster more questions about the subjects."

                "Absolutely! The course is a lot of fun, and the material is really interesting. I think everyone would benefit from taking at least one psychology course during college, and this is a great course to take! Professor Dunham and our TF, Kate, were both incredible!",
                "I would highly recommend this course. It is really interesting",
                "Yes. Because it talks about basic information of psychology and is quite helpful for the later learning of psychology.",
                "I would not recommend this course. I felt like I learned small bits and pieces of random trivia with the structure of the class. I am not sure if this is because of its condensed summer version, but I would recommend looking into other courses that look deeper into a topic of interest.",
                "A fine course. I wouldn't say it gives much breadth nor depth, but rather vignettes into various subfields within psych.",
                "Yes, it's a great introductory course for psychology! However, the final exam was cumulative, so there was a lot to memorize.",
                "If you want a brief overview of various different psychology related topics, this is a good class to take. However, most of the content learning happens through asynchronous, pre recorded lectures which could be a bit tedious at times if you weren't interested in that particular topic. Also, over the summer there is a decent amount of work because you have to watch lectures, do readings, write responses, etc so it could be easy to fall behind. Overall, a solid introduction to psychology.",
                "I thought this course was very well taught and managed. Although it is a fairly standard college course that most take, I was always interested in the material and the important connections we could make.",
                "Yes, it was a well taught course.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. I think the course did an excellent job introducing what psychology is about and its wide range, so it is a really great course to start learning psychology."
