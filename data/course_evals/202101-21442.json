He suddenly got very stern and rude even snapping at students when they asked about the grading structure for the class where there was entirely no clarity. This man literally just repeated all of the same things and never even bothered to define The Anthropocene. He then proceeded to grade students very harshly on final assignments when he did not even teach us what he wanted us to include in the final exam and the final paper.

This course was incredibly disorganized and I felt like every single thing we did was randomly thought of on the spot by Professor Weiss. He did not provide any clarity on assignments or grading and I learned almost nothing the entire semester.",
                "Strengths: Very nice class to take if the rest of your schedule is super demanding since this class does not demand much outside of a few readings each week. Weaknesses: Professor gave absolutely no feedback and the format of the course schedule was constantly changing, so it was very hard to get a good understanding of where you are in the class.",
                "The strengths of this course was the breadth of information covered and the ability to own one of the concepts taught throughout the semester. Each student effectively picked a topic that they wanted to become the expert on... and then they would present that topic to the class via powerpoint presentation on the day that it was assigned. They then had a chance to dig deeper into that topic in the final term paper. The course could be improved by facilitating more of a conversation -- oftentimes the seminar felt as though it were a lecture and there was limited ability to participate or ask questions outside of being the presenter of that days topic.",

                "Strengths: There were none\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Weiss was clearly mentally unstable. This octogenarian has lost his marbles. The first half of the semester Professor Weiss spent too much time talking about Gobekli Tepe and cave stalagmites. The second half was composed of student presentations that dragged on for over 20 minutes. It appeared as though this man simply did not want to teach but wanted to collect a check for his research from Yale University. He is the professor at an ivy league university that students are warned about. However, whenever a student would ask for a meeting with Professor Weiss, he never seemed to be busy. However, he was apparently too busy during actual class time to teach his students...",
                "While the material was interesting, this seminar was a complete disaster. Our class was very disorganized, with readings often missing from the syllabus, the expectations constantly changing, and no clear direction to the lectures. Prof. Weiss was clearly very passionate about the content, but would spend most of the class going on confusing tangents without space for students to interject or ask questions. I personally didn't feel able to participate in the class, as the only way seemed to be interrupting the professor or volunteering a right answer to a confusing questionit often felt like there was a right answer (his opinion) to completely subjective issues. Our professor also struggled with technology, making class difficult at times. The strength of this class was the student presentations, from which I learned a lot; this class would likely be so much better if it was a true seminar, rather than a long, confusing lecture!"

At first, this course was fun because Professor Weiss is a character that you might meet in a cartoon. He was very entertaining. But then as we neared the end of the semester, the facade fell and what was left was a man who was past his prime who was deciding the fate of your GPA. I thought this was a gut, and I suppose there was not much work to actually do. But your grade is literally a toss-up, so I would not recommend it unless you Credit/D. But even then, he has given a student a D, so I don't even think that is safe!",
