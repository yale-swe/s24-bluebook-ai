We mainly learned about important, recurring chemical reactions that show up in later courses like biochemistry as well as the reasons why they happen (again, with MO theory). These include (but are not limited to): addition reactions, SN2/E2/SN1/E1 reaction mechanisms, reactions of conjugated systems, and interconversion reactions between some functional groups.",

This course was taught as a flipped classroom, and in my opinion (which was shared by the majority of the students this semester) this system was awful since we were expected to teach ourselves with little to no guidance from the professor. What guidance we did receive came from the TA's who were all really supportive and helpful. However, in general we had to fend for ourselves. Thus I had to learn quickly how to teach myself organic chemistry without anyone's help.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, I also developed my skills in synthesis reactions, and how to chain together many small reactions together into an overall process to get the product I desire. I found this part fun since it is like a logic puzzle. Again, I had to teach this all to myself (I am stressing this point because I and many others find it absurd that we are paying thousands of dollars to go to Yale and be told to teach ourselves the material).",

This course requires a lot of outside class-time spent on learning the actual topics. Without that, the lecture can be pretty confusing and difficult.",

However, I felt like this didn't work very well, as many people were still lost upon coming to class. I felt that towards the end of the semester it seemed like he kind of began just lecturing us in each class, which I personally found to be more helpful for student learning because it resulted in clarity about what we were expected to know and it was helpful to go over it again in a different way.",
                "I don't think the flipped classroom set up was effective for this class. It was very difficult to keep up in lecture on days where I was not able to do the readings. I feel like midterms were true to the practice exams that are given out. The TAs and ULAs are LIFESAVERS!! I cannot stress going to peer tutor office hours when you can.",
                "I think the flipped classroom system works if you have a large amount of free time and motivation, but for many students, it ends up becoming confusing and difficult to manage the readings while also being engaged during class. For me, I ended up falling behind in readings, leading me to stop going to class and just catch up on all of the content immediately before each midterm.",

                "Strengths: The exams were very fair with regard to what was discussed in class. Professor Newhouse was great at giving examples and helping those who needed it. The course was well-designed to allow spaces to obtain help if needed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The flipped classroom format using a textbook wasn't the most conducive to student learning. I found myself confused as to what I was reading a lot of the time, and having to teach myself that bulk of material was oftentimes tedious. I would have liked somewhat more in-class instruction. The subsequent workload for this class was much higher than my other chemistry classes.",
                "I think the idea of flipped classroom is genuinely not something that can be used for organic chemistry. Some of us don't have strong chemistry backgrounds so it's basically learning everything for the first time. Spending 3-5 hours before EVERY class to learn the content is not doable. I don't know who said it would be, but most of us are pre-med with 3+ other STEM heavy courses. We don't have the time. When I go to lecture, especially at a school like this, I expect to learn from the lecturer. The TAs are the only good part of this class. I think there should be some re-evaluations for the next semester because this is not working.",
                "Strengths: exams are fair, extra credit got rid of the need for a curve, flexible office hours were amazing, great TFs. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: flipped format doesn't work. I don't have the time to balance my other classes, read the textbook, do 100+ Achieve problems per week, and review lecture. This is one class. ONE. Teach us what we need to know and let us practice after class. Tim is also just a poor lecturer. I have such a difficult time keeping up with him during lecture.",
                "Strengths: The TAs were amazing and practically carried this class. They created so many resources throughout the semester, and without them, I would have been pretty lost.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The flipped format of this class was not conducive to my learning. In fact, it made learning organic chemistry miserable for me. The homework assignments and psets 3 times a week on top of the long readings made it hard for me to actually grasp and enjoy the material because I was so worried about getting the work done. Tim insisted that research shows that this method was effective, but in the end, I found myself with not much hope for passing Chem 220.",
                "It was a flipped classroom, except the \"flip\" never occurred. The class had no formal instruction or ways to know exactly what content to study in order to be successful.",
                "I don't like flipped classroom at all, but I do like organic chemistry and the actual content of the subject",
                "Just crammed before the tests. Not much class material tested. We have to learn everything ourselves.",
                "I greatly dislike the flipped classroom. I found it very hard to learn this way and would have much rather taken a traditional style class.",
                "The course has strengths because organic chemistry is required and inherently interesting so it will always have that. Another strength is the tutors and TFs being very available to students. \r\n\r\nSome weaknesses include the homework design and the flipped classroom model. The homework was about 60-100 problems on achieve a week. I think this was flawed because they online so they didn't prepare us for the paper tests or give us practice drawing out organic structures, and because there were way too many of them to put in quality work on each problem. I think a classic paper PSET would be more effective in this class. 10 ish hard problems that we can go to tutoring for and work on is more tangible, better prep for mid terms, and more quality over quantity. \r\n\r\nThe flipped classroom model was done poorly. If Tim really wants to stick with it I highly recommend video lectures or guided problem sets instead of just outsourcing students to a very dense textbook. It is not realistic and not what we are paying for quite honestly! We are missing out from a very interesting lecture. Also, the combination of being expected to learn the material through a textbook and then do 60-100 problems a week is just not a successful recipe and will result in cutting corners.",
                "Strengths: offered extra credit\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: flipped learning style method (code for not having to actually teach us himself), numerous Achieve problems that were due thrice a week",
                "The course is flipped, which means that the professor will not teach. You will only go through multiple practice problems in class. This is the most ridiculous learning method Ive ever done. Why do we even go to Yale if we are going to get professors that dont teach.",
                "Strength: The teaching team. Although a bit disorganized at times, they were committed to having students learn, not just memorize, organic chemistry. \r\nWeakness: the final exam was weird and was mostly on stuff we didnt explicitly cover.",
                "Flipped classroom, made students actually learn the material",
                "This course was a flipped-course style which I strongly disliked. I  understand the importance of doing practice problems, but for a class with so much difficult and heavy content like Organic Chemistry, having to laboriously teach myself the material through outside sources online: youtube videos, textbooks, Master Organic Chem, paid online memberships were not preferred. It was like the class was for taking tests and all learning was done solo outside of the classroom. Many people spoke of their dislike towards this learning style, but nothing was done to adapt to student learning. I think any test grade was a reflection of a student's own learning rather than from the classroom.",
                "Strengths: I felt like the class did a good job of emphasizing understanding over memorization. There was heavy emphasis on learning mechanisms and applying molecular orbital theory which made predicting reactions easy rather than just memorizing a bunch of different reactions. I found the content to be very interesting and there were definitely moments in class that really fascinated me. Personally, I think the flipped classroom worked well for my learning style since I tend to learn better from reading rather than watching lectures. The TFs were always very helpful. It was pretty easy to get help since there were study halls pretty much every other day held by the TFs and peer tutors.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The flipped classroom format is definitely not for everyone and it definitely ends up being a lot of work. I felt like I had to read both the required and suggested textbooks to keep up. I felt pretty ambivalent about the group problems on the test. I think they are ok as long as everyone in the group gets to submit their own answer and as long as it isn't worth more than 10% of the total exam score. \r\n\r\nAlso the organization of the course could be somewhat confusing and it was often unclear what exactly was on the exam or how they would be graded. Professor Newhouse would lecture, but as far as I could understand Dr. Clark was in charge of all the graded aspects of the course (including writing/grading the exams) and there was often miscommunication or mixed messages about what we needed to know.",
                "I really hope they scrap the flipped class model for future versions of this course. It really is not constructive to our learning. There are not even any pre-recorded lectures or any material for us to base our studying on other than the textbook. I went into lecture every day and stared at the lecturer writing on a piece of white paper under a projector and had no idea what I was looking at. Not to mention the handwriting was awful on both the lecture notes and practice problems. The answer keys were so cluttered I would rather just look up problems to practice with online. The only part of this course where I felt like I learned anything was during the discussion sections and through the TAs.",
                "Strengths: content was interesting, Tim and Aaron were both really great\r\nWeaknesses: I'm normally a fan of flipped classroom, but it really doesn't work in lectures this big. It just ended up being way more work for students without the educational payoffs since we couldn't actually bring what we wanted to discuss from the readings to class. Also, the achieves were way too much and should have been reduced to roughly 1/3 of the amount of work/time they took. Also, the readings were far too long in the first part of the course.",
                "Strengths: interesting content\r\nWeaknesses: FLIPPED CLASSROOM - the worst possible idea for any STEM course but especially organic chemistry. Had to not only go to lectures and section but also spend hours a week in study halls and with friends trying to teach the information to ourselves",
                "I did not enjoy the Professor and the flipped course style of teaching. It was too much at times as we all have other courses and I dont understand how it can be expected of us to learn all this content outside of class and then come in for an hour or so and just do problems. I think this class would be better with a lecture style and a better profesor. Myself and many others found that most times, the TFs and Dr Clark did a better job at teaching/explaining concepts than Tim.",
                "i did not like the flipped class. organic chemistry is difficult to teach yourself. a lot of the textbook material and achieve material did not align well with what we did in class. i consider the workload very high because we had to spend so much time outside of class trying to teach ourselves the material",
                "strengths: By the end of the course I feel that I had a relatively deep understanding of the foundational organic chemistry concepts \r\nweaknesses: the flipped classroom format was difficult, especially at the beginning of the semester when the topics of organic chemistry were unfamiliar to us",
                "One of the most infamously difficult classes being flipped-classroom posed a challenge, since there was a lot of uncertainty about my knowledge of key concepts at times. However, throughout the course of the semester, the instructors appeared to do some more traditional instruction within the lecture period as a sort of review, so this became less of an issue. A strength of the course was discussion section, where I was generally able to reinforce key concepts taught in class, albeit a week later. I also thought some of the homework was not really relevant at times, and there wasn't adequate preparation for the ACS exam portion of the final. Other than that, there was a lot of support in the class with study halls and office hours.",
                "Strengths: The amount of assistance offered for this course was outstanding. Office hours/peer tutoring is absolutely necessary for this class, and it was offered 5 nights a week. I would not have been able to do well or even pass this class without these study halls (I attended as many as possible). I appreciate that it's acknowledged that the material is difficult and that there should be so much extra help offered. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Flipped classroom. I understand the intention behind it, but it just really doesn't work for this class. These concepts are so difficult to learn to begin with, and we are supposed to teach them to ourselves? The lectures often just made me even more confused than the book had because the professor expected that you'd been able to grasp the concepts from the book already and proceeded to build upon them, rather than reviewing them. You were pretty much screwed if you hadn't had time to do the reading for that lecture yet. I want to be taught by my professor, not by my textbook. The textbook should be for reinforcement of, not introduction to, concepts. In addition, the homework assigned for each lecture was due BEFORE that lecture. If you were confused on something, you had to just guess your way through it because you hadn't actually been taught it yet. Again, I really do understand the intention behind flipped classroom, but it just does not work for this class and only makes the students feel stranded.",
                "The course was ambitious but not unreasonable in what was covered. I appreciated the flexibility in the syllabus as the semester went on, especially the opportunities for corrections and extra credit. However, the \"flipped classroom\" model, while nice in theory, should be reconsidered for a course as technical as organic chemistry.",
                "Lectures were recorded\r\nThere were a lot of office hours offered\r\nClass is not curved but test corrections are offered\r\nThe workload was very heavy and it made it difficult to learn",
                "the strength of this class is that there is A LOT of support in this class, all of which are phenomenal. A weakness of this class is that between exams the content gets more complex quickly, as well as they move through content quickly.",
                "Strengths: there were so many opportunities to receive help from the instructors and TFs alike. The collaborative format of the class (i.e. group problems) made it easy to connect with other students and truly engage with the material.\r\nWeaknesses: The achieve assignments would cover material before we've gotten the opportunity to be introduced to them in class, and they weren't always relevant, either.",
                "Strengths: the TA's and ULA's are absolutely fantastic.\r\nWeaknesses: the flipped classroom model really wasn't that useful. Towards the end of the semester, however, when half the class was lecture style and the other half having the flipped classroom model felt a lot more conducive to learning.",
                "This course should have never been flipped. If it is in the future, the flipped lessons should be videos from the professor or even recommended supplemental videos as it is incredibly hard for many students to teach themselves organic chemistry through a textbook. Additionally, it made no sense to be flipped since we already have discussion sections for this course. Ultimately, it felt like no learning was being made in the course and instead we just had 2 discussion sections.",
                "The biggest weakness was making this already difficult class very inaccessible. I didnt feel like the profesor was very helpful because he wasnt actually teaching in his lectures.",
                "Strengths: Exams felt fair and lectures were never uninteresting. Weaknesses: I don't know why Tim insists on a flipped classroom. It is nearly universally disliked among students and TAs and seems only to save Tim the hassle of having to teach Orgo. Maybe the format would work in a 5-person seminar, but in a 200-person lecture it is simply preposterous. I know Tim has become somewhat infamous for teaching in an flipped classroom, so I can't really see it changing soon, but I really hope it does.",
                "Should have been lecture style instead of the students having to teach themselves",
                "The design of this lecture was honestly the most difficult experience yet. The flipped classroom design was not helpful in facilitating my learning. As an FGLI student who has to manage work and extracurriculars on top of a heavy course load, I did not have the \"3 to 5 hours\" to prepare for EACH class, meaning doing the readings on top of the extensive and long Achieve homework assignments. Because of this structure, it was difficult to keep up with learning the material. I still attended class but even then, the lecture was not helpful if I did not know the material to begin with. The only place I feel like I truly was able to learn was during section--which was lecture style. While flipped classroom can be helpful for some students, I can say that for me and other students, it was a really difficult experience. In the future, I would consider going back to a lecture style, where SECTION can be dedicated to focus more implementing the material through guided examples.",
                "Strengths was that many topics were covered. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses was the flipped classroom style of teaching. It was not effective for learning. If this was the only class taken in a semester, it would work but it required so much additional work outside of the classroom to teach myself all of the concepts.",
                "The weakness of the course was the flipped classroom format. It did not facilitate learning and consumed a ridiculous amount of the student's time. It would be improved if the professor would teach.",
                "Strengths: The TFs and Dr. Clark were always very helpful. Professor Newhouse is great at explaining challenging concepts. The practice exams provided before each test provided accurate insight into what students needed to know for the exams.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The flipped classroom format is not conducive to learning. Although I understand that it is meant to increase engagement in lectures and student retention of material, it fails to do that. I think flipped classroom is highly effective when professors provide students with materials to study outside of class that are comprehensive but also comprehensible (such as recorded lectures or videos). Having students read the textbook as their primary form of instruction is not an effective method of introducing the material. The textbook chapters are convoluted and include extra information that is not required for the course (yet, it is difficult for students to identify this as it is their first experience with the material). Most students do not retain information well from a 50-page textbook chapter that they have to get through quickly. Then, students are left confused in lecture because the textbook has not prepared them to suddenly attempt challenging problems, while Professor Newhouse attempts to teach by example, which does not establish a solid foundation of knowledge for students. I think having a lecture-based course with a thorough and challenging PSet would give students as much exposure to the material (since we really did only get through about 5 problems per lecture) while actually promoting the retention of information and having students learn the material well. I think Professor Newhouse and Dr. Clark are both great instructors, but I had a lot of problems with how the course was structured and designed.",
                "I think the flipped format works great, and I got a lot out of doing challenging practice problems in class. It could be improved by greater transparency about what we need to know from the textbook.",
                "Tim was very engaging and really tried to make organic chemistry fun. The course was also fairly graded!\r\n\r\nI wish that it wasn't a flipped course though - it was challenging to learn things on our own and then apply them in class, especially if we fell behind on certain things.",
                "Flipped classroom didn't work well for me - if I got behind whatsoever, I would gain little to nothing from lecture and would always need to rewatch the recordings. I will say, however, having recorded lectures was ESSENTIAL to my learning. Being able to rewatch and pause lectures made it much easier to process material at my own pace.",
                "The flipped classroom mechanism is a major weakness of this class if pattern recognition isnt your strong suit. However, the teaching staff, including the amazing TAs are dedicated to helping you understand the material.",
                "Great TAs, help, assistance",
                "I personally liked the flipped classroomI felt I received a ton of support.",
                "I think a strength of the course was the wide availability of office hours. I think a weakness was the flipped classroom setting.",
                "Flipped course needs to go. Lecture during class instead.",
                "No strengths. I think the flipped class method is overly ambitious considering that as Yale students we are extremely busy and have to balance the work of at least 3 other classes and extra curriculars, jobs if you aren't fully funded by your parents too. The amount of self-teaching that has to happen in this class in order to do remotely okay in the course is genuinely unacceptable and it honestly makes the professor, Tim, seem lazy. I would also say that even though Achieve is helpful for practicing general concepts, it is ultimately unhelpful for preparing for our exams as the question styles are different and Achieve oversimplifies concepts in addition to asking the same exact question multiple times between homework sets and problem sets as opposed to the same type of question so that you see a variety of starting materials/reagents. I would also say the amount of homework that we were getting from Achieve, while meant to be a supplement to the readings and serve as additional practice, was kind of ridiculous because -- rather than trying to actually learn something, I spent so much of my time getting answers from friends and looking up the answers online to get through our 40 question psets and 3 homework assignments in a timely fashion. I felt like I was wasting my time in lecture and that the lecture slides proved to be wholly un-useful as well.  So, to improve, I would suggest actually teaching in class, being realistic about how much reading can get done in a week, and shortening the Achieve assignments so that more time can actually be devoted to it. Regarding the length of the reading assignments -- I heard from several sources that we ended up learning the first month and a half of OChem 2, that should not be the case ever. It makes sense too, because I felt like my learning was being rushed the entire semester.",
                "I think the TAs were awesome. I didnt appreciate the flip classroom method.",
                "The strengths of this class is that the tests were pretty straightforward. Everything that was seen on the exams was covered during lecture so there was no \"trickery\" that was involved in that respect. Also, the TFs were amazing!! Each one of them had amazing teaching material that made the content more digestible and they were always there if we had any questions. In general, I feel the biggest complaint for the course was the \"flipped classroom\" structure and although I get what it was trying to accomplish, I also would say it is one of this course's greatest weaknesses. Organic chemistry is notorious for being one of the harder pre-med courses so I didn't understand why the flipped classroom was chosen to teach the course. Personally, I skipped more than half of all the lectures because I couldn't keep up with the content so it ended up being a total disaster. However, if you keep up with the content the lectures were very helpful but it is hard to do so when you have long achieve homework assignments (usually 17-40 questions two to three times per week and when you have upwards of 20 pages to read per lecture). Although well intended, I would suggest teaching the content in depth first (still keeping MO in mind) so that discussion section could do the job of the \"flipped classroom\" (practice problems, examples, etc.).",
                "I surprisingly liked doing more active learning in class; it certainly made the time go faster.",
                "The strengths of the course were the tutoring opportunities available and the chances we got to improve our grades and knowledge. \r\n\r\nA weakness of the course was having to do a substantial amount of self-teaching. I think that lectures couldve been more in-depth by explaining the mechanisms and reactions further instead of us trying to copy them down without really understanding the basis behind them.",
                "The strengths were the TFs and having lectures recorded to be able to watch again while studying. The flipped classroom course was challenging because I felt like hte basics were not covered, and this felt very real while taking the ACS questions on our final.",
                "I had never taken a class with a flipped classroom before, and that was a bit of an adjustment.",
                "Flipped classroom was difficult to work with",
                "I feel the best way for this course to improve is to change it from a flipped classroom model. I personally did not feel like it was the best way to learn the material.",
                "This course was taught as a flipped classroom. The flipped classroom setting did not work for me or my peers. We would very much prefer more active teaching in the classroom. I feel like I couldve done much better with a different classroom setting. Additionally, the professor decided not to curve a course that is always curved and is curved in other schools and classrooms. This puts us at a disadvantage for medical school applications.",
                "The flipped classroom model was definitely both a weakness and a strength of the class. It forced me to learn the material on my own, and because of this, I went to lecture about 4 times the whole semester. You might as well make the class fully online.",
                "No flipped classroom please!!",
                "Less homework or more in-class learning. As Yale students, we unfortunately dont have time to do both the homework and to teach ourselves. Because homework has a deadline and a grade, we do our assignments but dont have time to learn the material.",
                "This course was very poorly taught. The lack of explanation of mechanisms in class made it hard to understand, and the flipped classroom format did not work for me. The TAs were most helpful, not the professor.",
                "While I understand the intentions behind flipped classroom, sometimes the appropriate answers were hard to discern. A student might answer a question in class that was half right, but I wouldn't be able to clearly tell what would actually be an exemplary response for that question. I also wish that molecular orbitals of interest were more clearly written in the notes.",
                "This course being flipped classroom was not effective. The benefits of flipped classroom were pushed at the beginning of the semester, but it was not executed well. In order for us to dedicate in class time to solving problems, there need to be lectures and learning materials provided to the students so they have the means to learn the content.",
                "Strengths: Lots of resources and help\r\nWeaknesses: Flipped classroom learning",
                "This class would best be taught not in a flipped format.",
                "The course is designed very badly. The flipped classroom nature of it is an awful approach to teaching organic chemistry because way too much responsibility is placed on the students to teach themselves. The pace of the class is very fast and the format that the professor followed was extremely disorganized and did not allow students to truly understand how concepts build off from each other. The only strength of the class was the TFs who actually showed that they cared about us learning and did everything they could to help us gain a more profound understanding of the material. The class could be improved by NOT having a flipped classroom and instead having the professor actually make lesson plans and teach the students as opposed to having the students do all the work.",
                "I thought the flipped classroom was an excellent way to engage with organic chemistry content. It wasn't everyone's cup of tea, but for someone who struggles to self study on my own, it really encouraged me to keep practicing the content in order to be successful.",
                "Strengths: great support from TAs and peer tutors.\r\nWeaknesses: flipped classroom. We were required to learn all of the material through reading the textbook, which was the least effective way to learn the material. We were expected to read so many pages, and the textbook always had significantly more information than what was expected of us in class, however we were still expected to learn all of it. In class, we focused on doing practice problems, which defeated the purpose of having discussion sections, since we would also spend those doing more problems. If we had a traditional lecture, it would have been much more efficient because we could focus on learning what was expected of us and then use the discussion to practice. Flipped classroom was a poor way of learning. We were told that it would help for exams by not having to cram, but what ended up happening is that we had no practice problems for the exam, leaving us with very few resources to study with.",
                "I really appreciated all the TFs and Peer tutors that held lots of office hours to help me improve my skills.",
                "Strengths are that the TAs were really great. I would say that the class should not be advertised as flipped classroom because although it was a bit different, it was not completely flipped. Advertising it as flipped makes less students go to class.",
                "Strengths: collaborative and interesting. I found it really cool to be able to learn the molecular orbital theory behind reactions. The tfs were extremely helpful and I like how we often had practice questions during lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some concepts I did not pick up from the textbook the first time reading, and we're not explained thoroughly in class, leading to me to be confused about certain topics for a long time.",
                "Although I understand the merits of the flipped class design, I  personally was not a fan of it. I also wish there would have been more practice materials provided before each exam.",
                "This course had very fair exams and I never left an exam thinking that the course hadn't prepared me or that the instructors were trying to trick me with any of the questions. Additionally, all of the TF's and peer tutors were very helpful and went out of their way to help us learn and understand the material. Overall, there was a lot of support for students through office hours and study halls. A weakness of this course is that it is taught at 9 am on science hill, which is brutal for a lot of students to go to. On top of this the structure of the class worked best if more students went to lecture. The combination of these two things just really was not pretty and I don't think any class that actually wants students to show up should be scheduled at this time especially all the way up on science hill. Also, since the time slot is an hour and 15 minutes, I think they could keep the \"flipped classroom\" aspect of the course while also including more of a lecture-esque style maybe towards the start of class, or at least an overview of the content students were supposed to learn before class. This way the practice problems done in class will make more sense coming after a brief overview, and the lecturer can make sure we are learning the material in a way that emphasizes the most important takeaways and prepares us for exams.",
                "Strengths were I learned a lot. Weaknesses is that this class broke me more than any class ever before. Would not recommend unless you need to.",
                "I found the discussion sections and TA discussion section materials to be very helpful for this course. They effectively summarized everything covered in class and were very easy to understand. I believe that the main weakness of this class overall was the flipped classroom format. I found it very difficult to keep up with the material and often fell behind and was left confused in lecture. I personally was only able to actually learn the course material by attending discussion sections every week. In addition, the assignments that we were required to do before coming to class didn't really help me understand what was going on in lecture. I found the main textbook for the course to be too dense and it over-complicated the material that we learned. The achieve homework also didn't help me to learn the material and I was just guessing most of the time. Students should know that the Klein textbook does a really good job of summarizing course material and gives a good foundation for everything we learn in class.",
                "The greatest weakness of this course is its flipped classroom learning style. The expectation that students take 4-6 hours learning the material outside of class (in addition to practicing and drilling the material and studying for other classes) is absolutely unrealistic and impracticable. As a consequence, the course moves at a pace that makes it incredibly difficult to keep up. On some class days, the syllabus would instruct students to read 2 whole chapters to be prepared for the class the next day. Moreover, the practice done in class with the professor would not mirror the exams at all. The strength of this course was undoubtedly the TAs of this course who were absolutely the best I have ever had the pleasure of working with. They were patient, understanding, knowledgeable, and above all else willing to take out more time than they did explaining concepts that were hastily covered in lecture.",
                "Something that is both a strength and weakness of this course is the flipped classroom style. A strength was that it helped me learn the content very well because it forced me to see my own weaknesses in what I did or did not understand of the content. I had to figure out the best way to understand what we were expected to know. The weakness of this style is that it can be overwhelming to determine what we are or aren't expected to know for this course.",
                "This is a very difficult course. The discussion sections are good, the lectures are not bad, but there is A LOT of handwaving that makes it difficult to do well if you don't have a natural intuition for organic chemistry.",
                "This is genuinely one of the worst classes I have ever taken and it is all because of Tim. I realized by the end of this semester that I actually do enjoy organic chemistry and I'm excited to continue learning mechanisms next semester but I am even more excited that I'll be continuing to learn organic chemistry without Tim being in the picture. Assigned problem sets do not match the material being \"taught\" in class and are relatively unwieldy assignments.",
                "Although learning in a flipped classroom manner was challenging, I think the concept may work if students are taking fewer credits or learning Orgo during the summer. However with a heavy workload during the semester, this method of teaching was hard to keep up with. Nonetheless, attending lectures, rewatching lecture, revising and summarizing my notes, and attending office hours with TFs and peer tutors was helpful. Additionally, being able to do problems class where we could ask for assistance and work with peers helped solidify the information.",
                "Lots of office hours\r\nOnly downside is that if youre taking a heavy course load (example with physics 180 with Steinacker) the class becomes really hard, because the flipped format makes you have to spend more time on the material. If your other classes arent heavy this shouldnt be a problem.",
                "Strengths: strong teaching fellows, many opportunities to seek help during daily study halls and office hours.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Many. The flipped classroom model was ineffective; it would be much more effective to be taught principles of organic chemistry than to come into class without much of a conceptual understanding and learn every concept through youtube or organic chemistry websites. The professor was clearly not engaged with the class; the burden of the class's logistics (grading, making exams, teaching support) fell onto the course preceptor and the TF team; in fact, he was in Hawaii during our final exam. And despite the flipped classroom model's requirement to self-study, the amount of homework problems on Achieve could be an overload. 20-30 questions were due every 2 days, with a 45+ question PSET due on Fridays. With other classes, studying for the class AND completing homework assignments of that quantity was overwhelming and forced many students to prioritize completion of the Achieve questions without conceptually understanding concepts. Not to mention, the Achieve questions didn't test the same conceptual understanding as exams, and the professor explicitly told us to ignore Achieve questions during exam preparation. \r\n\r\nThe pacing of this class was also too rapid; concepts were learned in haste, and there were often periods between when exam content finished in lecture and exams themselves that would be filled with new content that wasn't learned. Exams were difficult and felt punitive. Lastly, the professor's emphasis on molecular orbital theory felt unnecessary; rather than clarifying concepts, it often obfuscated them. It was also difficult to find resources about MO theory independently considering most organic chemistry classes nationally do not utilize the MO framework.",
                "Great teachers. Tim and Dr. Clark were very kind and accommodating, and definitely made extra steps to help students understand material. Dr. Clark was super helpful and quick to respond to student inquiries. Great experience working with them both.",
                "One strength of this course is that every concept in framed in a way such that it builds off of something that we already learned. This made it easier to grasp onto new topics.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course is that the flipped format sometimes made it feel like we didn't have enough pure lecture time to cover all important topics.",
                "It's a solid intro to organic chemistry. The class's strength main strength is that the professors gave ample opportunities for students to improve their grades, with extra credit and test corrections both being offered. There were also practice exams for every midterm that were great representations of what our actual exam looked like. A weakness is that the course was flipped-classroom style, which means the majority of learning rests on the students. However, I feel like as the class went on, we steered slightly away from the flipped style, and the professor taught the material more.",
                "Strengths: Many of the TAs this semester were awesome and really cared about everything in the course, especially Aaron, Jihyeon, and Ramsey!\r\nWeaknesses: The emphasis on group problems, and the 9 am attendance checks were very frustrating, especially when I had to juggle other classes. I also wish that both the Achieve and the textbook better aligned with the actual curriculum, as I abandoned the textbook after the first midterm because I found lots of the material to be irrelevant.",
                "The strengths of this course include useful achieve problems. The weakness of this course was that it was a flipped class which was confusing at times as organic chemistry is a challenging course.",
                "Strengths: TAs and preceptor and professor - the entire teaching team was great, the flipped classroom model was jarring at first but very helpful, and the resources throughout the class to ensure that we learned the material were extremely helpful. The extra credit opportunities also were great! Weaknesses: at times the class felt very disorganized (exam)",
                "Strength: I like the emphasis in understanding the \"why\" of organic chemistry \r\nWeakness: With the flipped classroom setting, this class was was a lot of independent learning on top of three weekly homework psets so it was a big time chunk. I did enjoy doing practice problems in class, but I feel like there could be more of a balance between lecturing and doing in class problems so the class didn't feel like so much of a burden outside of class.",
                "Class was great! Wouldnt change anything",
                "The flipped classroom structure is hard to get used to, as the class does not make sense unless you read the textbook. This can make it really hard to stay engaged with the content if you aren't prepared, but it makes full sense if you have read the material. Tim is a strength, he's an amazing instructor and really fun and charismatic. I also thought a lot of the collaborative aspects of the course were very well done, as it made it easy to make friends and understand concepts by both talking about them with others and learning in a group setting.",
                "This exam should not be a flipped classroom, but the rest of the teaching and support was fantastic.",
                "Weakness = flipped classroom",
                "Strengths: because the topics were very challenging you learned a lot. Weakness: the flex learning set off of this class made it 10000x more difficult than it should have been. The material was too challenging to learn completely on your own. I ended up having to watch countless YouTube videos when we could have been learning the material in lecture. The amount of time put into this class was insane for the what it should have been.",
                "The course was flipped format, meaning we were responsible for previewing, learning, and reading up on the material before lectures. A heavy course schedule can make this very difficult. Moreover, the lectures did not always follow what was listed in the syllabus, particularly toward the end of the semester. Furthermore, there were so many Achieve assignments at times that it was difficult to find time to study and learn the material. Overall, I wished that this course was not flipped. That being said, there were many opportunities for help if needed. However, because the class size is so big, finding 1-on-1 help was basically impossible. More peer tutors would be helpful in the future. Regarding course materials, there were practice exams given ahead of the real thing but the answer keys often had messy handwriting, making them hard to read and difficult to decipher why exactly an answer is correct.",
                "The flipped classroom model was not compatible with the amount of homework students had. Many students were consistently behind because of this. In fact, I learned very little during class and most of my learning came from using supplemental materials outside of class (Youtube videos, etc). Again, the majority of students were not engaged in class due to a combination of the teaching model, the overwhelming workload, and the instructor who was very poor at explaining concepts.",
                "This class is very intense and will take up a disproportionate amount of time compared to other classes, which can feel like you are missing out on other classes. I also felt like the class went very very fast.",
                "The quality of the TFs and the review materials offered were major strengths of this course. While there were many strengths in the syllabus of this course as well, I thought a fundamental weakness was the flipped-class method. It was often unclear what units we were expected to know for the following class, making it difficult to follow along. Additionally, the homework was not always calibrated to the coursework.",
                "The flipped classroom format is not good for this class.",
                "One main weakness is that the class was taught reverse-classroom style. I found this extremely difficult and time consuming outside the classroom. One strength is the amount of help we were able to receive from TA's and tutors",
                "I though that the flipped classroom structure was not beneficial and that teaching the material directly would make the course stronger. I thought the TFs were a good support system, but overall my main concern was that teaching ourselves was counterproductive and that utilizing class time to lecture would be more efficient way to learn organic chemistry.",
                "This course was structured badly. It was taught as a flipped classroom, which is a fancy way of saying that the teacher assigns us work and we have to teach ourselves before the deadline. The very first class was spent trying to present us \"statistics\" about the success of a flipped classroom, but upon careful inspection all the data presented was faulty and biased towards the teacher's point of view (i.e. that flipped classrooms are good). I tried to be in lecture every day, but I always ended up getting nothing out of it because lecture time was spent by watching the professor draw molecules and sort of aimlessly talk about how to solve the problems. By the end of the course, only a small fraction of the total number of students actually showed up (the class was in Marsh hall, the biggest lecture hall available, and it was packed on the first day, but by the end, the hall was mostly empty). To compensate for the minimal lectures, the professor assigned an unreasonable amount of work: every single day there was something to do, and the assignments could take hours depending on how fast you are at solving the problems. Overall, I learned nothing from lectures, and got all my knowledge of organic chemistry by doing problems and learning tricks there, talking with friends, and by going to websites like Khan Academy, chem.libretexts.org, and others, which I could have done without going to Yale and spending thousands of dollars on my education.\r\n\r\nThe one good thing about the course were the TA's. When the professor did not teach anything, the TA's came through and put effort into their discussion sections. They always made clear and straightforward lectures and slides with supplementary problems that were simple and captured the important concepts. They were also always there for discussion via email if needed. Anything I did not learn from my own efforts, I learned from them. Those TA's deserve recognition for their excellent work this semester, especially given the poor overall organization of the class.\r\n\r\nI am saying all this in such strong words as a sign of respect. I believe the professors and the university should know how students truly feel so that positive changes can be made for everyone's benefit. I will not lie or dull my impressions to appear falsely polite.",
                "Strength is that good review sessions were held, however I found the flipped classroom format of the class to be very difficult to adapt to, which affected my overall performance in the course.",
                "The strengths were the office hours. The weaknesses were the lectures correlations with the homework and exam problems. I think this course could be improved if more time was spent in lecture and in homework on explaining things we are going to be tested on.",
                "The flipped course was NOT the move for this class. We had to do psets on achieve without learning the material on the psets. And during class it'd just be us doing a bunch of practice problems. The whole engagement thing is what discussion sections are for.",
                "Weaknesses: In-person lectures are useless and workload is obscene. I personally don't mind having a flipped classroom but don't be tricked--this is not a flipped classroom. All Newhouse does is give you vaguely defined sections of the book that you are expected to read and learn. There are no pre-recorded lectures or videos. You are supposed to learn everything on your own, which will be extremely frustrating unless you have all the time in the world to study organic chemistry. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the syllabus of this class in absolute trash. The teaching staff literally copy and pasted the table of topics from the book ad vertatim and assigned that as a syllabus. They did this even though we did not cover the complete books or all the topics in the sections related to the books.\r\n\r\nWorkload is insane. there were weeks were we had 5 assignments, and some going up to 60 problems each. I will not lie to the reader, if you want to succeed, a big part of organic chemistry with Newhouse will involve googling most of your psets and learning with YouTube. It's not pleasant, and it is honestly a shame such pedagogical attempt is called a class. As an international student, I sometimes question myself why I came to the US if I could have download the textbook and read it myself at home.\r\n\r\nStrenghts: The teaching assistants are a great resource, and most of them are available to help you understand. This does not make up for the lack of teaching, but it makes the experience less painful.",
                "strength: the TFs. They seriously helped with my understanding of the course by explaining concepts and providing notes on canvas. Reviews with Aaron helped a bit also. weakness: flipped course. I think it had potential but it honestly did not help in my learning. Having to learn everything before lectures took up a lot of my time at night when I had other assignments. I always felt like I was expected to understand everything when in reality, I did not. It did improve when Tim began explaining the concepts during class.",
                "I appreciate all of the helpful TAs and study halls. The pacing of lecture was a bit difficult to follow at times. I recognize the advantages of the flipped classroom style, but I would have appreciated just a few more minutes every class spent overviewing the larger conceptual ideas before diving immediately into practice problems.",
                "This course is taught in a flipped-classroom setting, meaning that majority of the learning happens outside of the classroom. The instructor teaches us nothing we need to know, and students are expected to learn it all from reading the textbook on their own time. This is the greatest weakness of this course. I believe that the flipped classroom style can be successful, but not in this way. Flipped classroom is successful when the students are given structured materials to learn from, like pre-recorded video lectures or worksheets. On the other hand, when expected to navigate entire chapters to read during the little time in between lectures and basically self-teach, many students get lost and are completely confused when asked to do a problem in the given lecture time. Additionally, the lectures themselves were confusing and used terminology that many students didnt quite understand yet, and many of my peers and I were left extremely discouraged after every lecture. I believe that organic chemistry should not be an extremely intimidating course and should instead be an opportunity to learn and challenge oneself, but the way this course was taught did not foster this positive environment.",
                "The strengths of this class is the conceptual aspect of the class. It was conducted in a way that truly helps to understand organic chemistry rather than pure memorization. I like how this class prepares you to use previous knowledge to understand new knowledge. The class builds on previous lessons which makes studying for the final a lot less difficult. However, a weakness of this class is how fast paced the class is. If you are not keeping up with the content, then the class is extremely easy to fall behind in. An improvement would be to have alternative readings or videos to refer to rather than just the textbook. Although the textbook has several information, it is not how most people learn, especially me. To excel in this course, there definitely needs to be alternative resources available.",
                "I wish there was more guidance in lecture during the beginning of the course, because personally I have gotten used to MO theory only towards the end. The end of the course felt like less of the flipped format, and I definitely learned more through lectures that way than heavily reading the textbook in the beginning.",
                "The strength of this course were the TAs for this class. The weaknesses included the flipped classroom style which was an utter failure. We were supposed to spend \"3-4 hours\" before each class and prepare the content we would cover, teach ourselves the materials, and come to class to do group problems. However, since we also had discussion sections, there was no point in having group problems during class when we could have actually been taught the material during lecture. Instead, I had do use outside resources and teach myself the majority of the content. The first day of class, we looked at data and graphs that supported the idea of a flipped classroom and why it was effective. The rest of the semester, proved how flipped classroom was not effective and useless for a large lecture class teaching an incredibly hard topic such as organic chemistry.",
                "The course had many opportunities to engage with TAs and student assistants that provided a lot of insight into how to approach and solve problems. The homework assignments often required using the support systems in order to complete them within the given time table. The flipped classroom was helpful in providing students more practice during class time, but a times the \"why\" for how things took place was lacking and hard to replicate for success in the course.",
                "pretty shocking course",
                "I had to learn most information on my own. Class time was spent practicing what the instructor expected us to already know.",
                "The provided lecture material was poor. If you went to lectures, you got a random outline of the course information. To do well in the course, students were required to figure out a large portion of the course material on their own time through outside sources. Because the professor spent class doing practice problems, it felt like only some examples were being in taught in class. Providing stronger class notes or prerecorded lectures to supplement would be extremely helpful. I understand that having a flipped classroom is beneficial, but it is entirely unfair to have a flipped classroom without providing lectures or notes to learn from at home. It felt like the professors were getting out of really teaching because I had to teach myself all the course material to be able to decipher the problems gone through in class.",
                "I did not like the flipped classroom style. It felt like I was teaching myself the material. The TAs and discussion sections were very helpful.",
                "I liked that we were given practice problems to work on during class. I think although there are noticeable faults to a flipped classroom, I appreciated the overload of practice problems. The major weakness of the class is the flipped style. There was no formal lecture and the professors expected you to learn mechanisms and reactions through reading the textbook. The textbook was REALLY BAD and was not conducive to student learning AT ALL. Without a formal lecture, we had to turn to YouTube to learn most of the reactions and mechanisms, but this was also difficult because there wasn't a clear gauge of how much we were supposed to know. I wish there had been a compiled list of reactions we're expected to know and a sub list of reaction mechanisms that we're expected to know. There's so much resources online, but they become more detrimental than helpful when you overconsume content that isn't really tested.",
                "The biggest weakness of how this course was taught was the flipped course system. Professor Newhouse expected all students to read numerous chapters out of the textbook and understand the material before coming to lecture each week, and realistically, I felt that this was not very considerate of students' busy schedules and other class work. Instead of learning content and going through the concepts, we spent most lectures just going over group problems with classmates sitting nearby. This was also not effective for me, or my groupmates because we weren't able to get feedback most of the time, since it was a big lecture and there were only so many TF's and peer tutors to go around the whole class. There was only so much we could learn on our own and during our discussion sections, which were only once a week. The professor and lectures should be there for students to supplement what we learn from our readings, however, Professor Newhouse expected us to gain most of our knowledge through our own self-studying and textbook readings.",
                "I did not like the flipped version of the class because with soccer, it was almost impossible to commit to 4 hours before every class prepping it.",
                "Having a traditional teaching style. Having a flipped classroom was very discouraging and put too much pressure on the students.",
                "The flipped classroom style doesnt leave a lot of room for feedback on a students work. The TFs can only provide so much information during the class, and the Achieve homework only allows for very specific problems that arent reflective of the in-depth understanding required for the class.",
                "This course was done in a flipped classroom, so the strengths in instruction came from the students and TF's, not the instructor. The weaknesses of this course were that if you were confused, the only solution was to go to office hours/study halls at night to talk with the TFs, which is inconvenient.",
                "The TFs and peer tutors for the course were incredible. I would not have gotten through the course without their help. \r\nThe flipped classroom format made learning extremely difficult. A lot of my peers and I felt we never adequately learned the content outside of class and thus were unable to learn in class, which assumed knowledge that would traditionally be delivered in lecture. But even if the instructors feel the instructors feel wedded to the flipped classroom approach (which is understandable because it's a cool idea), there is a lot they can do to make sure they aren't leaving so many students to fend for themselves. \r\nFirst, the out-of-class work shouldn't consist solely of readings. Most STEM classes already assign pre-class reading, and it is understood that students need to see content again in class (in an audiovisual, as opposed to textual, way) to fully understand it. Math 120 uses a flipped classroom, and we watched lectures the instructor made before coming to class each day. But there were no pre-class lectures in Organic Chemistry this semester, so it was like we were trying to teach ourselves the content instead of learning from someone who I'm sure would be a great lecturer.\r\nSecond, the instructors should make the Klein textbook required and the Loudon textbook optional (instead of the reverse). The Klein textbook made so much more sense and was so much better for looking at content for the first time. Instead, a lot of students never learned that they should use the Klein textbook simply because they weren't friends with the right people.",
                "The weakness of this course was the lack of instruction from the lecturer- Timothy Newhouse. His theory on \"backwards learning\" sounded great in theory, but we were rarely provided resources outside of the textbook that matched what we would be assessed on. The homework on Achieve rarely lined up with what was being discussed in class or in the reading. Learning about MO theory, a huge basis of this class, is something I have found to be quite helpful in doing organic chemistry. However, it was rarely mentioned in the textbook and barely exists in online resources. This would have been fine if we were provided a strong foundation of MO theory in lectures. However, this was not the case.",
                "I believe this course has no notable strengths and that anything positive is severely outweighed by how horrific this class was. \r\n\r\nThis course is obviously meant to be challenging but the way it was structured and run meant that everything was made more complicated than it had to be and students spent hours a week doing busy work (online Achieve problem sets that Tim himself said were not useful for our tests).\r\n\r\nAs bad as this class is, it really wouldn't take much to improve it. All this LECTURE course needs is LECTURING. Class periods are solely devoted to problem-solving which is difficult to do without having a strong grasp of the concepts (which can be hard to achieve merely from a textbook). If teaching ourselves organic chemistry simply through a textbook and online videos were really the best way to learn, I think we would have forfeited typical class structures a long time ago. \r\n\r\nOrganic chemistry cannot be self taught. At least not in any sort of efficient fashion. I really don't know what I paid for. Tim placed a very unfair burden on the TAs who had to explain virtually everything. \r\n\r\nIf you need to take orgo, DO NOT do it with Tim. I have heard that other professors make this course bearable.",
                "The weakness is that learning is likely not universal because level of engagement, success, and leaning is dependent on how much he student puts into the class and engages with their instructor and Teaching Fellow. Additional weakness: this course assumes you have some knowledge in MO theory already.\r\n\r\nStrength is a great introduction into organic chemistry.",
                "Strengths: the tests are fair and well made, the TAs are excellent, the class is not curved so students are not incentivized to compete with each other. \r\nWeaknesses: there is little to no top down instruction (all learning is self-taught or done through the TAs), the Achieve homework assignments are excessive, tedious, and not particularly helpful, the textbook (which is supposed to be the main source of learning) often does not align with the primary material that appears on the tests.",
                "Flipped classroom is clearly a torture tactic invented by the devil.  Whoever thought this was a good format for what was already a notoriously difficult class really ought to find a different line of work.",
                "I disliked the way this class was taught. There was little teaching in the classroom and everything had to be done individually. Class time could have been helpful by going through examples, but the professor moved quickly past each concept and definitely taught as if assuming every student had the same baseline and same level of knowledge."

                "If you love chemistry, or if this class is a prerequisite that you must fulfill, Id suggest taking it.",
                "Yes! Only if you are really interested in chemistry",
                "Absolutely. Professor Clark and Professor Newhouse were fantastic teachers and very supportive.",
                "Never",
                "No. Obviously if you have to take it, do, but I would make sure that your schedule is very light so that you have enough time to dedicate to the course, otherwise you genuinely will not do well. I would also avoid taking the course with Tim in particular if you expect to be taught how to do things in class.",
                "Yes!! You learn a lot.",
                "Yes! I personally enjoyed Orgo because it's literally just drawing and it's considered STEM (plus I loved making cute notes for the class). The difficult part of the class in knowing how exactly to draw the structures, knowing which this go where, and how the different structures are visualized, change, and are described. If you are not a big fan of gen chem because of the math, Orgo will be much easier to learn since there absolutely no math. My biggest piece of advice would be to do a lotttt of practice problems. Do as many retrosynthesis/synthesis practice problems with your friends and soon enough you'll know all the reactions you need to know along with their reagents, regiochemistry, and stereochemistry.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if it is a requirement. Just make sure you are ready to put in a substantial amount of work in because there is a learning curve.",
                "If they needed it for major requirements then yes. Otherwise, the flipped classroom course could be found online.",
                "I feel like it's a good overview of organic chemistry, but if the class is still a flipped classroom, you should be prepared to know that the workload is balanced in a very different way from classes that you may have taken previously. Tim is great though. He very much wants everyone to succeed and provided lots of opportunities to help us out.",
                "Unless youre regally interested in chemistry/youre premed/its your major, I would not recommend.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student because of what I stated above, however I would tell them to take this course at another institution or for pass/fail at Yale.",
                "No, unless it it required for their major.",
                "Unless its for premed or your major, then no.",
                "If you are a premed or chemistry major then yes.",
                "I would not unless a requirement because of how badly it was taught. I normally love science, but this course left me feeling frustrated.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you are a premed student. It was the class that I spent the majority of my time on.",
                "If you're interested in organic chemistry, I would recommend this course. Otherwise, be ready to work very hard to do well.",
                "I would recommend this course to other pre-med students.",
                "No because it is taught very badly and in a manner that makes students feel as though they have to teach themselves everything. Since most students in this class are premed and already taking extremely hard classes alongside this one, it makes learning in this class a lot more difficult because you would need a million hours to understand the concepts in this class since we get little guidance.",
                "If you have to take organic chemistry, taking it with Tim Newhouse is your best bet. He gave us extra credit and correction opportunities for each test, and it was obvious that he truly wanted us to succeed. I ended my Gen Chem career with a B, and will end up with an A in organic chemistry. I think that's a true testament to his teaching.",
                "Definitely not if it's not a requirement. I think it can be an interesting class, but the amount of work you have to put in makes it not worth it.",
                "I would recommend it if it is a requirement. The flipped classroom format is very controversial among students, so if you like more lecture-style courses I would not recommend the class.",
                "Yes, but only if it is required and/or they are super interested in chemistry.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. Organic chemistry is a fascinating field and this class goes through the fundamental mechanisms and concepts in detail.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone required to take it for their major or premed requirements. The only case in which I would recommend it to students who would take it for fun is if they have already taken orgo in high school and are just REALLY interested in the subject.",
                "Honestly no like if youre really trying to challenge yourself for no reason sure but unless you have to take it save yourself girl. This was hard as hell and had me studying night and mf day so do yourself a favor!!",
                "I would recommend this course to students because I find organic chemistry to be an interesting topic that is rewarding to learn about. However, I don't believe that the flipped classroom format works for everyone.",
                "Only to satisfy requirements, otherwise no.",
                "I would recommend orgo to another student but I would caution them to avoid taking it with Tim Newhouse if at all possible.",
                "Yes, but you have to be prepared to put in a lot of work and to spend a lot of time trying to comprehend the content instead of just memorizing. Once you learn why reactions work they way they do, you wont forget it and youll actually be able to recall it during exams without feeling like you have to many things to keep track off. But again, this requires a lot of time and effort. So dont overload your other classes when planning to take this course.",
                "Yes, organic chemistry is great, just be sure you can handle the workload out of class.",
                "It's a required course for premeds and certain STEM majorsif you fall into those categories, then you have to take the class. I'd recommend finding a solid study group to help get through the class. But otherwise, noit's a poorly taught and demanding class that puts too much onus on students to independently learn organic chemistry.",
                "Yes!!!!!!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it taught me how to learn in a different way. It wasn't the stereotypical organic chemistry course that mostly focuses on memorization, and I am walking away feeling that I truly understand most of the topics we learned.",
                "I would recommend this to someone that really enjoys puzzles and chemistry...and obviously if this meets a requirement for pre-med or your major.",
                "I would recommend this class to other students in certain circumstances. I really appreciated the emphasis on understanding concepts and MO Theory, as opposed to having to blindly memorize tons of reactions. However, this is not a class for everyone, and I also had difficulty memorizing the reactions and grasping concepts in the final third of the semester.",
                "If you are not absolutely required to take this course, then DO NOT take it. It was the worst class I have ever taken.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless necessary.",
                "You likely have to take this class if it is a requirement",
                "If you are interested in chemistry and enjoy problem solving, its a great course",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are planning to do anything in the natural sciences. Tim is very good at explaining the chemical concepts of Organic Chemistry and relating it to a broader context, which helps connect the small-scale chemistry with large-scale world topics. The course is really hard, though, so unless you are willing to put in the effort it may not be worth it.",
                "If it is a requirement or if the student is interested and has free time to dedicate to the course.",
                "Only if you need to take it for a requirement, otherwise no.",
                "If you do not have this course as a prerequisite, do not take it.",
                "No, I would not recommend. Especially if the course is taught by this instructor with flipped classroom. It is better to wait until next semester.",
                "If you want a challenge, take this class! It is not for the feeble minded though.",
                "Yes, but only during a time when you are able to put in adequate time.",
                "No, I think I would only recommend if it is a requirement or there is already a strong interest in organic chemistry. However, for a typical student who does not find chemistry interesting, this class would not win you over.",
                "Unfortunately, if you are a biology or a chemistry major, this course is required.\r\nIf a student is in any major that does not require this course, they should not take it given how much Yale costs and the expectation of this course that you will teach yourself, although you could always teach yourself through things like Khan Academy for free. \r\n\r\nI am saying all this in such strong words as a sign of respect. I believe the professors and the university should know how students truly feel so that positive changes can be made for everyone's benefit. I will not lie or dull my impressions to appear falsely polite.",
                "Yes, only if it is a requirement or you genuinely love organic chemistry.",
                "While this course was difficult, I would recommend it to someone because I ended up really liking doing organic chemistry problems at the end of the semester",
                "No. Well, maybe with another professor, like Dr. Dimeglio or Dr. Herzon. But still no.",
                "I do not recommend taking Organic Chemistry with Professor Newhouse to any student. Take if if you must, but if you can take it on another semester, you will save a lot of frustration and stress by taking it with another professor more invested in your learning. At Yale, you will find many classes that will enable your learning a lot, others not so much, and others that are ulcer-inducing. CHEM 220 with Professor Newhouse, unfortunately fits the latter description.\r\n\r\nThis whole class is a mess. From the lack of teaching to the unreasonable workload, this class will make you unhappy and kill any interest you might have in organic chemistry and maybe chemistry in general. I am usually the student that can't get by with bad teaching as long as the content is interesting. But with this class, it was enough. I could have learned so much more if I and my classmates had not been left to \"drown and learn.\" I spent so much hours in this class just to have a basic grasp of the field. And this is not because organic chemistry is necessarily hard, but because the class makes learning about organic chemistry unnecessarily hard.",
                "Meh, not really. But if you have to take it, then just know that having 1-3 people in the course who can help you and study with you is necessary. Coming from someone who completed the gen chem sequence alone, I definitely could not have completed this class without having other people. The course also challenges you in a way that many courses had not before so be prepared for that.",
                "I would recommend this class to other students. It's important to keep an open-mind when approaching this class as the style is pretty unique. However, in the end, I think the application and problem-solving focused style of the lecture was more beneficial than a typical lecture class.",
                "Yes. There are a lot of resources for this course in terms of study halls and office hours; taking advantage of those resources is necessary to succeed in this course.",
                "Only if this course is a necessary requirement for major or program.",
                "I would truly recommend this course to another student. I think although the flipped classroom does suck, it isn't that much work, you just need to really put in the effort. I took my first exam, and it was not my finest work; however, I soon learned how to study for Tim's exams. Instead of trying to memorize all the information, it is important to ask the question why. When I studied differently, I was able to perform better on exams. If you study for the course in the right way, then the exams are easier. However, flipped classroom is a lot of work, so I would only recommend taking organic chemistry if you are willing to put in the effort.",
                "I would recommend this course to other student, but in the beginning there may be a possibility that you will feel lost with the flipped classroom format.",
                "Only to premed students and bio and chem majors who need to take it.",
                "I would recommend this course for students who want to learn more about chemistry and are interested in developing their knowledge in the course. It is hard to recommend this class for students because they may be unaware of the high demands of the course and the expectations of people who are enrolled.",
                "absolutely not.",
                "Yes but only because I enjoyed organic chemistry as a subject and because it is a pre med requirement",
                "I really love chemistry and overall the course material was not exceptionally difficult, but the poor organization of this class makes it difficult to love. If you do not have an aptitude or desire to learn chemistry, I would not take this course. However, if you do, it will not be as bad as organic chemistry is famed to be (however a few adjustments from professor would make it considerably better!!).",
                "Yes! Though it is difficult, it creates a great foundation for chemistry!",
                "Yes. Although there are clear faults with this class structure, I really did enjoy organic chemistry and learned a lot more than I ever did in Gen Chem. This class is pretty enjoyable once you get into a rhythm and find a structure that works for you.",
                "I know this is a prerequisite for a lot of majors, especially pre-meds, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend learning orgo under this professor.",
                "I would recommend it, but with caution. It's a lot of individual work.",
                "Not unless you need it. It is probably better to take the class as a sophomore than as a first year.",
                "No.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. The flipped classroom makes learning extremely challenging and makes what should be a fun subject into a painful experience. I decided not to major in chemistry because of this class. If you have to take this class because it is a requirement, here is my advice: --use the Klein textbook - it's a godsend and explains concepts in a comprehensible way (unlike the Loudon textbook, which is for some reason listed as the main book). --go to the office hours and ask questions there-the TAs are very kind and good at explaining things",
                "I would recommend this course to other students. However, I would strongly advise against taking it with Timothy Newhouse as the lecturer. Once I had taught myself much of the information, I genuinely enjoyed solving problems and found organic chemistry to be much like puzzles. My experience with Professor Newhouse, however, tainted much of my learning experience in a way I have never found any course to have done before.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to my worst enemy.",
                "You have to take it for medical school and most sciences degrees. However, if you are not required to take it, I only recommend taking this course if you can allocate a lot of time to studying and/or prepping for every class.",
                "I recommend this class to any student that is academically self-sufficient enough to learn difficult organo-chemical concepts without any formal instruction (i.e. through reading the textbook, watching videos, etc.). Relying on lecture as a means of learning concepts will simply not work. If one is capable of learning independently, then this class is very manageable.",
                "If you're reading this, it's because you have to take this course and you're scared of how bad it's gonna be.  So here's my advice: find a study group, find a favourite caffeine source, and brace for impact.  You'll survive but it'll take a lot out of you.",
                "This course is required for some majors and pre-med requirements, but otherwise I would not recommend this class."
