I knew that I am not talented when it comes to 2D art, but 3D art is very satisfying and this course was well-suited to let me explore. The initial prompt was a challenge in and of itself, as finding a reasonable object (i.e. no couches, fences, or giant Panasonic TVs) that spoke to me proved difficult. This course also pushed me to manage my time as efficiently as possible, as coming in outside of class hours needed to be incorporated into my routine.",

                "Good crit structure and class vibes and organization",
                "Strengths: Sandra and my TA Pap were both so supportive of all of my classmates and I genuinely just got to play around and explore, which was the best part of this class. All of my classmates and I got so close to each other, Sandra, and Pap which was so fun, in addition to being able to flex a different part of my brain. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: only got to do about 2 projects, but that had more to do with COVID and absences due to COVID than anything else.",
                "I loved how we were given free-reign on our projects and could explore in a really open-ended way. I found that to be a really fruitful way to understand my own voice",
                "A strength is the teacher- Sandra is incredible. Another strength is having the classroom workspace available. It is so, so nice to have somewhere that is the classs to work in and leave projects in.\r\nA weakness might be that some students were aware of how flexible and kind our teacher was, and didnt put in an amount of effort that added to the environment."

                "Yes, I believe Sandra provided an environment in which I felt safe to learn, ask questions and make mistakes. Sandra was extremely flexible with deadlines due to Covid. She allowed us to experiment with our works and try new things.I thoroughly enjoyed Sandras class and I hope to take an intermediate version in the future!",

                "Yes!",
