I've also gained a much greater knowledge of ancient and pre-modern Chinese history and many cultural aspects of China. Moreover, as a political science student, a class rooted in history gives context and greater understanding of the current political situation in and around China. I also have a much greater understanding of the border conflicts around China and why they are occuring.\r\n\r\nThis class also helped me develop greater essay-writing skills and improve my history essay skills in particular.",

                "I developed writing skills and learned how to be more brief in my writing without losing meaning or important information. I also learned how to better analyze a primary source and use them for larger purposes.",
                "I, of course, learned a great deal not only about Chinese history but also about how that history influences or is used by those of the present. I think more generally I also learned more about what it means to study and interrogate history this being something I had never done in college before.",

                "The readings are very good! The lectures are interesting on their own, but not too cohesive as a whole. I thought every single assignment was, unfortunately, really not helpful to facilitate or demonstrate learning.",
                "Strength:\r\nThe readings are interesting and engaging.\r\nThe lectures are easy to follow and points lead into one another in a very reasonable and memorable way.\r\nThe structure of the class (where we went from Modern China (or close to modern China), went back in time, and then came back to the modern period armed with the context of the past was super interesting and a fun way to structure a class.\r\nHigh engagement with modern China and news sources both from and about China, from a variety of perspectives.\r\nInteresting guest speakers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe structure, while super interesting, can occasionally be a little confusing, but I think this is overtaken by the new perspective it gives.",
                "I can see the antithesis for the three different sections but would have preferred more focus on just the broad history of China and then keeping the last section on how the PRC came to power and Chinese international relations for the past hundred years. While I did learn new things about the Covid outbreak during the first section the whole time I was just a bit put off since I, at least, am somewhat media-logged with Covid news after 2 years of the stuff. Maybe throw it in at the end to show how the PRC has responded and such in the past 2 years? I did like how each week while there were readings about the history of China there were also accompanying news articles which really tied stuff to the present. I also liked how we tried to go into the minds of the CCP and see why they were doing the things they're doing. By learning their history and ambitions it was easy to draw connections to their modern-day actions.",
                "The grading is very tough and the TAs are not very helpful.",
                "This course was certainly pretty solid, albeit unexceptional, for the most part. Prof Hansen clearly knows what she is talking about, that is for sure. She is super knowledgeable and passionate about the subject matter. My section leader (Tom Santa Maria) was tremendous--extremely personable, funny, and gave some great writing feedback I definitely lacked in high school. A large weakness is that assignments and grading could be unclear, it felt like Hansen was pulling grades out of a hat sometimes for sure.",
                "The strength of this class is certainly the professor. Professor Hansen is a very good teacher and knows the content of the class very well. Her connection and experience in East Asia is also a huge plus for the class. One weakness of the class is that the readings that were assigned were sometimes not relevant to the content of the class. Sometimes the readings would be on a time or subject that was only talked about for a very short amount of time or not at all.",
                "Generally, I think the course was a very strong one. It was interesting and engaging. In terms of weaknesses: I did sometimes wonder at the organization of the course it wasn't quite a survey course of Chinese history, but it didn't necessarily feel very specific either. Of course, I understand that an overview of Chinese history would be difficult to accomplish because there is so much of it, but I feel like the workload of the course could be heavier if it would also mean more content covered. I also found myself wishing for more engaged sections, though this may have more to do with those in the section than with the organization of the class. Lastly, while generally fair, the grading did feel at times feel inconsistent.",
                "Overall very high opinion of this course. No weaknesses to speak of.",
                "Really a lot of readings! A bit too much.",
                "Strengths: Straight forward material about Chinese history was provided during bi-weekly lectures. These powerpoint slides were easy to review and understand in preparation for our final project. I liked how we analyzed different regions in China and their peculiarities.\r\n\r\nImprovements: It would be helpful if we stuck to the \"Present to Past\" timeline; often, it felt like we were bouncing between present and past and it made it a little bit confusing to understand Chinese history.",
                "Overall really solid course, potentially more involved writing assignments because as of now it is not writing intensive enough for a writing credit.",
                "I think the lectures provide enough outlines to the course material that a student can succeed by taking the lecture info and the primary sources together.",
                "Strengths: 1. Professor Hanson is a great lecturer. 2. Interesting course material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The qing and song time periods were not covered in depth, I wish we went into more detail."

                "This would be a very good extra class for a political science student or similar student trying to get a better grasp on Modern China and how it developed to become the country it is today. I'm not a history major, but I've heard positive associations with it on that point as well.\r\nIf you want to get a good grasp on Modern China, and learn how the past relates to the modern world, this is a perfect class for you. If you're looking for a class that purely engages with the past or historical events, this may not be a perfect match for you, but in general, I suggest anyone with an interest in international relations or modern China take this class!",
                "If you want some basics of how China got to where it is today then this class will help. The last section is a nice discussion of current events and Chinese territorial disputes that is sure to help anyone be an informed reader of future Chinese actions.",
                "No, because I think the course is disorganized and the grading is not representative of your work or effort.",
                "For sure. It's not a gut, I'm not sure why people rate it that way on course table. The material is interesting (except for the family unit, lol) and looking back I've actually learned a lot about Chinese history and modern China. I certainly have a much better idea about how and why the country interacts the way they do with the outside world. China is a rising power, and if you want to learn more, certainly take this class. Grading was kind of unclear though...",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The professor is very engaging and provides excellent feedback on assignments. It was also very interesting to take a history course that didn't necessarily follow the linear flow of time, although sometimes the class felt like it was a bit all over the place. If you are looking to learn about Chinese history and work on writing, I would certainly recommend this class.",
                "I would recommend the course to another student. I think the class would be, of course, most interesting for those who are actually interested in the subject matter  if you don't do the reading or attend lecture, the class will not be very thrilling, but that's true for all classes.",
                "yes absolutely, super valuable writing help and engaging course topics.",
                "Yes, I think I would.",
                "Yes, if you wish to learn more about China.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in a very solid introduction to (mainly) modern China with a focus on the Qing dynasty and contemporary issues.",
                "If you have an understanding of China, whether modern or past, then yes you should take it. If you don't, take it if you want to read about it and listen to it through lectures. Keep in mind that while this class has a low workload, you have less chances to improve your grade. The final presentation is nice though as it boosted everyone's grade because traditionally everyone does well on it.",
                "Yeah, great course, learned really interesting stuff, good professor, not too much work",
                "I would; given scrutiny around China today, this course can help a student to better understand the conflicts.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone seeking an introductory course to China. The strength of this course is that it incorporates both past and present elements, which is essential to understanding Modern China. I would not recommend this course to any student who already is significantly knowledgeable about Chinese history and current political events.",
                "Yes because It is a very chill class. But you shouldnt take it if you arent interested in China."
