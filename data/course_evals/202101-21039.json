                "Strength: Professor Strack is very knowledgeable\r\nWeakness: we were shown a lot of abstract math / proofs that we did not need to know for assignments or exams",
                "It felt like the instructor (Strack) was pretty checked out - I get that it's hard to be engaged with a class over Zoom, but he pretty much reproduced his online notes with no deviations every class, meaning that there was no point in ever attending.\r\n\r\nThe problem sets, while having some good/challenging problems on them from week to week, were sort of trivialized by the fact that the TA would answer every question in detail during office hours. On one hand, this was definitely helpful when the psets coincided with other deadlines. On the other hand, it made it easy to get by with zero engagement with the material. The midterm was also absurdly easy, exacerbating the aforementioned issue.\r\n\r\nOverall, I just feel like I learned way less than I expected - 351 is supposed to be the capstone course in a sense for the Econ/Math major, and I feel extremely meh about the experience overall.",
                "Strength -- you learn a lot from nothing. \r\nWeakness -- I wish we had covered more applications, although I know were limited time-wise!!",
                "I think the problem sets were really helpful in learning the material. I think the grading of the course is a bit strange; there is a much higher level of scrutiny in the grading of answers on the exams than on the problem sets, which made it tough to properly study. Also, the problem sets are, in my opinion, the most substantial part of the class but are only worth 15% of the grade. I think the class could be improved by giving more weight to the problem sets and less to the exams.",
                "Strengths: the first few problem sets were fun as they ask us to solve several simple games.\r\nWeaknesses: not the most engaging lectures, hard to follow",
                "Strengths: Dr. Strack is really sweet and seems to genuinely care about his students. He responded to our pleas to make the PSETS more manageable, and really tried to take student feedback into account. The exams were quite reasonable this year -- hard but doable. The PSETS became MUCH more manageable as the semester went on. The TA was literally amazing and was one of the only reasons I got through his class. Without him working through the PSETS, there's no way I wold have had any idea what was going on. The PSETS were also thankfully graded quite generously. Lastly, the class was fairly well organized and the professor seemed to have things together.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class is quite theoretical, so there were definitely lectures where it seemed like we were so far in the weeds, it was hard to know how anything really connected to game theory. Because of the rigorous nature of the class, some of the PSETS were brutally hard. Because of their difficulty, it felt like I got little out of them and was just pure confused. By the end of the class, the material got incredibly difficult. I have no idea what happened the last 3 weeks of class. Some of the concepts were so hard, the professor didn't even consider adding them to the final exam.",
                "The exams had practically nothing to do with the course material. Lectures were extremely abstract and hard to follow, and whenever you asked for help Philipp just told you to read his lecture notes over and over until you got it. Problem sets also had almost nothing to do with the lectures. Felt like I was taking three courses at once and was confused in all of them.",
                "Strengths: Prof Strack is a good lecturer (although sometimes his notation can get a bit confusing and it is also a direct repeat of the lecture notes), since he is clear and very willing to check in and answer questions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the PSETs took an insane amount of time (and there was a problem that was basically a full length academic proof). I have no problem with hard PSETs, but I wish that they were slightly easier such that I could figure it out on my own (or part of it) without having to go to OH every single week.",
                "I think one of the weaknesses of the course is that I would sometimes sit down to do the problem set without much of an idea of how to do it, since we were sometimes lacking examples in class. Nonetheless, that improved a lot in the second half of the course after Professor Strack took a mid semester feedback poll. Apart from that, I really enjoyed professor Strack's teaching and also really liked the material.",
                "The initial problem sets were personally very difficult, but near the end they were manageable, both as I got the hang of the psets and because they were easier.",

The problem sets usually differed from the precise material covered in class, but this helps students think outside the box a bit. The course could be improved by the professor having a regular office hour along with the teaching fellow."

                "For the first half of the course, the professor basically repeated the lecture notes verbatim. Problem sets were all over the place, with problems ranging from routine to almost impossible without going to office hours. Exams (although not sure if this was due to the virtual format) felt a bit orthogonal to lectures and problem sets.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student with caution. While I think it is a great way to learn more about game theory, it requires a lot of independent work and some self teaching.",
                "Would not recommend unless required for major. Lectures were tedious and hard to follow with complicated notation which was not always clearly explained. Problem sets were ok with the help of TA section.",
                "Surprisingly, yes I honestly would with Professor Strack. Would I take it if it wasn't a major requirement? Probably not. But for a major requirement, it wasn't too terrible this semester. The class is quite challenging and can be brutally hard at times. The material got quite difficult the last 3-4 weeks and I had no idea what was going on. However, the professor acknowledges this and that material wasn't really even on the exam. Throughout the whole semester for that matter, Dr. Strack was very receptive to student feedback and very approachable. He made the PSETS significantly more manageable as the semester went along. I still probably spent around 10 hours on the PSETS, but rarely significantly more which I appreciated.\r\n\r\nOverall, the class this year was definitely loads easier than the class has been before. I have no idea if it'll hold up, but if it does, this class is not the worst requirement in the math/econ major. I support taking this class. Go to office hours and you will be fine.",
                "I mean its required for a few majors so you dont have much of a choice. But honestly, no. I had high hopes for this class but it was so disconnected that there are many other classes I wish I could have taken instead.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone only if you are interested in the mathematical foundations of economics and game theory. If that sounds like you, I think this course is great - it teaches you a lot and helps gain a new perspective on how players interact in games.",
                "If you have an interest in economics and a knack for mathematics, this is definitely the class for you. If you are interested in economics or math, then this course may be challenging, but is definitely doable if you put time towards it and engage with the content.",

It is more about using mathematical notation and problem-solving methods to work through the game theory in a quantitative way."
