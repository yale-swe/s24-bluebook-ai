   "comments": [
    "Over the course of the semester, I developed my own literary and poetic voice in Spanish. Writing in another language is truly a different experience. I also explored the techniques of various contemporary Spanish authors and poets, which became very influential in my own writing.",
    "really does teach you to write better in spanish.",
    "I read some short stories by authors I had never read before, I practiced oral and written communication Spanish skills, I learned to discuss, write, and edit creative writing with my peers.",
    "A broad exposure to creative works from Hispanic authors from different parts of the Spanish-speaking world.\r\nAn introduction to forms of Spanish creative writing, e.g. cuentos, microcuentos, fbulas, poemas, yografas, recetas, reflexiones personales, odas, and more.\r\nSkills and vocabulary in discussing works and ideas in Spanish.",
    "I learned how to write more carefully in Spanish so as to pay better attention to accents and grammar.\r\nI learned that it is an artistically valid thing to mimic other writers as an attempt to further your own skills.",
    "I definitely developed a stronger ability to communicate in Spanish and produce my own interpretations of Spanish poetry and prose, particularly given the historical\/political context of the works. I also learned a great deal about current Latin American writers, which I think gave me great insight beyond the scope of classical Spanish literature."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course does an excellent job of balancing writing and reading assignments, both of which are essential to develop creative writing skills. The readings come from a diverse spectrum of Spanish authors and poets from Jorge Luis Borges to Nadia Villafuerte. The writing assignments cover a variety of genres, which gives you the chance to find what type of writing resonates with you. The course could be improved with more opportunities to receive peer feedback on our work.",
    "The small size of the class is really nice, and Maria is a great professor.  She makes you feel very welcomed and class is always fun in unexpected and hilarious ways.  That said, it would have been nice to sometimes get more direct feedback on the writing that didn't just focus on grammar.  That would have helped me feel like I was also improving my writing, and not just my Spanish abilities.  The course is also very good at introducing many different authors and styles of writing, which we then are able to explore ourselves.",
    "the course is great. the readings are great and maria was the highlight of my day. if anything the tests can be a little bit hard in terms of knowing what to study for, but its nothing too crazy.",
    "This course was really wonderful!! The readings were interesting, class was usually fun, and the workload helped us improve our Spanish skills without being unreasonable difficult. While the class was mostly made up of heritage Spanish speakers, the professor made students of all levels feel comfortable and included. The professor really made the course, Profesora Jordn is super smart, super passionate, and super kind; out of all the professors I've had at Yale, she has cared the most for us, and it really meant a lot to me and everyone in the class.",
    "Strengths: range of readings, range and difficulty of assignments, flexibility in syllabus, course structure, professor, classroom size, classroom dynamic\r\nWeaknesses: hardly any, blog assignments sometimes did not contribute much to our understanding",
    "The course did not seem particularly well planned or organized- often our homeworks and classes did not match what was on the syllabus.\r\nThe homework often felt a bit like busy work, something that It was not necessary to devote much time to.\r\n\r\nThe professor was incredibly enthusiastic and loved all the readings we treated with a passion. She was extremely patient with her students.",
    "I think this course does a great job of considering the work of every student and urging them to individualize, specify, and improve their writing with the help of their peers' perspectives. I think the course could improve by providing more of these panels and open spaces for peer and teacher feedback - it's all immensely constructive, but I believe I would have appreciated more of it."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student who enjoys creative writing and would like to develop their own voice in the Spanish language. Going into the course, you should feel comfortable speaking and writing in Spanish. Some familiarity with Spanish literature would be helpful.",
    "The class is about what you would expect.  If you like Spanish and you like creative writing, it will be a great class for you.  Assuming you're looking at taking this because that's the case, then yes absolutely, you should take the course.  It's both super fun and super informative, and Maria makes the class even more exciting.",
    "YES!! take it, i loved every second.",
    "Yes, I would recommend to another student! If you're looking for a good L5 Spanish course to take, and you are interesting in reading\/writing fiction, then this is the perfect class for you. It really was a positive experience all around.",
    "Escritura Creativa was one of my most demanding yet most rewarding classes at Yale. Mara puts a lot of time and effort into selecting readings, defining assignments, evaluating and making suggestions for your work, presenting, and leading discussions. This being said the course expects you put a lot of time and effort back into your writing, presentations, and discussions. Mara was super helpful in making you be the best writer you can be, and at the end of the semester you'll be very proud and surprised at how far you've come. Take the course if you plan to put in the effort, and it will be one of the best classes you've taken.",
    "I would not, because of its seeming lack of organization and the fact that there was nothing particularly interesting or intellectually stimulating about the course.",
    "Absolutely. I think it is essential for each student at Yale to have a course like this, which has a lax structure but a demanding and intriguing curriculum. I looked forward to this class and its assignments every week."
