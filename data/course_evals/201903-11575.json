    "I learned a good amount about global firms, how they came to be, and their relation with states.",
    "I developed a very thorough understanding of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and the relationships firms have to home and host country governments.",
    "Extraordinary class. Professor LaP cares deeply about his students and the discussions were always on point and intellectually fascinating."

   "comments": [
    "The syllabus itself is fantastic and the course could have been awesome. But class discussions were often derailed a bit by the professor who wanted super specific answers that weren't particularly important.",
    "This course definitely benefited from the professor's extensive knowledge from years of teaching. The people in this class are very passionate and intelligent, which made discussion interesting. I wish this course had a clearer grading system; apart from some papers, I had no idea how my work translated to a grade.",
    "strengths: LaP is awesome and has so much knowledge and really wants to learn from his students and hear his students' opinions. He takes your opinion and thoughts into consideration and couples it with his own knowledge to teach great material\r\nweakness: you will have no idea how you're doing in the class throughout the entire class except for the 3 10% papers which only will let you know 30% of your grade going into the end of the class.",
    "It would have been quite nice to have a little more clarity on what exactly the final exam was going to consist of, or really any at all.",
    "The strengths of this course are the brilliantly selected case studies, presentations, and short essay questions. Particularly the short essay topics were very well formulated and allowed students to apply the materials of the course creatively. The weakness of this course is that the readings are somewhat repetitive.",
    "No weaknesses.",
    "The professor was wonderful. The cases and supporting readings were very interesting, but the conversations were not always as useful as I might hope. Having students present cases and devise discussion questions left many more interesting topics unexplored."

   "comments": [
    "Maybe. It's a good course, but it seems that the grade you will receive in the class just depends on whether the professor likes you.",
    "I think I would, but I would also tell them to be prepared to put in lots of work if they wanted to do well.",
    "yes get the experience with LaP as a professor because he is so smart and knows so much about what he is teaching because he has been teaching for so many decades. Hands down one of the best professors I have had at Yale",
    "It's not bad",
    "Yes!!",
    "Yes, especially if you are interested in FDI and the role of firms in national and global politics. No prior economics knowledge needed!",
    "Absolutely. Any chance to learn from LaP is worth taking.",
    "Yes. We absolutely need more political economy courses and more students taking these courses. This specifically was a nice departure from the heavy focus in the department on the presidency."
