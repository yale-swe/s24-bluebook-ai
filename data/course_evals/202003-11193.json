                "I think having more emphasis on writing would be useful - in previous Chinese courses there was a daily written quiz which forced students to learn how to write new characters. But I suppose this would have been more difficult given the online format.",

                "The class is very engaging, but oftentimes there is not enough class time to go over everything. In an online setting, there are also technical issues.",
                "In previous Chinese classes at Yale, there were one-on-one tutorial sessions where students could meet with a teacher and get practice speaking one on one. There wasn't anything like that for this course.",
                "This course was very engaging and you learn a lot by the end. It builds a good foundation if you want to continue studying Chinese. If not, it is a good point to stop since you will feel satisfied with how much you improved by the end. One weakness is that the course is a bit disorganized and chaotic. The homework due dates and details about certain assignments can be extremely confusing or not updated from the year before.",
                "Strengths: engaging professor, learned a lot\r\nWeaknesses: Directions for assignments was sometimes confusing\/disorganized, in-class engagement was sometimes awkward",
                "Strengths - classes are generally discussion based, liked the formatting of each chapter with a text, vocab, grammar, and practice sections\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes felt like you would learn new chapters but slowly forget the previous ones",

I cant really think of any ways to make the class more engaging.",
