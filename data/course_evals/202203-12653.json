                "I learned deeply about the subject area of reproductive technologies, but maybe most importantly, this course taught me how to feel more comfortable in a Yale seminar discussion setting. Coming into the class and throughout the first few sessions, I was incredibly nervous about sharing my voice, intimidated by the idea of a \"Yale class.\" However, over time, this class taught me that my ideas and input are valuable, and I engaged in exciting discussions with the professor and fellow classmates.",
                "I strengthened my writing and analytical skills.",
                "I developed strong writing and speaking skills during this class. As a book-club style course, it challenged me to develop thoughtful insights to contribute to the in-class discussions. I also gained significant insights in regards to global assisted reproduction.",
                "The ability to read texts quickly and effectively.",
                "I believe my ability to analyze texts both concisely and thoroughly was improved by this class. I found the reading heavy, but highly interesting and informative. In order to adequately come prepared to class and have read enough of the text, I developed note-taking skills that were efficient and highly valuable.",
                "I learned how to write comparative analyses.",
                "I learned a lot about the reproductive health care system and it's injustices.",
                "I feel that this course helped me gain significant critical thinking skills about complex systems and concepts, but also when it comes to interrogating simple notions that we accept every day. More specifically, I feel more confident in comparing and contrasting systems of reproductive healthcare and how they benefit and harm patients worldwide."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the professor and teaching fellow were amazing. You could tell that they both were deeply passionate about and invested in what they were teaching. Also, the students created a welcoming, warm, and intellectually challenging environment.\r\nWeaknesses: there was a lot of reading, and many of the books (all ethnographies) were comparatively fairly similar. Sometimes, by the end of the semester, it felt like our discussions were circular and a little repetitive.\r\nOverall, though, this course was incredible!!!",
                "One of the strengths of this class was the diverse and in-depth discussion of global reproductive technologies. The course structure of three specific units allows for a breadth of discussion. Student led-seminars are also a strength of the course, as it allows for student leadership and ensures all students are able to express their insights.",
                "I found it very interesting, and really enjoyed the level of discussion. There were times in which I felt it could have been more guided by professors, given it was a small class and had quieter days, but I feel the environment facilitated open and informative discussion. It felt caring unlike my other classes. I enjoyed being a part of it.",
                "The books we read at the beginning of the course were interesting, but more diversity in subject matter could be better. I would also prefer having more didactic seminars at times, rather than solely basing the seminar on student participation.",
                "I found the course structure to be particularly strong. I really enjoyed the student-led and professor/teaching fellow-facilitated discussions, as well as the flexibility in assignments. I don't see any major areas of improvement, but it would be intriguing to maybe have a day or two designated to more open discussion about any of the texts, as this would give more discussion room for comparisons to be made."

                "Yes, the class was very insightful on medical racism and sexism.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any students who are interested in furthering their knowledge about reproductive technologies. The course offers an intimate environment to dissect the extreme global inequalities in regards to reproductive technologies. The assigned books are very interesting and the course provides students with many writing and reading skills that can be applied to future coursework.",
                "Yes, I would. It was a course with content completely new to me and unlike any of my other courses. It was a nice way to expand my educational ground, so to speak.",
                "Not particularly. The grading of book reviews is often very unclear and lacks consistency across assignments.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course, especially to pre-med students and those looking to work with medicine or sociology in any respect. Grappling with the failures of the medical system is essential to approaching it in a way that is conscious and careful with patients."
