                "I learned how to plan and develop a large research project.",
                "Most of this class was working on the education studies capstone (for the intensive certificate). The first month-ish was just making idea modules (i.e., submitting ideas of capstones), and we talked about stuff like honing in on ideas, ethical sourcing, IRB processes, etc. - So a bunch of skills and knowledge which was helpful for social science research. We also had a day on pitching our ideas to others. Otherwise most of the class was workshopping the capstone.",
                "I learned about the process of developing and executing an original research project, as well as writing a literature review.",
                "Gained so much confidence in myself as a writer and realizing I am so incredibly capable of writing a long-term senior project! In terms of concrete skills, i learned how to develop a strong research question and design my own methodologies to complete it. I learned it in a way that felt different than other projects, so this was great.",
                "It's really exciting to create your own research project! It definitely feels like the culmination of things that I have learned in Education Studies and throughout my time at Yale.",
                "I was able to learn about the IRB process which was important for my capstone. Additionally the class was generally well paced to set you up for developing your idea (idea modules were useful) and to use the time to begin making headway into research."

            "comments": [
                "I think this course strikes the right balance between self-directed and faculty-guided. There were certainly moments during the semester when I was stressed about deadlines, but in the end I was grateful for them because they pushed me to make progress on my capstone.",
                "Strengths: structure and feedback mechanisms were really nice and appreciated\r\nWeaknesses: some classes were not helpful depending on what stage of research individuals were in",
                "The course had a great balance of structured and unstructured time! Some of the deadlines felt a bit fast but in general the pace felt really great! I loved the Idea module framework.",
                "The capstone itself is an exciting project, and this class provided a lot of opportunities to get support and feedback from TZB, our TF Praachi, and our peers. The workshopping groups were set up well and were a really valuable resource, and the comments we got on our assignments were generally helpful. However, attending class did not always feel productive; sometimes it felt like we spent the majority of the class going over due dates or questions from students that would have been better answered in a 1-on-1 meeting. There were a few class meetings where I wished we had just been sent any updates/announcements via email and then been given the rest of the time to work. Additionally, while the number of assignments seemed fair to me, the timing of the actual deadlines was a little rough (like having one of our two major assignments due the same week as Halloween - having it due even just a week later would have been great).",
                "Strengths: the information in the first few weeks (honing in on a topic, sourcing, etc.) were generally helpful. I think our cohort was also quite supportive, and I found that being in a workshopping group was helpful for bouncing ideas off of each other and having others help me think about where to make my thoughts more precise. I also appreciated having optional class days and breakfast work sessions for stuff like submitting prospectus and rough drafts. (Big thank you to tzb/Peyton/Praachi for the support.) Weaknesses: I think more clarification of expectations for each assignment could be helpful. There was a rough draft due a week before the final project that I know caused a lot of people stress, and ultimately was only graded for completion. - I think clarifying this would have helped people mentally for the assignment.",
                "strengths - community aspect, flexibility, instructor!, timeline. No weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: I appreciated how we had in-class workshopping time. It provided real-time chances for us to be sounding boards for each other as the project was developing. A lot of my project developed through conversations with people, and that was all beautifully facilitated by the class structure.\r\nWeakness: Some of the organized workshops we did were not as applicable to everyone. I think it's because we were all in different stages of the project and using all different disciplines and methodologies, that it was challenging. But many of them, like the elevator pitch workshop and some of the exercise like that from \"The Craft of Research\" were actually quite helpful for me even though there were a lot of negative complaints from some of the classmates. So they were okay with me, but it was challenging to dive fully into it knowing that many people were frequently sharing how they were not fans of it.",
                "The course was well-paced and really held our hands along the way of us developing our capstone projects.",
                "TZB is a huge strength of the course. She really takes the time to get to know each student and each project and always gives good and encouraging advice. Praachi is also super helpful and a huge strength of the course. I wish that there was more flexibility in the module assignment - sort of like the end-of-semester deliverable. I think that the modules were not particularly helpful for me in thinking about or narrowing the focus of my project. I think if I had just thought of it as chipping away at the proposal, that might have been more helpful.",
                "Strengths: the assignments were well planned toward supporting students write their yearlong capstones. I felt like each module and assignment made sense of the time of year and for supporting progress. I felt like the workload, assignments, and distribution all were supportive to the capstone.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the time in class was less aligned to support progress compared to the assignments. For example, the business pitch class lasted a long time and could have been moved to the spring (as practice before presentations for example or as a way to reconnect with work after break) instead of taking the class period before the prospectus/rough draft product was due."

Everyone is able to hold each other accountable, and I've received great feedback and guidance from my classmates. Some of the classes are a little slower than others, but I think that as a whole, the pacing of the course is very helpful (as long as you stay on top of it). Also, TZB brings breakfast to class a couple of times, and it always brings the energy up!",
