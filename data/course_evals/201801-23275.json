   "comments": [
    "The Capstone is an essential component of the Education Studies Program, and continues to provide students with a unique opportunity to culminate their work over three years. The key weakness to this year's offering was the extreme bias towards social science papers. In past years, there was a much greater diversity of student projects--photographic essays, children's television shows, and proposed architectural environments. This year, nearly all students followed remarkably similar formats and many progressed through an IRB process. This resulted largely from the first semester course's design around conventional Methodology topics, which pushed most of us to approach the project in a certain lens. I think that uniformity is a major detriment and fueled dissatisfaction among the scholars throughout the year.",
    "A lot of the feedback we received was critical, but not necessarily constructive or positive. More should have been done to get us started on our papers in the first semester. Also, the entire first part of the course (EDST 400) should just be nixed so that we can start working on our projects sooner.",
    "enjoyed the flexibility of the study",
    "This course is structurally sound and truly a product of incredible leadership by the teaching team.",
    "I think we would have benefitted from starting our original research earlier on and doing our presentations later, since our projects changed so much throughout the course of the semester.",
    "Strengths: independence--I really felt my project was my own, I also enjoyed hearing about my peers' projects\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Deadlines were more concentrated later in the semester"

   "comments": [
    "It's a required component of the Education Studies Program, and continues to be a highlight. Hopefully in future years there will be a better explanation of the range of projects you might pursue--don't feel constrained into writing a social science paper, particularly if your other academic background predisposes you to other kinds of analysis.",
    "No--the amount of stress that went into this project was not worth it, especially considering we will not get a degree from this program.",
    "Yes!! Other than the fact that its required for senior EDST scholars, doing an original research project is always exciting!"
