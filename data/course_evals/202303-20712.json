                "I learned how to write about music and opera for multiple different audiences, which is a skill I believe I can apply beyond musicology. Being able to write for public and academic audiences are both important skills to develop. I did also feel like I left the class with a really developed sense for the American opera industry, which I entered the class with absolutely no knowledge of.",
                "I learned a great deal about how the contemporary opera industry works; I especially enjoyed the discussions of finances and other logistical constraints that opera companies face at the moment.",
                "I learned so much about opera, a topic I knew very little about before. I also feel as though I learned a lot about music in general, and gained an appreciation for many different types of music.",
                "I learned how to discuss contemporary opera and think about all of the various factors and collaborations that go into creating a new production. As someone hoping to go into the arts, I really appreciated how this course discussed the business side which is often left out in creative discussions but plays  a vital role in producing works.",
                "I developed a better understanding of the modern American opera scene.  I was quite unfamiliar with this subject matter, so it was wonderful getting to know the insights of the current opera world.  Every week, we discuss a different topic pertaining to modern American opera, such as documentary opera, on-site opera, and etc.  Since this is a weekly discussion, I also developed skills to further my public and discussion speaking. In general, this class helped me be more open-minded and carefully critical of current opera happenings.",
                "I learned much about various aspects of contemporary American opera. Among the topics we discussed are interpretations of specific works as well as the management\/organization side of things.",
                "This class truly offers a thorough and diverse variety of insights into the complex world of contemporary opera. Every week was full of discussion about useful and pertinent readings and viewings!",
                "- overview of the different trends in American Opera\r\n- funding structures of contemporary opera in America\r\n- approaches to analyze unusual operatic concepts"

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The syllabus included a well-balanced combination of scholarly articles, public-facing pieces, and online opera performances. Class discussions were always engaging; the 2 hours passed by quickly. The trip to the Met was a highlight and felt very necessary to grounding the course material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The essay prompts were generally unclear. We were simply asked to write a scholarly article or a public-facing piece, which felt too broad.  Fortunately, the professors were very helpful during office hours at explaining their expectations.",
                "I loved going to the Met with the class and then discussing it later. It helped contextualize what we learned about in class and connect it to the outside world. I would have loved to see more in person operas but understand the constraints and why we watched so many recordings.",
                "I loved how each week our materials for class were varied between readings, listening, and watching. The highlight of the semester was going into New York to see the premiere of X at the Met. Not only was it an incredible experience to be participating in contemporary opera in the present, but also really meaningful to get to talk more with my peers and professors. \r\n\r\nOne idea for the course would be that there was so much to unpack and discuss, I almost wished that we met twice a week.",
                "The reading material the professors provided were very relevant and current to what we were discussing.  I also enjoyed the guest talks from Michael Abels and Nicolas Lell Benavides, they were very generous in answering questions and allowed a different perspective to what we were learning. The field trip to the MET opera was incredible and helped me understand the physicality and experience of being an opera-goer.",
                "The syllabus is very well-organized, and I enjoyed each week's reading, listening, and viewing assignments very much. There is a good mix of moderately hardcore music\/theater material and stuff about the social, historical, and political contexts. I generally enjoyed the class discussions, which are usually intellectually stimulating without being inaccessible even to those without much prior knowledge. I can't think of any major weakness.",
                "Truly no faults! Professor Kreuzer and Allison did a wonderful job engaging the class and guiding thoughtful conversation!",
                "- very detailed preparation of the instructors\r\n- lively discussions\r\n- a lot of variety (variety of topics, media, texts etc.)\r\n- up to date"

                "I absolutely would. It's a perfect course for really any student interested in opera or musicology with any or no background in the subject. It's accessible to beginners but does not sacrifice any depth for that sake.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to a student interested in the opera of today or the arts in general. I gained a vast knowledge of contemporary opera and left with a deeper appreciation of how operas get made.",
                "Yes, absolutely! Whether you are an opera enthusiast already or know nothing about opera, this class is very interesting and you will surely appreciate the different forms contemporary opera takes.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any Yale student and especially someone interested in going into the arts. I came into the course as a musician with no real knowledge of opera and was so impressed by how the course not only expanded my ideas about the genre of opera, but also made me think about all of the many collaborations and steps needed for a production. The co-teacher team of Professor Kreuzer and Allison Chu was fantastic and it was a really exciting opportunity to have two teachers for the course.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in opera, or want to get to know more about opera, this is an excellent class to take.  This class is also friendly to people who dont' know much about opera, and the learning environment is very understanding and friendly.",
                "Although this course is not offered on a regular basis, I would highly recommend any student who is interested in music (especially, of course, in opera) to take a course with Professor Kreuzer and Allison. Both are extremely knowledgeable of various aspects of opera and also very accessible. As a result of taking this course, I now find myself able to appreciate contemporary American opera in much more nuanced ways.",
                "Absolutely! There were a number of students who were new to opera\/had limited knowledge and yet left the class feeling similarly fulfilled as someone wanting to go into the field.",
                "Yes! I learnt a ton and enjoyed it a lot."
