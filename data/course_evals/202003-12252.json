The textbook follows what we cover in class very closely, so you can always complete your learning by reading the textbook. The workload is manageable, and the grading is very fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the exams are nothing like the problems in the homework.",

Required readings, homework problems, grading schemes, and all other aspects of the class were clearly outlined at the very beginning of the semester, making it clear that was expected for the course. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course was the level of engagement. I did not feel very engaged in lectures, and often resorted to watching the recordings of lecture rather than attending them live and 'in-person'",
                "Overall it was a very easy course. The notes and textbook were very clear though the lectures confusing. I wish we could have covered more topics more deeply.",
                "Good class",
                "Honestly this class was exactly what it sounds to be. I came in expecting to learn about Separations and Purification, and that's exactly what I got out of it. It was strong in that respect, and had few weaknesses because it is what it says it is.",
                "Depending on your point of view, this will be either a strength or a weakness and I am not sure where I fall myself: the class is quite fundamental and covered only the most important separations processes. The course was still engaging and at times challenging but it definitely leaves room for you to explore the textbook and other chapters\/subjects further outside of the course.",
