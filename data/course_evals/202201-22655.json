                "The course focused largely on the historical perspective when studying American drama. This means that we spent a lot of time looking at biographical and historical context for the authors we read, at archives materials at the Beinecke, and constantly keeping in mind how the trajectory of American drama might be periodized in different and sometimes overlapping ways.",
                "In this course you get a really sweeping survey of American theatre history from near the countrys start1830s to 1950sas it evolved t from adaptations of Shakespeare to melodrama, to minstrelsy, to cabaret and vaudeville to naturalism and expressionism. You track how theatre responds to and seeks to capture culture.",
                "This class helped me recontextualize what I thought about theater and consider large movements in the performing arts within the broader strokes of history."

                "I've never taken an English course as focused on fact, history, and the material qualities of literature as this one. It was a fantastic experience!",
                "This course is the optimal once-a-week seminar. With clear themes/topics, each class tracks different threads in the American theatre narrative, allow us to excavate the period through various lenses",
                "The readings were extremely interesting, Professor Vogel is a great discussion leader, and the class was organized really well. Not sure how it could be improved.",
                "This class is wonderful!!! The biggest strength is working so closely with the Beinecke to see materials related to what were learning about. I wish we had more time to look through the materials in our visits.\r\n\r\nI also appreciated the breaks we would take during class.",
                "Each week we focused on a different play or essay (occasionally multiple short plays/essays in one week) and discussed them over the two hour class period. Every few weeks took trips to the Beinecke Library to view materials related to what we were discussing in class. I very much enjoyed this structure, and thought the relatively frequent Beinecke trips were a great supplement to class discussions. Though time is limited each semester I think this class could be improved by the addition of a few more plays, and/or video content of performances of the plays we read to get a sense of what they are like on stage in various adaptations. As the semester was grouped into broad subject matters it would have been great for a chance to engage with even more plays within each topic, or multiple plays from different playwrights."

                "yes -- prof. Vogel is extremely supportive and understanding, and while there are a lot of readings, there probably isn't a better option for a senior seminar out there",
                "Definitely! Prof. Vogel is a really attentive and understanding instructor. He's very open to student feedback and ideas, even though the course is in some senses an exhibit or extension of the critical/archival work he himself has done in the past. It's very gratifying to be put on an equal level to someone who really does know what they're talking about when it comes to this period of American drama.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! If you are interested in understanding American theatre, this class will make you well-versed in multiple touchstones that have shaped theatre today.",
                "If you're interested in theatre, yes, but it is a lot of work  really enjoyable though!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. The topics we learn about are relevant to the world outside the classroom and the readings are always exciting and thought-provoking (or even if the texts themselves arent particularly riveting, our discussions in class about them are). I never got to class and felt bored with the text or like I had nothing to say.",
                "Any student with an interest in the history of theatre and who would enjoy close reading individual plays would greatly enjoy this class. It would also be interesting for someone interested in American history with an art/humanities-focused lens. As a senior seminar for the English major, I think the workload was quite reasonable and the texts we read provided ample material for the final long paper."
