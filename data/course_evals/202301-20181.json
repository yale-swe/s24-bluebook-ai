                "I learned about collecting in the 1700s and the history of colonialism in museums. I learned how museums evolved through time and how visitor interactions have changed.",
                "This class taught me so much about pre-museum collecting, including cabinets of curiosities and cartography practices. I loved that we had so many class visits to the Beinecke archives and the YUAG exhibits because it grounded our conversations and readings. Professor Bertucci weaved the history of museum and collecting with colonialism and imperialism in an expertful way -- I'm leaving this class with a much fuller understanding of museum ethics, the flaws of archives, and an understanding that 'knowledge' is subjective and highly curated. This is a fantastic course for anyone interested in history, postcolonial theory, and museum studies!",
                "I gained experience and proficiency in reading academic texts for relevant content and in visual close reading. The course developed my ability to write art history essays. Most importantly, I became more comfortable with discussing difficult topics that I didn't feel I had answers to, like the equity of collections.",
                "I gained knowledge regarding the development of the modern museum and insight into the cultural and historical context that facilitated wunderkamern."

            "comments": [
                "Strength is that there's not too much reading, but the class format of discussing each reading thoroughly, often first in small groups, holds you accountable to doing it. Which means every person in class is engaged with the material and we can all further each other's understanding of it. Professor Bertucci was fantastic, very kind and considerate, organized discussion well, super cool personal and professional background as STEM-turned-historyofscience-turned-museum-curator.",
                "More visits to Yale's museums would have improved the course.",
                "This course had really strong readings and class field trips. Professor Bertucci is also great at guiding class conversations, adding her own experiences and expertise, and also fostering a thoughtful and engaged space.",
                "Not much feedback on writing. readings were also incredibly redundant",
                "The strengths of this course were the curated selections of readings and the class discussions. I also greatly enjoyed the collection visits. I have no comments on weaknesses.",
                "Overall, the course was very well designed. The only improvement I'd suggest is to have more opportunities to be graded and work on our writing as it is a writing credit.",
                "The readings of this course were diverse and interesting, and contributed to my engagement with the topic as a whole. At times in-class discussions felt unguided or meandering, though that may have been more due to the students than anything else."

There aren't tons of courses devoted to museum studies, which made this feel like a gem of a class. If you're interested, you certainly won't be disappointed.",
                "No, the readings were very rarely engaging and the discussions were somehow less engaging.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in looking critically at museums. It is a very niche topic so it certainly is not for everyone, but it is taught well and very interesting if one is already drawn to the subject matter.",
                "Definitely! A great multidisciplinary class that was well designed.",
                "Any student interested in the history of museums, colonialism, or art history would enjoy this class."
