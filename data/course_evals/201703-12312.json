   "comments": [
    "This course greatly improved my grammar in Spanish, which allowed me to understand more precisely the meaning of written texts as well as express my own ideas with greater nuance both  orally and through my writing.",
    "I have a much better grasp on spanish grammar than i did before.",
    "You definitely learn a lot about the mechanics of more specific aspects of Spanish grammar. The course really breaks down the more instinctual grammatical rules that seem to exist simply because they exist and illustrates these rules in a manner that is comprehensible, coherent, and concise.",
    "I learned about the complexities and nuances of the Spanish language. My confidence in the language and proficiency in it have increased immensely as a result of this course, and it has answered basically all the grammatical questions I've encountered during previous studies with Spanish.",
    "My Spanish definitely improved over the duration of the course.",
    "I reviewed and learned many difficult grammar concepts. I believe I have a much better grasp of the intricacies of the language now.",
    "Outstanding ability in Spanish: wow -- a master",
    "I developed my skills in the Spanish language in writing, aural and reading comprehension, and overall grammar.  Speaking and conversation was also developed to an extent.",
    "I learned, as the title would suggest, advanced grammar skills of the Spanish language. We adhered closely to the syllabus, but don't be fooled -- even if you learned these topics in high school, the college course goes into a LOT more depth with them. That being said, the class never felt overwhelmingly difficult, even with a lot of busy work, and Pfa. Seymour always made herself available to chat and help out."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course covers a wide breadth of topics but does not sacrifice the depth of understanding we needed to truly improve our grammar.  Terry Seymour is also an incredibly strong instructor.",
    "The only negative is that there's a lot of work, but I would say it's all necessary to actually benefit from the class.",
    "My teacher was always enthusiastic and did her best to keep class enjoyable but the work load was crazy.",
    "Professor Seymour is incredible -- she really knows a lot about the mechanics of Spanish grammar and is able to answer virtually any question about the subject, even if it is not exactly related to the curriculum. I think the main strength to the course is that students are really able to learn and practice new insights into grammar that may not have been taught in previous levels while also having the opportunity to speak Spanish with the professor and their peers.",
    "The strength is that it is very informative and will concisely clear things up for you. A negative is that the class moves FAST so you might not feel comfortable with everything. Having periodic review session-classes may allow for better student comprehension.",
    "This course covers a lot of material in a very structured way. However, it moves very fast, and there is not a lot of time for reflection and absorption of studied material",
    "great daily handout to guide us in class --- prompt email communication and consistent office hours -- thanks!",
    "The course is a great deal of work, but it is very through in scope.  The material was not always the most interesting, but it is a really helpful and in-depth course on the backbone of the spanish language.",
    "This course was effectively structured and designed to maximize both quantity of topics and quality of deep learning. There was a lot of homework, much more than any other class, but it was always manageable. The real problem with the homework was that it didn't always really serve a purpose, instead just feeling like busy work. Of course, practice is essential in second language acquisition, but the assignments didn't always seem to serve that purpose. \r\n\r\nThe real strength of this class was Pfa. Seymour. She was so nice, so helpful, and her explanations so in-depth and clarifying, that it was impossible not to enjoy coming to class. The homework and other assignments were fine for learning, but her class truly was structured perfectly."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in improving your Spanish grammar significantly, this course is worthwhile.  The day-to-day workload is heavier than most courses at Yale, but the quality of teaching in this course makes it a worthy experience.",
    "Yes, I feel like I started this course barely being able to understand Spanish, and now I feel like I have a decent command over the language. This class is great for learning nuanced grammar points which have really helped me better understand Spanish.",
    "I would tell the student to really be sure they were ready for a lot of work and high expectations for understanding of the language.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who is looking to improve their writing and speaking skills in Spanish. Though the course can be a bit mechanical and dry at times, you really come out of the course having learned a lot, and with a very manageable workload. On the other hand, if you are looking to really practice and thoroughly improve your speaking skills, I would suggest a difference course. But if you are looking to improve your writing, and subsequently your speaking, in Spanish, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone else, they would just have to realize that it's a lot of work and rather difficult. I learned a lot from the class and I'm grateful for though.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students who are looking for an L5 Spanish to take, but I would warn them that the workload is fairly high.",
    "Absolutely. I learned a lot from this class. Although grammar might sound dry, the class is taught via the study of various texts and videos, which were quite interesting.",
    "yes --- homework was graded and critiqued effectively and consistently --- this professor worked hard to help us learn",
    "If you already have a knowledge of spanish and want to break it down to the nitty-gritty, this course is the right one for you.  It is not always the most fun, but there are a variety of evaluations and it covers a wide spread of material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning more about Spanish grammar (or simply to complete a language requirement) but doesn't want to have to read long, complex books and is more comfortable doing problem sets and fill-in-the-blanks. That being said, be prepared to read and discuss six short stories over the course of the semester. These can be difficult to get through, but class discussion always helps make things clearer. Basically, the class will be a lot of work, but is structured more similarly to a high school course than the other L5 Spanish classes, which is comforting to a lot of students who took a year off in between AP Spanish or who aren't in the mood to dive into Spanish literature.\r\n\r\nTests are also not too difficult, and Pfa. Seymour is a very fair\/generous grader, so don't worry too much about your grade in the class."
