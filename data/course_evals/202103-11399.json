                "I gained a very solid foundation of various ethical frameworks. I also learned a lot about different global health topics that I previously had no idea about, like organ donation markets in Iran and HIV treatment in Cuba. Ultimately, I learned how to apply the various ethical frameworks to global health issues.",
                "I gained so much topical knowledge on different fascinating aspects of global health. I also learned ethical frameworks from nothing  I've never studied ethics before. Together this made for a really intellectually stimulating course. I really enjoyed writing the papers and produced work I was quite proud of. I've also started viewing many other topics in public health and ethical frameworks as a result of taking this class.",
                "I truly cemented a foundation in global health topics and ethical frameworks. I felt my writing became stronger throughout the course as well, since the topics themselves also built on each other.",
                "I learned about different ethical frameworks (eg. Principlism, Consequentialism, Deontology, Agent-Centered ethics, Feminist ethics of care, etc.) and how to apply them to public health dilemmas.",
                "A lot of important knowledge on how ethics related to the field of global health. There are so many ethical decisions in this vast field, and by studying various topics each week, we were able to gain a comprehensive knowledge",
                "We learned about various ethical frameworks and applied these frameworks to global health dilemmas. We learned that tradeoffs will always exist, but that ethically justified solutions can be reached by examining a problem from multiple perspectives.",
                "I definitely learned about alot of situations I wasn't aware of before and was able to look at global health issues through multiple ethical frameworks that I learned about.",
                "In this class we first developed an understanding of key ethical frameworks and what ethical analysis consists of before diving into applied topics in global health ethics. By delving briefly into theory before addressing a broad range of ethical dilemma, the course was both comprehensive but not at all shallow, and was quite interesting. I particularly enjoyed exploring the ethics of organ transplantation, medical research in low\/middle-income countries, and vaccine policy.",
                "I learned so much about healthcare across the world, ethics, and debate. The class is facilitated in such an interesting  way."

                "Strengths: super engaging, great prof, ideal workload weakness: wish that it was more of a class discussion instead of Prof Fallon calling on students",
                "One of the strengths of the course is that all of the assignments that she creates are useful and have improved my learning. She also does a great job at continuing class discussions and selects very interesting readings. One of the weaknesses is that her feedback can sometimes be slow to receive.",
                "This course was so engaging. I always had so many thoughts and ideas during class stimulated by Prof. Fallon's framing and other students' comments. The readings were very reasonable and the papers were quite exciting.\r\nOne weakness: the course was mostly made up of STEM majors\/pre-meds who wanted a writing credit. There were a few who were constantly negotiating down the workload because it was clear they felt their other courses were more important. I think Prof. Fallon could have been more firm with shutting that down, because frankly I found it somewhat disrespectful.",
                "The course is a very typical seminar, with weekly readings and then class discussions. I thought this format was useful for the nature of the course, and Dr. Fallon often broke us into smaller groups, which was very helpful in keeping everyone engaged and also allowing us to approach issues from multiple perspectives.",
                "I think we could have spent more time discussing the non-western ethical frameworks (eg. Confucianism, African Humanist ethics, Ethics of care, etc.) because I'm still uncertain how one would apply them in an ethical dilemma. I'm most familiar with principlism, consequentialism, deontology, and agent-centered frameworks. I also think that some of the papers we read at the beginning of the course were a bit redundant in terms of providing an introduction to ethical frameworks for public health and global health.",
                "strength: dr. fallon, assignments werent too hard, readings werent too long, overall discussion was good \r\n\r\nweakness: lot of people talk too much to get their participation points and doesnt allow others to speak up in the seminar, grade distribution (20% participation)",
                "This was truly one of my absolute favorite courses I have taken at Yale and I only have good things to say about it. Professor Fallon is extremely thoughtful, knowledgable, and kind. She led engaging discussions that I looked forward to each week, and she was very receptive to student feedback. The readings for each week were interesting and thought provoking, and I learned a lot about ethical analysis and writing in general when writing each of the papers. I also appreciated the freedom to choose our own topics for the papers because this made writing them enjoyable. Overall the workload was the perfect amount to keep me engaged with the course material without being overwhelming.",
                "This course always had such lively discussion and I was always engaged by the readings (they were also the perfect length). No improvements!",
                "I really enjoyed the structure of the course material, readings, and how we discussed topics in class. Professor Fallon did a wonderful job of moving the group discussion forwards while also allowing students to do the majority of discussing and debating. I particularly enjoyed breaking into small groups and doing case-studies and exercises; I would recommend adding even more activities like this since they were so fun.",
                "I loved this course - each class you have readings in advance, then discuss, and time really flies by."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! This course is so fascinating and the workload is very manageable. You truly learn so much information without being assigned a crazy amount of work. This was the first ethics course I have taken, so I was very unfamiliar with the ethics component of the class and had practically no prior knowledge of it. Professor Fallon really makes sure you get a solid foundation in ethics and does so in a way that is easy to understand.",
                "Yes!! This is probably my favorite class I've ever taken at Yale. It's made me think about the methodology I want to use moving forward in my career. Also, Prof. Fallon is an amazing professor who cares so much about the students.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student, especially anyone interested in medicine or public health. I think ethics is such a crucial part of these fields, and this course is an excellent overview of the key dilemmas and strategies.",

                "Yes! Dr. Fallon is great, important topic, and a good writing credit. Not too difficult",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone. Professor Fallon is incredible, the material is interesting and relevant to many different fields, and the course is well-organized. I learned so much, not just about global health ethics, but also about decision-making in general.",
                "Absolutely! I think any student interested in global health issues should take this course and Professor Fallon has so much valuable insight to give.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a great way to get started in health ethics or to expand your knowledge if you already have some background. Since the course covers so many topics, you will certainly learn plenty of new things and by the end of the class develop your own views about the ethics regarding a number of different dilemmas.",
