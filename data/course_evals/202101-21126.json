                "Strengths: Great Professor (Liu Laoshi was very enthusiastic, organized, and a fast grader) This class really teaches you how to speak, read, and write Chinese even if it's a lot of work. I don't know if this is a weakness, but I think L4 vocabulary was much more difficult than L3, so it took a lot more time to understand the grammar. Also, essays were really difficult to write and you usually only had like 3 days to write it. All in all, this is a very worthwhile class.",
                "Strengths include the liveliness of our instructor, Professor Liu, and the interesting subject material. A slight weakness was the relative monotony of some of the daily vocabulary and grammar drilling, but these were all necessary in order to master the subject material so I do not consider to big of a drawback.",
                "Course was very well organized with clear deadlines and expectations.",
