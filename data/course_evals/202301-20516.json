The weakness is that the course isn't rigorous enough, averaging around an hour of homework per day. There's no chance to accelerate the learning of Chinese for someone ready to put in more work.",

                "I think it would be beneficial to have more opportunities to speak at length without having prepared. For oral homework, I and others often wrote out answers first and then read them aloud. I don't think this was good for our speaking abilities.",
                "Strengths - very organized and well planned. \r\nWeaknesses - can be very high workload and difficult at times, but my Chinese definitely improved significantly!",
                "I think that there is a lot of busy work, and trying to spice up the assignments with something fun every chapter might make it more fun. A strength of the class though is that it touches on all four key aspects of language very well -- speaking, listening, writing and reading are equally weighed in terms of curriculum.",
                "The teachers, regular homework assignments, and assessments were all excellent and fair. I really don't think there is much room for improvement because Chinese is always one of my favorite classes at Yale."
