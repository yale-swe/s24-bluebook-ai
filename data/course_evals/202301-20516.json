                "I think it would be beneficial to have more opportunities to speak at length without having prepared. For oral homework, I and others often wrote out answers first and then read them aloud. I don't think this was good for our speaking abilities.",
                "Strengths - very organized and well planned. \r\nWeaknesses - can be very high workload and difficult at times, but my Chinese definitely improved significantly!",
                "I think that there is a lot of busy work, and trying to spice up the assignments with something fun every chapter might make it more fun. A strength of the class though is that it touches on all four key aspects of language very well -- speaking, listening, writing and reading are equally weighed in terms of curriculum.",
                "The teachers, regular homework assignments, and assessments were all excellent and fair. I really don't think there is much room for improvement because Chinese is always one of my favorite classes at Yale."
