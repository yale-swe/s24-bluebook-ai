   "comments": [
    "I learned how to write well in a personal essay style. I learned how to make paragraphs sound more natural, to convey a public point in an essay, and add stylistic effects (such as white space) to my writing. I also learned a lot about myself. English 120 has the remarkable capacity to allow students to express their never-before revealed ideas on paper. I was surprised at some of the essays I wrote, because they revealed new dimensions of my personality.",
    "This class helped my to hone my writing skills and learn to think. I read many essays that helped me see what makes good writing, and workshopping with my peers gave me great advice in terms of my writing.",
    "I learned how to really analyze the structure and meaning of essays and how to apply similar techniques to my own assignments. I learned how to show more and tell less.",
    "I learned how to construct and read modern essays. I feel like a generally more cultured person having read these modern sources.",
    "This course does a great job teaching students how to write and, more importantly, revise. If youre looking to learn how to write multi-dimensional, concise essays, this is the course for you.",
    "I learned the structure of modern essays and skills and insights on how to write like the authors we read. We used techniques like concentric circles, warmth, sentence structures, sandwiches to improve our writing.",
    "I believe the knowledge gained in this course has helped me not only to improve my creative writing, but to improve my writing skills overall. The course also gives extensive insight into analyzing texts, and it has provided me with an entire new regard when I read."

   "comments": [
    "The course does have a lot of reading, and at times, I wasn't able to dive as deeply into the readings as much as I would have liked because I just didn't have the time. I think that the faculty could consider cutting down on the syllabus while raising expectations for student contributions to classroom discussions.\r\n\r\nThe feedback in this course is incredible. I enjoyed how instructors give students the benefit of the doubt in their writing--most suggestions take the form of questions that the author is free to take or disregard. This style of feedback was stimulating and helpful, because it pushed me to think more deeply about how I could improve my own writing, rather than making corrections someone told me to make without knowing why.",
    "This class was very well taught and gave us a wide scope of topics to write about. The syllabus could do with some essays being changed.",
    "The course had a fantastic reading selection & great resources for feedback.",
    "There was a lot of reading which took away from really getting everything out of specific readings that might have been more helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. This course was extremely helpful for my writing. It was also empowering to find out more about myself and my voice as a writer. I would keep in mind that English 120 might not develop writing skills that could be employed on a scientific research paper as much as other English writing seminars. However, this class was certainly the best class I've taken (albeit a small sample size) and has affected me more than any other class I've taken in my life.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student. It was great at improving one's writing skills.",
    "Yes! I think it was really refreshing to write something different than the typical high school analysis essays. I learned so much about writing that I feel can be applied to any type of written assignment I receive.",
    "Take this course! Really interesting course material and a great introduction to college English.",
    "For any student looking to improve their writing abilities, this course is a must.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, because its a fun class that introduces students to the art of modern essay writing, which is always a good skill to have. Its the opposite of what most students learn in high school.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students who are passionate about writing. The course is very intense and the workload can be overwhelming, however, I believe it allows for immense practice and improvement of one's writing skills."
