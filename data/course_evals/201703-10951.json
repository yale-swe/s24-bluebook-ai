   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about how to analyze circuits in various contexts.",
    "Gained the ability to recognize and analyze the different components of electrical circuits. Also learned basics of binary.",
    "I got a very good understanding of circuits, the components of circuits, and how to achieve different results by designing a circuit. I got first-hand understanding through the labs which helped make lots of concepts more concrete.",
    "This class really sharpens circuit analysis skills.  I came in with pretty solid knowledge of basic circuits, such as resistors, RC, and LC circuits, but EENG 200 dives into so many more topics.  AC circuits are covered extensively, as well as circuit elements that are very relevant to modern operating machines, like op-amps, diodes, and transistors.  Overall, I definitely got a lot of this class.",
    "I learned a lot about basic circuitry and how some important basic electronics we interact with often work electrically.",
    "This class got hard very fast, but I understand a lot about circuits that I otherwise wouldn't have. It's always annoying to have lab, but I found them necessary in helping to make sure you understand the material (and there are only 5 during the semester). I often didn't feel comfortable with the material until I did the labs. You also build on your lab writing skills in the process, which is important for the engineering field.",
    "This class gives you an excellent set of tools to analyze basic circuitry. I think I will find it invaluable in my future academic and professional career.",
    "Electronics",
    "Knowledge of introductory EE",
    "Great intro to ee",
    "I learned a lot about microelectronics and how you can build on them to develop more complex and interesting electronics such as logic gates and amplifiers.",
    "I learned the basics of circuits, including how op-amps, capacitors, inductors, and transistors work. I also learned valuable lab skills: how to build circuits on a breadboard and us various tools including the oscilloscope.",
    "Both DC and AC circuit analysis skills, also a \"bigger picture\" view of how electronics are used in real life (MOSFETS and semiconductors in digital electronics). Also bread-boarding\/oscilloscope use skills from lab.",
    "You can make a motor go vroom, and a lot of actually useful circuitry knowledge",
    "A basic, systematic understanding of electronic components, phasor methods and circuit analyses. We covered everything from HS physics' ohm's law to capacitors and inductors, equivalent circuits, op-amps, transformers, diodes and transistors. Basically every lab would involve oscilloscopes so yeah we also got pretty familiar with the equipment.",
    "knowledge of indtoductory electronics",
    "This course taught me the fundamentals of electrical engineering and circuit analysis. Additionally, I was exposed to conventions regarding how to write lab reports and learned skills such as Matlab.",
    "I can kind of do circuit analyses.",
    "Basic circuit analysis, circuit prototyping. Great course to learn the basics and some more advanced topics not covered in intro physics (e.g. op amps, filters, transistors, etc.)",
    "I developed knowledge in the area of electrical engineering. Furthering my understanding of circuit analysis and introducing me to hands on circuits and electrical equipment.",
    "I learned how to analyze a circuit with complex elements, and learned basic applications of circuits in the lab. I learned why circuits are important in everyday life.",
    "I developed a basic understanding of electrical engineering. I learned the basics of how speakers, lights, and computers work.",
    "I learned the basic skills to pursue electrical engineering",
    "I gained an understanding of basic electronic circuits.",
    "Working with with several different circuit elements like capacitors, inductors, op-amp, transistors, etc.",
    "I learned basically only the behavior of specific circuit elements.",
    "I practiced the ability to break down complex problems and circuits into individual components which may be more easily analyzed and understood. Furthermore, I developed a greater understanding of Electrical Engineering and its intricacies, strengthening my desire to major in the subject. I learned a wide array of skills in analyzing basic circuits, and as a result gained the confidence to pursue and construct my own personal projects.",
    "I took it because it was part of my major but I enjoyed it. There is not a lot of work and the labs really aren't as hard as people make them out to be. For my year, they made the labs a lot easier and I think that will continue. It's 5 labs, 3 long ones and 2 short ones. The content is not hard either. Mark Reed is such a bro. One of the best teachers in the EE department. Super chill dude.",
    "Knowledge of electrical circuit components and their applications",
    "Learned both how to analyze and approach more complex circiuts. Also learned about circuit design, and how to put together circuits.",
    "Really great baseline in how electronics\/circuits work! Graphical, logical, and mathematical analysis.",
    "I learned the basics of electronics and circuit design.",
    "I learned how to do basic circuit analysis using algebra as well as handle circuitry in a lab setting.",
    "The class gave a good introduction to analyzing some analog circuits"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are that there is a lot of help when needed, Professor Reed and the TAs were always available to answer questions. I think the weakness of this course is that too much is packed in too quickly, and it is hard to develop more than a simple understanding of the different circuit elements from just the lectures. The labs definitely help solidify things.",
    "Lab's were poorly organized\/ran into many problems, both with important typos and malfunctioning equipment. Classes consistently ran over time due to trying to fit too much information into each lecture.",
    "The class is taught very well. We go through many examples of the day's topic which really helps to understand it. The class sometimes ran a few minutes late however.",
    "The psets in this class are very manageable - they only take 2 or 3 hours a week.  You get to apply what you learn in class directly to the psets, so you can see what you do and don't know.  The thing I dislike the most about this course is the lab component.  The labs themselves are cool, but the lab reports can take ages, and  personally felt like I didn't get anything out of writing full lab reports.  If this could be changed, EENG 20 would be an amazing course.",
    "I think a section or peer tutor of some kind would have been extremely useful since lectures tended to go by so quickly it was difficult to understand in the moment what you did and didn't understand well conceptually.",
    "I appreciated that it was a 50 minute class; however, Professor Reed often had trouble finishing in that amount of time, so I think it would be better to go back to it's being a 1 hour 15 minute class. I had class 35 minutes later up science hill, and I often would have to miss lunch because he let us out late, so I would rather it be advertised as longer that way you can plan your schedule accordingly.\r\n\r\nI liked that there were only 5 labs and they weren't all full lab write-ups. The labs also really helped explain the material, as I often would be confused until forced to write about a concept and explain it.",
    "Overall, this course was very good. Professor Reed is a great lecturer, the topics covered are very useful, and the TA's were helpful. I think this class should be divided into lecture and lab or count for 1.5 credits because the work load is very large.",
    "The textbook is poorly written and hard to follow. Lectures were more helpful",
    "Allow people to leave on time for lunch but otherwise awesome!",
    "Very interesting, great professor, and helpful TAs. Professor is always available to meet for help.\r\n\r\nClass size is pretty large for an engineering course. The labs were difficult and sometimes beyond what was taught in class.",
    "This class covers a lot of material in depth. The problem sets are a good length and reinforce the material learned in class. The labs are also a great learning experience, though the lab reports seem to be too formal and feel like writing them takes away from what was supposed to be learned from the lab.",
    "Lecture speed was a bit fast. I feel like this course could be 1 hr 15 minutes of lecture instead of 50, and 4 labs instead of 5. I did appreciate the wide range of office hour and open lab options.",
    "Lab grading criteria were vague.",
    "Labs are useful, but often confusing and don't take into account lousy equipmebt",
    "Strengths: well structures, good lecture notes; Professor Reed is super passionate about teaching this course and his enthusiasm definitely helped. He knows what he's talking about and can explain things with different perspectives.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: professor Reed talks too fast and could let certain section a*holes bog him down for stupid questions.",
    "Sometimes lectures were not comprehensive enough to fully understand the material, but the TFs were very helpful and were able to make the class much easier to understand.",
    "Reed goes through the material very quickly. You do learn, but you need to put in a lot of effort into understanding the material on your own time.",
    "Great class overall, only weakness was the lack of direction on what to study for the exams.",
    "The strengths are the way Professor Reed taught the course material. The weaknesses are the labs and writeups, which were graded inconsistently.",
    "The class starts out a little boring, but gets much more interesting as it progresses. The lab is a lot of work and not too interesting.",
    "Even though the professor moves through material more quickly than I would like, I feel like that is necessary due to the course naturally covering a lot of the important basics.",
    "I found it difficult to learn from the lecture. I think that the professor was wonderful, but the pacing was nearly impossible to keep up with. The labs also seemed to be unnecessarily time consuming.",
    "Strength: The presentations were relatively clear and well organized. There were not many errors in theory or calculation in examples.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Too much theory work and too little examples. When there were examples, they never expanded to more complex situations or if they did, they weren't explained thoroughly enough.",
    "For an introductory course, I found it to be mostly a repeat of what i had learned in physics rather than introducing me to any new concepts.\r\nGrading of labs was dependent on some seemingly arbitrary stuff especially considering how little instruction\/insight\/guidance we were given in both lecture and the lab.",
    "Overall, it was a difficult but engaging course with accessible help. One improvement would be to offer a sample lab write-up before the first lab report is due.",
    "The textbook is clear and understandable. The weekly problem sets were not overly time-consuming but included enough problems for one to become familiar with the week's material. Although the labs are included in the one class credit, they facilitated understanding the material, especially the units on op-amps and transistors, and since there were only 5, it was not really deserving of an entire lab credit anyway.",
    "Strengths: Mark Reed is a genius, and very willing to answer questions and fully explain things IF YOU ASK. Midterm and Final are only worth 40% in total (20% each), and so lab\/pset grades really help. Psets really aren't that bad once you get the hang of them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: because Mark Reed is so smart, sometimes he doesn't realize that the class doesn't really understand what's going on, but IF YOU ASK HE WILL EXPLAIN! Unfortunately, lecture was only 50 minutes twice a week, which was not enough time in my opinion. I'd rather a longer class that consistently lets out early than one that's rushed. Other weakness is of course the labs, which are RIDICULOUS. Seriously, they're just overkill in terms of workload and expectations, especially if you don't know MatLab going in and they don't teach you! The TA's are VERY hit or miss, some very sassy some really great (@Josh)",
    "I think the strength of the course was that we covered a lot of material, but it still felt like you learned a lot. I think the biggest weakness of the course was that the lecture portion of the course was only 50 minutes a week\/ 2x a week. I think if the lectures were 75 minutes \/ 2x a week, we would have been able to get through the material at a more comfortable pace, allowing for a better understanding of the material.",
    "This was a very solid course. The final lab was a bit difficult and there was dissonance between the lab TAs and the professor over the details of the lab which caused confusion among the students. Professor Reed also taught fairly quickly and started the next class'  slideshow during the same lecture. I believe the course could be improved if Professor Reed just spent more time on the current class's slideshow before moving on to the next one. Perhaps we just need to ask more questions\/not be afraid to as well though."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course with Professor Reed, while it is very challenging it is very interesting for both EE and MechE majors. The tests are somewhat reasonable, the homework is always doable (though often with TAs help), and the Labs are a lot of work but very fun.",
    "I highly recommend to students in STEM as electronics is a key part of design. There are such broad applications, whether its for future projects or something else, that this class introduces you to.",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student genuinely interested in learning more about circuits; otherwise, it's not worth the amount of time the labs consume.",
    "Most people who take this class have to take it. The labs really help you understand the material, which is great because I often didn't fully understand it when doing the homework. You build skills you wouldn't otherwise, so take it if you need to. It is relatively hard, but it's easy once you do the labs and understand the material.",
    "Most people who take this course do so to fulfill a major requirement, but I think this is a great course nonetheless. If you're interested in learning about how to analyze basic analog and digital circuitry, I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "If taking it for pleasure, this course should be taken credit\/d",
    "Yes, great inteo",
    "Yes if you want to work anywhere in engineering or science. The basics of electronics are very important and useful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in EE or in physics. Though it is a bit more work than other EE classes (and the lab reports take many hours to write), I learned much more than I thought I would.",
    "As someone who is not an EENG major with almost no EENG background, this class' learning curve was really steep. However, if you supplement class lectures with lots of office hours, textbook practice problems, etc., you'll eventually catch up. I think the material is really interesting, but tough to conceptualize.",
    "Take it only if you need to. This is not a fun intro science credit if you are not into electronics or related engineering disciplines.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this course for someone who has an interest in Electrical Engineering or has to take it for a particular major, but I would not recommend this course for someone looking for a casual course to take.",
    "No. It's not taught the greatest way. The material is alright. Would not recommend taking it for fun.",
    "Make sure youve taken intro physics here or AP physics, and calculus before this course. Although there are no hard prerequisites, youll have to use concepts from these courses throughout to fully understand the topics.",
    "i would recommend to other engineering prospects",
    "Yes, if it is required or if they are interested in electronics.",
    "I enjoyed the class. I thought it was pretty well taught and Professor Reed was great.",
    "I would since it contains a lot of useful information for electrical engineers, but probably not to non-STEM students.",
    "I don't think that I would recommend this to a student that does not need to fulfill a requirement. That is unless you are willing to work very very hard for the sake of curiosity.",
    "Take this only if you need to. There are much better and easier ways to learn about electronics.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student, as it teaches you the basic fundamentals necessary to begin understanding how the electronics that surround us function. From passive filter frequency response to CMOS logic and operational amplifiers, the course provided me with massive insights into the development of electrical technology throughout the years, and how it has improved to today's current state.",
    "Yes. Take it cuz Mark Reed is a beast with his medallion belt buckle and dyed-blonded Bieber hair.",
    "It's the antithesis of a gut class if you have minimal exposure to electrical components, but it teaches about electrical components well.",
    "Highly recommend to any engineer -- circuits are cool and this class gives one the skills to be able to understand, use, and create a wide array of basic circuits.",
    "I actually am not required to take this course (I'm non-ABET MechE), but I chose to because I thought it would be a good background to have for any engineer. I still stand by this, and while the course was VERY challenging and the labs were absolute hell, I would recommend the class. But you probably have to take this course, anyway.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in electrical engineering or wants to learn more about circuits.",
    "The class moves quickly, so keep up and get help if you need it! The problem sets are pretty straightforward. Your lab experience depends on your TA. Prof. Reed is really great thought--get to know him one on one.",
    "Great introductory course to analog circuit analysis. You do some digital circuit analysis towards the end of the course, i.e. 0's and 1's and all that, but most of the course is just dealing with voltages, currents, resistances, capacitances and the like throughout a circuit. So like, necessary tools if you want to go into Electrical Engineering.\r\n\r\nThere are weekly problem sets as well as labs every other week. Half the labs are full-blown lab reports while the other half are just answering questions. I suggest choosing\/finding a reliable lab partner, because you'll probably have a partner!\r\n\r\nThere's also one midterm and one final, and you get to bring in a cheat sheet so I recommend maybe starting that earlier than the day before.\r\n\r\nProfessor Reed is a great lecturer, although he'll move quickly (even move on to the next class's material in the same lecture) if nobody asks any questions, and he loves to answer questions so don't be afraid to ask. \r\n\r\nAlso, the slides that he teaches from are on Canvas so you can actually take a look at them beforehand which has proved to be pretty useful.\r\n\r\nFinally, go to office hours! The lab TAs as well as the problem set TA are very helpful and kind.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's a fun course dealing with circuitry- obviously it's no walk in the park, but you can do it!",
    "This is an amazing course, especially with Mark Reed teaching it, and would recommend it to anyone interested in learning about electronics, even if you're not an engineer. The labs take a lot of time to write, though, so be prepared."
