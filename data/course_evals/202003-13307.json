                "this course sucked. he makes you come to lecture, talks really slowly, and then reads off the slides. I would never recommend this to another Yale student. The homework were not easy, not well covered in class, and the grading was extremely inconsistent. I also hated not having a real syllabus and not releasing the grading percentages (ie HW and exam weights) until after the final exam was unacceptable. Not to mention he said there would be a final paper and it ended up being a 3hr exam.",
                "The slides and overall course materials were phenomenal in this course. My only issue was that the lectures could be dry at times and I would have loved to see more examples\/application of the knowledge we were learning to break up the powerpoint. I also wish assignment answer keys were posted, because some questions remained unclear even after attending office hours.",
                "loved this class. professor fischer is funny and tells fun anecdotes to teach concepts in class. i really liked it. I wish we had gone a little more in depth on some topics, but we went through so much stuff we probably did not have time.",
                "The content is interesting, but the professor is not good.",
                "Professor Fischer's explanation of the material and his slides are the best part of the course. The slides present the material in a very clear and easy-to-understand way that when combined with Professor Fischer's explanation, allows the material to be easily grasped. The first couple weeks seemed a bit slow but that was probably because I was already familiar with the content; the rest of the course was at a perfect pace.",
                "The instruction method and slides were very clear and concise, and lecture was delivered well in addition to having all the lectures recorded for re-watching. Homework and exams were very fair and we were given ample time to complete them. Sometimes homework feedback was a little unclear.",
                "Good class",
                "The course was very informational. Minimal weaknesses.",
                "The professor when I took it, Michael Fischer, clearly has deep knowledge of the subject matter and has also been following the latest developments\/research. He is a fairly clear lecturer, though sometimes I thought he went through the math a little too quickly. Be warned though, unless you are extremely interested in cryptographic algorithms, the course can be a little dry. The format is mainly monotonous lecturing through a long series of slide decks. The psets were pretty helpful to cement conceptual understanding, and I enjoyed them. However, they varied widely in difficulty: sometimes they only took a single hour, sometimes they took 5. One week there wasn't even one assigned. Just be prepared for this variability.",
                "This course gave an strong introduction to different cryptographic techniques, however at times the class was slow.",
                "Professor Fischer is very nice and extremely organized. The only occasional frustrating thing was the grading could sometimes feel very picky or arbitrary with not a lot of feedback.",
                "The class was a slideshow-based lecture, which helped convey information clearly over Zoom.  The availability of the slides and lecture recordings was also useful.  To increase participation, perhaps each lecture could have included a problem to solve in breakout rooms.  I also would have preferred if we covered fewer topics, but learned them more in depth.",
                "The course, in its online format, feels not particularly interactive. It is a hard thing to address in large online classes, but I wish we had more opportunities to discuss topics with other students or work with the material beyond just homework and exams.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Course material is interesting\r\n- Professor is highly knowledgeable and willing to help students\r\n- Lecture slides and assignments were well-organized and easy to follow\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Lectures could be kind of dry",
                "Lectures composed largely of long streams of speech without pause; lecture slides were organized but it seemed rarely updated year to year.",
                "The material presented in the course was interesting, but the presentation format was not. Lectures consisted of the professor going through 40 slides of word-dense slides with slides that we couldn't get to left as assigned reading for us to do later. Towards the end of the course I struggled to pay attention and wished I could skip lecture to later watch the recordings at 2x speed while I did something else. The professor didn't allow this, however, as daily attendance is required. Those who didn't have their video turned on in our zoom class meeting were cold-called in class, but our professor stopped doing this as often. The material of the course was pretty interesting, but I wish our professor had mixed up our regular 75 minute presentation of 40 lecture slides with something new here and there. The assignments were a strength of this course. I especially loved the programming assignments which weren't too time-consuming and required us to use the interfaces for various encryption\/decryption methods.",
                "One strength of the course is that Professor Fischer is very knowledgeable about Cryptography and was great at answering student's questions. There were many weaknesses of the course. The first weakness is that the class did not follow the syllabus. There were 2 exams, a midterm and a final, and 10 problem sets. Another weakness was the Teaching Assistant office hours as we were often mislead by the teaching assistant on how to solve the problem sets. We also did not know anything about the midterm in terms of content or format until we actually took the exam. It was scheduled a week before the date without any notice of there ever being a midterm so this threw off a lot of people's schedules.",

There was even a stated requirement that we were expected to speak at least once in every lecture.

The professor didn't stick to the syllabus, the TA didn't know what had been covered in lecture, and a new grading assistant was brought in halfway through and completely changed how problem set grading worked. Although the coursework was interesting, the disorganization wasn't worth it. Do not take this course.",

It definitely does get a little boring at times, but the lectures are pretty clear and I didn't find myself lost very often.",
