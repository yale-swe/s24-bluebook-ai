                "I learned a lot about the development of Spanish music, art, literature, and food throughout the 20th and into the 21st century. I also grew in my listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills, and became more comfortable discussing more abstract, academic concepts in Spanish. This is a helpful course if you want to maintain the skills you have and gain a little more.",
                "The twice-a-week classroom discussions helped me to practice my Spanish skills.",
                "I improved my abilities to speak and write in Spanish. I also learned more about art and artists of Spanish-speaking countries.",
                "I learned how to evaluate art in Spanish. Also, I enjoyed learning about the Latin America music industry and its influence during political upheaval, as well as about gastronomy and its roots in indigenous ingredients.",
                "Very enjoyable exploration of Spanish culture and art. Tons of time spent looking at pieces and having conversations about various art forms.",
                "Spanish grammar, writing, speaking, and reading. Very supportive in learning in all areas. Also gained background in speaking about art and art terminology",
                "Improved speaking, writing, listening and reading through exploration of visual art, music, culinary arts and literature. In this course I feel that I really improved my understanding of how to communicate more complex subjects in Spanish like marginalization, colonization, identity and culture.",
                "This course was a fantastic opportunity to practice my spoken and written Spanish. I learned about a variety of artistic genres and traditions from the Spanish-speaking world and got better about communicating my ideas through a variety of written and oral mediums. Lots of great content, and lots of language practice!",
                "More knowledge about Spanish language",
                "I developed more extensive vocabulary pertaining to Spanish music, culinary arts, fine arts, etc, as well as learning how to engage with a seminar-style class in Spanish. My conversational abilities also got better through the intercultural dialogues with Peruvian university students."

            "comments": [
                "The topics of this course are interesting, but some of the assignments such as those assessing grammar were very random. We had projects that were loosely based on the unit we were in, which were fun and helped us practice speaking and writing Spanish, but we would also have quizzes for very technical aspects of grammar which we never learned in class and were expected to somehow know on our own. We also often did not know what was happening ahead of time, so several times we were told about an in-class essay or test one or two days in advance.",
                "It is structured very much like a high school Spanish class, with lots of little assignments and readings and projects, which was not my favorite way to learn. It was easy to fall behind, but also not too much work overall.",
                "Strengths-class discussion was always good and helped me improve my speaking abilities. \r\nWeakness-The class was also a bit disorganized and spread out over Canvas, another website, another platform-it was sometimes difficult to find the right material\/assignment for the correct date.",
                "I think the content is engaging and interesting no matter if you have many or no experience with art. I think the Canva could be more organized as there was sometimes confusion about due dates and where assignments were.",
                "Strengths: Big emphasis on discussion based learning\r\nWeakness: Examination process was a bit unstructured",
                "Strengths: engagement with classmates is high, we learn from each other! Loved the content and the Professor\r\n\r\nPotential Changes: there were many small assignments which made it hard to keep track of so changing that could be helpful",
                "I love this course - It improves fluency in an exciting way that breaks out of the traditional Spanish grammar course. This is a course where you can actually use the language to learn and discuss topics in art. I learned a lot and I felt fluent after this class.",
                "This course is accessible for a wide variety of Spanish-speaking levels, but it was also rigorous enough to be useful for more advanced students. It had a great variety and consistency of assignments without the workload ever being overwhelming. Also, I appreciated the mixture of individual and group work, as well as the mixture of group discussion and structured lessons.",
                "Strengths: Profesora was AMAZING! Best Spanish teacher I have had so far \r\nWeaknesses: there were way too many formal assessments one after another. Way too much group work",
                "The course has lots of interesting content that isn't covered in other Spanish classes at Yale, and the focus on individual examples of arts (such as gastronationalism) is a new perspective on Hispanic culture that I hadn't discussed before. The intercultural dialogues were also super helpful in improving my conversational skills and were low stress opportunities to practice Spanish.\r\n\r\nThe course assignments were mostly big projects, as well as grammar quizzes, assignments, and 2 essays. These projects\/presentations were often assigned in a short amount of time, with little warning, which made it difficult to plan ahead. Additionally, a lot of the assignments felt like busy work or were not assessing material that we were taught in class (mostly things like the grammar quizzes)."

                "I wouldn't tell someone not to take the course, but I don't know if I would strongly recommend it either. It was a good way to maintain the Spanish I had already learned, learn a bit more, and get more comfortable listening, speaking, and writing. I was also able to learn how to use Spanish to discuss more abstract, nuanced, and academic topics, which is definitely a strength of the course. That being said, it was not particularly well-organized course, feedback was often absent or confusing, and the work was often tedious.",
                "I wouldn't recommend this class to people unless you just want a semi-easy Spanish L5 class where you don't learn muchespecially for people interested in art. You will watch a few interesting Netflix episodes on art but that's about it.",
                "Yes, I would recommend to a student wanting to improve their command of spoken Spanish and who has interest in art!",
                "Yes, I would 100% recommend this course to a student. Professor Leon is an amazing professor and the course content is important for any Spanish student to take.",
                "Great if you're looking for an engaging L5, definitely if Rosamaria is teaching!",
                "Absolutely!! Such a fun interactive class",
                "I would recommend this to any student at an advanced grammatical fluency looking to improve their speaking abilities in an interesting class. The class environment is really warm and open so I never felt too anxious to contribute.",
                "Yes! Great for any L5 Spanish student, whether you are a younger student hoping to improve or an older student hoping to maintain your language skills. Really interesting and challenging in a good way, but not overwhelming!",
                "Yes, it's a great opportunity",
                "I would recommend this course if you want to take a seminar-style class in Spanish and want to work up to something like a 300 level literature class, but it wasn't my favorite Spanish class at Yale and also was pretty work heavy in unexpected ways."
