                "Strengths- course load was perfect, readings were never too overwhelming and class discussion allowed for in-depth discussions\r\nLiterally no weaknesses",
                "The people: All students and teachers were super engaged and brought meaningful contributions to the conversations. Every class was a joy and it was really great to spend a lot of time relating the material to our personal lives. Professor Ferguson is INCREDIBLE. He and the TA's understood how difficult this semester was and gave everyone an \"A\" about halfway through. This allowed us to really loosen up and bring our best selves to class.",
                "strengths: I loved Professor Ferguson's choice of readings and sources, as well as the seminar structured class. I also loved the different thinking hat exercises he integrates into the class, as it allows us to appreciate the content in a variety of ways. I also loved how this class pushed us to engage with our creative thinking. \r\nNo weaknesses!",
                "Too much reading!",
                "No weaknesses, only strength. Main strength: Professor Ferguson CARES ABOUT YOU. The TAs (at least this year) CARED about us. It's a fantastic feeling. You will learn so much from them and from your brilliant classmates.",
                "Probably my favorite course this semester, there was a perfect balance of intellectual stimulation and a caring for students. We read rich material but  a fair amount of reading. The TFs were amazing and Professor Ferguson is literally such a blessing as an instructor; he is so thoughtful and really cares about each student. I always felt supported throughout the class. The syllabus was flexible to the interests of the class and Prof. Ferguson and the TFs always made it known that they valued our voices as students. It was truly an amazing experience.",
                "strengths: fascinating material, low workload, unique and creative assignments, flexibility in coursework, super accomodating policies, cool guests, makes room for personal knowledge, uses small group discussion effectively\r\n\r\nweaknesses: very small note but i wish there was less of a discrepancy between reading material lengths from weak to weka",

But this was my first WGSS class, and I was surrounded by GENIUSES. So... I sometimes felt lost. But Professor Ferguson always guided me (and everyone else like me) into the light. Being online just made it easier for me to ask questions. But that might be a personal preference.",

Dr. Ferguson is a one-in-a-million professor with incredible insight into trans and queer politics, especially as it applies to people of color. We read a plethora of papers that challenged how I view our society and revealed so many important LGBTQ+ activists and theorists. The discussions in class and in section were eye-opening and structured around participation from students.",
                "YES YES YES. Best professor and TA's of any class I've taken at Yale. Even over Zoom, I forged fantastic connections with my peers and this class really opened my eyes to a lot of history that I was unaware of.",

I feel much more enriched as a result of taking the class, and it engaged me with materials and content I have never seen in academia.",

                "Yes this class was the favorite part of my day on many occasions. Prof. Ferguson is such an amazing professor, everything he says is like a little nugget of wisdom. Also, he is just such a cool, kind person who was willing to work with students to make the class work for them. SUCH a great experience, please take it.",
