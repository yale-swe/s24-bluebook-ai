    "Exposure to a great work of North African literature!",
    "Critical thinking and anylitic skills.",
    "I extensively improved my knowledge of the Arabic language, both spoken and written, while reading and discussing the novels in Mosteghanemi's trilogy.",
    "The quality of teaching we received from Professor Elbousty was second to none. He knew his stuff extremely well and always came to class very prepared to deliver the material. We were in constant contact with the author of the trilogy, which is not something simple to organize since she is the most famous modern-day writer in the Arab World. Only Professor Elbousty would have been able to arrange such extraordinary access and for that, all of us were extremely grateful on how he went well beyond what is required from a professor to let us make the most out of this course. In addition, we learned a huge variety of literary skills when reading the trilogy and we analyzed them in depth. Professor Elbousty made us read a manageable chunk every week and this was definitely my favorite class of the semester. Everyone in the class was open to different interpretations and this opened the door for lots of constructive and fruitful debate. Through these novels, we were able to learn about the history of North Africa in a more engaging manner. We discussed many topics ranging from rampant corruption to colonialism and women's' rights. In addition, Professor Elbousty teaches in a very accessible manner, which means that we had students with varying abilities in the class!"

    "Content is really interesting. We got to speak to the author and ask our questions. Its a shame it was only once a week!",
    "Professor Elbousty is the best Arabic teacher I have encountered throughout my education. I have never come across a professor as kind, humble and engaging as him. We all looked forward to his seminars and we learned so much in a very inclusive environment.  The strengths of this class is that nothing is rigid! We read the allocated passages and come to class with many ideas ready to discuss. This means that you are free to take the trajectory of the class in whatever trajectory you deem most interesting. If you enjoy debating and coming up with your own interpretations, this is the perfect class for you. In addition, it is very unusual to be able to have direct contact with a world-renowned author and that is the level of access which this seminar provides. You also have an optional TA is very helpful and could provide you with any extra support you may require with reading and writing. This is such a well-organized class and I would highly recommend taking a class with Professor Elbousty!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes!",
    "Absolutely. Professor was very engaged and passionate. Content is really interesting and relevant. There was a mix of native and non native speakers - great dynamic.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in the Middle East and speak Arabic at a native or fluent level, this class is very interesting and would be challenging but not overly difficult. However, if you have only completed Arabic 150\/151, you are not ready and should not take this course. This class is not intended to help students learn Arabic, but rather to improve upon existing Arabic. There are no vocab sheets or stepping stones for students who need help understanding the novel. Students are, from the first class onwards, completely immersed in challenging Arabic. Do not take this class unless you are prepared to read 70-100 pages of Arabic a week, and subsequently write a couple of pages in response. I am at a near-fluent level of Arabic, and so this class was incredibly time-consuming for me because of the time it took to complete the readings and write responses. I still was able to perform well, but keep in mind that there is a lot of vocabulary that even the Arabs do not know because the novels that we read use high-diction. If you are a Middle East Studies major or concentrated on languages, or know Arabic very well, I would recommend this excellent class whole-heartedly! If you are near-fluent or have only taken Arabic 150\/151, please know what you are getting into, as this class is substantially higher level and more work then you've ever done before.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The novels that we discussed are interesting and the discussions we had were very informative.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE A CLASS WITH PROFESSOR ELBOUSTY! He is a genius in his field and you will never ever encounter such a passionate Arabic teacher! He loves his classes and research and within the first 2 minutes of meeting him it becomes apparent. The course is put together in an amazing manner, which leaves a lot of flexibility for you and your fellow classmates to take it in whatever direction you want. The learning environment is very inclusive and you touch on many relevant topics such as colonialism, violence, corruption and women's' rights to just name a few. I have never laughed this much in a Yale class and that is what makes this course extremely distinct. You get to learn from your peers a lot and the group presentations are very fun. The weekly responses are also very flexible, which is such a great method for you to write about whatever interests you the most. Do not hesitate for a second when it comes to classes delivered by Professor Elbousty!"
