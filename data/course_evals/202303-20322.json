            "comments": [
                "I thought this course was very thoroughly planned out, and I really enjoyed it a lot. Dr. DiMeglio really cares about developing not only professional technique but also professional conduct in lab, holding us to high standards of presentation of our notes that willl serve us well going forward. Despite how long organic chemistry lab is, I had a lot of fun, and always felt super happy seeing the products I had synthesized.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I don't think the 10 minute quizzes are conducive to having learned material well, it's really a race against the clock. I think allowing a bit more time or finding an alternate form of assessment would be more preferred.",
                "ADVICE: pick Monday lab if you can, you'll be in a tiny section and get tons of support + the work you do outside of lab is more important to your grade than the work you do in lab + collaborate whenever it's allowed. STRENGHTS: real, useful lab techniques + thorough description of theory + no busywork like Gen Chem lab + supportive learning environment, not afraid I'll be punished if I make a mistake or don't know what to do. WEAKNESSES: the IR spectroscopy unit is hard and I thought there wasn't enough material to learn about it or practice",
                "quizzes were, at times, unexplainably difficult.",
                "Strengths - easy to follow and conduct the actual lab experiments \r\nWeaknesses - lab quizzes are very difficult to prepare for and grading varies vastly between TAs",
                "The major strength of this course was the organization of the course and how easy it was to follow the instructions and the light workload compared to the other lab courses I have taken. The main weakness of this course was the quizzes because I think the timing of the quizzes were unfair and brought a lot of unnecessary stress to the lab.",
                "I thought that this lab course was taught very well. Instructions were always very clear and the expectations for our assignments and lab execution were never obscure.",
                "This course had a great balance of support and independence. As my first laboratory course, I felt that I had the space to make mistakes and learn without fear of being penalized. The teaching tema was always there to answer questions and help with the lab.",
                "This class is very organized and gives clear instructions. It is very helpful in learning all those experiments. The assignments and quizzes are also very helpful for understanding the materials. I think it would be great if we could have more time on the 10 minute quiz.",
                "Strengths: The TF's were a big asset to learning\r\nWeaknesses: learning material for quizzes",
                "Strengths: so much more chill and also interesting than Gen chem labs. The lab was actually centered around learning laboratory techniques in orgo and the labs were actually related to each other/ used the same skills. It was fun to make a product and then use the techniques we already learned to see how pure they were!\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the post-lab quizzes were pretty tough each week and we only had 10 minutes to do them (10 question quizzes). I understand the point of them, but they were a little difficult given that they were just to reinforce what was learned in the lab.",
                "Doing the lab itself was enjoyable, especially since I liked the people in my group a lot. The workload was not too bad and the assignments (aside from the very brutal quizzes, which I did absolutely abysmal on) were relatively easy. I also appreciated the videos about the experiment since just reading the procedures might not be enough sometimes. I just wish the quizzes had a longer time limit. The lab staff were kind, Dr. DiMeglio was approachable, and my TA was great.",
                "It is well-organized. The experiments align well with lecture content and the courses reinforces and expands upon lecture material. Few weaknesses come to mind. It is worth noting that the quizzes were often quite challenging for concepts presented that same week.",
                "Doing the lab techniques multiple times in different contexts helped increase my confidence in performing them on my own.",
                "Strengths: This course was very engaging. I like how I got to perform everything myself. The professors and TA's were all so helpful, accomodating, and encouraging. I gained a much deeper love for and appreciation of chemistry as a result of taking the class. Weakness: This class was not the best organized. I regularly spent much of my time looking for things on the canvas website, much of which was buried within documents that regularly repeated information or were unclear. I believe we were provided with way too much information and documentation, which could make topics confusing and assignments time-consuming to complete. The quizzes frequently had mistakes in them, and they tested us on things not taught in class (lecture or lab). To make experimental plans, I would spend a lot of time rewording the instructions given to us and I never felt like I really learned a lot or spent my time in a meaningful way. I believe there are other assignments or practice that we could spend time on to learn more material on a deeper level.",
                "The course is aligned well with orgo lecture, so the theory behind the experiments is easy to follow. The instructors are also helpful with setting up lab equipment. Learning more guidance/tips in lab would have been helpful.",
                "Super super fun content. Organization of the course was well thought out in a way that wasn't overbearing.",
                "Strengths: Flexible and important material to know\r\nWeaknesses: The material started off very tough (expecting us to know functional groups and other nomenclature), I high key cried for the first 3 labs, but I noticed a huge growth in my progress and now, I think that I can tackle any lab",
                "Strengths: The experiments are genuinely interesting and fun to carry out, even with the long reflux periods. Beyond that, each experiment provides an opportunity to learn a new technique or to practice an old one. By the end of the course, I felt familiar and comfortable with each step in the procedure, even if we were synthesizing a different compound, because I had learned how to carry out the protocol before. I also liked the focus on lab preparation and documentation, rather than writing up insanely long reports. I felt that the experimental plans and the lab notes helped me to properly prepare for each lab and to be ready to perform the experiment. Professor diMeglio is amazing and so fun -- she brings such great energy and joy to the lab, and is so helpful. The TFs are all great as well!\r\nWeaknesses: The post-lab quizzes were a bit frustrating since the timer was so short and there were a lot of questions. I often felt that they were more so testing my ability to speed-read than my actual understanding of the content.",
                "strengths- you learn a lot. like the way the course is set up kind of forces/tricks you to really learn the techniques in depth. that's very good.  weakness- the quizzes are hard. they're like really hard. i think dr dimeglio should allow for opportunities for collaboration or make the quizzes short answer and longer (like 1 hour) or untimed because the multiple choice is super hard to take in only ten minutes.",
                "Strengths - takes you through common organic synthesis lab techniques. Learning to write in a professional manner was really important experience and a strength of this class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - grading was not clear and TFs graded differently.",
                "The lab and content was interesting but the post lab quizzes can be improved. They were often very stressful and hard to study for so it would be more helpful to make these quizzes longer.",
                "Strengths: My lovely teaching assistant Maria made me feel so confident in the lab! Also, Professor DiMeglio is lovely and will get to know all of our names by the first day. \r\nWeakness: The labs are long. The quizzes are overwhelming and not always reflective of the study questions given in the PreLab writing.",
                "STRENGTHS: really clear instructions and expectations about the course. WEAKNESSES: I think that there was not enough time to complete the quizzes and I found that I lost points because I rushed at the very end.",
                "it is well organized",
                "Strengths: Compared to previous labs, this course was well-organized, had engaging and fun material, and aligned well with the organic chemistry lectures. \r\nWeaknesses: The quizzes are a difficult adjustment, and from other students, the popular opinions is that it is difficult to understand what is required for the quizzes, especially when the questions quiz seemingly minute values or details or touch on adjacent topics that were not covered by the experiment. It wasn't until I had a meeting with my TA and Dr. DiMeglio that I was able to approach and prepare for the quizzes in a way that would result in success. I believe it would be helpful to address this weakness by setting expectations and helpful recommendations for quizzes.",
                "The experiments were very interesting each week. I found the lab quizzes to be very difficult, but this is the nature of the course.",
                "Great course, decent workload.",
                "Long hours but worth it, only 0.5 credits.",
                "Strengths: Very organized for a smooth lab day once a week. Dr. DiMeglio and TAs are very helpful when there are questions about lab, assignments, and school life in general. Great opportunity to get a hand-on wet lab experience to apply what you learn in Orgo.\r\nWeaknesses: Quizzes can be challenging and answers sometimes require contesting due to common errors.",
                "Strengths: EPs prepared us for the labsl; Postlabs and Quizzes solidified understanding of the chemistry behind the experiments; Weaknesses: none",
                "The experiments were interesting and valuable experiences. The post lab assignments were helpful and not too much busy work. The quizzes were fine but the strict timing was unnecessarily stressful and seemed pointless.",
                "There is two much variance between TAs when it comes to grading and attitude, though mine was incredible.",
                "I think that the course was pretty well organized and accessible, especially through the modules. I think one room for improvement would be the quizzes. I would've appreciated some explanation as to why answers are incorrect and sometimes correct answers would be marked incorrect and it would be confusing to understand why.",
                "This class really required that we significantly prepared before coming to lab; this streamlined the laboratory experience. My TA was also very present and ready to help.",
                "This course is overall structured well. Though I wish some of the concepts were taught in lab such as functional groups as the lecture and lab sometimes do not go at the same pace and can be confusing.",
                "The course is well taught and pretty fun. Quiz material is sometimes a bit vague and there is too little time to answer the questions.",
                "Strengths: The course was exceptionally well organized, and I always received clear and helpful feedback on all of my assignments. I think that the syllabus provided a good, varied coverage of different topics in synthetic/analytical techniques in organic chemistry.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I do feel as if a lot of our time was spent working on tedious and/or repetitive assignments that had little practical value or purpose to them. As an example: prior to each week's experiment, we would complete an experimental plan (EP) outlining what we were meant to work on during that week's experiment. While much of the information in the EP was genuinely useful and helpful (e.g., drawing out the reaction scheme, writing out the procedure, considering safety considerations, etc.) we also had to complete a chemical table in which we were asked to provide information (melting point, density, etc.) pertaining to each substance that we intended to use in the experiment. This was always a bit annoying to do, as it felt as if we were investing a lot of time into the EP for tasks with little practical purpose.",
                "Strenghts: the TAs are awesome and Dr. DiMeglio was a great teacher. The lab videos and pre-lab readings are thorough and helpful. Weaknesses: the material on the quizzes often didn't reflect the study materials given for preparation.",
                "Strengths: lab was very low-pressure and clear with much support from TAs and professors. Assignments were posted well ahead of time with clear deadlines.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some lab quizzes were very difficult while others were very easy.",
                "strengths: great instructor, mostly fun labs\r\nweaknesses: sometimes I feel like the pre-lab readings didn't line up conceptually with what we learned in CHEM 220 lecture, which made the post-lab quizzes very difficult",
                "The class gave a good overview of methods for orgo lab work. However, the quizzes were extremely confusing and unnecessarily rushed (one minute per question), often covering questions that we had only barely been introduced to. Each week, the quizzes were frustrating and stressful, and the lab did not adequately prepare us for them, with many people scoring about 50% on a regular basis. The grading of the class felt somewhat arbitrary; it was not clear how much these quizzes factored in versus other assignments that were graded on completion. Further, different TAs differed significantly in how harshly they graded assignments like the weekly Experimental Plans.",
                "I cannot think of any weaknesses for this courseboth the instructors and TAs were very supportive and kind, especially when I was confused. There were not too many assignments, and each one I had served a purpose.",
                "Strengths: the teaching team and professor were very engaging and understanding, a part of what made this course a nice experience. I would say that, despite the higher workload, feedback was given in such a way that it facilitated student learning throughout the semester.",
                "One large strength I saw throughout my time in lab was how much engagement we got during our labs and how we were able to gain a full understanding of our steps and techniques that I felt like we were truly able to complete this lab again if we were asked to do it again on our own. One weaknesses of this course would be that the pre-lab reading assignment would be large in length in its background and description that it would be a little overwhelming and that made it harder to understand what I was reading at times. That would make it harder for me to understand our lab quizzes, so I struggled with those a lot. I found the videos extremely helpful and I would do my EP based on what the video presented because it gave a lot more in depth descriptions and it was comforting to watch someone do the experiment before I would do it in lab.",
                "Almost everything was done in class which was good, and the TA's (especially Ruth Son) were amazing.",
                "Dr. Dimeglio is a great professor and really cares about your success.",
                "The labs were great, but the quizzes were difficult and did not feel achievable with what we learned in the handouts and in lecture.",
                "Strengths; Dr. DiMeglio and Dr. Son were such joyful presences and made the lab a welcoming, enjoyable learning environment. This course is a significant improvement over gen chem lab thanks to its grading structure (experimental plans and post lab assignments are graded very fairly without obsessing over nit-picky details as was done in gen chem lab) as well as the general vibe of the lab sessions: students were treated with respect, and the TFs and instructors were always more than willing to help out when needed.\r\nWeaknesses: quizzes tested material to a level far beyond what was required for success in the lab. 10 minutes is far too little for a 10 question quiz.",
                "Strengths: I found the TFs to be very helpful, the labs to be interesting and fun, and the resources to be very well organized\r\nWeaknesses: the quizzes were fast and difficult  very few people did well, and they can be very stressful. Also, grades are curved by TF section, so you really have no clue about your grade until the last minute, and it entirely depends on how you did relative to others in your lab section",
                "Strengths: learned a lot, good hands on practice, the videos for labs were super helpful, and the TAs were great!\r\nWeaknesses: weekly quizzes were very difficult and it was very unclear how/if they would be curved which created a bit of added stress",
                "This course covered a lot of ground in laboratory organic chemistry techniques.",
                "This lab course is taught amazingly. It cannot be improved.",
                "Weakness is how some days are too long.",
                "I think the Experimental Plans can be repetitive at times but their importance is pretty clear, so I'm not sure what could be improved exactly. I think it definitely depends on your instructor.",
                "The experiments are interesting themselves, so time spent in the lab is not bad. But there were so much work outside of lab that the work of this class definitely exceeds 0.5 credit's worth.",
                "This course was great for teaching the real-world experimentation that led to the principles that was learned in organic chemistry lecture. This class was also very clear on the objectives and every lab taught something that was learned in lecture. The assignments were also great with preparing a plan and the postlabs were cumulative.",
                "I spent a lot of time writing up the experimental plans. Experiment time itself also varies greatly from person to person; don't be discouraged because you take more time than your peers to finish up the experiment! Focus on the lab techniques you learn, and you will take away a lot by the end of the course.",
                "Demanding and highly educating. Teaches the sometimes tedious nature of lab work but mainly all enjoyable.",
                "good",
                "Strengths:\r\nCourse Format\r\nIndividual Lab Work \r\nQuality TFs who are sociable\r\nPre-Lab Lectures \r\nPre-Lab technique and process videos\r\nMultiple Rubrics & Examples\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nN/A",
                "Strengths: very un-stressful environment; given a lot of freedom to do experiments, but also had a lot of help from our TF and Prof. DiMeglio. Weaknesses: post-lab quizzes were much more stressful than were helpful, and they did not test what we were taught in lab and had way too short of a time limit.",
                "Strengths: The course is formatted greatly. Before lab day we are required to complete the Experimental Plan which requires you to read the pre-lab readings, look at SDS charts, and watch the videos they give. So on lab day you're prepared and know what you will be doing. In addition, the course isn't focused on students getting stellar results, but rather emphasizes the importance of mistakes and failures during the lab process and using chemistry to explain accurate/inaccurate results.",
                "Strengths: lighter workload, very fun! Learnt a lot!\r\n\r\nCons: NA",
                "Strengths: The post lab assignments were very reasonable and the grading on them was fair.  They were not excessively long and I really felt like I was being asked questions that well applied to our work in lab.  Dr. DiMeglio was also amazing and just such a nice presence to have in lab.  No weaknesses!",
                "The weekly quizzes are clinically insane. I don't understand how they expect students to complete them in 10 minutes successfully. It is not enough time to think, let alone reference any materials. Memorizing safety pictograms and IR spectrums should not be the point of the class. PLEASE extend quizzes to at least 20 minutes.",
                "Strengths: \r\nDr. DiMeglio and TFs are very helpful and understanding.\r\nAs someone with fairly limited lab experience, the labs felt very approachable and manageable. \r\nLabs are organized in a way where each one builds off the previous one, especially towards the end, so I feel like I learned a lot.\r\nThe pre-lab work for every lab is fairly similar, and assignments are available well in advance, so the workload each week is very predictable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nPre-lab readings can occasionally be hard to digest.",
                "Strengths - Although the requirement of an experimental plan was annoying, it did force me to actually learn the experiment before I went to lab. This increased efficiency, and I actually understood what we were doing instead of going to lab anxious. Plus, the lack of the lab reports that the general chemistry laboratory sequence requires was a breath of fresh air. Sure the post-lab reports were not the best thing in the world, but they were more succinct and less time consuming. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The quizzes honestly could be done away with for this course. One, I do not understand the purpose of opening up the quizzes after the lab is done and testing on questions that in my opinion were beyond the scope of what we needed to know for the lab. It would be a different conversation if the quizzes did not factor significantly in ones grade, but unfortunately they do. Also, the quiz prep questions at the end of each pre-lab readings would be more helpful if there were answers provided with them. Otherwise, theyre just questions.",
                "The strengths of this course was that the professor and TAs were all extremely helpful and willing to walk you through any questions you may have had. I also found the course lab notes and experimental plan assignments were great ways to fully understand the material. The two large lab reports due through the semester became less intimidating because of the other assignments we had. One of the weaknesses was the quiz contents and many times the quizzes went beyond what the material implied and required a little bit of self study and researching in preparation.",
                "Strength: the labs were designed so that experiments did not have to be conducted in a hurry and with less stress on the results gathered. I appreciate how labs were designed to allow us to grow as scientists and practice important chemistry techniques.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the quizzes were difficult to complete in 10 minutes.",
                "I think the division of work was much better. The pre-lab assignments were actually necessary for the experiments, the notes and data we collected were all useful for the future, and the post-lab assignments focused more on the conceptual takeaways than the minute details of each step. I will say that I found the quizzes challenging due to the time limit, which never really improved for me throughout the course. I feel like there could have been another way to test our knowledge, even if it was just an addition or complement to the quizzes, especially since I didn't feel like I was able to change my studying or approach to learning enough to make any significant improvement."

                "Yes! This course made me realize I enjoy chemistry much more than I thought I did.",
                "YES! Waaaaaaaaay better than gen chem lab! You get to do real syntheses, learn real-world analytical techniques, and there aren't tedious data-crunching lab reports. EPs are annoying but only take 1-2 hours per week. Learned a lot. Actually had fun! ADVICE: pick Monday lab if you can, you'll be in a tiny section and get tons of support + the work you do outside of lab is more important to your grade than the work you do in lab + collaborate whenever it's allowed",
                "Yes 100%. Very engaging class and went from 0 orgo lab knowledge to complete familiarity.",
                "Yes if you need the lab credit or if you just want to learn organic chemistry lab techniques.",
                "I would recommend this course to students because it truly allowed me to learn the basics or working in a chemistry lab setting and the many techniques involved in synthesizing a product and analyzing the product.",
                "Yes, I thought the course was a very reasonable amount of work and was a fun way to get some experience in the lab.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course as a great introduction to lab work and organic chemistry at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students because this course is fun and informative.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, if you have to take it. It was structured very well and help was always available.",
                "yes, for a major requirement.",
                "Yes! so fun.",
                "Yes, I believe it is a great introduction to organic chemistry laboratory techniques and I enjoyed myself a lot. While there were some weeks where I felt frustrated with the class, overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it and looked forward to lab each week. I had a lot of fun.",
                "Yes. Hands down. One of the best lab courses",
                "Yes! It definitely depends on your TA, but I loved mine and I grew a lot in the span of the course",
                "Honestly yes, even if you don't need to take it. Coming out of gen chem lab, organic lab is such a welcome change. I felt that the class developed my passion for chemistry and for being in a research setting. Unlike gen chem lab, you actually really understand everything you do in the lab and why you're doing it. I felt like I built skills in this class that I could use in the future!",
                "i mean you definitely are taking it because you have to... that being said yeah i would i guess. it was good, much less workload (and tedium) than gen chem 2 lab. like i don't LOVE lab but synthesizing products kind of gives you a rush idk its cool",
                "Yes - it is most likely required for your major, but it really is quite fun if you enjoy experimentation.",
                "Yes, if you need orgo lab.",
                "Definitely would recommend if you need it as a requirement.",
                "Not unless required",

                "yes",
                "Yes, it's a good course that teaches you important organic chemistry techniques. No need to take it if you don't have to though",
                "yep !",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! Especially if you are not on the Pre-Med track. I had a great experience in lab and I think others can agree that it was fun. It does not really supplement knowledge in Orgo, but it helps understand the real-life application of the reaction mechanisms. If you are not on the Pre-Med track, the only incentive to take it would be for the hands-on wet lab experience, and the workload isn't that bad.",
                "Yes, great way to learn about organic chemistry in the laboratory setting",
                "Yes, this is a good introductory course for any stem major.",
                "This course is definitely better than the other Chemistry labs that I've taken. Not only do you learn more applicable skills, but the work never feels like \"busy work\" which is common in other lab courses.",
                "It was definitely my favorite lab course out of the three that Ive taken mandatorily, so, by those standards Id say Id recommend it. Pretty good course!",
                "I would recommend this to another student if it is a prerequisite for your major.",
                "Frankly, only if you enjoy organic chemistry or if you need to take it. This class does stress professionally in scientific writing.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone looking to do research as a career.",
                "Yes, the course is pretty fun and lab reports are not long.",
                "Yesmost students considering CHEM 222L are probably doing so if they are required to for their major or another requirement, but I would still recommend it even if it isn't a requirement. It's a good introduction to a lot of lab techniques (especially relevant if you want to participate in research) and serves as a good supplement to CHEM 174/220 if you're interested in chemistry.",
                "Yes. It should definitely be taken concurrently with the Orgo 1 lecture. Most people take it because they have to; that said, if you have to, don't be intimidated.",
                "Yes, I enjoyed this class more than the lecture. You also develop a community within your lab section.",
                "It's definitely valuable for learning foundational O-chem lab techniques, but it also feels extremely tedious to watch a ~30 min of video, read a 10-12 pg pre-reading, write an experimental plan, and complete a lab quiz for each lab.",
                "I wouldn't recommend taking this course unless you have to for pre-med or your major. Especially for a half credit class, it added a significant amount of stress to my workload.",
                "Yes! Even if they are nervous about performing experiments (like I was), everyone is so kind and wants you to succeed. After a few classes, many of the experiments that may have been confusing in the beginning come naturally to you.",
                "Yes, although a requirement for some majors, this lab was worthwhile for me",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in a STEM-related field. It would not be relevant to those who were not STEM-majors, but the techniques we use are very hands-on and definitely build a great foundation on what I imagine any lab-experience will include.",
                "Yes, because it is much less work outside of class than the general chemistry labs and the labs are much more interesting.",
                "Yes, it is much better than Gen Chem lab.",
                "It's probably required, but this is my favorite chemistry lab by far",
                "I would recommend taking organic lab, as it is truly an enjoyable experience even for pre-med non-STEM majors. It is so satisfying to synthesize a specific organic compound and be able to analyze its purity.",
                "Yes! This class made me more excited about chemistry and even want to be a chem major! The experiments are fun and the environment of the lab isnt too stressful. Also, Prof. DiMeglio is amazing!",
                "Yes -- good intro to organic chemistry lab work (and labs in general)",
                "I'd recommend this course to a student who seeks having knowledge of organic chemistry laboratory techniques.",
                "Yes, you learn a lot of organic chemistry techniques in a wonderful environment.",
                "Only if necessary as a prerequisite",
                "Not unless they need it for a requirement",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student as it really shows how the knowledge that is taught in lecture was obtained. It gives students a hands-on experience with organic chemistry.",
                "good",
                "Yes! I enjoyed orgo lab (more than gen chem lab). The labs were enjoyable and I liked that you get good practice with the different techniques because they come back again.",
                "Absolutely.",
                "If you're interested in doing chemistry research or haven't done any lab work before, then yes. It taught me a lot about lab techniques and was well aligned to what we were learning in class.",
                "Yes, definitely. The CHEM 222L faculty is amazing, especially Christine DiMeglio. She is very supportive and understanding!",
                "YES! Not a lot of work",
                "Yes!  It is a great lab and Dr. DiMeglio really does a great job teaching students and creating a supportive atmosphere.",
                "Yes, I would; though most people are likely taking this class as a requirement, it complements organic chemistry lecture well, and your understanding of organic chemistry concepts does not have to be super strong in order to do well in lab.",
                "Overall, this course is very straightforward and fair. Performance in lab is closely tied to how much you prepare with the pre lab materials, what you should do/look at is outlined clearly in the syllabus and readings. If you are prepared for lab and mostly know what you are doing, then the labs themselves are interesting and gives you first hand experience with important techniques. The TAs and other instructors in the lab are usually helpful as well, though this of course would vary from person to person.",
                "I would never recommend a lab unless its absolutely necessary, but CHEM 222L is definitely better than the general chemistry laboratory sequence.",
                "I would recommend this to students taking organic chemistry to supplement what they're learning and to those interested in working with IR spectroscopy and a common organic chemistry lab environment.",
                "I would if the student desires to learn organic chemistry techniques.",
                "Organic lab is much better than general chemistry. At some points, it actually felt like a true lab experience. It wasn't my favorite, but I do feel like I benefited from it beyond it being a companion for the lecture.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as it was very well organized and an enjoyable part of my week."
