    "After taking this class, I learned how to present, speak in seminar and write op-eds, finals papers.",
    "A survey of several ongoing debates and political issues in Global Health and their intersections with other topics such as Economics, Climate Change, International Security, etc.",
    "This course helped me understand roles of politics in global health. It provided me with a solid background on the political power dynamics in health care system from the past to the present. I also learned to see global health as an inter-related field with politics, law, economics, etc.",
    "I learned how to view topics I traditionally viewed through a more empirical lens as dynamic and nuanced. I honed my communication skills through thoughtful critique of my papers. Engaging in debate with my peers and my professor taught me how to present a point or argument on the spot and to the point, which will serve me well professionally. I also have not been exposed to global politics to the extent that I would have liked at this point in my education and I believe that this class has made me a stronger and more capable health professional.",
    "A working knowledge of the political aspects of global health, including global health governance, cooperation, and challenges.",
    "The politics behind global health interventions and policies, and how they intersect with social determinants of health from climate change to migration",
    "I had never been exposed to how politics and various actors have such a large impact on global health. I thought it was helpful to learn what constituted global health and what was involved in the field of politics before learning about the interdisciplinary nature of global health politics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: professor brings her experience into the class, wide variety of classmates (majors, years, grad which made it valuable), guest speaker was great,  \r\nWeakness: class felt boring at times, presentations could have presented more challenging questions and dilemmas in global health, \r\ncontent wide, I think there's needs to be more criticism of neoliberalism, WTO, and big powers, racism, imperialisms, policy, that work in global health, more information about trade, sanctions, taxes and medical education, inequality in different countries would be very valuable as well. More about how governments react, prioritize and how they work in global health settings\r\n\r\n  students could lead the seminar, with a seminar leader for every week in place of the presentation or in addition to it and let students bring questions to the table that the entire class can discuss. I think this would bring in more student engagement into the table and allow for more diverse voices to speak. and also hold students accountable to do the readings. If was often hard to participate in class, because we didn't have time due to the presentation and lecture. if we instead just have students present and bring questions, it gives agency and ownership to the students and more discussion time as well. everyone could submit a question to the leader or comment (100 words or less) on canvas and the seminar leader can take over and present those questions in class and lead with guidance from the professor.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Kerry offers professional insights about topics in global health that are unparalleled. From her own experience, she has so many stories to share that offer meaningful insights about what the real problems are (vs. what we just read about in academic papers, policy, or news) and who is working on them. I'd say the only major weakness about this class is that it is a survey course; you can't expect to get very deep into the issues themselves. That being said, Prof. Kerry did do a great job framing some of the key debates in a politically neutral way. This gave me a new lens to think about these issues that I definitely didn't have before.",
    "I think the biggest strength, also the most enjoyable part of this course for me, was the class discussions. These discussions were perfect opportunities for me to learn how my peers thought and their insights on global health politics issues. Another highlight of this course was the class presentation. Class presentation gave me the freedom to research on topics I was interested in. The only one improvement I would suggest is to have some discussion questions related to readings posted onto Canvas. Some of my classes use this to make sure students understand the readings.",
    "The engaged debate was by far the strength of this course. I appreciated that conversations were respectful and inquisitive and we were encouraged to challenge each other in a safe space. My only comment on that would be to regulate the amount of speaking time, so would monopolize the conversation including myself. The papers required a different skill out of my than I am used to so I cannot speak to the strengths and weaknesses, just my own. There could have been clearer criteria for the oral project, as our skill and styles varied wildly but I enjoyed hearing from other students what they found meaningful.",
    "It is a fantastic course. Well-organized, timely, and incredibly important today.",
    "The course was engaging and actively incorporated many practical skills for global health advocacy - for example the midterm was writing an op-ed, and each seminar had student presentations on a current issue of interest. The only weakness would be the broad nature of the course and the global health field itself, and I often left seminar wanting to go deeper into discussions and beyond the readings",
    "Strength: No one person dominated the conversation because we all came from diverse backgrounds. Enjoyed completing various assignments that allowed us to explore topics we were interested in. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Needed more clarity with instruction for various new assignments but definitely thought we all got there by the end."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! there could be more guidance for op-ed\/ final paper but otherwise it's pretty great to get more insight into global health from someone in the field. classmates are engaged, readings could be from more diverse sources, I.e primary sources, letters, declarations, & voices from we don't typically hear from. in other words, not just public health academics but also community leaders, activists. I think more exploration of how policy makers get to a decision would be helpful. why do they fund, where is it coming from and how do governments shift their budget to make global health happen? \r\n\r\n if you are a global major, this class is a good fit much better than the GLBL230 class with Talbert-Sagle which just rushes over everything, at least this offers you more time to speak and engage with professor.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have a pre-existing strong interest in global health or if you want to gain a survey-level understanding of key ongoing debates.  Since the workload for this class is relatively low (1 presentation; 1 final paper; 1 editorial article\/midterm paper), you'll only really get something out of it if you invest in doing the readings and try to build a relationship with Prof. Kerry. She does do an amazing job of making herself available outside of class and offering assistance for each of the assignments. Since she's a stellar prof, I would highly recommend trying to make the most of these opportunities if you end up sticking with it.",
    "Yes. A really great class for students interested in global health, global affairs, and politics.",
    "I would 100% as long as they are prepared to relinquish any stubborn opinions or superiority complexes in order to engage with those who are different than themselves. I find that yale can sometimes be a bubble so this class is best for those who want to expand their curiosity as opposed to confirm their held beliefs",
    "Yes, definitely!",
    "Totally! Incredible course for anyone interested in global health policy, and taught by a passionate professor with deep knowledge and experience in her field",
    "Definitely!!! I learned a lot about global health and its ties with politics. I think the syllabus provided us with a great range of topics to discuss and assignments to complete.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Great class! I feel like I learned so much about global health. I really enjoyed the class discussions. The assignments were really fun to write and pushed me to formulate strong arguments."
