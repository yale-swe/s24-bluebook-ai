I developed a deep understanding of the Venezuelan migrant and refugee crisis as well as the international migrant and refugee legal regime. I also learned to work independently on a long-term research project, to collaborate in a large team of committed members, and to present ideas concisely and convincingly.",
                "So, so much. I learned alot about the Venezuelan refugee crisis and Venezuelan pendular migrants, as well as refugee issues in general, international aid, and international organizations. In terms of skills I gained alot of teamwork and collaboration skills, learning how to split up the project, maintain a good group morale, work through different opinions, etc. In terms of insights, I walked away with a strong sense of what it means to be invested in the people behind the issues we are solving, and the value of championing that moral lens in tandem to data-driven work.",

                "The course facilitated student initiative and leadership, allowing us to direct the course of our project within the parameters set by our client. Professor Robinson (Rob) was incredibly helpful and hands-on, but still managed to ensure that we had full autonomy over our recommendations to the State Department. I am sure it was a very difficult balance to strike. One weakness of the course was the lack of clarity from the Global Affairs major's supervisors about expectations and logistics  we often turned to Rob to ask about administrative questions (length of presentation, length of final report, size of travel budget, etc.), and he then had to go to the supervisors for insight. It would have made more sense just to be in regular email contact with the students and to send information along to the whole senior class with updates.",
                "Strengths: So many strengths -- great instructor, great group of students, interesting topic, cool experience to work with a real client, etc\r\nWeaknesses: the only weaknesses are things out of our control, such as not being able to go to Colombia given covid, as well as Jackson at large offering a set of capstones that were mostly security & health focused with none on economics or environment that students may have been interested in",
                "Strengths: amazing project, great connections, worked with people on the ground, great team\r\nWeaknesses: none"

                "Yes! Absolutely! But make sure to select the right project take some time to think about the expectations of the project and speak to previous students about the project's mentor if possible. I feel very lucky to have been in Rob's group, but can see how the experience would have been entirely different had I had a different mentor.",
                "Absolutely! This was one of my best experiences at Yale. I went into the project feeling like I didn't exactly get the Capstone topic that aligned with my interests, but I became incredibly fortunate to have an amazing instructor (Rob) as well as fellow students, and the process of working on a team for a client's goals felt really fulfilling given that most work at Yale is very individual. It was also really meaningful to present our work to the rest of Jackson as well as our client. We were able to talk to so many interesting speakers and I truly learned so so much. It is a really special experience to conduct original research and build recommendations that may actually be implemented in the real world.",
                "You have to take this course to complete the Global Affairs major, so yes I recommend it haha! I would recommend trying to rally your group to really make it a team effort. I thought that the workload for the senior capstone was INCREDIBLY manageable because we were a group of eight that divided the work evenly. I was hesitant about the whole group project aspect, but I honestly enjoyed it because everyone was willing to do their work. This may just be the behavior of people in my group, but I thought that this course was very fun because we divided the work and learned lots."
