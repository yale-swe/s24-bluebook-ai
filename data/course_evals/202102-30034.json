                "so much repetitive lecture",

The final project is fair and there are no assignments that will surprise you with how much work. It is also very difficult to fall behind, which is nice. Just make sure to do a good job, as there are not that many assignments and they may be graded harshly. Also the curve is unfortunate.",
