    "General improvement in vocab and writing skills.  More natural speaking.",
    "This is an intense course and I feel that my Spanish improved enormously while taking it. I think I improved in all aspects, but certainly in speaking and confidence.",
    "More advanced grammar, improved listening comprehension, better flow when speaking.",
    "A continuation of Spanish grammar and vocab. Grammar topics include subjunctive, imperfect, preterite, conditional and future tenses, indirect and direct object pronouns among others.",
    "An good level of grammar as well as comunication Skills. It was also great to go into small aspects of Spanish literature and culture as we learnt the grammar.",
    "This course is very comprehensive. I learned many grammar structures and felt my Spanish improved.",
    "Spanish grammar and speaking",
    "I developed my ability to understand Spanish vocabulary and grammatical concepts. I also improved my ability to read, write, and speak in Spanish",
    "More grammar and vocabulary. We also improved writing\/reading\/speaking skills.",

   "comments": [
    "The pace of the class was very good.  We fit in the material without rushing too much.  The material also felt interconnected.  I would say the worst part of the course was the short stories, but I did feel they contributed and do not think they should be outright removed.",
    "The only weakness in this course is the novel we read, El Secreto de Cristobl Coln. I think the reading level was perfect for us, but surely there's something more interesting? It felt like reading a children's chapter book, but boring.",
    "From speaking with students in other sections, grading and teaching in the course is very inconsistent. Also, it would be much better if sections were smaller.",
    "I enjoyed that class was everyday and the workload was relatively light. I also enjoyed the focus on oral skils.",
    "If you werent as good as spanish as the other students, she still kept at their level rather than helping the lower level",
    "The grammatical concepts were presented in a very organized fashion. This was the strength of the course. However, I did not find the online homework very engaging. I found that the personalized homework in the CC was much clearer and more specific to the lessons at hand",
    "The major strength of this course was the great professor. I'd say a weakness that I heard from a lot of people was the textbook (very expensive, but not all that useful).",
    "Well-structured and clearly laid out, good feedback system"

    "Yes, professor was helpful and I feel my skills were greatly improved.",
    "Absolutely. I think this is a great class.",
    "Take it, but if your Spanish dept in high school was pretty relaxed, know that it's not like that here and that you do need to be strictly correct.",
    "I would recommend this course, but scope out the professors first - the quality of teaching and toughness of grading varies wildly.",
    "If you want to continue learning Spanish, I recommend taking this course. An easy and great way to fulfill your language reqs.",
    "Would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in taking L3 Spanish. While a tough grader, Professor Reymundi is an excellent teacher. Super well organized, really good at what she does and gives students personal attention. Great class.",
    "I would. I think it is a very well rounded Spanish grammar course that is also enjoyable.",
    "While this class is 1.5 credits, it is a very manageable workload, and your Spanish definitely improves while taking it.",
    "Yes if theyre taking spanish",
    "Yes! Clear and fair course. I left the class feeling much more confident in my ability to read and write in Spanish especially",
    "Take it if you want to learn some Spanish"
