                "American political dynamics, writing, argument, debate, history, supreme court cases, better understanding of my country.",
                "A lot of knowledge about different political ideas and the key tenets of classical liberalism that undergirded the American Revolution. Also, the class gives you a good understanding of the different methods of constitutional interpretation and how to apply them (with a thorough examination of key cases on race, gender, wealth, etc).",
                "I learned a lot about how to manage my time, what distracts me while reading and what doesn't, and learned to take short but effective notes for the larger assignments. In class I learned a lot about how to discuss with other classmates. When agreeing I learned how to add to their argument rather than just repeating it, and I think more importantly I learned how to be polite and understanding when I didn't agree.",
                "I learned about the origins to our American creed and become more informed on historical works and figures that influenced American politics.",
                "I gained so many skills with regard to questioning America's historical documents, reviewing the context in which topics were discussed, being critical of political thought by those long praised for their opinions, and constitutional interpretation, and understanding the great effect of words in legislation. This class was a great introductory course into the world of American politics and analyzing America's political system.",
                "I learned a great deal about the foundations of the US political system with a particular focus on the judiciary. A great course for appreciating the political and intellectual foundations of the American constitutional system. Also you learn how to read Supreme Court cases which is fantastic!",
                "I learnt how to evaluate the American Constitution  and how to dissect it in an effective way to deeper understand its purpose and power.",
                "An in depth knowledge of consitutional values and their relationship with American society and analytical thinking and writing skills.",
                "The course started by giving students an understanding of foundational American Ideals and as it progressed, gave students a critical understanding of constitutional interpretation and the Supreme Court through American History. I learned how to write analytical, argumentative papers using Supreme Court cases and my choice of class materials. I also learned how to participate in this kind of seminar and use evidence to back my comments in discussions."

            "comments": [
                "This course is mostly good.  If youre interested in the political philosophy behind constitutional law, I would recommend the course.  If youre interested in court cases, I would recommend it.  You really learn a lot and gain a new understanding for the legal process.  However, a lot of the assigned reading was never discussed in class and the grading for papers was ridiculously slow.  I wish there was like a required reading section and optional reading section.",
                "The coursework, grading, and essays are straightforward; there are no surprises. Most of the readings are manageable, though some are harder to get through than others. Some students may feel unprepared to add to classroom conversations if they do not have a solid background in US history, especially concerning the federal government and the Supreme Court. Background information could be given at certain times to make sure everyone is on the same page.",
                "There was quite a lot of dense reading for this course, often written in the 18th century or earlier. However, the discussions were relevant and engaging, especially when we started diving into Supreme Court cases. In the future, it would be nice if there was an even greater focus on the Supreme Court.",
                "Most everything was strong about this course. Wouldn't change anything.",
                "Strengths: Amazing professor, great topics/readings, proper workload\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like the grading was fair but far more correlated with how good a writer you are than how well you engaged with and understood the material. Course would benefit from more emphasis with grades on class discussion.",
                "Strengths: it's a good introductory political philosophy class in a seminar format, making for a lot of great discussion with your peers about political ideas\r\nWeaknesses: i felt like this case avoided a lot of important historical events and supreme court cases such as Brown v Board, Roe v Wade, Obergefell v Hodges because they were too controversial",
                "The biggest strength of this course is definitely its conversation style format. It was very engaging hearing others students talk, and these discussions really helped me fill in the blanks in my understanding from the readings. This format really fosters relationships between students as well as with the instructor, and it's safe to say I got to know more about each one of my classmates in this course than any other.\r\n\r\nA weakness is probably the density of the readings. I'd say that the main point can still get across without having to read an entire work.",
                "A strength of the course I thought was that the entire class was discussion based, allowing for a constant exchange of ideas among students.",
                "This course was overall incredible. The discussions we had were engaging and the topics were quite interesting. One weakness is the pacing, while some weeks we had to read several hundred pages of dense reading, other weeks were filled with one or two briefer court cases. The workload was a little inconsistent at times, but, still manageable.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Silverstein is great as both a discussion leader and as knowledgable professor. Almost all class discussions were excellent. Great reading list\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes readings felt like a lot, but nothing terrible. Perhaps spend less time on the intellectuals of the courses (Locke (which I enjoyed), Paine) and more on the court cases which was where the course really shined.",
                "The course covers alot of material and there is thus alot of reading. It might be helpful to have a bit more guidance on which texts will be discussed more thoroughly in class to allow focused preparation to facilitate more informed discussion.",
                "The strengths are definitely Professor Silverstein's expertise as well as the well-curated course materials. I left the class with a very comprehensive understanding of the course content and was always excited by what we were learning about. The weaknesses are certain parts of class discussions. They were easily dominated by a select group of students and veered off-course which was sometimes discouraging for participation and also confusing. I think this could easily be improved by using a bit of a faster pace when guiding discussions. This would also allow for more material to be discussed."

                "I would recommend this course.  Despite some of the flaws, I truly believe that most people will come out with a greater understanding for political philosophy and constitutional law.  If youre not interested in the topics, I would still take the course as it is important to understand the material being taught especially in todays world.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in the foundation of American political thought and its application and evolution over the last few centuries.",
                "If you are interested in American political history or political theory, I would really recommend this course! However, I can see how this class would drag on for those that aren't really interested in those fields.",
                "Yes. This is the best, most challenging, and fun class I have taken at Yale.",
                "I think every student who can should take this course. It is the best course I have ever taken.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in politics or philosophy whatsoever, this class gives you a great foundation in political philosophy, and you learn a lot along the way because of the seminar based format of the class. Also, you learn a good amount about constitutional law and interpretation, in a way that is arguably superior to the Constitutional Law class at Yale (plsc 233) taught by Akhil Amar, because the seminar-based format allows for some very insightful discussion that I dont think one would get in a lecture class.",
                "Yes. This was unlike any course I had ever taken before, and I'm certain anyone who takes this course would enjoy such a different change in learning pace. Even if they are not a huge fan of government, these topics apply to almost every part of modern day life, and I'm sure that there is something to be taken away by everyone.",
                "Yes, I think it provides a lot of insight on the shaping of American government and the political scene today.",
                "Yes, yes, yes! For any student that is interested in learning about constitutional interpretation, having deep conversations about the nuances facing political officials and the nation today, and so much more, this is the course for you. The discussions we had in this class were invaluable and they always left me more open-minded and pondering those topics even further.",
                "Yes! Especially if interested in History or Polsci. Also -- definitely take a class with Prof. Silverstein. He is great.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as I believe it is a valuable course which teaches you a lot about the power of words and allows you to question aspects of our government.",
                "Yes! Extremely engaging and interesting.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is interested in American history and politics. I think it is a great way to start your Yale experience. I would warn students about the discussion dynamic as well as the workload, but would say that even with these components, the class is fantastic and worth taking especially because of Professor Silverstein."
