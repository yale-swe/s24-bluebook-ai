                "I think personally,  I expected this course to focus a little more on the sociological, political, and economic development of China. Instead, this course became a little bit more of an art history based course. It was still enjoyable although not what I expected. '\r\nA strength of the course was definitely Dr. P. She is one of the kindest people I have ever met and her excitement about these topics is contagious. She does her best to be flexible with due dates if people have busy weeks and I really appreciate that. Another strength is the final project. Dr. P lets you pick any topic you want and it is really exciting to have the freedom to ask questions and do research on topics that you are most interesting. \r\nI think a weakness of the class is the seminar format, especially at the beginning of the course. Many of the readings are archaeological papers that don't offer much room to deviate from their findings. As someone with zero background in this field, it was hard for me to offer my own insights rather than just rephrasing what the experts said in their papers. Also, I think that the class spends a bit too much time on various settlements from neolithic era China and should instead focus more on the cities that we discussed at the end of the class.",
                "This course was super well taught -- Dr. P is an amazing professor!! The weekly amount of work is about 3 hours but then ramps up to like 12 hours of studying for the midterm and over 20 hours of work for the final project and paper. We went on a lot of field trips and Dr. P always brought us food and was very accommodating on every assignment and let us zoom in when we were sick.",
                "This course seemed like, as in the course description, a course focusing on city development and urbanization in Ancient China. I very much feel like it is a course more closely geared towards art history subjects, which are interesting in their own right. The module structure of this course was also very helpful, as it allowed a more focussed look into specific archeological and historical sites which were fascinating to me.",
                "While the course itself was fascinating, it would be really helpful to have a brief overview to put things in context before learning more details. It was sometimes really difficult to situate the sites in their time frame and context and have a broader understanding of what was going on. I watched quite a few youtube 'China overviews' to try to get this context.",
                "Better clarification on how the course was graded would have been helpful. More timely feedback on weekly assignments would be great as well."
