                "I learned to critically analyze the creation, implementation, and effects of social policy. I got comfortable looking through federal and state legislation to understand the exact mechanisms underlying the our social safety net. I also got experience thinking about and proposing meaningful, and realistic, changes to major government programs. I also learned how to both critically analyze what is present in our welfare programs as well as what is missing and who is excluded, which is a really significant lens. No matter what I end up doing, I am now far more prepared to engage in meaningful conversations, both as a wonk and layperson, about our federal and state social safety nets.",
                "I literally learned SOO much about welfare policy in the US (mostly that it needs to be fixed). I also learned to think about the feasibility of making policy changes and how limiting it can be without truly fixing the entire system.",
                "I learned so much about all the major federal social welfare programs in the U.S., as well as how to engage in discussions about the history of these policies and how they can be improved.",
                "I learned to read and analyze information on social welfare policy, and craft my own memos synthesizing these sources and proposing policy changes based on them.",
                "In this class, I learned so much about welfare policy in the United States and how it can be reformed. This class would be great for people interested in sociology, political science, or just interested in how welfare policy works in the US. All in all, this class taught me how to be a policy wonk!",
                "This course showed me how U.S. social welfare policies are structured and function. Without previous knowledge of welfare specific programs, I gained valuable insight into how our country assists populations in need.",
                "Discussion of specific welfare programs in US as well as a few overarching themes such as administrative burden. Also practice talking and writing about policy.",
                "This is probably one of the best courses that you can take at Yale College. It primarily discusses U.S. welfare policy and programs. This was my first time not only sitting down and reading policy but also having the opportunity to discuss what's currently wrong with our welfare system and what changes can be done to make it better. Even if you're not a socy major, you should take this course to understand the different components of policy in the U.S.",
                "I learned about a large array of social safety net programs in detail, including their pitfalls.",
                "I learned an enormous amount about the technical details, ideological underpinnings, and historical background of specific social policy programs (e.g., TANF/welfare, SNAP/food stamps, Section 8, Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security programs, etc.). I also refined my skills with respect to writing policy memos, which is different than standard academic writing.",
                "I learned so much! I learned how to not only understand/read about American welfare policy but how to criticize it. I developed an ability to voice my opinions in a way that I could incorporate my opinion and experiences while integrating facts of the policy. I was also able to have a closer look into my lived experience by viewing it from the perspective of state and federal governments. I was also able to research policy in an effective manner.",
                "Throughout the class, I learned about the details of different social welfare policies in the United States (such as SNAP, unemployment benefits, etc.) as well as problems associated with each one. During class, we analyzed what works and doesn't work in the program and made connections between the programs and how history, politics, and other factors influence its creation and implementation. At the end of the class, I also learned how to write a policy memo trying to improve one of the policies we talked about in class."

                "This course makes policy reform feel possible. It removes the cover from a discrete process and encourages students to critically analyze welfare programs and make meaningful proposals for reform. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses.",
                "It was nice having discussion leaders each week. The point of the class was mainly to learn about and understand policy which was helpful but I do wish we had had a bit more time for discussion.",
                "Professor O'Brien is one of the most caring, enthusiastic instructors I've ever had. He really took into account the difficult circumstances during the semester. The format of the class is very organized, and I appreciated the working class Google doc where we would compile questions and notes each class. The readings and overall workload were very manageable. I can't think of very many things to improve, but perhaps including some comparative policy perspectives (internationally) could help with students' understandings of how U.S. social welfare policy can be improved.",
                "Main Strength: Rourke O'Brien!!!! He is an amazing prof!!! \r\nOther strengths: The memo format was really great and helped us engage with what we had learned and become true policy wonks ourselves. I really liked the class discussions and the notes document we had to keep track of everything. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish this course had been in person, but I think Professor O'Brien did a better job than most professors at adapting to the zoom format!",
                "The class was centered around discussion, which helped to keep everyone engaged and facilitated many interesting perspectives. The weekly assignments might be improved by interspersing different types of projects with the discussion posts. Keep the daily check-ins!",
                "Amazing class! Really appreciate the efforts towards accessibility, meeting people where they are, welcoming all thoughts/voices. Also learned a lot!!",
                "I think the syllabus was organized perfectly as it allowed us to do a deep dive into each program each week or two, and then throughout the course we would reflect on the consistent themes that we noticed. The course was very focused on getting into the weeds so that we could hold substantive conversations or write meaningful memos on policy issues, which I liked a lot. At the same time, Professor O'Brien didn't assume any knowledge on our behalf--each week's readings included basic primers on the program we were studying, so it was easy to start learning about a new program if you hadn't encountered it before. I also think having weekly presenters helped because we always had one or two people apart from the professor who could help facilitate discussion. Another thing is I think it was helpful to have the short presentations from Professor O'Brien to give us some background on the program we were studying and pull out some main points for the week.",
                "The weekly memos were very helpful in having us summarize our thoughts and the details of the programs. It was also great to read each others' memos and see how we pick up on different things. The class discussion file where we write down notes during class and prepare beforehand was an incredible resource during and after class. We raised and discussed huge questions at the heart of welfare policy that shapes our lives and how we are able to help each other. Professor O'Brien is the greatest strength of this course. He raises the level of engagement through the organization of the class and his presence. He adds essential questions and ideas during our discussions while still giving us autonomy to lead the discussions. He is so encouraging and engaging that I cannot imagine a course so well taught on a topic so important and complex in political science.",
                "One strength of the class was that one program was covered every week, which made it easy to comprehend the details as well as make connections to other policies. Another strength was that the assignments did not seem like busy work, but to rather help us understand what we know and what we're having troubling understanding about the programs."

It was a great way to frame the conversation while allowing us to also discuss larger theoretical themes and critiques. Having each week led by a student discussion leader was also really good. The workload was manageable such that this was not a stressful assignment, yet also added variety to the discussion every week. Professor O'Brien also made time at the start of class for people to mention things they were grateful for and general small talk, which I found very helpful to take a breather during my hectic schedule.",

I really appreciated this! He also started each class by having people share happy things from their weekends, or that were going on in their lives (and he shared as well). I loved this! It really cheered me up after a day packed full of zoom classes and work meetings on Monday and I wish more professors would do things like this. It's the little things that count and can really make a difference in helping students reset and get ready to engage with another online class.",
                "The centralized class documents were very helpful.",
                "Professor O'Brien had us use a Google doc that would have our questions and main points from our reading responses, and where people could actively take notes or write down questions as we went through the seminar. I think this was a helpful way to collect the large amounts of information and technical details we were juggling at one time, leveraging the fact that we were all already on our computers.",

It helped us organize class discussion and became a great reference for our papers later. Break out rooms were great to allow us to get to know each other and develop ideas. I can imagine how great it would be in person where we can all be together!"

It gave me the basic policy knowledge and skills to confidently discuss my thoughts on critical programs like SNAP, TANF, social security, unemployment insurance, and more. The assignments (policy memos) were open-ended and allowed me to explore what I was really interested in personally.",

I think the course is especially suited for people who really do want to do a deep dive into the technical details of these programs and their consequences--you will go into the weeds, but in a way that is not boring and will help you actually use these details in real life if you want to.",
                "I am proud to call myself a policy wonk after this class. I cannot imagine a better way to have ended my time at Yale. I majored in something I am not too fond of but this class truly made my regrets disappear. I am happy I made time for this course. This class solidified that my experiences and my passions can inform policy to contribute to a greater good. This course touches upon all the essential aspects that exist in welfare policy and emphasizes the human aspect of it all while maintaining technical details. I found myself fully engaged because the material was so well organized and the sources we read were so informative. The conversation never lacked and we formed such progressive policy proposals together.  We started our class with moments of gratitude and I left every discussion grateful to have been able to take this course. I always felt heard and included and that my thoughts were as important as everyone else's which has been rare in my STEM courses. This class has been pivotal in my academic and professional journey. I wish I had this course and professor O'Brien sooner.",
