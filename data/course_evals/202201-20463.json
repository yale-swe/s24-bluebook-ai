                "Learned a lot about a range of late 20th and 21st century social theorists. Improved my critical thinking skills and my sense of society and sociology as a discipline.",
                "Despite not being a sociology major, I learned so much about multiple aspects of social theory, from more applicable topics like class, politics, and gender to more theoretical ones, like the goal and audience of sociology. I thought the theoretical part would be boring, but I honestly learned a lot.",
                "Important contemporary social theory and how it applies to our own lives",
                "The writing assignments were great practice in putting theorists with very different styles in conversation with one another. I was able to apply my personal views on social theory to theoretical works I had not read before, which was an interesting experience.",
                "Honestly very little.",
                "In this class I learned a lot about social theory, including what it is, what it has been, what it can be, and what it should be. Our main topics were race, gender, and sexuality, and I really appreciated that this course deviated from the classical social theorists and really expanded my view of what counts as social theory. The biggest insight I gained was learning how to read literature, pop culture, and 'regular' writing as social theory."

                "The course material was interesting, class discussions were well-facilitated, and the reading load was very reasonable each class (allowing us to really discuss it in depth). I wish there was maybe more of a common thread between the theorists we read instead of focusing on essentially one theorist for each class.",
                "Most readings were great, and so was the discussion in class. Both Phillip and Eric know how to conduct a healthy seminar discussion.",
                "Loved how we would discuss the theorys application to our own lives - it made it feel relevant and important for me to read these texts. We got no feedback on papers though, which hindered ability to improve as writers in this course",
                "First, a 9am discussion-based seminar is always going to be a challenge. Second, given that we spent a great deal of time talking about race and gender in the course, it felt pretty weird to have a white man professor, a white man TF, and mostly white people on the syllabus. I understand that sociology is a homogenous field, but with contemporary texts in particular, I think we could have encountered more diverse perspectives. For example, I thought the incorporation of J. K. Rowling (her writing on gender, not her novels) and Brubaker was fairly unproductive, and I would have liked to read more intersectional perspectives on the relationships between race, gender, and the body. As a result of the syllabus, some of the class discussions felt white-washed and detached. \r\n\r\nI did appreciate the individual feedback I got from both Prof. Gorski and Eric. At times, our class discussion was very insightful and interesting.",
                "I would prefer to have more assignments of lesser worth.",
                "I really liked the lengths of the readings. Having them MNR shorter made it so everyone in the class had read the same material which made conversations better",
                "Strengths of the course are that we discuss only one work per class, which gives us the opportunity to really break it apart and connect it to other works we've read. We also read a really good range of theorists and broke past the foundational white man theorist, which I really appreciated. One weakness of the class is that we only ever spent class time discussing, and it would have been more engaging to do discussion activities that were more creative like agree\/disagree prompts, four corners, etc. Another weakness is that the feedback I received on my essays were very limited and I did not find them helpful."

                "I would absolutely not recommend this course. I feel like I learned almost nothing, and the assignments were very difficult due to unclear instructions and unfair standards. The course is not well organized at all, and it constantly made me consider dropping my sociology major. Class time was not engaging at all, which is probably why many student frequently skipped class despite this being a seminar with mandatory attendance for a participation grade. Overall, I think this course should be completely overhauled. I enjoyed Modern Social Theory last semester, so making this course more like that format could be helpful. Unless this is required for your major, steer clear. Professor Gorski is very nice and definitely cares about his students, but something about this course just did not click.",
                "If they're interested in social theory, yes.",
                "Great writing credit. Not a gut by any means, but you definitely learn a lot (coming from a CS major). Its worth the extra hassle of not taking a gut writing.",
                "Yes",
                "Overall, I would not recommend this course to another student who does not need to take it for their major, unless the syllabus seems really interesting to you. Writing synthetic papers about three to four theorists can be challenging when you enjoyed reading fewer than those, so definitely evaluate your interest in this course specifically (not social theory in general) before enrolling.",
                "I would not. It is really boring unless you like the concept of considering sociology as a field instead of always diving into it. The grading is harsh. There are a few good readings but most are not. Additionally, the class is American and White centric even when the material is not.",
                "Unless you are fulfilling a requirement, no I would not recommend it. This course is dry and poorly organized, and it is not accessible to students who are not already interested in social theory.",
                "This is a required course for the Sociology major, so there isnt much of a choice in the matter. I dont think someone should take this course unless its required or they really like theory.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! Though it is required for sociology majors, I would recommend this class to anyone interested in sociology. I would also recommend it to people interested in WGSS\/ERM\/Afam and other similar majors, but I would make sure to note that this is a social THEORY class, and they may feel frustrated by how lofty it can be."
