                "I improved my ability to look.  Reading and thinking about fossils and the creatures they came from was a wonderful way to spend my final semester.  I gained an appreciation for scale and our planetary existence.  It helped me not worry.",
                "Lateral thinking and forming hypothesis. I think this class developed my creativity most of all. For a lot of the challenges in this class we had to use very little details to make guesses about what we were looking at.",

                "Strengths were that the specimens were really interesting! It made the lecture course so much easier (and more enjoyable) to be able to see the fossils and how they exemplify whatever concepts we had in lecture that week. The TFs and professors were also a huge strength; they were usually really helpful when we got stuck. The collaborative aspect of this class was also great! Weaknesses were that the labs, questions, and instructions could be really confusing, especially in the first half of the class.",
                "The course is nearly perfect. You learn so much in a welcoming environment, and Dr. Hull and Dr. Briggs are exceptional. The one weakness is that the labs assume more knowledge than could possibly be expected from the students. Some kind of pre-lab reading or lecture might help to clarify many of the confusing concepts we encounter in lab.",
                "I think it is organized well for what it is.  The first few labs are a bit stressful, but you settle in well I think.",
                "I wish this class had its own independent readings from the lecture. There were a lot of things we had to learn on the fly that it would have been nice to have some more explicit preparation in. For example if we had even had like a page of notes or little YouTube video on things like corals and echinoids I think the labs would have been much less stressful. Briggs would never give feedback on what he was counting off for but Hull was a very clear grader. This class SERIOUSLY reinforced the lectures. If you want an A in lecture take the lab.",
                "Really really cool to be able to have access to so many of the Peabody's amazing specimen. But the questions asked in lab are often very hard to get without instructor help."

                "I would especially recommend this course to a student who is taking the lecture. If you are someone taking 125 as a science gut or you are an environmental studies major take the lab too and just credit\/D it if you must. Especially on the midterm, this class was like an extra three hours of lecture study.",
