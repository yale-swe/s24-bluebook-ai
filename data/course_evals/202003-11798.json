                "This course provided a lot of perspective about how institutions can create and perpetuate inequality through the various different actors that constitute \"the state,\" and how institutional inequalities really impact marginalized populations and their everyday lives. This course gave me the chance to learn about how people are impacted by inequality, far beyond any other course I've taken that approaches inequality in either a purely theoretical approach or in a sanitized, strictly academic way that only recognizes the existence of inequality. I really felt like I learned how to understand state institutions and the actions they take or neglect to take that cause harm and trauma. I learned many analytical tools and concepts that can be applied to institutions in order to understand just how they are involved in the inequality that we see throughout different aspects of society. I thought it was really great how we covered many types of inequality, and we learned and discussed how inequality can be embodied, perpetuated, and resisted. I think the emphasis in the final unit about resisting inequality was so important because it allowed me to really think about what I personally could do to combat institutionalized inequality. My writing skills also improved over the course of the semester, and I really learned how to write about and analyze institutional inequality in a deep and accessible way that also allows the stories of those impacted the most shine through that analysis.",
                "I learned how to approach and analyze the ways institutions in the United States enact inequality. I learned how to read and analyze ethnographies, as well as how to write my own mini auto ethnography. I feel like I gained so many reading and writing skills as well as a larger understanding of inequality and oppression in its many forms in America.",
                "I learnt institutional analysis (which very few classes at Yale have taught me), how to respectfully and effectively wield ethnographic evidence and theoretical concepts, structures of oppression in the US, effective writing, and a lot about complex experiences of marginalisation in the country.",
                "I gained a greater perspective on what it means to be living an unequal life. Many of the readings opened my eyes to experiences I was hardly aware of, such as the burden of having to work to receive welfare while caring for a child."

                "This course was excellent in so many ways. I learned so much about institutionalized inequality and how institutions and their various actors work to create and perpetuate inequality in America. We read so many wonderful texts over the course of the semester, and they really fit with one another. By the end of the course, we were using concepts we learned in the first few texts to analyze and elaborate on the concepts presented in the last few texts. The curriculum was structured in a way that both built up and broke down the complexities of state institutions and the inequality that arises from those institutions, and I really feel like I'm leaving the course with a significantly deeper understanding of how inequalities are institutionalized and how they impact people, which is the most important facet of inequality in my opinion. This course was so different from any other academic setting that deals with inequality, because it embraces ethnographic work and personal stories from those most impacted by institutionalized inequality, as opposed to using very sterilized and disconnected language to run away from the pain, fear, and trauma that's inflicted by inequality. I saw the manifestation of inequality through these texts in a way that I had never been exposed to, and because of that I learned so much about what inequality really looks like in society. I honestly can't say enough positive things about this course!\r\nI can't really think of any weaknesses of the course, other than the fact that it had to happen over Zoom, which sometimes meant the last 20-ish minutes were more silent because everyone was tired.",
                "Strengths: Professor Dudley and TF Kate were AMAZING - they were so knowledgeable and created a very open space for learning every week. We had really intense and deep discussions and the readings were so powerful and stuck with me throughout the whole semester. I received the most feedback on every paper I wrote in this course than any other course I've taken at Yale and I felt like my writing improved dramatically throughout the semester. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I wished we could've done more breakout rooms or had a 5 min break in the middle of the seminar.",
                "Strength:\r\nThe three writing workshops really improved my essay writing and my approach.\r\nThe modules were very well organised to cover really broad aspects of inequality with precision.\r\nThe choice of texts covered a lot of genres and ethnographic approaches. They were excellent !\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\nMore discussion of problematic nature of ethnography ? Perhaps a dive into the ethics of the form ?",
                "Strengths:\r\n1. Professor Dudley and Kate (the TA) both care so much about each one of us as students and people, and I appreciated that so much. Being able to be honest with them about where I'm at in terms of stress, mental health, and understanding made me feel safe, accepted, and appreciated.\r\n2. The books all connected with each other very well, and discussions often highlighted those connections in a way that helped me remember the important ideas.\r\n3. The content of the course is so so important, especially now\r\n4. I really enjoyed writing the papers. I suppose that's because I went into the course wanting to get a better sense of how I can be a better person in general (and knew that if I didn't get the grades, I'd just Cr\/D the course), so I wrote each paper with the intention of reflecting on my own life. I wrote with a lot of first-person and a level of honesty I don't think I could have in any other course. And I was actually encouraged to write personally in my essays. I felt like I could write each essay with an eye on just trying my best to write out my thoughts, instead of focusing on what's \"right\" or \"should be done\". \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. I'd say the workload is a lot, but you don't need to read the entire book every week--read what interests you and what you can get through. If you're having a rough week, it's okay if you only read 1 chapter or just the first few summary pages.",
                "Weakness: political bias. Experiences will vary widely in this class as a result. This way of doing anthropology neglects individual agency, trying to understand human phenomena from structures alone. As a result, it has a pretty progressive bias in terms of what is open for debate because American conservatives\/liberals place more importance on the individual while progressives do not. What I often wanted to discuss was called \"psychology.\" \r\n\r\nWeakness: not enough discussion of methods. Anthropology is a relatively recent field and lacks the empirical generalizability of other fields. As such, the concepts argued are just less valid. Doing an ethnography from a particular point of view may find something powerful here and there, but it also may not be generalizable. There was pretty much no discussion in class how one experience may not relate to another, how one concept is confined to a particular experience.\r\n\r\nWeakness: not enough substance. The class would go on and on with little substance being discussed. We would run out of things to \"feel\" out loud about and would be directed to theorize how to change the system. This was a theme of the course, but we never argued why inequalities exist as they are. It was assumed they are wrong. This goes back to the political bias. \r\n\r\nWeakness: not enough analytical rigor and overemphasis on feelings. I would want to engage with a concept I found somewhat flimsy. Hypotheticals, philosophical exercises, are not valued to hit a concept from different angles. Somehow this was not okay while others would consistently just voice how they agreed with the author and empathized with the experience documented. I just wish I knew this up front. \r\n\r\nWeakness: intellectual vagueness. The phrase \"analytical concept\" was thrown around so much in this class I found myself having to analyze what it actually meant. When asked, the professor answered in highfalutin poetry. Literary, yes. Helpful, no.\r\n\r\nWeakness: misleading expectations. We were encouraged to write with freedom of expression, but then graded according to a formulaic way of argument. \r\n\r\nStrength: selected readings were great. Both Hands Tied, Life Beside Itself, Exit Zero, Land of the Open Graves were terrific ethnographies."

I wasn't in tune with social justice to the extent that I felt I needed to be and hoped that this course could propel on a level of self-reflection that I don't think I could have done by myself. I walked away with a better sense of how inequality is embodied, how inequality is perpetuated, and how inequality can be resisted. Each essay focused on each of those key concepts--with the first essay as a personal essay about your own life, the second one analyzing how inequality persists, and the third on how we can build a healing future. I feel like I walked away from the course with a better understanding about how institutions perpetuate inequality and how I experience\/react to inequality, but more importantly, I walked away with a set of questions, thoughts, and ideas that can help me think about my own experiences with inequality, empathize with other people's experiences with inequality, and learn ways that I can ultimately be a better person.",
