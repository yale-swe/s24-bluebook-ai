This class is so challenging grading-wise that I spent a lot more time with the essays and therefore with the content, so I think I came away from the course with an extraordinarily good grasp of utilitarianism, Kantianism, and contractarianism that is further than most intro courses in philosophy.",

Professor Kagan is brilliant -- his lectures truly opened up my world to an entirely different way of thinking. I felt like I was hanging onto his every word. This class was an excellent introduction not only to Hume, Kant, Locke and Mills, but also to philosophy more broadly. There was a strong emphasis on how to construct a cohesive, compelling and logically coherent philosophical argument. This skill is super important, particularly when it comes to big meaningful questions like the ones often tackled in this class. That being said, it's important to note that this class is very competitive. There is lots of discussion around grades and the grading curve which I felt added to the stress of the class at times.",

It's definitely not as bad as everyone hypes it up to be though there's probably just a very specific percentage of students in this class who despair over the grading of this course because they harbor pre-law dreams. I'm one of those students, but I think after I come to terms with that, the course becomes exceedingly enjoyable. Lectures are interesting, the essays are not bad at all, and this class has made me think a lot about the things I value.",

You get an introduction to the formations of a moral theory and you begin to dip your toes into the vast pool of theories which are out there.

I learned about many different perspectives in philosophy and the papers presented me with an opportunity to examine and evaluate the arguments presented in class more intimately.  I feel that the content covered in the class provided a great overview of viewpoints in ethical philosophy.  The course also presented me with the opportunity to develop key skills.

                "Strengths: It gives you a very solid understanding of ethical thought.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We spend a little too much time on Mill and Util, when we should spend much more time on Hume, (free will) and contractarianism",
                "The course is great as it is. I think the only weakness is that the fact that the grading is harsh adds some pressure and then the fact that sections are graded very strictly make the environment a little weird and boastful and unnatural. However, this is an incredible course and only at Yale and with prof kagan you can have this opportunity to learn to think and philosophize this way.",
                "This course was very good. It could be improved by being more clear what specific readings are assigned and how to get them (such as pdfs online for instance).",
                "Good at facilitating discussion, lectures were a struggle because there were no\/few visual aids",
                "Strengths: Not too much reading, Shelly's lecturers are fun and interesting. Good comments\/advice on papers to help you improve. Weaknesses: Overall, I think my weaknesses with the class pertained that I was lost at times but was too focused on other classes to make time to get help. There were also times where the hypotheticals were uninteresting to me but I think that's more on my interest in philosophy.",
                "Sometimes the lectures feel very boring, and the constant addition of vocabulary words that don't end up getting used is confusing. But this class opened my mind on things I previously thought were common sense.",
                "Learned a decent bit, but feel like there are too few writing assignments.",
                "The lectures were very interesting, but they could be a little unclear at times, and the readings and lectures weren't very aligned. We were often 2 weeks ahead of the readings, which made it more difficult to learn the material. Also, the readings weren't often discussed in section, so it really didn't make much sense to do the readings. Finally, the grading is extremely strict, so be ready to put a lot of effort into essays if you want to get a decent grade.",
                "make the lectures more engaging and interactive",
                "Strengths: First unit, on utilitarianism, developed from simple to complex ideas straightforwardly, serving as a good introduction to the course format. Second unit, on Kantianism, was especially well taught, with key ideas and their consequences clearly explained in lecture and further explored in discussion section.\r\n Weakness: Last unit, on contractarianism, was not always clear; lectures did not cover consequences of contractarian claims (especially Kantian contractarian claims) in sufficient detail.",
                "This course is a \"Yale classic\" but honestly did not live up to the hype. I didn't learn anything particularly insightful, and it feels like you're being dragged through a zoo of morality instead of actually digesting philosophy.",
                "There's little connectivity between the lectures and what's said in sections.",
                "The class is hard. I was stressed about every discussion section being graded (and other people in my section were stressed as well, which made each discussion section kind of... tense). Writing philosophy is difficult, and I feel like there should be more feedback. For example, I got a B on my first essay and the TF didn't give me too many reasons why it was a B, and how I could improve it. Also, I wish we could have focused a bit less on Kantianism and Utilitarianism and spent more time on contractarianism and determinism.",
                "Strengths: Lectures were great. Shelly does a great job of explaining concepts and tying them to each other, as well as to logic that is somewhat easy to follow. I think there were times where I felt like the course had strayed from a logical path, but then again, I'm not sure I understand philosophy enough to tell them to reorganize the order of the material.\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion sections were usually interesting, but because they were graded, there were days when everyone would chime in just to chime in and one-up someone else. Sometimes there was a little bit of disconnect between what Shelly was teaching, what our TF said, and what was in the readings, so I wonder if there could have been more coordination and ways to present topics more easily. Feedback and class discussions would sometimes leave me much more confused than I was.",
                "Strengths: Shelly is AMAZING Weaknesses: the stuff he teaches lol",

                "I thought it doesnt really cover that much beyond Kantianism and utilitarianism. You learn a lot about those but that takes up almost the whole course and it always felt very theoretical.",
                "Strengths: SHELLY KAGAN. He is absolutely phenomenal. He has so much energy during every single lecture, and he is incredibly funny and entertaining while he teaches the concepts. Everyone at Yale should take at least one class with Shelly Kagan! The class itself is also very interesting if you are interested at all in ethics, and the discussion sections are very productive and useful\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were sometimes repetitive and could have moved a bit faster, papers and section participation are graded rather harshly",
                "I dont feel like I really learnt how to write a philosophy paper from my TF. She was very nice, but I did not feel like she really made me understand how I was supposed to improve my writing. Her comments on my essays were very minimal in comparison with other classes Ive been in.",

                "Very good and engaging overall, but section grading should be more lenient",
                "really enjoyed the course! TA was great and was fundamental to my learning in the course.",
                "Strengths: Prof Kagan is an incredible lecturer. Really engaging and fun to listen to. poses cool moral questions. Weaknesses: readings were hard to understand\/ section didn't clarify the readings very much",
                "I really wish there was some way to follow the lecture, as it was, we were just listening to what felt like a stream of consciousness. Slides would have been nice",
                "Strength: You only have three papers and they're pretty evenly spread out across the semester so it's not a heavy assignment based class. Weakness: I'd say the way the discussion section works needs to be fixed and a greater measure of facilitation has to be taken on by the TA because since it is graded people will literally talk for minutes on minutes and there is often no opportunity for everyone to speak (if they want to). Also, sometimes the discussion itself felt redundant with people just filling in space likely for the sake of it being graded.",
                "the lectures are really really interesting and although they seem loosly structured they are super productive and tell a really good, cohesive story",
                "My TF was great and she often filled in my \"blanks\" from lecture. And of course, Shelly is an excellent teacher. I enjoyed every second of class.",
                "This course's content is not particular difficult, yet grading is unnecessarily hard. Discussion sections are strength of the course. Lectures were generally pretty engaging.",
                "Strengths: Shelly is an amazing professor and does a great job breaking down introductory ethical theories; Weaknesses: Teaching Assistant's often expect far more philosophical insight out of students than what Shelly teaches in lecture, and it makes section participation and essay writing extremely difficult. A suggestion is to provide clear, written communication as to participation and essay standards through a written rubric that will set expectations that students can reach towards.",
                "I loved the content and found the content very engaging. The only thing I'd change is that at times I thought the course was moving too slowly, particularly during Kantianism.",
                "Strengths: Shelly Kagan is of course a fantastic lecturer. Course was well structured and readings were a good length, not too long but not short.\r\nWeaknesses: As with Kagan grading is very strict so expect rigorous grading but they are also very fair. He rewards improvement.",
                "Strengths -- Professor Kagan's teaching, the chosen texts, the TFs and their ability to lead thoughtful discussions\r\nWeaknesses -- The lack of recording for lectures, the emphasis on grades and the grade distribution",
                "the strength is that because the readings are somewhat complicated, they are limited in scope. A weakness might be that the readings could have been more relevant to the lectures.",
                "Strengths - this class teaches you how to write an effective ethics paper, and I feel like my writing has improved a lot as a result of this.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Lectures around the middle of the semester can sometimes feel skippable, since everything we talk about in sections just clarifies and reiterates the important takeaways of lecture. Also, the readings can sometimes be very dense, and not the most enjoyable thing to read.",
                "Strengths: Shelly is a fantastic and entertaining lecturer. Took this class after his other class on Life and it was just as engaging\r\nWeaknesses: Overly harsh grading, sections are hit or miss depending on your leader",
                "The class was very engaging, and I appreciated the way the TFs were very available to discuss all course-related themes.",
                "Grading system is too harsh. Receive grades like B+ and then all the feedback says is well done, you did really good. This is not helpful feedback to improve. \r\n\r\nAlso, the idea of not giving students model essays is problematic. It is understandable that the professors dont want to give students the wrong ideas because the students might deduce the wrong things about what makes the essays good, but there are many ways to avoid this. E.g. show students marked essays that get As, with feedback about what made them A grade essays. Once you get a B+ in this class, I was told that I did not need to improve my structure and so it was hard to aim for certain improvements while not knowing what good work really looks like.",
                "The Professor was great, the readings were very helpful and the sections were also really helpful. The weakness of this course is that many times I felt like I was being graded rather than taught. The grade and the performance mattered more in this course rather than the process of learning. We were really never taught how to write a philosophy paper, we were just very harshly graded on it. Sections were helpful because during them, some core philosophy concepts were clarified but they were not enjoyable at all as we felt like we were assessed for whatever we said. If the section format was to be changed to a nicer and kinder learning environment, this would really benefit the image of the whole course. Also it would really improve the course if there was both a first and a final draft of our papers. In this way we could get comments from our TF and improve our grades but also actually learn how to write a philosophy paper.",
                "Shellys lectures get a bit repetitive and are taught at a very intro level, but the grading is done at an advanced level. Section was great though.",
                "Good TAs, but extremely tough grading with little reasoning given to how that grade was determined, little feedback or feedback would be given so late that it wouldnt help the next paper, little to know feedback on how to improve grade",
                "strengths: well-taught; lectures were compelling, discussion sections were fun, readings were engaging and very reasonable. I did every reading for this class--not something I can say for many other courses\r\nweaknesses: expectations for essays can be a little fuzzy, lectures can be a little confusing for difficult concepts",
                "Strengths: engaging lecturers, well-organized lectures, reasonable workload\r\nWeaknesses: Shelly tells the students that we probably will not do very well in the class, so many people credit\/D\/fail the class and arent engaged in the class as a result. There arent many resources made known to students for help on papers (e.g, the writing center).",
                "The course leaves one to fend for themselves in many instances, especially with the specific style of writing that is expected in the class.",
                "Strengths: I liked how we would learn about ideas in lecture and discuss them in section. I also like how. The content also really interested me\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the course spent too much time on Utilitarianism which was the easiest system to grasp and not enough time on the more complicated topics later on like Kantianism and Contractarianism.",
                "The sound quality of the lecture recordings are quite poor.",
                "The organization of discussion sections could be improved because it forced participation. Additionally the papers were graded in such a way that very few people felt good about their progress.",
                "I think that this course spent too much time on the first unit, spending too much time discussing utilitarianism and not enough time on the rest of the moral theories. I think that we could have spent more time discussing how each theory related to each other.",
                "The lectures were interesting but I thought discussion sections could have had a better structure. Grading was very tough, and I really suggest Cr\/D\/F the course so that you can focus on learning about ethics, and not stressing too much about your grade.",
                "Strenghts: Shelly Kagan is an animated professor that made going to lecture a pleasure (a great way to start my week). My TA always offered out-of-class meetings to discuss what we wanted to write for our papers, which helped me redirect my initial thoughts into a more coherent paper.\r\nWeaknesses: the lecture content did not match up with the assigned readings. My TA also took a very long time to grade papers. For instance, I received the feedback for my second paper the day before the last paper was due.",
                "Strengths of this course are the great dialogues we had in section. The weakness of this course are they dealt only with Western philosophers and the syllabus lacked philosophical diversity.",
                "I think that there could definitely be more feedback given on papers and more advice throughout the process.",
                "The course itself could be improved by incorporating easier pathways through which the participation grade could be earned, given that it is 25% of the final grade and the section is only 50 minutes long, which often results in having to struggle to get a word in when there's people who sort of dominate the conversation within the discussion section.",
                "I think a strength is that Shelly is a very engaging professor whos clearly an expert in the field and the topics covered are quite interesting if thats what you want to learn about! Obviously the grading is harsher than most humanities classes, but Professor Kagan is quite up front about that in the beginning, so do with it what you will. I only wish that participation in section wasnt weighed as heavily because I think it makes section feel more like a competition for who can say the most as opposed to a genuine discussion.",
                "The material and lectures are very engaging, but the grading is WAY too harsh. Maybe if the grading was a bit better, it would cause less students to CREDIT the class and thus make students more likely to put in more effort.",
                "This course was a great introduction to the basic schools of thought in western philosophy!  It may be improved by spending slightly less time on Kant, but that is a fairly minor note.  There were times where the lectures didn't match up with the readings so it sometimes made the professor seem disconnected from the discussion section.  This was not an overwhelming obstacle, but sometimes took some reorienting as I tried to remember the reading and process what we had just learned in class.",
                "Guidance-based, much space for self-directed learning on the assignments. Discussion section is inspiring in access to peer perspectives and strengthen impromptu thinking & clear vocalizing of philosophical ideas.",
                "The primary strength of this course was the discussion section feature.  My discussion section was lively, educational, and interesting.  While we did discuss and debate ethical theory in section, we were also provided with instruction and a breaking down of concepts by the TF.  The TF was amazing at helping students understand complex ethical theory in this instruction.\r\n\r\nProfessor Kagan's lectures were also a strength of the course.  He is incredibly engaging and is an iconic professor at Yale for a reason.  This is the second course of his I have taken and I will forever continue to take his courses.  His lectures are relatable, theatrical, and very educational- he utilizes these tools during his instruction to present multiple perspectives and examples that help to break down the philosophy that we learned.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I think the only weakness in the course is the grading.  Professor Kagan has very high standards for grading, even though this is an introductory course.  I feel that the scarcity of As and Bs given in the class is a little bit of a weakness, but I also found it motivational to always turn in my best work and seek help in office hours when necessary.  I think his high standards for students is in good faith because he wants us to improve.",

                "No. I would not recommend this class to anyone unless it is required for your major.",

                "If it is a prerequisite, then you already have to take it, but it is not too bad. If you are interested in ethics, and go into it looking forward to learning, then it should be a good fit as well. If not, you can always Credit\/D\/Fail it.",
                "ABOSLUTELY YES. once in a lifetime opportunity. \r\nIt's just an incredible opportunity that you won't get any other way to learn to philosophize and think in such an articulated and stimulating way. I really think this was the best course I've taken in my year at Yale and I feel deeply enriched by it. \r\n\r\nEven if you are worried about the harsh grading, please just take it and maybe credit d if you are really worried but don't make this stand in the way of you taking this incredible course! \r\n\r\nalso, the workload is very much NOT high. other than when u have a paper due, which is only 3 times per semester, you only need to read a few pages and go to class. It's intense thinking when you are in section or working on the paper but so exciting and worth it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student with the caveat that it requires a form of thinking that not everyone enjoys. I found the course specifically worthwhile because my professor and TA encouraged me to offer my critiques openly, even when they were wrong or simply poorly thought out.",
                "Not unless you have previous experience in philosophy, since it is geared toward those who have familiarity with philosophy from previous courses in college\/high school",
                "Yes if you're okay with CR\/pass or getting a B if you've never taken a philosophy class before. Or, if you're excited to go to a lot of office hours to improve your paper. Overall, Yale seemed to me like a place to take a philosophy class, I don't think I'll be taking more but I'm glad I took it.",
                "For NON philosophy majors, I think this course is good for anyone who wants to take a class on Cr\/D\/Fail (so during first year). It is a great lenses into philosophy and is not too hard to pick up on. Depending on the discussion section leader, this class may or may not be more enjoyable.",
                "Yes. It's a pretty chill class. Grading starts off hard though",
                "Yes, because the content is quite interesting, but be ready for tough grading.",
                "not really, it was very boring. the lectures moved slowly and were very repetitive. the section was the only part that was decent.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in engaging with abstract questions in a more rigorous way than usual.",
                "No. Sorry, but it's really not worth your time. The grading process is shrouded in mystery, the section discussions are wheezingly dry, and most people are there just to get their EP&E prereqs done. If you want an iconic Yale experience, pick a more interesting class. And if you want to really learn philosophy, pick a harder class.",
                "Perhaps. It's necessary for majors but the grading and overall experience isn't very conducive to actual learning with the knowledge that if done correctly you'll get the grade you deserve.",
                "Buckle up. It's Shelly Kagan - no further explanation.",
                "Yes. It's a good class to take with Shelly, a decent introduction to the field, and was interesting even if I didn't invest super fully in it.",
                "Yes! Philosophy is stupid but everyone should take this class.",
                "If you have an interest in philosophydefinitely. If not, do not recommend.",
                "Maybe. Only if they actually are gonna want to learn and engage with philosophy.",
                "100% absolutely!!!! Every student at Yale should take a class with Shelly Kagan. He is genuinely the best lecturer I have ever had and is one of my all-time favorite professors. He is engaging throughout every second of class and provides hilariously memorable examples to help you learn the concepts and theories. Going to class was about so much more than just learning; it was also 50 minutes of entertainment and having the privilege to admire Shelly's incredible work and hang onto his every word. He is absolutely brilliant! Although some of the concepts can be difficult and the class is graded harshly, it is absolutely worth it to take it because ethics is very interesting, and I found that I learned a lot in this class that I will think about in my everyday life going forward. The discussion sections for this class are insanely helpful and productive and were something I was excited about each week.",
                "I would because I think Shelly is an amazing instructor who really dedicates a lot of time and effort to his students. He always made time for me when I reached out to him and I really appreciated that",
                "Not really. If you already have experience with ethics, I feel like this course is a bit redundant.",
                "The course deals with a lot of interesting philosophical questions about ethics and morality. Though not always the most engaging of classes especially when discussing really confusing concepts like Kant.",
                "Yes! I think as long as they can live with a non-A grade this course will be suite beneficial",
                "yes, take it! It was a great experience and made me want to major in philosophy.",
                "Yes, if theyre genuinely interested in philosophy.",
                "Yes",
                "Class is interesting but difficult",
                "Not really unless its required for your major, the grading is very harsh and I didnt feel like I learned that much. Crash course philosophy",
                "I'm not sure that I would. As someone who had not taken any philosophy whatsoever previous to taking this class, I found the course to be a very accessible but simultaneously inaccessible introduction to philosophy. On the surface, it was like you knew what certain theories were because you took notes from the lecture but when it came to actually writing the papers, the theory would not really be as clear as to when you were in the lecture. It was hard to apply in what seemed to be futile moral examples where either moral theory you chose to advocate for had significant flaws that felt like invalidated their practical application to real life. But then again, I guess that's what philosophy is. As you've probably already read grading IS tough, but at least they let you rewrite the first paper. I'd say if you're in the EPE track and HAVE to take this course, really be intentional with it and pay attention from the first day or you'll likely get lost. The professor is a nice person and has a lot of knowledge but I often found myself not understanding a lot of concepts even after explanations. If you do decide to take this course, make sure to make time for office hours within your schedule because you'll likely need them.",
                "yes definitely even if you're not super interested in philosophy it's just really cool to listen to the lectures, and section is always interesting",
                "Yes! Its a blast, you get a feel for the grey, and your writing will improve.",
                "If you don't need it for your major I advise you to take it Credit\/D\/Fail. If you are looking for an introduction to ethics or philosophy, then this is a good course. I had read Kant and Mill before this class and was only taking it for my major and thus found it quite disengaging.",
                "No. Unless you're a philosophy student who has a great grasp of these concepts already, it is very difficult to meet Shelly and the TA's expectations and earn a good grade. The students who are at an intro philosophy level going in, participate well, and genuinely learn will likely all get B's. I definitely feel as if I learned what I was supposed to learn in this class, but I don't think the grade distribution reflects this in the slightest.",
                "I definitely would recommend this course to every student, because it teaches you the basics of ethics that any person should know, it teaches you how to think, and it teaches you how to write.",
                "Good if you need a credit\/D",
                "Absolutely, this course helps you structure how you think about things and helps you build airtight arguments. Gets you to think about other arguments and break down their arguments.",
                "YESYESYESYESYES. Take this class if you have any interest in being an informed, thoughtful participant in the world. This class taught me how to make a compelling and logically sound argument!! Cannot emphasize enough how fascinating the material is and how powerful the skills learned are.",
                "I think this course is interesting to a student interested in philosophy, otherwise, they probably won't like it.",
                "This course is a requirement for many majors, but even if it wasn't, I would say that this is an incredibly interesting class to take if ethics is something that you've wanted to know more about. There aren't a lot of readings, but all of the assigned readings are very dense. I often found myself prioritizing paying attention in lecture and skipping certain readings, and I thought the system worked pretty well.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to get into philosophy. Shelly does a great job of taking you through the various moral frameworks and the logic behind their arguments. Instead of regurgitating the facts, he primes the ideas with succinct and thought-provoking examples. Definitely take the class Credit\/D to alleviate some stress though, because the 3 papers are graded pretty harshly.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone looking to improve their logical, ethical decision-making.",
                "Take it if you have to for a requirement, or if you are interested in ethics but take it credit\/fail.",
                "Yes, but credit D it.",
                "Yes because the content is very interesting but not if they want to improve writing or struggle with writing\/ reasoning with is a shame",
                "yes, for sure! Grading is a little harsh, but not impossible to do reasonably well. Concepts are interesting, and my TA was great.",
                "I would recommend the course because the lectures are engaging and it is an important topic.",
                "I would cautiously recommend this course. It may be a struggle if you don't have experience in philosophy or ethics, but it is a good way to introduce you to a new way of approaching problems.",
                "Yes I would because it helps develop critical thinking skills and students may even come out of the course with a new found sense of morality.",
                "Its a good intro philosophy class. You have to take it if you have want to do EP&E. However, the grading is very harsh (but an A is not impossible). I got an A for my first paper by following Shellys writing guide, despite not having written any philosophy paper before. However, keeping up with the content and going to every single lecture is very important. I didnt manage to do that and I got worse grades in the end. With that being said, feel free to take the class credit\/D\/fail. It will be an intellectually stimulating class without the pressure!",
                "It is hard to enjoy a class when you put in so much effort and only come away with mediocre results. It is an interesting class, but that is something to keep in mind.",
                "Yes I would, professor Shelly is an amazing lecturer and the TA's are very understanding as well as try their best to explain lingering questions during discussion sections.",
                "I would totally recommend this course. Shelly Kagan is a great lecturer, and I found all the material interesting.",
                "Yes. I think it was a great introduction to various philosophical frameworks and both my TA and Professor Kagan were willing to meet outside of class to discuss my thoughts on upcoming papers.",
                "I would recommend this course to people who want to think deeper about the world.",
                "I would suggest this course if you are interested in asking fundamental questions about morality.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another Yale student. Though you're bound to struggle in this course, it definitely is unique compared to other classes I've taken at Yale, and I would especially recommend it to students who find themselves enveloped into the STEM bubble at Yale, since this is bound to be an intellectual challenge that will teach you valuable skills about prioritizing different aspects of life when it comes to making a moral code.",
                "Yes! I wasnt originally planning to take the class and somewhat stumbled into it during add\/drop. Im so glad I did! I thought the material was super interesting and loved Professor Kagan as a lecturer. That said, if ethics isnt your thing you probably wont be interested in this class.",
                "I would if you CAN credit the class. You might not need to, but know that this might have to happen and that the course can become a bit stressful even though it is just three papers. If you can credit the course, then it is super interesting and worth it.",
                "Absolutely.  Shelly is an engaging instructor and the class offers the basics of ethics, so it is a must-take for anyone interested in the field.",
                "Worth taking to access a new, more efficient way of thinking\/reasoning for all disciplines.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, with the caveat that it is not for the faint of heart.  To do well in this course really requires students to apply themselves, be willing to grow, and to learn how to do philosophy.  As I had taken a course with Professor Kagan before, I felt well prepared.  I was already familiar with his style of instruction and what he expects from students: excellence and good argumentation.  However, students who have never taken a course with him before might be a little put off at first by the way he teaches and grades.  I would also warn students who have never written philosophy papers before that they should learn how to structure a philosophy paper before taking the class.  While there is a guide on how to do philosophy posted in Canvas, there is no other instruction on it offered in class or section.  This was something I struggled with when I took my first class with Professor Kagan, but I got over the learning curve and have done well since.  All that said, I would also tell another student that the course is incredibly educational and skill building.  If you want to be a better thinker, take this class.",
                "its required. kind of mid as an introduction to ethics.",
                "Only if you need to take it for EP&E. It's not rewarding and you're likely to C\/D\/F it because of the harsh grading"
