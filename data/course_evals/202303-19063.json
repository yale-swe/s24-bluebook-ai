                "I learned how to read papers outside of my field and think critically about the design of experiments. I was able to understand why certain techniques are used and which advances have been made in the last decades.",
                "I have learned how to read scientific articles in depth and how the authors developed their methods. I also learned how to read papers relating to any biochemical\/biophysical field, and not just a specific field. I also developed an understanding of why a certain method was used over others or flaws in the authors' reasoning. I also learned how to design an experiment and propose it based on prior research from the papers read in class.",
                "I had a love-hate relationship with this class. Through this course, I have gained a deeper understanding of older molecular biology techniques. My approach to reading scientific papers has also changed. I no longer accept the author's words at face value, but instead, I've learned to critically analyze the content. I now understand the importance of examining the steps taken by the researchers and questioning their reasoning. This course has taught me to identify potential gaps in research projects and to understand the controls and procedures commonly used in experiments. I've also gained insights into the troubleshooting methods used in the past, which has given me a greater appreciation for the evolution of scientific research methods. Moreover, I've developed my discussion skills which has not only improved my communication skills but also deepened my understanding of the subject matter."

                "Strengths: Discussion within the cohort prior to with the professors were, in my opinion, very effective and productive; variability between the professors allowed for different types of questions to be asked for different papers; food on Thursdays were instrumental\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class time was late in the day and for many people, including myself, my energy was depleted; lack of food on Tuesdays were a bummer (not a serious weakness).\r\n\r\nUltimately, I believe that having this course a little earlier in the day would help attention and productivity.\r\nAdditionally, food on Tuesdays would not hurt.\r\n\r\nPhenomenal course.",
                "I enjoyed the general format of this course, but feel like it could benefit from lowering the amount of papers to two per week so that we could adequately prepare and would get to dive deeper on each paper during class. I also think that incorporating some newer, more cutting-edge papers would be an exciting change!",
                "I think the set up of the course, with Tuesdays for students discussion and Thursday discussion with professors is very effective. I think one of the weaknesses of this course is that often one of the papers ends up glossed over and that there is a lack of focus on recent advances in science. The class could be improved by including more recent papers to help prepare students for experimental design and expectations in the current year.",
                "Going more in depth into why certain papers were accepted where they were, and how the professors teaching the class approach reading papers would have been a useful addition",
                "It was helpful to go through papers together and discuss. However, the content\/number of papers meant that each paper was read less thoroughly. It would have been helpful to have less papers but more in depth discussion.",
                "The assigned papers and questions we received in class were very good. Sometimes the amount of reading was overwhelming, and the course time conflicted with many extracurricular activities students wanted to participate in.",
                "Although the class had a large amount of reading required, the in class discussions and the readings really did help me to develop skills (such as learning to understand the motivation for the paper, how\/why the technique was used, and what the authors failed to answer) to understand most articles in biology. I also really enjoyed the end of semester presentation (chalk-talk)\/final paper where we had to come up with an original experiment based on one of the papers. I enjoyed seeing the thought process of everyone in the class when they were designing an experiment, and I learned about new techniques through their presentations. One weakness is that most of the articles were old (but of historical importance) and were not related to my field of interest. It would have been helpful if 1 of the articles per week were older\/historical due to a significant contribution in the field and the rest of the articles being relatively more modern, such as more articles post 2010. Also, since the class was in the evening from 5-8pm, I felt tired during that time and would prefer the class to be in the afternoon or morning.",
                "Strengths of the Course:\r\nThe course's primary strength lies in the complexity of the papers we studied. Additionally, as much as I disliked the final project, I think it was helpful and pushed me to think and ask questions outside of my comfort zone.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses of the Course:\r\nOne of the main issues was the volume of reading required. With three papers assigned each week, it was difficult to provide the in-depth analysis that the course demanded. While I managed to read all three papers in the early weeks, I struggled to grasp the finer details and participate actively in class discussions. As the semester progressed, I was able to increase my reading and comprehension speed, but the initial weeks were challenging, particularly while trying to balance my first rotation. I found on the weeks when we were only assigned 2 papers, I was able to fully engage in discussion\r\n\r\nThe course structure also posed some problems. In the beginning, we would read through the papers and clarify any confusion during Tuesday's session. However, as the semester progressed, this approach became less effective. The loosely structured nature of the class often left us feeling that we hadn't asked enough \"tough questions\" to fully understand the paper. The student-led discussion section was beneficial only when a handful of students had a better understanding of the source material or procedure. This often resulted in discussions being dominated by a few seasoned students. After each class, I would take notes and re-assess some of my weaknesses to prepare better for the next week. But by the 4th week, I was spending at least 5 hours per paper to prepare for class each week. However,  I also appreciated the feedback from some of the professors I reached out to asking for help. \r\n\r\nSuggestions for Improvement:\r\nTo improve the course, I suggest reducing the number of papers assigned each week. I found that when we were assigned only two papers, I was able to engage more fully in the discussion. Additionally, the course structure could be revised to ensure more effective discussions and a better understanding of the papers. Perhaps more guidance could be provided to ensure that all students are prepared to contribute to the discussions. Lastly, it would aid in class engagement if we moved the class time up by an hour or two."
