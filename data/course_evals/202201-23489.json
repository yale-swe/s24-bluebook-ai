We also explored some of the physics of time travel with our guest speakers and thought about what the experience would be like. The ideas I discussed in this course with my classmates and professor will stick with me long after I graduate.",

                "Time Machines is truly inter-disciplinary. In one course, I learned about the physics of time travel, Victorian daily life, military history, and narrative economics. Overall, the course is about different ways of representing the past: through video games, through artifacts, through books, through video, etc. Professor Gaddis' assignments are very creative -- e.g., write about how you'd prepare to go back in time for a day, and analyze a colorized historical video. I think I improved my knowledge of history and historiography, as well as my creative writing skills. I also got to read some great books and plays (Arcadia and How to Be A Victorian especially stood out). Take this course to learn from Prof. Gaddis' unique perspective on history and read a bunch of good books!",

                "Strengths: Professor Gaddis cares deeply about this, and he makes any class interesting. The other students are all very interesting people, and viewing the student presentations was a highlight of the course. Weaknesses: a little disorganized, class time could have been better spent at times, but this is an experimental course and it's the first time it has ever been taught. Very understandable.",
                "Strength: Gaddis has a thoughtful constructed syllabus and set of class speakers\r\n\r\nWeakness: Class was not engaging. Often, we would listen to Youtube videos for the entirety. \r\n\r\nImprovement: Facilitate more discussion among the class about the readings",
                "This course is the best I have ever taken. The content was intriguing, and Professor Gaddis was a great moderator for our discussions. Every guest speaker contributed something new and interesting to our evolving debates. I also enjoyed the flexibility of the class. I think there is little that can be done to improve it.",
                "This is an extremely flexible and conceptual course.  This year was it's first iteration, and I expect it to build on those two core concepts going forward.  There were a few scheduling issues that arose this year that came from asynchronous speakers and presentation times, but that comes with this class' experimental nature.  That should be smoothed out with time.",
                "This course is unlike anything I've ever taken before, in a good way.  Strengths: The reading list is eclectic, with plays, novels, and historical books about all sorts of different topics and historical eras  there's something for everyone, from military history buffs to playwrights. The guests range from physics professors to Economics Nobel laureates to digital humanists. Professor Gaddis is a font of knowledge and wisdom, and always supplies the class with fascinating insights. The course environment was very relaxed and enjoyable, with students from all over the university bringing different perspectives. I genuinely enjoyed being in this class, which met once a week for two hours. The assignments were a lot of fun and challenged me to write creatively about history. Key strengths would be Professor Gaddis himself, the guest lectures, the varied reading list, and enjoyable assignments. The only weakness I can think of is that this course might have been improved by being held in a room where students could all see each other -- i.e., if we all sat in a circle as opposed to in rows, so we could all get to know each other better.",
                "The course was really interesting and fostered a creative way to consider time through many different perspectives and themes. However, the course could use a little more structure, guidance, and organization.",

                "Yes.",
                "Of course. In Time Machines, students explore concepts of time and history through the lens of technology. This unique blend of topics is perfect for those who are looking for an interesting class and are willing to rethink our perception of reality.",
                "Definitely. The flexibility of the class combined with the variety of material was perfect, I actually got to do a personal project for my final and it was one of, if not the, most fulfilling journeys Ive embarked on at Yale. 10/10!!!",
                "Yes.  It changes how you view trends and the history that they shape.  It is transformational.  I wish I had words less cosmic to describe this, but that is the nature of time travel I suppose.",
                "Time Machines is a lot of fun! It is an \"experimental course,\" which meant it was a low-pressure way to explore a variety of topics related to the topics of time, history, and technology. As I understand it, the fundamental question of the course is, \"how can we use the resources of technology, as well as literature and the arts, artifacts, and historiography, to get a sense for what the past was like?\" The reading list was fantastic, as were Prof. Gaddis' insights, and the opportunity to choose our own final project topic. The course is truly interdisciplinary and I truly believe there's something for everyone in the syllabus. I feel like I genuinely learned about the past from the course, as well as a host of other topics from chimney sweeps in Victorian England to video games to the battle of the Somme. The course is more lecture-heavy than seminar-style, although there was time for student contributions, especially towards the end when we chose and discussed our final projects. Overall, I would recommend Time Machines as a low-stress way for any student to learn about the past, and explore a topic of personal interest within the fields of history and technology.",
                "This semester was a test-run of a new class so it might change in later semesters, but I found it to be a fairly interesting and low-workload course.",
                "Yes! Cool topic to learn more about.",
                "Yes. The Professor is one of the best in the world and the course is fascinating. Professor is very engaging"
