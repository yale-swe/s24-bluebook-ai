A bit of a heavy focus on the graphical representation and geometrical meaning of the concepts we learned (or at least heavier than I expected).",

There wasn't much discussion that occurred, and I didn't really get to know my classmates nor my instructor quite well. On the other hand, I do think the course is well structured to provide all students with any level of support they need to succeed. There were pretty good peer tutors and office hours were usually quite helpful.",
                "Weakness: It goes at a very fast speed and there should be more preparation for the True/False questions on the exam. The classes were boring and they should be smaller class sizes so we can get more one on one attention.\r\n\r\nStrengths: I liked the pre quizzes, the videos explaining the concepts, and how the p-sets were slightly more difficult so we can get help and be more prepared for the test.",
                "The pacing and structure of the course is good, though the problem sets can sometimes sneak up on you, especially those whose due dates are only about 4 days apart. My professor was very good at explaining the concepts in a way that was easy to understand, and the grading system (where different questions are graded by different people) seemed to work very well. The exams were a bit inconsistent in terms of difficulty compared to the practice material that was available, and the true-or-false sections were sometimes unreasonable in expecting students to know what the question writers had in mind.",
                "Well-structured, comprehensive learning materials. The videos posted were extremely helpful.",
                "Strengths: organized\r\nWeaknesses: fast pacing, heavy workload, the 3 exams have so much weight which is stressful",
                "Strengths: This course has no busy work. The assigned work was not overwhelming and felt very intentional: the homework videos and quizzes genuinely helped me understand the material better, and the combination of homework and lectures really made it possible to understand otherwise abstract/difficult concepts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class participation is not a built in part of this course, so the classes, while small, feel much more like lectures. While I found the course material to generally be quite interesting, classes could often feel long or difficult to get through, and classroom engagement often felt low.",
                "Strength: Ximera, online lectures, and practice tests were helpful \r\nWeakness: lecture went too fast and didnt explain things clearly enough, especially if you didnt entirely understand concepts from preclass work. So if you dont really put in the work to utilize the math resources you can end up very behind. Also class is not curved"

This course made me discard the possibility of majoring in math if I decide against my current majorwhich, I should say, is nevertheless important, so definitely take this course if you're wondering whether math is for you. But if you're a humanities major and don't mind letting single-variable calculus (or less) be the most advanced math you learn by the time you leave college, maybe take another course to fulfill the QR requirement; this can be a tough one.",
                "Yes. A solid foundation to multivariable calculus.",

This course is exactly what it sounds like; homework is not too difficult, exams are fair, and classes move at a decent pace. I thought that the vector calculus concepts were the most interesting part of the course, and the course overall greatly improved my ability to visualize problems in 3D. That said, this course would likely be a slog for anyone not interested in calculus.",
