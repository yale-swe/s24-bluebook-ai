                "Strengths: \r\n1) I'd say the workload for the class was pretty fair. The problem sets were pretty manageable. However, I'd recommend taking the extra time to go over the textbook problems since that will help solidify the concepts from lecture and psets.\r\n\r\n2) The oral final was also a strength. It does feel terrifying at first, but it's very lowkey. It will be rewarding if you take the time to go over your notes from lecture and psets.\r\n\r\n3) Billy as a TA. He is very accommodating and explained difficult concepts very well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n1) Overall just felt like an awkward balance between EE and Physics. The EE majors in the class were very lost during the physics section (griffiths) while the physics majors got lost during the EE section (pozar). Intro Physics is a prereq, but I think intro EE should also be listed as one.\r\n\r\n2) Juggling between three-four different course texts. We start out with Griffiths's E&M, and then briefly move to Purcell for circuits, and then Pozar for transmissions lines, before circling back to Griffiths for waves and Pozar for waveguides. It's cool to see concepts of E&M and its EE applications, but it felt like we were learning three different languages for the same topic because some of the math in Griffiths used different notation in Pozar. Rob also had his own mathematical formulations different from all textbooks which made things harder to follow. TAKE GOOD NOTES during his lectures and you won't be as lost. Also, I felt the pacing for the first half of the class with Griffiths was way too fast.",
                "The course was particularly strong in terms of conceptual understanding, and was strengthened by the use of demonstrations during class.",
                "The weakness of this course is the instructor. I got Covid and was dealing with personal/family issues and missed a chunk of the class, and he made me feel horrible and stupid because I didnt grasp the material as well as he hoped.",
                "Schoelkopf is a brilliant man with deep insight into the connections between each of the topics covered in the course. That said, he approaches the course more from that angle  that of making deep connections  and the engineering angle (I.e. deriving specific relations for lots of coefficients) than of building from the ground up axiomatically. This can make it quite hard to follow the lectures without knowing the basics already. Lectures could be improved by writing more on the board.",
                "Lectures were well-organized and taught effectively. It was helpful that no steps in analyses or derivations were skipped and everything was explained thoroughly. In-class demos were great fun and were also very helpful for internalizing content. Oral final exam was much less stressful and more fun than a traditional problem-based paper exam, and preparing for it was also easier as it was clear which concepts were important for the exam."

I feel like PHYS 430 may be a better substitute since follows Griffiths. During the transmission lines section, I'd suggest going to online resources on transmission line theory if Pozar isn't your thing.",
