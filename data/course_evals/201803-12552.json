   "comments": [
    "We learned about how the ideas of faith and doubt have played a role in Western classical music.",
    "Going into this course, I had little to know ability to understand and critically engage with Western Classical Music. Through the course, I was able to gain a baseline knowledge of the Western Cannon and develop a stronger musical ear. Now when I go to concerts, I will be able to appreciate the music on a deeper level.",
    "This course helped encourage me to more actively listen to music, and evaluate the impact of what I was hearing. It gave a good (selective) historical overview of the western canon, which helped situate all of the music we listened to in the appropriate context.",
    "This course covers the role of spirituality and religion in Western art music from the Baroque era to the early 21st century. We learned how to listen closely to pieces and analyze them for their musical content and deeper implications. We also read a variety of primary and secondary sources to supplement in class discussions."

   "comments": [
    "Strength: Henry is a gem of a professor and effectively facilitates discussion, and the breadth and depth of knowledge he gives us is astounding.",
    "The only recommendation I have is to explicitly say that this course, while it is a lecture, will be taught in a seminar-like style. Apart from that, it is a great intro course for those with little background in classical music to gain a better understanding.",
    "I think this course was well organized, as it proceeded chronologically and thematically through history. Sometimes I think it might be valuable to return to anachronistic pieces in later discussions, so as to investigate how similar themes were treated differently over time.",
    "The course was advertised as a lecture but became a seminar because of the number of people enrolled (which may or may not be a strength or weakness). I enjoyed the course because we were able to analyze music through historical and religious contexts without needing a lot of knowledge of music theory. The course is also not exam heavy, which is nice."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend, especially if you are interested in music and particularly classical music.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is an interesting premise which offers an overview of music history (albeit in a particular vein) without the stress and large workloads of the music history survey courses. Additionally, this class, due to small enrollment, was discussion-based, which made it a lot more interesting and relevant than just a large lecture course.",
    "Yes! The class had students from a variety of disciplines\/levels of prior experience, and it is very accessible for any level of experience. It also explores music through a different lens that is not always offered in a traditional music history course."
