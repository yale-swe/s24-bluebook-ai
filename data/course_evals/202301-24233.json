                "Strengths: TAs are wonderful! super super amazing with homework. \r\nWeaknesses: lectures could be sometimes ineffective.",
                "Course felt pretty disorganized, lectures were dry and didn't connect with psets.",
                "Professor Park truly wants to teach students coding and has a brilliant passion for it. I feel like the class was very fast paced and it was difficult to keep up with after the 4th week. I think the amount of office hours that were available created a really strong support system for students; however, I was often confused in lecture.",
                "The weaknesses are that sometimes lectures went very fast, there is a lot of information, and very hard to organize together. The strength is that there is a lot of discussion section and office hours that are helpful.",
                "This course is designed so that you don't fall behind, but a lot of people still slipped through the cracks. I struggled to keep up with the pace of the class even after attending office hours, but this was more of a me thing than a class thing.",
                "Strengths: a strong group of TAs really helped students to navigate through data science and coding\r\nWeakness: the lecture of modeling part might be better delivered if there is a comparison table of strengths and weakness of modeling shown in the beginning.",
                "Strength: go through a lot of material in a short span of time, the final project is very helpful and ties everything together, extra credit opportunities are encouraging, TAs are very great at what they do and very accessible\r\n\r\nWeakness: with the final project it would have been helpful to have more feedback throughout (it was difficult to know if our models were appropriate and if not, how to fix it before it was too late)",
                "This class should NOT be titled as specified for Humanities and Social Sciences. Nothing about the pacing or course material categorizes it as such and it is false advertising. Just call it intro to python and move on. There are so many weaknesses, mainly the pacing of the class. If you do not have coding experience there is a major learning curve and you are not given the grace or time to catch up since everything builds upon the next thing you learn. The TAs were great but if you don't understand what's going on how great is the class actually? It is entirely too much content. There is a PSET each week that takes SIGNIFICANT time especially if you are struggling. No matter how much you go to office hours, DS, or pay attention in class it will take a very long time if you are not experienced with coding. On average about 9-12 hours a PSET.",
                "Strengths: Professor Park is very nice and will take time out of her afternoon to explain concepts to you one-on-one. Also the ULAs were super awesome and helpful. Weaknesses: I felt like Professor Park waaaaay overestimated my capabilities to understand CS. The lecture format of this course meant that every single class we'd blur through all these complicated CS concepts and it was just impossible to follow. The unit in which we were supposed to learn all the CS basics necessary to perform our statistical analyses felt far too short, and Professor Park squeezed in the whole complicated system of object oriented programming four days before the midterm, and then made have the midterm about object oriented programming. I feel like this class maybe would have worked a lot better if it had been in a seminar format, with more emphasis on professor-student interaction and in-class time to practice and really understand the models we were working with. Maybe a reverse-classroom situation would've helped too. In the current format of the class, I felt like I never really fully understood what I was doing, which was super frustrating, and even when I was able to get my code to work for the final project, I'd get results I couldn't analyze or evaluate because we didn't spend any time discussing what a good accuracy score looks like, or what a strong R-squared measure is.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Park is super accessible and understanding of deadlines and students needs. There was so much extra help in this class and if you used it (went to office hours and discussion section), it made the course a breeze. The problem sets always helped me learn concepts from that week and never felt overwhelming. I also appreciated the extra practice for the in-person exam. Weaknesses: The data science part of the class (the second half) moved incredibly quickly. We didn't need to know all of the material presented, neither for our final project or the second midterm exam, so I think this course could use some restructuring of that section. I feel like I've walked away knowing many data science concepts exist, but I can't quite explain all of them.",
                "Good introduction to Python. I wish we spent more time solidifying the basics and learning concepts like objects and classes more in depth before moving in to data science concepts. I think learning fewer data science concepts at a slightly slower pace would have also been helpful. A lot of statistics and data science were thrown at us class after class the last half of the course and it was hard to retain or feel comfortable with much of it.",
                "Strengths: The ULAs and TAs were extremely helpful and the grade breakdown (how much PSETS were worth and projects) of the class were fair",
                "pacing was much too fast",
                "Poor lecturing and lecture format, not helpful or engaging. The rest of the course was formatted well, though. ULAs were great.",
                "strengths: Professor Park is amazing. she really cares about her students and our learning and is constantly trying to improve the class\r\nweaknesses: you cannot do well in this class unless you go to office hours and discussion sections A LOT",
                "I really appreciated how professor Park tried to accommodate our learning pace by going slower at times. Also, she did a great job of making the material approachable and not scary and she made sure to make sure we were engaged by checking in throughout each class.",
                "Strengths: this class fills a huge void by being approachable to non-majors but still teaching key CS concepts. The plethora of ULAs and office hours was also tremendously helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes class went so quickly through modules that it was impossible to copy down all of the code or follow what was going on. I also felt that the content of the second half of the course tried to cover too many things so I didn't get depth in any of them.",
                "You will learn python! but the thing is Professor Park goes too fast and covers too much! I would have to spend 3 hours at office hours after class!",
                "strengths of this course would be that it is well organized and covers a lot of material, also the TA's are very helpful and try their very best to help you understand concepts that you don't which for me was the entire class\r\n\r\nweaknesses would be that the class moves way too fast and doesn't really give people time to actually understand things before implementing them. The final project starts way before I was technically capable of completing something like that and it just completely threw me off tbh.",
                "Taught very well and easy to follow and very practical skillset gained",
                "Expectations on certain assignments or projects could have been somewhat clearer. However, overall, the course was very supportive in all areas and used a variety of types of assignments/projects to learn the material from various angles.",
                "Strengths: TFs were great, the subject was interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: speed of the course. It would be so much more beneficial to break this into two courses. Even Cs Majors who looked at our syllabus were shocked at the speed we were going at. Lectures were too fast, and we went through the modules so fast we ended up having to go relearn the material in discussion sections. The didnt spend much time on the extremely hard concepts, so when the exam came around, I felt unprepared despite studying for hours and going to OH every week on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and sometimes Friday. Also, the way class info was shared was so inconsistent. Different TFs would be telling us different things, and some regularly would say they too, dont know Whats going on.",
                "Professor Park is amazing but sometimes she goes too fast and its easy to feel lost in class. However, I was able to catch up during ds / office hours l",
                "Strengths: the subject matter of this course is interesting, especially if you want to think about CS application to humanities / social science topics. You'll leave the class feeling like you have a pretty strong grasp of Python basics, and the ULAs are phenomenal. Professor Park is also very sweet. Weakness: the class goes VERY fast (which I don't think the professor was aware of) and almost everyone I knew was often lost, overwhelmed, and confused. The lectures and lecture slides are difficult to follow, sometimes the Pset questions didn't make sense (even to the ULAs), and you'll need to rely on teaching yourself and talking to the ULAs in order to grasp a semblance of what's going on.",
                "Professor Park is very kind and considerate, if not always the clearest lecturer. I realized pretty soon that I'd have to learn a lot of the content alone, because there was so much covered in class that it was impossible to follow without having basically done everything beforehand  and, at that point, there's not much sense in going to lectures. Many others in the class realized this as well.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the biggest weakness of the class is the content. I wasn't entirely sure why the discipline of data science existed before taking this class, and having taken it I'm less sure than ever. Learning about and solving problems using Python was fun enough, and I quite enjoyed the first half of the course, but as soon as we started getting into data science I was entirely lost  intellectually, emotionally, and morally.\r\n\r\nThe best part of this class is the grading structure. When it's all said and done, 85% of your grade will come from take-home assignments, which is huge. The fact that everything is spread out over a bunch of different small assignments also takes some pressure off. All the assignments are easy enough to do well in if you're willing to put in the time.",
                "The 11AM problem set deadline made time management a bit difficult, in that sometimes the need to finish a pset last minute meant skipping a 9AM class or losing sleep rather than a midnight cutoff",
                "Strength: The amazing TFs and ULAs that provided numerous office hours. \r\nWeakness: Some of the content felt rushed.",
                "Office hours are helpful. The final project proved a bit constraining.",
                "This course does expose you to many basic Python programming skills, albeit very quickly, and it does briefly expose you to what you can do with Python, especially with data science. However, I think the course was too ambitious in its goals to try to expose students to as much material as we were exposed to this semester. There was too little time to absorb the large amount of information we were given, and it was often difficult to grasp the applied part of the class because everything was gone over so quickly.",

The professor is amazing; but, the course itself is very difficult and I often had to rely on office hours or discussion section to explain the material.",
                "I would recommend this course but you must go to the discussion sections to aid your learning.",
                "I would recommend this class to students looking to engage with computer science without being in an environment they're totally unfamiliar with--most of your peers in this class are humanities and social science majors, meaning everyone is coming in with similar levels of experience and interest.",
                "Yes, great intro to python and data science",
                "Yes, this course provided exactly what I was looking for. It was an introduction to python programming for people that will not become computer scientists. It was accessible, accommodating, and beginner friendly. The course felt approachable but also left me with a satisfactory level of programming skills.",
                "I recommend this course to students who are interested in Python and data analytics, especially who are budgeting 10+ hours a week joining TA sessions and doing homework.",
                "Yes! This is a very well-organized course that makes computer programming and python very accessible for those coming from non-STEM backgrounds. You learn an extremely large amount of content in the span of a semester.",
                "Absolutely not unless you have programming experience. This was the worst class I have taken at Yale.",
                "If you're interested in this topic and/or need a QR credit, my opinion is that you should just take a statistics class or YData. I feel like this class has the potential to become really great if changed to a seminar format, but in it's current state I felt pretty disappointed by the strange organization of the class, and the fact that I felt like I never really learned how to code.",
                "If you want to learn python, yes!!! It is a great way to learn python at Yale. The class isn't intimidating and is filled with non-stem majors, and the professor knows that. I would highly recommend it as an introduction to python, so long as you are willing to put in the work especially at the beginning of the semester. It's a steep learning curve until after the first midterm, but the second half of the semester is super chill.",
                "If you are looking for an easier QR as a humanities major, do NOT take this unless you have the ability to spend hours outside of lecture-- 4-5 hours at office hours and perhaps 2 more to understand the material-- on PSETs and other material in order to overcome the high learning curve. Although there are many opportunities and resources to pass, it was a class that required you to prioritize almost every week. If you are willing to also put some of your other class materials on the backburner then take it. Personally, I was on the cusp of CR/D/F-ing the class until the very last minute, so if this is to fulfill the QR credit then I don't suggest it. Also as of now, there is NO CURVE for the class.",
                "Yes, as it's probably the easiest beginning class for computer science at Yale, nonetheless, still difficult, so only if you actually want to learn how to code.",
                "yes it is a good QR for non-stem people in which you actually learn something about computer science and python. big caveat is that it is hard this is not an easy QR if thats what you're looking for. you cannot do well in this class unless you go to office hours and discussion sections A LOT",
                "Yes! Python is such a useful skill and Professor Park is the most kind woman ever.",
                "If you are a non-CS major looking for an approachable class to start learning some CS, this is definitely the one. Manageable but you learn a lot.",
                "No if you don't have the time in your schedule to give this class all of your time.",
                "absolutely not. this course pretends to be intro CS for humanities majors but it moves way too fast for it to be tailored to someone with 0 coding experience. I was constantly behind in this class and while I learned some skills that might end up being valuable the stress and workload was not worth it for me.",
                "Yes, this class has very interesting content and great student engagement",
                "Yes! For anyone who wants a general understanding of Python and data, while this isn't an easy course, it's very supportive and fun and a good place to start for those who have the time and energy to fully invest in learning it all in just one semester.",
                "Kind of. The subject was interesting and its a QR. but I do not think it was actually curated to humanities majors, and the pace is much to fast for people who arent used to quantitive analysis.",
                "If you are interested in becoming comfortable with basic Python programming, yes!! Also, you have the opportunity to develop a cool data science project. Additionally, this course does not have the same crazy workload as CS50/CPSC100, which makes it way better if you are more of a slow learner like me lol",
                "Do not take this course if you're looking for a very basic coding class geared toward Humanities / Social Science students.",
                "Probably not. Personally I disliked it, but this is probably as much a function of my own disposition as anything inherent in the class. \r\n\r\nFor the first few weeks I quite enjoyed learning about and solving problems with Python - it was a new way of thinking and writing that was often interesting. But when we started the data science unit, I completely checked out. Everything about it was obscure and absurd to me. Perhaps someone with a better understanding of the underlying math can see the value in the kind of analysis we conducted (though I have my doubts even about that), but for the level of understanding that students in the class had (this is a course oriented for students in the humanities/social sciences, remember), it just seemed a bunch of utterly pointless hand waving. The final project in particular was one of the most excruciating experiences of my academic life, and singlehandedly made me swear off any kind of data science class at any point in the future.\r\n\r\nThat being said, getting a good grade in this class is pretty doable. Of course, if a grade is what you're after, there are better classes for you (THIS IS NOT A GUT, HOWEVER THE COURSE NAME MIGHT MAKE IT SOUND), so you should only take it if you think the contents will interest you. And that's a question you should consider carefully.",
                "I would probably recommend an entry level stats class rather than this one.",
                "Yes",
                "If you are able to grasp concepts quickly and have an interest in computer science as a humanities or social sciences student, I would recommend this course. However, if you find that you need more time to understand material and don't have the time to prepare before lectures to be able to keep up, I would not recommend this course. Moreover, unless you have the time to go to office hours and/or discussion section, this class can very easily make you feel like you're drowning in work and far behind."
