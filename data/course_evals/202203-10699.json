I would say that the homework load is a bit much at times, if you have to answer questions from podcasts, and write short essays on articles, in addition to the class readings. But everything is very easy to comprehend, even if you are not the most fluent in spanish.",
                "The strength of this course is that I think the subject matter is tremendously interesting - the laws of various countries have so much to do with their cultures, and are a fascinating lens through which to view current events and controversies. Unfortunately, I don't think the class did a whole lot to help us learn about that: the assignments were mostly answering comprehension questions about podcasts dealing with random current events, which while interesting, didn't really align with the stated theme of the class. We also had to pay $80 for a 500-page course packet, of which we used maybe 25%.",
                "The lecture format of the classes that covered legal concepts was difficult to engage with, and wasnt connected well with the current events aspect.",
                "Great professor.",
                "This course gave a lot of busy work which took several hours a week without having much purpose. The readings and podcasts were on interesting topics, but some weeks I would have 12 pages of writing to turn in which was barely read and only graded for grammar. Much of it did not feel like it was not being done for a real reason, which was frustrating with the workload. However, the class environment was quite relaxed, and Prof. Carreras was understanding when we asked for less work.",
                "A weakness would be the lack of feedback on written assignments and the strength is the professor's charisma.",
                "The course is structured in that we know the assignments we have to complete each week, but I wish we knew our grades. I did not know what my grade was the whole semester.",
                "Better management of assignments\r\nReadings and assignments being posted online instead of in printed course book\r\nAllowing for assignments to be turned in online instead of having to print",
                "The course ran with both lectures and discussion because of the seminar nature. The professor had us listen to a weekly current events podcast which enriched the class because we were able to not only keep up with legal events in Spanish-speaking countries, but we were also able to see how the law failed to protect people within unique settings and how the public reacted to shortcomings in their legal systems and frameworks."

Also, class participation will make the class a lot better, so if you are usually quiet, you will probably want to push yourself to speak up at times.",
                "I don't think I would recommend the class: the workload felt rather high (particularly some weeks) relative to the amount we were learning. The class also didn't feel like it was terribly well-organized or like it had a clear sense of direction. Prof. Carreras is very nice and interesting to listen to, but the class itself and the assignments could use some work.",
                "Take it, but its not as much of a gut as it used to be. You cant breeze by an hour long podcast with 30-70 questions and 30 sentences of writing.",
                "Yes absolutely, a great professor.",
                "Take this course if you need an easy L5 credit. It's not the most interesting and the workload is insane some weeks, but if you speak to the professor about it she will reduce the workload.",
                "Yes, but this has been falsely advertised as a gut. It is not a gut.",
                "Yes! This is an amazing way to explore the international legal field.",
                "I would recommend the course, but some of the assignments can be extensive. Profesora Carreras is very nice and understand, but she does get frustrated when students do not participate.",
