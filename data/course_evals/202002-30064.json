   "comments": [
    "I learned to be much more conscious of the food I eat, and the injustices that occur within the food service business.",
    "I received a great overview into the complex relationships between food, race and migration in the United States. We learned about food as not only a means for personal consumption but the ways in which it brings people together in social, racial, class and gendered spaces. We specifically focused on the food industry: farm sector, restaurant industry and meatpacking industry and how often the hands that produce our food are invisible and hidden away from consumers as well as their long histories of exploitation and struggle. We gained new insights into how to think and speak critically about our own personal roles in food justice and food hierarchies.",
    "I learned so much about the politics of growing food, preparing it and eating it both in the United States and around the world. Through this course, I got to explore so many ideas about common food practices and critically engage with the foods I enjoy.",
    "Thinking critically about where food comes from, how it's produced, and systemic forces that impact its production, distribution, and consumption. \r\nFilm analysis was another useful skill I developed in this course. \r\nPresentation skills.",
    "I learned about the structures of inequity built into the US food system, and the historical and contemporary ways this system effects us as consumers.",
    "This course taught me how to not overgeneralize different concepts related to race and migration. I feel like I now have a deeper understanding of different food histories, and it's definitely made me think more deeply about the food I eat and my own food practices.",
    "I gained a working understanding of food systems in the US and how they are vessels for cultural exchange as well as means of oppression of certain groups. I learned how to think critically about the food I purchase and consume.",
    "I learned so much about food, food practices, food cultures and more from this class. Despite feeling a bit hesitant since the class was quite large and over Zoom, Professor Tran and the TAs did an amazing job facilitating the class and leading meaningful and helpful discussions and lectures throughout the 3 hour period.",
    "I learned to analyze food and how it has facilitated people and migrations. We didn't just look at migrant farm workers, but how food working industries have created classes of people that are chained within hierarchies.",
    "I learned to think about food industries as structures of power. I learned how to evaluate many different roles in these systems, including the ways in which I participate.",
    "This course gave me numerous novel insights into how food is deeply linked to social justice. I am now much more conscious about the source of the food I consume as well as how the production process is harmful to different populations.",
    "So much! Respect and understanding of the complex food systems in our country and how race, class, ethnicity, gender are so intricately woven in",
    "I learned so much about the food industry and food practices in the United States. I learned so much about recipes that are considered quintessentially \"American\", how food is processed at every level, and social justice related to food. I learned so much and loved everything I learned.",
    "I gained the resources and skills to think about food mindfully. I now know the ways historical migration patterns intersect with foodways in the United States. I also have a greater understanding of the nuances of social justice and food justice that need to be considered in justice-related activism and policy.",
    "It helped me think deeply about the food I was consuming and how food is related to power.",
    "I learned a lot more about food and the histories involving food in the US. I had to prepare an oral presentation which helped me with my public speaking skills, and the two papers we wrote helped me work on my wiring skills.",
    "I felt the only skill worked on in this class was casual conversation over subjects that did not matter much in the real world. It felt like a seminar on small talk and avoiding real discussion."

   "comments": [
    "I found the class to be a bit lengthy, and thought the presentations at the beginning of class ran a bit long.  However, I really appreciated section as my TA and my peers were very engaging.",
    "Although taught through Zoom, this class was structured in a way that facilitated easy learning. Classes started with engaging student presentation on various food topics, followed by a break, then a lecture portion with slides, and then a breakout room session with our TAs. The assigned readings as well discussion section activities and discussion questions kept us focused on the week's topics and important concepts. It was easy to ask for help and share thoughts.",
    "I enjoyed how the class was split into a lecture and discussion section. I also really enjoyed the presentations by students throughout the course.",
    "I really loved almost everything about this course! The TFs and professor were amazing and facilitated great discussions. The topics discussed were very interesting and needed as well, but I feel like the content of the course could have been diversified just a little more, but this is probably due to the fact that summer session is so short.",
    "The student presentations were sometimes not as engaging, but our presentations were a great way to discuss mini topics related to the broader course themes. \r\nThe format of the class was engaging, with section held at the end of class. Personally, some of the readings (e.g. the pineapple one, cultivating food justice) were not as engaging as others (Holmes, Jayaraman, Pachirat, and Twitty) but all of the assigned readings were useful in helping me deepen my understanding of the class themes.\r\nThe professor and TAs were wonderful and I truly learned so much!\r\nUsing Zoom comments was also a helpful part of discussion.",
    "The strengths were the readings, which were very interesting overall. The weakness was the amount of time devoted to long-winded student presentations.",
    "Well, I wish the course hadn't been online, but it is what it is. I think that overall, the structure of having lectures and smaller discussions was great. It felt rushed and there was a lot of reading, but that's what a summer course entails.",
    "This course was thoughtfully organized to encourage student participation and well paced. It is challenging to keep the attention of the class for three hours via zoom, but I liked how each class period was split up among lecture, student presentations, and section discussion. That said, I think giving students the freedom to do things like watching films or conducting activities outside of class as a way to shorten the meeting time would have been helpful stamina-wise.",
    "the class was very interesting and insightful overall and I do not think the class had any real weaknesses. I think the class would have been better as a small seminar just because there tended to be a lot of people who did not speak at all throughout the short semester and I felt this would sometimes lead to awkward pauses which would make discussion a bit difficult at times.",
    "I loved the large lectures and the smaller breakout rooms. I think if there were more activities in the large discussion so there was more participation that would be good.",
    "Strengths: The classes were very interactive and I was engaged throughout them. I also found the assignments to be very fulfilling and fun to complete. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes sections felt rushed as there was so much to discuss in the time allotted for them.",
    "Strengths: The readings were very well chosen and thought-provoking (and very manageable!). Participation-based reading responses let me organize my thoughts about the material in a productive way. Section discussions were very robust, and were the highlight of class for me.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lecture material felt a little basic, and I don't think it added much to our critical discussions. Because this ended up being more of a lecture-style class, we spent an hour or more each class period listening to presentations. While I do think the material offered in those presentations was important and interesting, I don't feel like that was an effective use of our time. I feel like we could have been better served by making the presentation groups larger (~4 a group perhaps) to cut down on the presentation time in order to make more time for class participation activities like discussion section.",
    "This course was particularly enjoyable since it gave students the opportunity to engage with content through a diversity of mediums such as films as well as more academic research. I think it could be improved by spending more time investigating some of the solutions to the problems we investigated. For instance, it would have been great to get insights into sustainable food production.",
    "Seriously so good. For a summer class too?! No complaints. Great to have class broken into several smaller sections that help made 3 hours on zoom much more manageable.",
    "This class is very engaging and asks for students to think about the food they eat, how they cook, how they eat out, how they shop, and how they have access to food. It allows the students to discuss, to think critically about a basic part of our life, and I learned so much. It was an amazing class.",
    "The course included a good balance of lectures, student participation, and discussion sections. I liked that the the lectures included a variety of media that made them more interactive, like videos and polls.",
    "The course was conducted very well. The lectures were very engaging and I enjoyed how professor Tran created an interactive format over zoom even in such a large class. The only weakness was that the expectations for graded work was kind of unclear.",
    "The class's subject was very interesting and the professors and the TFs were all very good. The class was 3 hours long, which I think is too long because it is simply not possible to focus for that long in one sitting."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would if they'd like to be more aware of all sectors of the food business as a whole.",
    "Definitely! The topic was super interesting and also not one that is covered often at Yale. At the same time Professor Tran is really knowledgable and structured the class really well",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Food is used as a medium to explain more complex concepts such as race, migration, class, and gender. Course material is simultaneously engaging in past histories, but also today's modern U.S. society. It's easy to connect this learning to a personal level and ways in which we ourselves can engage in food justice.",
    "Yes, I think it is so important for everyone to take this class to learn more about the hierarchies in the food industry along race, class and citizenship lines.",
    "yes I would because it's really enlightening about the intersection of food, race, migration and how each one might affect each other in rarely discussed topics. I learned a lot about how food mandates subjugation of certain domestic and migrating races and ethnic groups.",
    "Yes!!\r\nFood is such an integral part of our lives and we often don't think too much about where it comes from, how it's produced, etc. This class helped me consider my own food choices from various analytical perspectives. Professor Tran and the TAs were also fantastic!",
    "Yes. This course was very eye opening and has given me a new perspective on my engagement with food.",
    "Yes! Professor Tran and my TA were really great and were really invested in my learning and understanding of the material. All of the readings were also incredibly thought-provoking--great class if you want a taste of the ER&M major!",
    "I would take this course! The readings are very interesting and prompt some really cool discussions. We watched some really eye-opening films that made me re-evaluate my relationship with food and cultural. I came out of this course with a wealth of knowledge about the food industry and the injustices within it.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in having candid discussions about food and in hearing about the wide range of personal experiences Yale students bring to class in that context. There is a strong element of individual experience in this curriculum, so if you embrace that, this course is for you.",
    "Yes, I would!",
    "Absolutely! I loved learned with Quan Tran, and I loved the TAs.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. There is so much to learn about the world of food and how we all interact with it daily.",
    "Yes! It was something I have never studied before, but is very relevant in my life.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any student interested in learning about how to think critically about the food industry and the products they consume daily.",
    "Absolutely. Such an important class. Everyone should be required to take at least one ER&M class at Yale. And take this one. Prof. Tran is awesome",
    "Yes! I learned to appreciate where the food I eat comes from and what steps are taken to get that food to my table. I have become a more thoughtful consumer and realize the importance of the choices I make at restaurants and supermarkets.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student that is interested in understanding the intersections between food and socioeconomic status in the United States. This course has a lot to offer in terms of historical analyses in addition to integrating economic and anthropological data.",
    "Definitely! It was an amazing thought provoking course. Definitely one of my favorite courses that I have taken at Yale so far even over Zoom. It was engaging and all of the reading were very interesting. You do have to be willing to fully engage with the material to get anything out of it though.",
    "Yes, it was interesting and the workload was not too bad.",
    "No. This course did not provide any real thought-provoking questions. Every conversation was generated by the same prompt re-worded to fit the chapters read for that week. There was no control of the classroom, nothing to keep me motivated to listen, and the subject matter was boring and had little impact on me in any way."
