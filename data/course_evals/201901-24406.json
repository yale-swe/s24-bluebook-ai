   "comments": [
    "The strength of this course is the vast amount of medical topics we're able to cover. I also really liked how we were able to cover these topics through various media such as scientific articles, magazine articles, movies, TV shows, and podcasts.",
    "Writing skills strengthened. Weakness is not my speaking.",
    "more focus on speaking and making participation less voluntary to keep students engaged",
    "Great overall. Well balanced lectures, etc and we'll organized. Would like more opportunities to speak.",
    "This class is very engaging and lots of fun. You learn a lot of material and the self evaluations are very useful. The structure of assignments in this class is also set up very nicely.",
    "I loved this course!",
    "Strengths are the professor and her teaching style that engages students and promotes a positive learning environment.",
    "The class was always very enjoyable. The work was light but consistent which was great since it made me enjoy doing it but I had to do work consistently which meant I was always learning something new. Watching videos in class also made the class very engaging. I only disliked one aspect of the class, which is the lack of central american literature or content. I can say with a high certainty that almost all of the documents that we read were from Spain and none were from central america which is very disrespectful to claim that a course is a Latin American Studies course yet no Central\/south american content was covered. This really frustrated me and it felt like a microaggression."
