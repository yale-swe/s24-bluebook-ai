                "This course provided an overview of the physiological systems of the human body. It focused heavily on several systems such as respiratory, renal, and cardiac function and also provided a great foundation on neurobiology and electrochemical signaling. It served as a great bridge from the pre-med prerequisites--particularly chemistry and biology--and applying them to actual biological functions.",
                "Lots of knowledge on how the body regulates itself.  By the end of the course, we could trace the effects of a change in input (say, consuming a high-salt diet) and the downstream changes that would occur in the corresponding system (the kidneys have to work harder to clear the dietary salt load, so your blood pressure is raised).",

                "In this course I learned about the human body and the mechanisms by which the different organs function independently and with each other.

This course was truly phenomenal as it allowed for me to understand so much about physiology and transduction pathways without needing in depth knowledge about the chemistry behind the molecules. I also learned how to study the symptoms of a patient to determine what could possible be wrong with their physiology. This skill is something that is critical for entering the medical field as well.",

This is one of those but it is a good thing because the content was very relevant to the BME major. I further expanded my memorization skills that is useful for other memory intensive courses like anatomy.",

                "This course was really interesting and did a good job of summarizing the body systems. However, I think the level of support was lacking. The material is so dense, but they don't recommend reading the book because it's too dense. I wish they would provide us study guides because the slides were not super informative on their own, and the class moved too fast to be able to write down everything the lecturers were saying. The learning objectives were well intentioned but are vaguely worded and sometimes just confused me more on what I should study.",
                "So great! You learn a lot in this class, and it's a lot to study, but it's all worth it. I prefer to have lecture finish a little early with time for questions after, rather than rushing to fit all the content in the end.",
                "They cram a lot of material into a very short amount of time, so you don't end up retaining much of information in the long-term. I think it would be helpful to have 3 midterms with one droppable midterm rather than 2 non-droppable midterms, since there is a learning curve for figuring out how to tackle the midterms. If you do badly on the first one, you have to do incredibly well on the second one to compensate.",
                "I think that the material in this course is fascinating and the teachers assistants do a wonderful job of helping the students understand what is important to know. Additionally, the learning objectives at the end are extremely helpful as well.",
                "strengths: lots of interesting info, good instructors \r\nweaknesses: cram too much info into 50 minutes, often runs over/rushed final few slides",
                "This class is definitely hard and goes at an extremely fast pace.  I feel like there was a lot of minute detail and math that may have been overkill and a but intimidating.  However, the class was fair on exams and the quizzes helped me stay on top of learning the material throughout the fast paced class.",
                "Content-wise, this has been my favorite course at Yale, but there was a LOT of it. The course was graded on an unclear curve, and even after asking about it we never really received more information about it. Its hard to come back grade wise from a bad midterm score too. I was also disappointed with the courses response after finals went online, as it remained synchronous, closed note and proctored although many other STEM classes recognized the severity of the situation and made the final optional or at least open note. TLDR really cool class, but take it credit D if you have the option.",
                "Some content, especially at the end of the semester, felt very rushed and condensed and was not taught as well/effectively.",
                "Strengths- The weekly quizzes, though very long, were great in formulating answers similar to that of an exam like setting. I thought the questions on the quizzes were easier than the questions on the exams. \r\nWeakness-The exams were absolute nonsense. Totally unfair and had to be taken under a complete time crunch. The professors would expect you to answer questions that they did when writing the responses to the questions. Not to mention that the questions required a level of deep thought to understand the mechanisms. In summary, the exams were way too long, wanted information that the questions did not directly ask, and were overall an unfair way of testing student's understanding. It felt like it was a \"let's make it difficult because this is Yale\" type exam. Also, there was too much material in each lecture, so much so that the professors wouldn't finish and have to go overtime or rush the last couple of slides.",
                "Big strength: Saltzman and Campbell. They were amazing lecturers, some of the best I've had at Yale. There was a lot of information delivered every lecture but it was definitely manageable as long as you kept up with the material. There is a lot to memorize so this definitely isn't a cram right before the test kind of class if you want to do well  you have to put in the work on your own to learn the material as it comes to you, or you will definitely be overwhelmed by the time the midterms come up. \r\n\r\nWeakness: No one ever responds on Ed! Most of the OH didn't work out for me so I turned to Ed when I didn't understand something, but most times it never got a response :(.  \r\nIt would also be helpful if the lecture slides had a bit more text to them. I often had to search through the book to have a figure explained to me while it could have been easily explained on the slide in just a few words.",
                "Short lectures made it easy to stay focused. Also changes of lecturers were amazing because the change-ups kept me engaged and it gave us insights from 3 (4 w/ Professor Holt) different perspectives! No pressure for grades because the quizzes are designed nicely concerning points, but they help a lot in preparing for the exams. Because there are 3 exams, for me, that also takes away the pressure. Discussion sections were amazingly helpful to understand everything.",
                "This course had strong instructors, and taught the material really well. The key weakness of the course was the textbook; it was so dense, and the assigned reading pages were so substantial per lecture, that reading prior to lecture felt impossible, and thus I did not read often. If a more condensed version of the book was available, which did not spend as much time discussing details cursory to the course, I think I (along with many other students) would have actually felt motivated to read and thus would have gotten much more out of the course.",
                "The material and the way its taught is a wonderful strength. The material is so engaging and lots of learning can take place if you out in the effort. The only negative is that you were expected to know basically everything you learned, which was a lot. This made the exams very stressful and difficult, especially the final.",
                "In general, I thought the organization of the class was conducive to learning a massive amount of information in a short semester's duration. Lecture slides were thorough and helpful, and the weekly quizzes were great, low-pressure, low-stakes opportunities to test conceptual knowledge and find weak areas of understanding. The feedback for each quiz was also very helpful. Typically, mandatory section is a chore, but section for this class was incredibly helpful. It was a great platform to review and simplify content from the previous week and ask questions. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, the biggest were some of logistical details regarding exams. Every exam was a massive time crunch, which made it difficult to demonstrate my understanding. For the multiple choice/true-false sections, it was a matter of I did I know the answer immediately because there wasn't enough time to take a moment and think through the question and answer choices. For short answers, it was a balance between getting through each question quickly enough so I could finish while trying to cover all the points necessary to answer the question. It was increasingly frustrating that the short answers were graded so harshly. It often was the case that the short answer had 10 conceptual points for a full answer. While I could write for an hour about a particular topic, I would cut myself off after 10 minutes, so I could finish the exam. If I happened to miss 1 of the 10 points that could go into a complete answer, I would get points taken off. In the past, I'm used to getting full credit if I got, say, 7 of 10 conceptual points and all of the main points. Here, I might not know how thorough of answer is necessary for full credit, move on so I could finish the exam on time, and then get points off, which was very frustrating. \r\n\r\nAlso, in the first class, it was communicated that--based on feedback from previous course evaluations--special effort would be put on completing each lecture without skipping slides or rushing at the end, but most lectures were very rushed at the end.\r\n\r\nOverall though, I really enjoyed this course besides those two details.",
                "The lectures are given quite well, but also quite fast due to the sheer amount of material the class covers, and they aren't recorded.  Posting the lectures would allow students to catch a small but important detail that they missed.",
                "Strengths: very well organized course \r\n\r\nweaknesses: pacing was relentless at times and sometimes lectures were very rushed because of the amount of material covered",
                "The strength is the wide range of systems that are covered. The weakness is that some are covered much more heavily than others (ie. kidney).",
                "This course had way too much content and the exams required a lot of rote memorization that does not facilitate learning.",
                "Strengths: the professors and teaching team were FANTASTIC! The quality and care everyone put to make sure students understood the material was unmatched in any other class I've taken so far. I also thought the textbook was helpful and used the outlined pages to annotate slides from class to get a full picture understanding for myself, even though only material taught in class was what was tested on.\r\nWeaknesses: I cannot think of any, midterms were definitely a time crunch considering they are 50 minutes long but I honestly would prefer that to a 2hr evening exam",
                "Weakness\r\n- very reading heavy and hence memorization\r\n\r\nStrength\r\n- very good exploration of basics of physiology",
                "Fantastic course!",
                "Strengths: weekly quizzes are not very stressful and really facilitate learning. You get 100% on the quizzes as long as you attend section and got at least 50% to begin with. Most people do better to start but it's really helpful to know that this part of your grade is more about learning and understanding. The professors are all very knowledgeable, especially Professor Aronson during the renal lectures. TAs are super nice and responsive.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the multiple choice on the exams was often tricky / the type that requires you to choose multiple answers so if you don't get ALL of them right, you get the whole question wrong. This is a little demoralizing but I hope the curve in the class makes up for it.",
                "This course is fascinating if you are interested in medicine/how the body works. It is a lot of material and it can be difficult to figure out how to study for the exams. My tip is to redraw all the diagrams and pathways until they are all clear in your brain. The professors are engaging and the material is gone through quickly but if it was any slower we wouldnt get through all of it.",
                "Weakness: wayyyyyyyy too much content rushed through each lecture, especially by salzman\r\n\r\nStrength: very rewarding material learned",
                "Strengths include the fact that the material informed me of the relevance of physiology in my research. It could be improved for graduate students by: allowing some ample time to learn how to navigate the MatLab software for lab reports. Also to make the exams open-note for graduate students or for them to have an essay-like final instead of an undergraduate-like final. PLEASE ALLOW AMPLE TIME FOR THE FIRST TWO MIDTERMS BECAUSE TAKING EXAMS UNDER FIGHT OR FLIGHT RESPONSE WILL NOT RESULT IN AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF A CLASS' APTITUDE OF THE MATERIAL COVERED***************** I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH.",
                "Strengths- the content is extremely relevant with sufficient support from professors and TAs and non-monotone lectures\r\nWeaknesses- lots of content that we are expected to know, so little time",
                "The strengths of the course was that the information taught was very interesting, the lectures were engaging, and the discussion sections were extremely helpful. The only weakness is that this course did require the students to learn a lot of information.",
                "This course would definitely work better if the material from each system was integrated better. Rather than just saying \"this is how the heart works, this is how the kidney works, this is how the endocrine system works,\" it might be better to have a week devoted to blood pressure regulation that integrates all systems, a week devoted to glucose regulation that integrates all the systems, a week devoted to Ca2+ regulation that integrates all systems. That way it would be easier to understand how everything fits together and what each organ system does, as well as what happens when things go wrong.",
                "Strengths: SUPER interesting material. I'd recommend this class for any pre-med, biology major, or BME major out there who wants to get to know more about how our body works from a chemical, electrical, and mechanical perspective. The TAs for the most part are also gems (shoutout to ANNA the best TA) - they truly truly care and devote so much time and effort into helping you learn and retain the concepts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Might just be the nature of learning physiology itself, but the one major issue of this class is that it is so heavily memorization-based. If you don't have a good memory (like me) you will be struggling. I wish this class focused more on applying concepts to new situations, like many of the equations we learn, instead of being so dependent on recall, especially since I guarantee most of the material will be forgotten a year after taking this class. I think it's a big flaw and a disservice to those taking the class if someone with a photographic memory but no true understanding of the material can ace the class. Another smaller weakness was that the lectures were too rushed and all over the place sometimes. I wish we selected only a few systems to really go in-depth on - a lot of things seemed very accessory and hand-wavey, which I did not appreciate.",
                "I liked the content a lot, but I wouldve liked more critical thinking. It was a lot of memorization which I dont believe builds the skills you need to be a successful scientist.",
                "Strengths: amazing instructors, very well supported course in terms of TFs and peer tutors\r\nWeaknesses: Just super dense",
                "This course was very well taught and has been one of my favorite classes at Yale. The format was amazing and I felt like I knew what was relevant everytime. Aronson was an amazing guest lecturer and Campbell consistently brought a soothing and clear presence. I just wish the lung lectures were more clear and went a bit slower.",
                "STRENGTHS:\r\n- course material is really cool and this is the closest you're going to get to med school content at Yale\r\n-quizzes: if you score at least 50%, it will be rounded up to 100% if you attend section\r\n-professors: Saltzman, Aronson, and Campbell are great lecturers for the most part\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES:\r\n-Jennette: passive aggressive TA who controls a lot of different aspects of the course; she would not record review sessions or offer multiple review sessions even tho the majority of students in this class had conflicts with another course\r\n-lack of grade inputs: you have to do really well on the exams in order to get an A because the only other grade you have is quizzes which in theory you should get a 100% on\r\n-lectures are not recorded: there is so so so much content in each 50 min lecture that it is impossible to hear/write it all down. recorded lectures would only be sent to students who missed class because they were sick",
                "Tests were too short on time, didn't feel like it was a great representation of what I knew in the course.",
                "This course did a great job of presenting material at an understandable level as well as the multitude of resources available to learn more about the mechanisms through Ed discussion or office hours with the professors. The quizzes in the course were a great study tool and relatively low-stress as earning above 50% and attending your discussion section would bump your quiz grade up to 100%. In addition, the discussion sections were truly helpful for figuring out what I needed to study, but also to better grasp the material. \r\n\r\nAs far as weaknesses go, there were not that many to remark on. The two that come to mind would be the pacing of some lectures and the amount of material that must be memorized for the midterms.  For the most part, lectures were well paced, but occasionally we would cover a lot of material in one lecture at a very fast pace which made it very hard to take notes on. In addition, this material often was very important to understanding subsequent mechanisms discussed. I think having the recordings of the lectures available at the end of a unit (such as before a midterm or the finals) would be extremely beneficial to figure out what was missed from those fast paced lectures. The other thing was that tested did require a lot of memorization, and while the material was enjoyable it was often just too much to memorize. Especially with the content on the midterm being up two lectures before the midterm. It would be helpful if the material on the midterms covered a week behind that of the lessons as to give students more time to memorize and focus on the material covered.",
                "Strengths: Class is taught very well, learning objectives are super helpful with guiding studying. Weaknesses: Professors can be bad at timing lectures and end up rushing through the complex topics at the end/not finishing. Sometimes the slides arent super helpful.  Posting the quiz answers on canvas would help a lot because my TA wouldnt get our corrections back to us until right before the exams.",
                "This course has very interesting material, however there is just way too much content for each exam. The weakness is definitely the amount of content they cover. It makes it impossible to really go into depth on a topic when reviewing for exams. Having learning objectives for the kidney section would have been very helpful. The endocrine system was taught very poorly, the last few lectures they skipped out a bunch of the slides and said to learn it on our own. Each lecture honestly had like 5 slides too many and they would often say to look over it on your own, we were expected to know it even if they didn't get to it in class.",
                "The course covered a lot of material in a very short period of time, and it felt as though some material was covered more in depth than others. I don't think the class is well organized in terms of feedback and exams. We don't get to keep our midterms to study from them and when graded, it doesn't say why we were deducted points. The class doesn't have practice exams either, so it is hard to figure out the best study method because we don't know the structure and type of questions that could possibly appear on an exam. It would be nice to have had practice exams to do and look through.",
                "Strengths: discussion section with TF and graduate section \r\nWeakness: weekly quizzes; very time consuming",
                "strengths: professors and TAs are very knowledgeable and explain things well\r\nweaknesses: course goes by extremely quickly and there is so much information. each lecture is very dense",
                "I enjoyed that we were able to cover all the different systems.\r\nI found that sometimes the textbook was less helpful than more. It was helpful for the quizzes, but not really in our own understanding of the concepts and putting things into framework.\r\nI loved learning from our professors, who were approachable, helpful, and very knowledgeable.",
                "Did not like quizzes. Final exam shouldve been open book because for those willing to cheat, it already was",
                "I enjoyed the teaching style where it was in person. I definitely think that this class could benefit from having more time. I know that this is more a Yale College regulation, but I think that having three lectures of 50 minutes does not allow for ample time to cover everything. There are some lectures that definitely needed more time and were skipped due to time constraints.",
                "Exams are weighted too heavily and more credit needs to be given to students for the amount of memorization and reading that goes into this class.",
                "Strengths: learn a ton about the human body, pretty fair exams in my opinion. weekly quizzes (100% if score is >10/20 and you attend section) were very helpful for understanding the type of reasoning necessary to do well on exams and understand the course material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures (particularly guest lecture + Campbell) could be a bit ambitious at times, and reading selections contained a ton of extraneous/irrelevant info beyond the scope of the course (maybe recommend reading that is necessary for the scope of the course separately from extra info)",
                "High workload. But worth it!",
                "Strength: the lectures are very clear and informative.",
                "strength: the course is very well-organized and developed\r\nweakness: the workload is incredibly high, especially for students whose backgrounds are more related to CS/EE.",
                "I think a strength of this course is that the content is very interesting, and if you truly think about it, all the systems fit together and work together in a very intuitive way that makes the content easier to digest and fun to learn. In addition, the professors and TAs are very helpful, if you know the right questions to ask. A weakness of the course is that there is a ton of content, which makes it hard to study for the exams. In addition, the fact that we are not allowed to keep our past exams for practice and to look back at past mistakes is a detriment to using past tests to help prepare us for future assessments.",
                "This course was extremely well-organized and all the professors were incredible!  The teaching fellows were also very knowledgeable and did a wonderful job of breaking down difficult concepts during section."

                "Yes! Required for BME, highly recommend for other bio/science people!",
                "I recommend this course to all pre-med students, since it teaches you a lot about the human body and you get to apply your knowledge to medical situations.",
                "Yes, it's truly a fascinating course and you will learn so much about the human body",
                "Yes, it gives you a strong preparation for medical graduate education (it's a grad course too!) and helps study for the MCAT.",
                "Yes, especially if you are pre-med! This class is a biomedical engineering class but it is so helpful for anyone wanting to go into medicine! Since Yale doesn't have a basic human anatomy class, I feel like this class gets the closest to learning about anything related to medicine itself and the human body.  The information was super interesting, but the class is definitely challenging.  I would recommend taking this class with other lighter classes so you can devote time to learning the abundance of information!",
                "Yes, if you can take it credit D or dont care about getting an A",
                "Yes, but only if you are able to put in a LOT of work. Though it is very rewarding to understand in such detail the human body.",
                "I would not. The material present in the course is great, but the grading is terrible. It's one of those classes that would be great to Credit/D, but most people cant because they are required to take it, or it would look bad on a medical school application.",
                "Yes! I think nearly anyone would benefit from this course. It gives such good insight into how the body works and is so captivating.",
                "Yes! One of my favorite courses at Yale because well-structured, instructors very committed to student well-being and to making sure they understand everything.",
                "If you are interested in medicine, definitely take this course. It is a much more anatomy/physiology-focused version of biology, and seems much more relevant and useful than the ultra-specific knowledge provided by other MCDB courses. The professors are engaging and thorough, and I loved learning about every topic covered. Putting in the work and learning felt very rewarding, as the material feels relevant to life and humanity irrelevant of whether one intends to progress further in the MCDB department. Additionally, the discussion section system does a fantastic job of condensing and clarifying the large amounts of material, making it much more digestible and manageable.",
                "Absolutely, but only if you are willing to put in the time and effort this beauty of a course deserves. You will hate this course if you are no ready to dedicate yourself to it. Very difficult but highly rewarding.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Particularly for people interested in medicine, it ties together the concepts of previous science courses (i.e. chemistry, physics, biology, etc.) and applies them to human functions, which, at least for me, is what my interest in science is all about.",
                "Absolutely.  The workload isn't too bad--weekly quizzes that essentially function as problem sets since they are open-note.  Most of my time spent on this course was studying for exams.  The class is very interesting and teaches you a lot about how your body operates and regulates itself; however, there is a lot of material and memorization, so be ready for that.",
                "Only if you need to take it or are particularly interested in physiology.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to go into medicine or any healthcare related field. The content is very valuable, however only take it if you have the work ethic and time to commit a lot of information to memory.",
                "If this class is not required, please do not take this exam. This class gave me nothing but stress and anxiety.",
                "An incredible course! Id recommend to everyone who wants to know about how the body works.",
                "Yes, don't think that this class will be too much to add to your workload because the content and experience of this class are so worth it. It really was fun to take this class and as long as you keep up with the material after each lecture and refer to office hours/the textbook when needed, the workload is definitely manageable. This is one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale and it is so well-taught!",
                "Yes, it is very interesting.",
                "Yes! Perfect for MCAT preparation and fascinating material for anyone interested in research and/or medicine",
                "If you are interested in understanding how the human body works, take this class! There is definitely a lot of material but you will learn a LOT and I hope I will look back on my notes for years to come. I'm not pre-med but I think this class is especially useful for anyone considering medical school. The weekly quizzes are more like problem sets that are graded on effort (if you get at least 50% and you go to section, your score gets changed to 100%). The exams were definitely tricker with averages in the 70s/80s but the class is curved.",
                "Yes! This is one of the best classes Ive taken at Yale. Its super satisfying to put together all the things I learned in my premed classes into functional systems in the body.",
                "As a BME major this is required. Definitely take it sophomore fall if you can! It confirmed for me that this is the path I want to take because although it was one of my hardest classes and its not easy to do well in it, if the material is intriguing to you thats a great sign.",
                "I would recommend this course to people who has to take it or someone who is interested in physiology and is willing to take a course that they will need to invest hours upon hours on.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the information learned about the human body in this course was very valuable and interesting, especially for students in a biology related major, even though the workload was very high.",
                "100% the material is really interesting.",
                "If this stuff interests you and you don't mind memorization-based exams, absolutely! It's a pretty rigorous course but definitely manageable if you tackle a little at a time each week. If you have to take this for your BME major or as an elective for bio, this is the class to take.",
                "Yes especially if they are thinking of going into medicine",
                "Yes",
                "If you are interested in physiology, you will gain a lot from this class.",
                "Yes, the best place to learn physio.",
                "For BME students, you have to take it. For non-BME premed students, it's probably a good idea to take it because it will def help with the MCAT.",
                "Not for a graduate student",
                "Absolutely!! This class has been one of the best classes I have taken, and I learned so much!",
                "I would recommend if you are genuinely interested in the content and want to put in the work. It is a lot of work, especially before exams, and definitely will not be fun if you dont like the subjects. It is taught really well though, although it can be frustrating when professors dont cover all the topics. If you actually go through things every week and review it shouldn't be that bad.",
                "Yes, but do it when your other courses are a low workload.",
                "No, I would not recommend this course to another student unless it was a requirement for their major or they are taking the MCAT. The workload of one quiz a week isn't bad, but they will spend a lot of time trying to learn the information for the exams. There is so much information that we learn in such a short period of time, and you're expected to know the information in detail, so the time commitment in terms of studying is very high.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes if you are premed or interested in how the body works. If you don't need this for your major, maybe consider credit/d/fail because this is a lot of work and studying was quite stressful. If you don't need a grade in the class, it might be more enjoyable to just learn everything without having to worry about grades. Although it's difficult, I found the information to be very interesting. It's really cool to learn how everything works!",
                "Especially if you haven't learned physiology before, I would HIGHLY recommend. I would also furthermore give the advice to read the textbook chapters on time (it'll help, but aren't super necessary) and for the quizzes (they really help with understanding the quizzes and what the concepts they are trying to get at much more). I would highly recommend going to section. Lecture slides are more helpful after you've gone to section, and you should also definitely look at them for quizzes.",
                "Yes, I would recommend, good introduction to general physiological concepts",
                "Probably not",
                "I would recommend this to other BME majors and premeds. However, if you are not in any way going to use physiology in your career or in other future endeavors then do not take this. I think that the huge time commitment towards this class makes it very difficult to enjoy it if you are not going to use it afterwards.",
                "I took this class as a non-major and without ever having taken biology, which in hindsight made this class more difficult for me than for most people. It was still interesting to attend lecture, and if you're like me, then I would recommend auditing the class or just showing up to lectures out of interest.",
                "Yes, apart from just being an insane amount of information to learn, the class was really interesting. Youll struggle a lot while studying but it starts feeling rewarding when everything comes together and you can make connections between different systems.",
                "Absolutely if you're premed. A good litmus test to see if this path is right for you, in my opinion.",
                "Heavy workload so be warned! But otherwise a great course and would highly highly recommend. My favorite STEM class at Yale!",
                "Yes. It would be a great introductory course for students interested in physiology or generally in biology.",
                "I would recommend this course for students who might be interested in medical school or BME-related majors and who are intellectually prepared for the workload, which might be more than twice as normal.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in physiology and the human body. By necessity of learning about the entire human body, there is a lot of content and things you need to know, but if you know what to focus on and keep doing it little by little, it is digestible. I would suggest taking classes such as physics, cell biology, biochemistry, and organic chemistry (aka most of the prerequisites for the course) prior to the course to give a solid foundation. Otherwise, there are many things that would be a little too complicated to master on the first pass.",
                "Yes, anyone hoping to pursue a future career in medicine or biomedical research should take this course!  I anticipate the content being extremely helpful and relevant moving forward."
