The emphasis on practical application over traditional grammar-focused lessons fostered a dynamic learning environment. This approach not only enhanced my linguistic skills but also deepened my understanding of important cultural and social issues.\r\n\r\nThe course structure, which prioritized project-based assignments, was particularly effective. It allowed for the practical application of language skills in meaningful contexts, making the learning process more engaging and relevant. This hands-on method helped in solidifying my language proficiency and in gaining a richer perspective on the issues discussed."

                "I really like the content of the course. The topics about immigration, Afro-latino and indigenous community, and art were super cool. I still think they need to have some more emphasis of grammar. I understand trying to teach us these things just through exposure to content and materials, but there was never any explicit teaching on grammar. I think this method takes a lot longer than it would if everything was just explained to us outright. Also, I don't know if there is a difference in professor or what, but I think the expectations of writing expression between L3 and L4 are really far apart. That was quite frustrating.",
                "Strengths of the Course:\r\nThis course stands out for its innovative approach to language learning, blending a diverse array of engaging and relevant content. The variety of materials used not only makes the learning process more interesting but also ensures that the knowledge gained is meaningful and applicable. This creative mix of content caters to different learning styles and keeps the course dynamic and engaging.\r\n\r\nAreas for Improvement:\r\nWhile the course's pace contributes to its dynamic nature, it occasionally moves too swiftly, which can hinder optimal engagement with the various materials presented. Slowing down the pace slightly could allow for deeper exploration and understanding of each topic, ensuring that students fully absorb and appreciate the richness of the material. A more measured pace could also facilitate a more thorough discussion and interaction with the content, thereby enhancing the overall learning experience."
