                "I developed more knowledge about reading plays and source materials more critically, and discussing film and theatre theory.",
                "Learned about so many awesome Black theatremakers who traversed the space between Theatre and Film, engaged with a lot of questions relating to adaptation, when and why it works and doesn't, engaged with multiple different theories about and connecting art, race, and performance, gained a greater understanding of the historical and industry-related circumstances that influenced Black theatre and filmmaking at various points in American history. Further developed script analysis skill by reading a play I was deeply interested in week after week.",

                "The course explored great films and plays and the discussions were always engaging. Professor Forster provided great questions to introduce the topic and structured the class very well. There was also some flexibility in the subject matter and he took care to pay attention to student preferences. I feel there may have been too many assignments at one time so there were times we could not discuss everything we had gone over.",
                "Strengths - high level of freedom for students to choose what they wanted to discuss and write about within Black theatre. Many opportunities to engage with different forms of Black theatre and be exposed to rare primary sources.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - n\/a",
                "Fantastic assignment format and distribution blog posts are a wonderful way to further engage with and develop the ideas kicking around in my head after watching the films, doing the readings, and engaging in class discussions each week. Ungraded pre-class worksheets were also a lovely way to get settled and centered within the material before each class started. \r\n\r\nSyllabus selection was fantastic overall, would've loved to see either more queer Black theatremakers brought into discussion and\/or more readings about queerness and queer readings within the work already on the syllabus! \r\n\r\nStudent presentations were a lovely way for each of us to dive a little more in depth into the playwright\/topic of our choosing and bring those insights to the class!\r\n\r\nThe Beinecke trip during class one day was also really awesome, and we got to see some very interesting and insightful archival materials relating to works we had read thus far!\r\n\r\nProfessor Forster gave amazing midterm feedback on the blog posts and class discussion contributions we had made so far!",
                "Really cool, unique content I would not have been exposed to before. Prof Forster is really good at driving discussions. More cohesiveness to overall themes might be helpful?"

                "Yes! This class was amazing and one of my favorites. It was both fun and educational. It was great to talk about the works we studied but also just fun to watch them. I learned a lot that I think I would have never heard about otherwise.",
                "Yes, it gave a great overview of the Black theatre canon, Professor Forster is very supportive and interested in student contributions, and the overall classroom environment is super comfortable and low-stress.",
                "Absolutely yes! If you have any interest in Black artmaking, please take this course! You'll learn so much that you can take with you into your studies\r\nelsewhere. If Professor Forster is teaching his Intro to African American Cinema course at the same time, I also highly recommend taking both of those courses at once! They might be the most iconic and insightful double-bill at Yale, and the connections between the two courses are so exciting!",
                "Yes! I appreciated getting to learn more about some Black artists",
                "This is an absolutely incredible course that I cannot recommend enough! Getting to learn about Black playwrights who have been ignored or forgotten by larger society is an incredible opportunity. Being able to engage with these artists and their work through discussions and blog posts is a great way to question how we define art and artists. If you get the chance, take this course! You will not regret it!"
