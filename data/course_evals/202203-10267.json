                "gave me a broad, fundamental overview of third world studies",
                "Lots of heavy theory, big emphasis on Professor Okihiro's theorisation of the \"social formation\" and subjectivity. This course is definitely breadth over depth, although if you decide to engage with the readings, you get a lot of depth out of it.",
                "I think I gained skills in reading political theory, and was able to read some theory that I'd been wanting to read for a while.",
                "This class was my first introduction to critical theory, legal theory, feminist theory, and other theories in an academic environment. I thought that this class was quite radical and challenged my view of the operations of society. The course is very reading heavy and as a first-year, it was hard but manageable. I learned to prioritize my readings and find ways to critically engage and understand the texts.",
                "I was able to learn of the field of Third World Studies, its relationship to Ethnic Studies, and how to read complex texts.",
                "I learned about how power operates in our racist society as well as the distinctions between Third World Studies and ethnic studies.",
                "An understanding of the third world, colonialism, imperialism, capitalism, and a number of other concepts/practices",
                "I gained a rich understanding of third world studies.",
                "I learned about Professor Okihiro's fields and theories: Third World Studies and Social Formation Theory. Both are a call for a more radical politics and transformative point of analysis. I also enjoyed learning the basics of other fields central to Professor Okihiro's work including queer theory, disability theory, racial formation theory among many others. This is a good introduction course for anyone interested in ER&M as it provides a foundation to use for other similar courses.",
                "Learned a lot of history. Maybe not the best intro class for some of these ideas? But really really good and important.",

                "I learned a lot of theory that I did not know before. As an ER&M major, this helped a lot because we should all understand where many of the discourse you hear today even comes from. I also was surprised to find that while many of the theories are dense and confusing throughout the semester, by the time I wrote my final paper, I could articulate them pretty well, which I am proud of.",

                "Strengths: Okihiro\r\nWeaknesses: I did not know that there would be so much jargon for this course, or perhaps that's the case for all philosophy/social science courses. The readings were dense at times, and it would've been useful if reading tactics were taught in class by TFs and Okihiro, rather than each of us learning on our own.",
                "Very theoretical, if you plan to take the course def recommend taking other courses in ER&M to get a better understanding of the concepts.",
                "strengths: broad overview of subject material to build solid foundation, professor is super engaging, TAs are fantastic\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the amount of reading was sometimes a struggle to get through in one week",
                "Professor Okihiro is brilliant, and my particular TF was great!",
                "strengths - engaging lectures, interesting and thought-provoking texts.\r\nweaknesses - a lot of readings, which are not always discussed in lecture/section. also, this seems more like a history course than an er&m course -- what i mean by that is some of the readings and material are a bit dated and haven't been changed in the curriculum since gary started teaching this course way back when. is \"third world\" even an appropriate term anymore?????",
                "The strength of the course is Professor Okihiro--he's a phenomenal and engaging lecturer. The biggest weaknesses of this course were its organization and the sections/teaching fellows. This course does not practice what it preaches. Not only did the teaching fellows assign an unreasonable amount of dense, theoretical readings, their sections felt poorly organized and not at all oriented toward generating productive student conversations. This felt deeply ironic in a course that emphasized new and radical pedagogies--that in such a course as students we were often talked at and not to. Although the lecture environment was wonderful, the sections felt like opportunities for the teaching fellows to speak at us and left little room for students to offer their own insights. After our first midterm, the teaching fellows team spent a considerable amount of time belittling our work--saying things like \"I was afraid to start grading your midterms because I knew how bad they would be,\" etc., etc. The teaching fellows then decided to single out the two top-performing students on the midterm and have them run outside, mandatory sessions with the chance for us to do a write-up and earn up to 10 points back on our midterm. I have never experienced anything like that in my time at Yale and found it deeply inappropriate. The final assignment (to cite and engage 15 to 20 readings from the course within 8 pages) was simply unreasonable. Again, for a class that ostensibly rejects the disciplinary nature of academia and seeks out radical and transformative ways of learning, many aspects of this course felt incredibly punitive. Another essential issue with this course was that although it was labeled introductory, it was taught in a way that would be highly inaccessible to any student without substantial background in critical theory or ER&M. Ultimately, the course could be improved through a new pedagogy which is more in line with what it teaches--assign less and more accessible readings and delve into them more, have teaching fellows who are sincerely interested in student learning, and be clear about standards and grading (rather than grading exams arbitrarily and scolding students who are simply doing their best).",
                "Professor Okihiro is a gem, but oftentimes, when he tries to engage the class during lecture, students are too shy or nervous to speak, so it creates a bit of an uncomfortable environment. Also, I wish the readings were a little more connected to lecture.",
                "Professor Okihiro is a great lecturer, but the lectures are a little loose and unstructured in a way that felt incompatible with the long class periods. The class is also quite disorganized. While Professor Okihiro seemed to have a vision, there was a lot of difference between the three TFs that made the class logistically quite confusing.",
                "The professors lecturing style can be hard to understand at times. He dumps a lot of information and I found it hard to critically engage with the lecture material during class time. The sections and readings helped a lot though.",
                "Strengths: TA Brennan was very accommodating and insightful, I truly enjoyed how he presented the material \r\nWeaknesses: lectures were at time disorganized, and lacked structure",
                "Strengths: engaging professor\r\nWeaknesses: dense, theory heavy readings that are pretty impossible to complete on a weekly basis and that often fail to connect to the real-life conditions of contemporary oppressed peoples",
                "Strengths: Really helpful to have big terms defined and explained in depth\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The structure of the sections was a little complicated,  some TFs required more work and there were constantly unbalanced grading, section work, etc. ; in general the TFs sometimes made it difficult to feel confident about the progress we as students were making in the class. Sometimes it felt like they expected us to have the same background as grad students which felt unfair at times",
                "A bit more organized of a course would be better.",
                "The greatest strength is Okihiro himself. Professor Okihiro is extremely knowledgable and caring for his students. He is interested in hearing students' comments and concerns. Additionally, I also appreciated the different genealogies that he presented in class.",
                "A little bit more structure to the lectures/ discussion sections would be helpful.",
                "The weakness of the course was definitely the testing/grading, which what I heard was mostly designated to the TFs to decide what to do. There was clearly a lack of communication between them how to grade us, and it was especially harsh for any class I had taken. It also seemed a bit strange to grade an in-class essay so harshly, especially considering what this class is about. I feel like in-class essays are a bit outdatedI haven't had to do that since the standardized testing of high school. The strength of the course is definitely professor Okihiro who is such a great lecturer. He really managed to make the class feel so personal and intimate despite it being a lecture. I learned immensely from him this semester.",
                "Strengths: Professor Okihiro and the TFs were all very knowledgeable, and the readings were always interesting. I feel like I learned a lot!",
                "Strengths- excellent content, incredibly insightful\r\nWeakness- more regular feedback would be useful",
                "This class had fantastic materials and great enthusiastic instructors but the reading was heavy, not just on the level of many pages, but also in that it was often hard to access on the level of language."

Especially for someone interested in Political Science, Sociology, Anthropology, etc., which typically lack much of the critical insight of other social science classes here at Yale, this is an important class to take.",

                "No. BUT Professor Okihiro's lectures are so wonderful that it's almost worth taking. If you do decide to take it, taking it Credit/D/Fail could alleviate some stress. Otherwise, the organization of the sections is such a headache that it's truly not worth it.",
                "Yes, I think all students at Yale should take this course and learn from professor okihiro.",
                "Not necessarily. If you want to go into academia/majoring in ERM/AMST, it definitely gives you an overview of all the ideas/theories/philosophers that form the foundation of this field of study. However, if you are just vaguely interested in the topic, you are probably better off taking a more specific ER&M/AMST course.",
                "Yes! It was one of the most engaging courses I've taken so far. The readings, discussion sections, and lectures all left me thinking for a while afterwards, each time. It helps you ground a lot of the concepts and terms that are thrown around and also introduces a lot of new topics to consider.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student if they already had interest in the subject matter. However, I would not recommend it to another student if they were simply looking to dip their toes into a new subject.",
                "I absolutely would. I recommend this class to every person I can. This class is incomparable to any other classes I have ever taken. Professor Okihiro is brilliant and taught me so much.",
                "Yes, this is a foundational course for ER&M, but Id recommend it to anyone.",
                "I would recommend the course to students interested in enhancing their understanding of how power operates in social and economic domains, and how that power is influenced and exerted by colonial and white supremacist forces.",
                "I would recommend this class! It was a lot of reading and the sections were kind of difficult because they were all so different but I really enjoyed Professor Okihiro",
                "Yes, important to get this nuanced perspective.",
                "I don't know. I learned so much in a semester but in short, grading is handled differently by TFs each semester. This semester, I understood that grades were being curved down by the TFs. Additionally, modified grades for the midterm were not handed out until weeks after the midterm, which did not allow students enough time to decide to Cr/D/F. It was disappointing to see the education system, identified by Okihiro as a means for oppression, used against us in a course that calls for a more radical form of theory and education.",
                "Yes - its a very interesting course and its important to be aware of these things",
                "Yes, everyone should take a class with Okihiro. If you like lectures or theory take this one!",
                "Definitely! The class was really thought-provoking, and the theories and authors we covered in class are applicable to basically any future academic or professional career.",
                "Absolutely, this course made me re-evaluate how i think about the world and my role in it as an academic",
