A comparative perspective is valuable, as it allows us to consider why our systems are the way that they are -- and if and how they should be changed. The book review and final paper also allowed me to learn how to critically assess legal readings.",
                "Knowledge of various topics in comparative constitutional law: relevant history, modes of comparison, important cases, and debated issues. Got better at reading cases, understanding legal terminology and argumentation, and relating legal frameworks to social, political, and historical situations.",

                "Strengths: Professor Calabresi is a kind professor who is knowledgeable about the material. The concepts covered in class are fascinating too, especially for someone who is pre-law. The workload was manageable --- all we had to do was a 10 page paper and a 20 page final. Weaknesses: The readings (a law school textbook) were dense every week, although you didn't really have to read it all in detail to participate. Classes would seem repetitive in structure after a while and Professor Calabresi would cold call on people.",
                "Professor Calabresi is brilliant, and is the greatest strength of this course. The discussions we had, especially when there was disagreement in the room, were phenomenal, and allowed us to take home pertinent questions to consider.",
                "Strengths: great overview of various important topics in constitutional law around the world; excellent discussions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: was all taught using one casebook, which led to an understanding of the law that fit with the ideology of the authors rather than one that was more unbiased  I ended each reading not really knowing how to argue against certain points because the book and class framing of the issue was only based on one viewpoint; class was mostly the professor lecturing, with some classes involving more student participation, usually off of cold calling to share thoughts on a particular case or debate - this could be remedied with more clarity on what to read for and focus on each week (as the readings are usually about 150 pages), and larger and more consistent amount of class participation; the assignments weren't specified beyond \"write a book review of x\" or \"write a final paper comparing some topic in x country to some topic in x country,\" and weren't clarified at all in class - I had to ask the professor after class or in office hours to get more information on what I was supposed to write and how to go about writing it",
                "Strengths: Great textbook, in that it usefully compiled a lot of important cases and information that give a really good grounding for future work. Weaknesses: A lot of the textbook focused on the US, Germany, Canada, and the UK, with not too much time given to other examples, particularly examples from low-income countries.",
                "I think that the course could benefit from a little more discussion on the material being taught, at times the seminar-style discussion took a back seat to the content we had to get through for the class"

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning about the constitutions of other countries. If you are pre-law or a political science major, you should definitely take this class. Professor Calabresi is kind and knowledgeable.",
                "I would entirely. The readings are on the longer side, but most of the chapters are profoundly interesting.",
                "Yes, but probably after taking some foundational law class or if you have considerable background information on OECD countries and political issues, and can commit to reading a lot every week. The content is really interesting, and it is laid out in an understandable way; the issue I had was then understanding how to criticize it and take stances on certain rulings and judicial opinions, which mostly had to come from beyond the class. It's a great overview and situates constitutional law within history and politics, but you should be prepared to do a good amount of work and come to class with defensible opinions.",
                "Yes! I say if you have an interest in international affairs, constitutional law, or how founding documents influence modern processes this is a great course. I will share that each class began with a ~30 minute lecture on American history/broader Western history of some Constitutional point. This was frequently helpful but not always the most effective use of time. Every time we got more into the meat of the questions class became a lot more interesting.",
