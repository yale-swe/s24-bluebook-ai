                "I learned a lot about analyzing picturebooks, and thinking about each element more deeply. We also explored the physical aspects of picturebooks which are internal to their success with children. The visit to the Beinecke was also a lovely part of the course as the history of pop-up picturebooks came to life before us.",
                "I got to read a lot of childrens books from many cultures and eras and develop a theoretical framework for critiquing them.",
                "I gained a solid foundation of the history of the picturebook from different time periods, and traditional Japanese and European traditions.",
                "I learned a lot about evaluating the things around me, including materials that I would not have necessarily thought to think critically about.",
                "An overview of picturebook history. Wish we had focused more on context and reception then just the content of the picturebooks alone. However, did look at a lot of cool books.",

                "This class was very interesting and had a good balance of lecture and discussion. The only improvement would be if it was in person (we had it on Zoom), but discussions went surprisingly well considering the virtual aspect of the course.",
                "Strengths - good assignments and readings\r\nWeaknesses - readings hard to access and find (bass reserve, Beinecke), low level of class engagement, on Zoom",
                "No class on zoom can be perfect, and sometimes I did feel that discussions were a bit slow and unengaging. I think one way to fix this would be to require that people keep there cameras on at all times: I understand that for privacy reasons this is not always possible, but often people who had there cameras on did not participate at all and I felt that was a bit odd. \r\n\r\nAlso, sometimes it was hard to find the books. The next time this course is taught, it would be great if the books were not put on reserve at Bass. I know this is a personal preference, but going into Bass is like going into a dark, depressing tunnel with no light at the end. It also takes a long time for the people at the service desk to find the books for some reason and oftentimes, they weren't able to find them. At Haas, where some of the books appeared on reserve, it is so easy and quick to find the books. Also, art books belong in the arts library, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the instructors of this course are very knowledgeable and it was a pleasure to re-visit and experience books from my childhood. I especially liked our seminars on the modern/avant-garde picturebooks, and I enjoyed that our for essays we were able to explore a topic that really interested us. We did go to the Bienecke once, and that was great, however I think even more museum visits - especially to the YUAG - could be included. The YUAG is now totally open and running like normal, so covid should no longer be a problem for museum visits.",
                "lectures felt helter-skelter and discussion sometimes stalled. maybe have guiding questions that we should be thinking about each week, and have a student presenter to give an overview of the readings for each week?",
                "Its very difficult to access the syllabus items for this class. Unless youre willing to do constant trips to the special collections desks at the various libraries, or deep deep google dives, you miss out on a lot of the classes information. Class facilitation improved over the course of the semester with things like shared google docs which booster engagement.",
                "i love the diverse selection of euro-american and japanese picturebooks!! so many of them were so gorgeous and they of course brought up lots of fun nostalgia (which was so sweet bc usually a lot of people would remember certaun books from their childhoods and it was like sweet memories time). weaknesses: we were assigned soooo many texts but really only talked about a few each class very briefly! i wish we had had fewer readings and were able to spend more time with each one since they are often so amazing"

                "Yes, especially if you are interested in Art History and English. Do take a course with Professor Trumpener - she is great!",
                "Yes, this was a course that pushed me to think outside the box, and was a bit out of my comfort zone. Def take it.",
                "Only take this class if youre willing to take weekly trips to all the various special collections desks at the different yale libraries. During a busy semester with lots going on, especially with the libraries limited hours, I found this to be a difficult thing to keep up with. Fun final project because you're able to make a picturebook. Prof Trumpener is a kind professor.",
                "yesssss! easy readings (lol), great profs, great discussions, not a ton of work, creative project final option, and lots of time reminiscing on childhood favorites through a totally new lense",
                "Yes!! The teachers are so amazing, the format of the class is great and the instruction works so well for a 2 hour seminar. The material for me felt like a new beat and it was really interesting to discuss picturebooks in an academic format. Take this class!"
