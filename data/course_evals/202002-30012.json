   "comments": [
    "I felt that I gained a well-rounded understanding of modern technological trends, and how polices may be shaped in order to help advance those technologies for the greater global good.",
    "I learned so much about green technologies and how they might not always be as green as they seem. This course taught me to think critically about technologies that seem great on the surface but might not actually have the impact we think they do due to the location they are used in, the time of day they are used, etc. I also loved how Prof. Prober kept bringing our learning back to New Haven and the Yale campus. It was interesting to learn about Yale's energy use; I feel much more knowledgeable about my Yale community and what Yale is doing to reduce its carbon footprint.",
    "I loved it",
    "I developed a deep understanding of how many modern technological advances work and why US public policy might hinder it's development and implementation.",
    "This course definitely opened my eyes to the way the technology I use everyday really works.",
    "I learned about how different technology works, from electric vehicles to maglev trains to spectroscopy and MRI. It was really helpful to learn the science behind technology that we know about and use everyday",
    "I learned about a variety of contemporary technological innovations both inside and outside of Yale and their applications as they relate to the environment, government, and other areas.",
    "I was introduced to a number of advancements in modern technology (and also the basics behind modern communication, vehicles, etc), and also felt like my research skills on technical subjects improved.",
    "A general understanding of a variety of scientific areas, but nothing super in depth. Overall interesting course",
    "Learned lots about the past, present, and future of processes like electrification, transportation and medical industry and the technology within those fields. Also learned a lot about Yale's sustainability initiatives and electricity process - super cool."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "If feasible, it might be interesting to prerecord the lectures (say an hour) and then have the Zoom session to be more of a Q&A, and discussion. That being said, the format we used worked fine and it didn't detract from the course. I would recommend having the lecture slides to be a tad more organized as they were a little scattered.",
    "One weakness was the length of each course. 3.5 hours was much too long for most students (I believe). Even though we got breaks, most of those breaks in the beginning were spent working on quizzes, so I never actually got the chance to get out of my chair and take a real break. This improved as the class progressed and we stopped doing the quizzes during breaks, but I still wish the classes had been split into more frequent meetings of no more than 1.5 hours. I think 3.5 hours is just way too long to stay on Zoom.",
    "The course was well adapted for an online version. Professor Prober does a great job of introducing the scientific principles of several topics and allowing a space for questions and discussion of public policy. Problem sets are often more focused on searching the Internet for information rather than applying the information from lecture to form policy recommendations and evaluations; these assignments could be reworked to reflect learning a little more.",
    "I think the length of this class made it hard for me to stay focused as much as I wish I could have.",
    "Strengths:\r\nVery interesting content! Since it was technology that we all use, it was very relatable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nHomework questions sometimes werent explained in class, particularly the ones with formulas",
    "A strength of this course is that the course material is very engaging, and the relevance to Yale specific policies are very interesting.",
    "I think the strengths were the interesting questions on the p-sets, and listening to student presentations at the end of the course which were extremely insightful and interesting. I do think that the course could be improved by making it more interactive, especially when the lectures are so long and are on zoom. Perhaps some conversations about the modern technologies in break out rooms or more frequent, smaller projects throughout would work well.",
    "The class is really boring, like the lecture portion, I really wish it wasn't that boring.",
    "I think the lecture slides are overall a little messy, and I think the Canvas files page could have been organized a little better. That being said, the exam was not hard and overall it was an easy science credit.",
    "Strengths - interesting material that we covered! \r\nWeaknesses - class limited because it was virtual (which couldn't be helped because covid), but would have definitely benefited from the in-person demonstrations and field trips that the class went on in the past. And possibly cover more material."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would. The course offers a very balanced approach to understanding modern technological developments. Definitely intellectually stimulating and makes it easy to excited about the hard sciences.",
    "Yes! This course is great for non-science majors who need a science credit, and it's also great for people who want to learn more about Yale's energy use.",
    "Great",
    "This course is a great way for students from non-scientific majors to delve into what modern technology is able to do and how it is able to do that. It's a wonderful survey of several topics of relevance to the modern world, including renewable energy sources, medical imaging and automated driving.",
    "I think this course is great for non-science majors looking to learn about the science of everyday life.",
    "Yes. Great class with interesting topics and flexibility.",
    "I would definitely recommend this as a great science credit for non majors",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because I think the course material is really interesting to anyone who is coming to this subject from a non-science background.",
    "I would recommend this course to other non-science students who want a science credit and who would be interested in being introduced to some modern projects like Elon Musk's Space X or brain-imaging or optical communication.",
    "This class is really boring. Not very difficult, but if you didn't drink coffee in the morning you honestly might face asleep in class.",
    "I would recommend this to someone who needs a science credit that focuses on breadth rather than depth. It covers many topics but doesn't get too technical or deep with the content. It is overall easy if you have taken science courses in high school, but it does have a good amount of work in the shape of the problem sets (especially if you are taking the condensed summer version). Overall, fun course with a good professor and relatively easy content. Would recommend as a fifth class.",
    "Maybe. It was disorganized. Other than that, the topics were interesting and gave a good base to modern science\/technology.",
    "Yes! Good course for a science credit, and interesting material to learn as well. Fair assessments, not super difficult to do, which made learning enjoyable."
