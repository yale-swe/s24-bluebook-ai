This course has introduced me to an entire world of audio-visual synthesis and analysis that I am very excited to continue learning about and pursuing professionally. If you are at all interested in the intersection of technology, music, and visual arts, this is the course for you."

                "Strengths\r\n-The professor. Konrad is literally the best\r\n-Lower workload\r\n-Assignments are FUN. You get to be creative\r\n-The demos blow my mind every single class. If you like demos, this class has a lot of them, and they're often interactive\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-It's a long class. Maybe break into two 1 hour 15 min lectures instead of once a week\r\n-Maybe more feedback on assignments. Didn't see grades all semester",
                "Aside the raging anemic, no weaknesses with the course, only strengths",
                "This course is fantastic and covers a lot of ground over the course of the lectures while allowing for some fairly creative assignments that gave us a really good grounding in the core concepts. Both being exposed to all the possibilities in lectures and labs plus practicing the problem sets and skills prepared us well for the open-ended final projects-- my favorite part of the class was definitely the reward of seeing everyone's hard work pay off beautifully in the final class presentations in the Off-Broadway Theater.",
                "Strengths -- Max is an awesome program, Konrad is a really charismatic lecturer, projects and assignments are very rewarding\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- the lectures feel somewhat aimless, we are shown a ton of cool stuff but not given a chance to really try it out or build on it, so a lot of it is just forgotten (you end up knowing ABOUT many more techniques and tricks than you can actually use)\r\n\r\nThe course would be much improved with a different structure... it would be great if lectures were shorter, with clearer goals and opportunities to try everything out ourselves",
                "I do not believe that this course works as a 1:50 lecture once a week. That is simply too long to try to follow a lecture about programming with a minimal interactive component. I felt like I didn't absorb very much of what I listened to. Dividing the lecture into two 50-minute blocks would make a big difference. I liked the biweekly assignment structure with the final project. Having lab was good, but it didn't always seem that there was a plan for how to use it. That would be the opportunity to work in pairs or small groups on our assignments or other exercises. Instead, it sometimes seemed to devolve into another lecture block.",
                "Strengths were lab time and demonstrations in class. I think focusing on specific skills would have been helpful, but the all encompassing approach was very cool too.",
                "Strengths: I feel like I can program pretty well in Max (or at least figure out on my own how to learn what I don't know); the course is very free in that you can choose to do what interests you on most of your projects. Cons: Konrad is very hands-off, and the lab section doesn't really help with that  the lectures are very lecture-y where he sort of shows you what you can do with Max and not how to do it. I feel like most of what I learned I learned from doing the psets, but even they were very free and abstract  so I wish there was a little more structure there. One more con - we received almost 0 feedback on our work the entire year, and one grade on one of the 6 problem sets. Also, the class spends a remarkable amount of time on video processing for a class called 'electronic MUSICAL instrument design'...",
                "This has been one of my favorite classes taught at Yale. Konrad is an inspiring and thoughtful professor, and the vibes are just right. There is no pressure to outdo yourself, but there is certainly always help available. However, I think the course would benefit from something like a vocabulary list within Max MSP. Although reverse engineering Konrad's program patches were a lot of fun, it could also take me down rabbit holes to understand the mechanisms. Especially towards the beginning of the course, I felt like I had been dropped into deep water. That said, the deep water is sometimes necessary and that is true of Max."

It's by far the best engineering elective I've taken. The assignments are actually fun, and they're built so that you learn along the way. The weekly sections help a lot too, and they're super small so you get to know your TA and classmates really well. Such a cool class, and the professor goes above and beyond to help you do whatever you want to do with the class.",

It's the type of class that is what you make of it. There is some really interesting material, and the lectures are fun, but they can become long and aimless if you are not internally motivated.",
