                "I learned the fundamentals of the Russian language. My speaking, reading, and writing skills drastically improved over the course of the semester.",

                "I learned how to speak, read, and understand Russian.",
                "I learned basic conversational skills in Russian, Five Russian tenses, and Russian vocabulary.",
                "I developed a basic skill set for speaking and writing in the russian language.",
                "RUSS 110 covered about four out of six of the Russian grammatical cases, focusing mostly on singular forms. Also, a ton of basic verbs -- a ton, plus the past, present, and future tenses. The beginning of the course focused on getting used to the Cyrillic alphabet and basic vocabulary, so your ability to speak didn't really \"explode\" until much later in the course. In all, I learned basic conversational skills (talking about my family, school, likes/dislikes, where I live, etc.) as with any intro language course.",

                "Strengths: Many resources available for help or guidance, textbook/video based, very busy-work homework.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Crunch weeks in quiz/test weeks aka inconsistent workload, fast pace.",
                "Having daily class and homework was very effective for my learning. I felt like that helped me understand the grammatical concepts better, especially in reading and writing. It would be beneficial to have more one-on-one speaking and/or listening practice.",
                "The class engagement and opportunities to participate were always high, making it easy to learn and practice Russian. I also felt that the homework everyday helped in reinforcing what was learned in class. I think one weakness was that there was not enough experience with actual Russian media. I think more examples of modern Russian media could help in improving exposure to conversational Russian.",
                "The canvas site was very user friendly, and the home work every night was really helpful in reinforcing writing and reading in russian. I cannot think of any weaknesses of this course.",
                "Strengths: There is speaking/writing practice built into class time, where the professor/TA leads the class in conversational/worksheet exercises -- that was very handy while learning Russian. The exams were also designed well: challenging, both oral and written, giving you a chance to really test/show off your knowledge. Weaknesses: But I would have liked more vocabulary reinforcement: I found myself learning material on my own much more than I ever did in class. The everyday homework was good for applying what I learned, but I wish there had been more structure to the actual class, too: less just flipping around the textbook and more note taking and discussions -- maybe group flashcard practice and more identifying exercises (like Alana's slide on colors).",

                "yes",
