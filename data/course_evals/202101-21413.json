                "fascinating class that really benefited from the multiple anthropological viewpoints of the professors. I gained an overview of war from both a \"deep time\" view and also insights into how modern warfare impacts all portions of the population.",

Definitions of war, its origins, its development and changes, peacemaking and after facts of war; \r\n\r\nSkills: Making connections between readings, discussions, and lectures; sometimes working specifically on refutations and critique of academic writing, but also using the class reading to analyze documentaries;\r\n\r\nInsights: I think the course really provided a ~depth~ of perspective for looking at the origins and developments of warfare",

                "It was a well thought-out, cotaught class that really tackled many aspects of a difficult subject.",
                "This course was led my some really great professors and TFs, and it synthesized a lot of different types of information in really cool ways. Lectures were interesting and the class was generally low-stress, and it encouraged me to ask questions I'd never considered before. One way it could improve is by ending more consistently on time.",
                "This course was excellent in terms of the range of topics it covered and how it thematically related those to war. However, in a lot of ways this class felt like taking three different classes simultaneously - one focused on archeology, the other two focused on biological and socio-cultural anthropology, respectively - since a lot of the assignments allowed students to choose their own topics, I could see how a student who just prefers archeological studies could have had a wildly different experience than a student who just prefers to study biological anthropology. I wish the course did more to integrate the three perspectives in each case study that we looked at, instead of using case studies as independent examples of each area. For instance, when talking about genocide in Rwanda - we could have learned about socio-cultural perspectives of genocide and post-atrocity reconciliation, but also considered how forensic archeology related to the process of reconciliation.",
                "Strengths: very cool to be taught by all 3 professors, professors all very engaged and willing to connect with students both in and out of class, readings very interesting\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes lectures were unstructured which made it difficult to follow",
                "Strength: A variety of perspectives, the three professors all bring their own specialty and a lot of students taking a class are very open to sharing their own experiences;\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes it could feel a little bit disorganized, given the structure of the course, and at points it felt a little unsatisfying because there isn't really an \"answer\" to the big questions being posed",

                "Unfortunately, I did not find the material as engaging as I had hoped it would be, which was, in part, the result of assigning too much reading. At the beginning of the semester, this was not as big of an issue, but especially towards the end, 100+ pages could be assigned for one class. This was particularly frustrating as we never talked about all of it, but we were not told to prioritize some readings over others, and this left me not motivated to do any of the reading because the chances were slim that I'd do the \"right\" one for what we were talking about. The discussion posts did require that you at least do some of the readings, but I felt like I was largely skating by and not getting as much out of the class as I would've if less reading has been assigned because then I would've actually done it all. Instead, I was constantly fearful of speaking because I didn't want to say something that would expose me for not having done all the reading. Additionally, I didn't appreciate the comments on our essays when they were to the effect of \"I wish you had talked more about xyz\" because that's not really helpful feedback for a 2-page paper; I didn't have the space to talk about it more. This probably sounds more negative than I mean it to, but it is something I would like to see improved in the future\/is something one should take into account when considering this course."

It's also uncommon for three professors of different areas within anthropology to co-teach a course, which is a great experience - especially if you're new to the anthropology department (like an underclassman) and want to get a feel for what sub-fields you might be interested in.",
