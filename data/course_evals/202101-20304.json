                "I think this course would have been great in-person but definitely suffered a bit in the Zoom environment. The readings were compelling and informative (make sure to leave a good chunk of time each week to get through them!), the final paper was a daunting but meaningful capstone to the semester (although the lack of intermediate deadlines meant that setting deadlines along the way was completely self-imposed), and our conversations were generally interesting. That said, it's hard for a conversation to feel free-flowing over Zoom, and it was often tough to gauge who was raising their hand or identify when students wanted to comment while Prof. Merriman was continuing his train of thought. I think a lot of these dynamics wouldn't have been a problem in-person, but it made our conversations feel stilted and not super organic. Prof. Merriman would often pose a new question or move on when there were still students attempting to jump in; this pattern certainly was a result of Zoom and not intentional, but it felt like we never really got into a conversational groove before switching direction. I would have also loved a stronger sense of community in our class; given how niche the subject is, I would have loved to get a sense of everyone else's interests, especially during such a socially isolated semester! Overall, I'd take this class in-person if you're interested in the content; I still got a lot out of it but felt like a piece of the experience was missing.",
                "The greatest strength of this class by far is Professor Merriman. His ability to tell a story based on his incredible memory and wealth of knowledge makes the two hour session fly by!",
                "It is a wonderful seminar with excellent readings and films, and an amazing instructor to match! Strengths include the instructor, syllabus, and other people in the course. There are no weaknesses.",
                "It was a great course!",
                "Strengths: John is one of the kindest, most fun professors I've had at Yale. Even online, the classroom atmosphere was welcoming and fun... It felt like we were just having an academic discussion among friends, rather than in a college course (and a departmental seminar at that). And with this great atmosphere, the discussions were very interesting and informative! The questions John asked to prompt our discussion were both broad and specific, so there was something for everyone to respond to, whether you wanted to have a more directed discussion or wanted to talk about your own takeaways from the reading. With a combination of the books we read, our class discussions, and our final research paper, I learned a ton. John knows so much about France, especially Vichy, so we always got extra tidbits of information. Sometimes our discussions would get a little distracted and tangential to the original topic, but I count that as a strength because that made class even more interesting, engaging, and feeling like a great chat rather than a forced classroom discussion. I liked that we only had one paper, but it was a long research paper, so we could really dive into our chosen topic in-depth. Overall, I absolutely LOVED this class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings\/books were a bit long, but I suppose that just comes with the history departmental seminars. The class was somewhat laid-back, which I think was a strength, but if you don't like more loose or laid-back teaching styles, you might consider this to be in the weaknesses category. The only other thing was that the final paper was 80% of our grade, which can really make or break your grade. However, because we only had one long paper I can't think of any way this could be altered, other than giving participation more weight."

                "There wasn't a mutually agreed-upon way to jump into the conversation -- some students unmuted and started talking right away, while others waited to be called on. I think that clear expectations at the beginning of the semester of how conversation should be structured over Zoom would have been helpful.",

                "Yes, without hesitation. This is one of the best classes you'll take at Yale whether or not you're a history major.",
                "Yes! If you like history or just want to hear great stories, take it.",
                "Absolutely, but only if they are looking for a very specific type of class. Professor Merriman frequently takes up a lot of the class time with stories about France or other historians he knows, which I always found fascinating and fun, but if someone wants a class where the professor is laser-focused on the readings, this is not it. This class is basically a weekly book club (reading is a full book on Vichy France most weeks) with a 15-25 page paper at the end as the only assignment. Take the class for Merriman, stay for his wine suggestions.",
                "If you like history, even if you're not so sure about the topic of Vichy France, I would recommend this class just to have John as your professor! And if you want to learn a lot about France under the German occupation, definitely."
