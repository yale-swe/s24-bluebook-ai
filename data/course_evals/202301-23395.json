                "I learned so much from this course! How race has undergirded so much of medical technology, and technology in general; how racial categories function as a technology and has been constructed by technological artifacts; how to analyze various forms of writing, stories, and narratives about medicine and technology; and the history of race, medicine and technology. Professor Menon is also incredibly helpful in teaching how to write effectively and concisely, and how to make writing which uses sociological and STS concepts accessible to a general audience and an audience of peers. This is probably the first course I've taken at Yale that truly spoke to me and helped me understand why I'm studying sociology and health, and showed me an incredibly interesting emerging field of research that I want to engage with, and feel confident in my ability to engage with, for the rest of my academic career."

                "Professor Menon brings together race, medicine, and technology with perspectives from science and technology studies, feminist tech studies, history of medicine, and sociology in a way no one else is doing, and this is truly one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. It's well-structured, all the coursework is purposeful and an appropriate amount, and all the readings are engaging and Professor Menon encourages us to critically evaluate each one for strengths and weaknesses. The course and readings are organized well to build up to a final paper on an technological artifact of your choosing, and Professor Menon is so helpful in sharing her knowledge of medicine, race, and technology to help you build an idea for your final paper topic."

I found the topics and readings extremely interesting and love the way professor Menon created the course. A lot of it is student led which I found helped to keep the conversations flowing and engaging.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course! Professor Menon is wonderful, the course material is engaging (even if you're not a pure sociology major - it has broad crossover for pre-med, hard sciences, and comp sci, among other fields), and the workload was low enough to feel manageable. I wish more courses like this existed at Yale! This is a must-take for all sociology majors.",
                "Yes 100%! Any one interest in medicine, public health, ER&M, or the culture of technology should take this course, it's one of the best courses I've taken at Yale."
