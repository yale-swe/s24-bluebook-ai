                "This class was definitely a mixed bag. Some of the strengths of the class were the immersion aspect, which definitely strengthened my German writing and speaking skills. I also appreciated that the class was not as focused on test taking, and structured assessments in a way that made them feel low-stress.  Constantin was also very helpful in explaining some of the tricky aspects of German grammar. I also appreciated the flexibility with deadlines, and found that the instructors were generally very passionate about their work. \r\n\r\nThat being said, the class is entirely too much work. I would have appreciated if the class took a \"less is more\" approach, as the sheer amount of work assigned made it nearly impossible to keep up with what was going on. The asynchronous Wednesdays often took more than fifty minutes. I also received nearly no detailed feedback on my homework, which was delivered weeks after assignments were turned in. Grading often felt slightly harsh in a class where mistakes were supposed to be welcome."
