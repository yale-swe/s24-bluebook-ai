His enthusiasm for the material made classes incredibly engaging, and I appreciated that he prioritizes understanding over memorizing.  Opening each lecture with a clinical case study made us engage in critical thinking and I liked how he used this as a framework for understanding how human physiology functions.  The lecture slides are dense with information and very meticulously put together.  It's evident that Dr. Boulpaep put a lot of thought and effort into the way he structures his classes and presentations.",

                "I loved the course. Professor Boulpaep is a course strength!",
                "The course should change class time because it is hard to grasp the material early in the morning in a dry lecture. The class itself makes it hard to know what to focus on because the slides are so dense. Also, the font colors on the slides make it hard to see, so altering those may help. The pathways and diseases covered make sense and are important, but maybe more introduction to general physiology would be helpful.",
                "The contents are good, its easy to follow after the whole background was built up, but for each single lecture, the slides are the way too more for only 50 minutes."
