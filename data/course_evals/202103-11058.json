Developed a general curiosity for further work with telescopes and learning to navigate the sky.",

                "Strengths: great exposure to a variety of techniques in an actual observatory; had the chance to test, work, and make errors with actual data and equipment used by professional astronomers; fun way to spend some evenings throughout the semester, either learning in the planetarium or observing with one of the telescopes; rather low stakes and grading tends to be generous; one-of-a-kind opportunity for a college course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: instructor was often a bit inflexible with scheduling observation times and not entirely understanding of students' (busy) schedules; lab reports were not particularly useful, and all of the learning could have been conducted simply through observation, in-class sessions, and data analysis projects instead of lengthy write-ups.",
                "Strength: astronomy is naturally exciting, so it was always fantastic to learn about it. \r\nWeakness: For such a small class, Prof. Faison does not take the time or care to know his students. If you are merely interested in being in and out of the Observatory this is a great class.  If you are at all interested in forming ties with your professor, this is not the class for you. Additionally, the TFs rarely have a clear answer to questions or any answer at all.",
                "I liked this course a lot. It was exactly what I thought it was--a lab introducing some basic techniques of observational astronomy. I really enjoyed learning how cameras and telescopes worked and getting to use the equipment. One minor frustration was that the philosophy of the course was very much \"learn by doing\" and the teaching fellows and professor would withhold advice on observational design. While this never impacted grades or the like, and likely in the longer term is a nice way to learn, given that I am unlikely to take more observational astronomy courses, I often found myself wishing I could redo labs after learning what could have been improved and becoming more familiar with the software. This was not possible for time constraints on all ends. Overall, a minor problem, and not one without its own benefits, but I do wish I had gotten better data for many labs, less impeded by my own inexperience.",
                "Fantastic course, the complementary course to astronomy 210 or 220 which allows students to practice the overarching ideas and principles introduced to them in the former courses.",
                "Strengths were getting to observe up at the Leitner observatory, engaging lectures, and flexibility with the option of remote observing. It would have been great if the lectures were recorded since the class time was fairly difficult given the walk up the hill.",
                "Strengths - great opportunity for introducing astronomical observation techniques, the chance to independently select celestial objects and use the telescope at night to visualize them. Only assignments are quick pre-labs (5) and lab reports (6).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - time-consuming, especially for a half credit, as it involves an 1:50 lecture every week and a 2-hour observation every 1 or 2 weeks. Basics of astronomy were covered in a couple lectures but afterwards the material became somewhat hard to follow for non-astro majors; perhaps supplemental readings would have helped with this. The grading system of >=92% is an A and <92% is centered around a B is odd. I can't help but imagine a minority of students ending up below this cut-off, where the difference between a 91% and a 92% would distinguish an A from a B. Lab reports followed a strange format that ends with \"Results,\" and the criteria for what goes into \"Observations\" and \"Analysis\" were vague at times. Errors with this format and significant figures sometimes resulted in snarky and unnecessary comments from the professor on Canvas, which was rather discouraging for students taking this class out of interest. Grades came back without a rubric, so you never knew what made you lose how many points."

                "Yes! It's an amazing, once-in-a-lifetime experience to both learn and work in the observatory using actual telescopes and observing the night skyall the while earning a half-credit. The course exposes students to a number of techniques used in astronomy, including direct observation by eye, true-color imaging (think astrophotography), photometry, and spectroscopy. All of these are applied and used to develop a better understanding of the stars and other celestial objects; taking a course like ASTR 210 concurrently will help with understanding the material, as the labs don't necessarily dive too deep into the actual subject matter and content (more, the techniques and methods involved for gathering data to understand it all). As far as the workload and time commitment goes, it consists of six lab reports that must be submitted every other week or two, in addition to the in-person classes each Monday evening and the observation slots you must sign up for (with each lab, so six in total). These lab reports aren't too serious, but they do require you to spend some time analyzing data (usually, tutorials are given in both recorded and in-class format) and tediously writing. Overall, it's a great way to gain exposure to observational astronomy, especially for a student with absolutely no prior background. Would recommend the course to every student!",
                "Take it at your discretion! Concepts are interesting, but we do not spend much time of them. If you want to spend time crunching data, you will love this class! There is little support from the professor and the TFs so you will be largely on your own.",
                "I absolutely would recommend to anyone who wants to learn how to do observational astronomy. Having good data, image processing, and CS skills would definitely improve your experience (although I had none of those and still had a great time). Do not take the course if you want to learn a lot about stars, constellations, or the universe, as there are definitely more informative courses on the theory. This course is very much a technical one, so if you want to learn how to do spectroscopy, photometry, and take/edit images of stellar phenomena while figuring out how telescopes and cameras work, this is definitely the course for you. (I'll add I had essentially zero experience/familiarity in any of these subjects before the course, so no need to know anything much in advance as long as you work hard, pay attention, and show up for observation.)",
                "I would if operation of a telescope is something that has always been of great interest to you.",
                "Yes, even if they're not an astro major (but enjoy or want to practice coding/astro image processing).",
                "Absolutely! Would recommend this course to anyone regardless of major. A wonderful course for anyone with an interest in astronomy.",
                "For astro majors or students with comfortable background in the field, yes. For people taking it as an elective, be wary of some material that is a bit over your head, especially considering the time investment."
