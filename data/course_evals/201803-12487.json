    "I learned about poverty alleviation strategies and to think about political considerations before proposing initiatives. Furthermore, I got a better sense of how hard solving poverty is.",
    "Topics covered included poverty and different strategies for addressing it, welfare states and their formation, the relationship between democracy\/electoral incentives and antipoverty policy success. Classes involved reading research papers, discussion, drafting and presenting policy memos.",
    "Got the opportunity to read an organized, compiled syllabus of the most important foundational texts in development. Had some time set aside to chat about them.",
    "Welfare policy in Latin America and Africa",
    "I was able to learn about poverty alleviation strategies all over the world, how different economic and political structures are perceived by varying cultures and learned how to effectively read a political science paper.",
    "Discussing and critiquing studies in economics and political science related to poverty alleviation; policy research and presentation.",

   "comments": [
    "Readings and discussion were great. I would have preferred to not have a group project and instead to have come up with a poverty alleviation proposal independently.",
    "A big chunk of the class was done in groups and involved presentations. In general, I feel like group work is not a good idea unless members are held accountable individually as well because it usually means that labor is unequally distributed; the past semester I often had to put together the memo and powerpoint for our entire group at the last moment because no one else was doing the work or could be found. I also felt that presentations were not a good use of class time. In-class discussion could have been brought more into depth; instead it often stayed surface-level as an overview of the reading.",
    "Great readings. Discussions could definitely be a bit more high-level -- rather than re-hashing the readings, would much rather take time to analyze them.",
    "Great professor",
    "Strengths: Great in depth research into poverty alleviation in various countries\r\nWeakness: Could provide more economic background for some students who weren't directly in economic studies.",
    "The readings were varied and interesting. Class discussion reinforced the understanding of the readings and topics. The presentations and final paper allowed opportunities to engage with specific topics of interest.\r\n\r\nHowever, class discussion tended to summarize the reading and there was sometimes a disconnect between the skills taught from the reading and clas, and the skills evaluated in presentations and the final paper. Concrete feedback on performance was slightly lacking.",
    "The seminars were basically recaps of the readings that we were required to do",
    "Covers a good range of topics and has interesting readings. The assignments on a specific country gives us greater insight on actual policies and programs."

   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you're interested in learning about poverty and welfare but have little background knowledge. If you already know quite a bit about basic development econ - ex. different measures of poverty, read some studies by Duflo & Banerjee etc - then the areas covered in this class could be repetitive. I was very excited to take it originally because of the great course reviews from the past, but it's really an average seminar from which I didn't gain any life-changing revelations nor much new knowledge. I could have read the papers on the syllabus by myself and learned just as much.",
    "Yes -- Prof De La O is nice, the readings are good, and the discussions aren't actively bad, though they could be better. Take it for a structured tour of development.",
    "Sure",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is proficient in basic economics and someone who is willing to question the current research into poverty reduction strategies. I think this course provides a good holistic understanding and helps me now see why some countries are better than others in poverty alleviation.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in engaging with a variety of perspectives evaluating poverty alleviation programs and policies.",
    "Only if a student were interested in these fields",
    "Yes if you're interested in poverty alleviation"
