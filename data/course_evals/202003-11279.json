Most of the weeks are very manageable for reading and workload, but a few of the weeks on politics do get bogged down in the density of the material.  Still, the class is really able to come out of that and Karolina does a fantastic job of balancing  keeping track of the many moving pieces of the picture with letting some of the details fly by to work towards a deeper understanding of the themes and dynamics. The class is incredibly laid out balancing politics with culture, and really nearly perfect the way it is."

                "YES!! It's a difficult course so if you don't have a good bit of energy to put into it, be warned. But it's also incredibly rewarding and might be the single course where I have learned the most at Yale. The topic is so fascinating and so important yet underrated in history (the Holocaust itself receiving, understandably, much more attention) and absolutely one that more people should learn. The readings can be dense, but they're all fascinating (and some even fun!).  An excellent, excellent course. Take it."
