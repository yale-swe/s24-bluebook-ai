                "This course is a wonderful balance of writing technique and info about the publishing industry! My only complaint was that it wasn't longerit made Mondays the highlight of my week.",
                "Strengths: opportunity to learn about craft and the industry, guest speakers, the textbook, knowledgable professor, professor's willingness to review drafts and meet with students, in-class creative writing exercises\r\nWeaknesses: Grading seemed somewhat arbitrary, I also feel like we could have done more with the books we read either for assignments or in class",
                "This course was great! For someone like me who usually has written academic papers, the change to creative writing is actually quite relaxing and uses a different part of the brain. I don't have any major complaints!",
                "Strengths- I loved how the class felt like a close-knit writers circle where we were able to freely share our thoughts and ask questions without judgment. I loved how creative we were allowed to be and how we got to develop our very own novel idea!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- It felt a little disorganized at times.",
                "We occasionally did in class writing exercises and had nice opportunities to volunteer to share what we wrote and to learn other people's style of writing. There was a diverse class with different styles and experiences in writing.",
                "Sometimes I felt a bit lost on how to improve.",
                "The course was also well-structured and paced very well. Assignments were carefully chosen and very meaningful, so it never felt like we were given busy work. Also, Prof. Friedland brings in very interesting speakers and it was fascinating to learn about the book industry from them. \r\n\r\nI wish that the course pushed us to write more of our own novel. For our midterm, we wrote a chapter for one of the books we were reading and for the final, we wrote a chapter of our own novel. I found the final to be incredibly meaningful and wished that we could have spent more time on it. Perhaps it would have been nice if some of our homework assignments were to write a first chapter of our novel, second chapter of our novel, etc.",
                "Strengths: I loved how we had weekly writing assignments that allowed us to practice the strategies that we learned each week. I think there was a good pace of books that we read and a good selection that was very diverse and allowed us to look at different styles of writing to learn from. I also really enjoyed all of the speakers that the professor brought in and how we focused on both the writing process and the publishing industry.\r\nWeaknesses: I think that maybe we could have had a writing partner earlier on and have more time taken during class for us to meet with each other, but no big weaknesses.",
                "Strengths - insightful professor with helpful criticism and encouragement + first-hand knowledge and insight with the novel writing industry, guest speakers including authors, agents, publishers. sense of community among an academically diverse group of aspiring writers, individual and group work. Relatively light reading load for a writing class (3 mid-sized novels)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - probably could have used 1 or 2 more longer writing assignments (as opposed to a double-spaced 12-15 page midterm and 20-25 page final), but Professor Friedland seems to really want us to enjoy the class and not stress at the workload. Overall very solid!"

This course provided some of the more practical writing strategies I could apply to my writing, compared to other creative writing classes at Yale. Professor Friedland is also very generous with her time and willingness to help",

Professor Friedland brought in a lot of guest speakers including authors and people in the book selling industry to give new insights and perspectives on the writing process and industry. This was a class for all levels including intro although the make up of the class does have very strong writers which at times make you feel like everyone is more experienced than you. The class is a nice chance to practice your writing, find your style through experimentation with different POVs and genres, and learn more about writing and the industry. I was not a big fan of Goon Squad, but I did enjoy the other books. Would recommend.",

                "Yes, what a fun class! I thought it was a really supportive environment and not stressful at all, which creative writing can sometimes be. The speakers were amazing too, including pulitzer prize winner Andrew Sean Greer, and the professor always makes herself available and has really helpful feedback.",
