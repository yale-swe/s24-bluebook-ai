                "I learned to handle uncertainties and process lab data in a much more rigorous way than what I learned in high school. I also learned LaTeX basics (it wasn't required, but my TA Ryan Hamilton made us a template to write up our lab reports nicely).",
                "I learned error propagation, which I never understood until this course. I also learned about circuits, power sources, oscilloscopes, spectroscopy, and torsional oscillators.",

                "I developed skills in designing, conducting, and recording physics experiments. These experiments are more diverse and extensive than the ones I've done before (e.g. the experiment with optics) and has given me access to a wide range of experimental methods used in physics (quite a good survey course of experiments). The support and materials given in the course assists me in learning how to conduct these experiments quite well. For instance, the explanations of why we do various things in our procedure by our TA and in the files given to us were very helpful. Aside from conducting these experiments, this course also taught me how to better record the experiment in lab reports. The format of starting with questions to answer (thus teaching us what to look out for and record in future experiments), then allowing us to write full-length lab reports was quite helpful. Especially, the part about recording and calculating uncertainties was especially useful.",

                "Strengths: interesting experiments. Great breadth of experiments and topics.\r\nWeaknesses: grading was sometimes arbitrary. The tortional oscillator is not the most engaging final project. Although focussing on one thing for many sessions was valuable.",
                "It's a fine course.",
                "Strengths: I thought the experiment guides were pretty helpful and the Pre-Labs sometimes prepared us well for the lab itself. The TA, Ryan Hamilton was the highlight of this course for me -- he was incredibly helpful and was always happy to clear up any confusions we had. \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the labs, especially one of the optics ones, were super long and required students to stay behind after the 3 hours, which is not possible for people who might have work afterwards. The prelabs could prepare the students a little bit better.",
                "The course gives you great exposure to a range of equipment, and the course smoothly ramped up from simple measurements to more difficult investigations, as it should.",
                "The course was rather laid back while also teaching crucial skills for physics experiments. The pre-labs were informative and the discussion questions helped us understand more about the experiments. And the experiments were really fun. I think some of the discussion questions could have extended further, and i wish we had done more things with optics.",
                "strengths: i really liked my TA morgan, she was super funny and patient with all my questions. class is good vibes i liked going to hang out w/ her and my lab group they were fun. also some of the labs were not necessarily super informative but at least pretty cool. i think my problem is im not super interested in experimental physics so wasn't thrilled by this class. \r\nweakness: the closest thing to a weakness is im not sure i learned anything but that's bc the curriculum was intro and I took it after the intro physics sequence. given this, though, i wouldn't really want them to change anything/make things harder, i think that would be unfair to the freshman majority who take this class",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Goes through a lot of different experiments thus giving a good survey of topics one might deal with in experimental physics\r\n- Provides a lot of support in the files and during the experiment (such as how to format lab reports)\r\n- Is thus overall a kind introductory course to doing physics experiments\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Might be too much hand-holding (e.g. lab reports doesn't have to be almost all answering questions)\r\n- May leave less space for students to explore, design, and experiment themselves, because the experiments become given tasks instead\r\n- Are overall more simple and slightly less interesting topics (again, a balance has to be found as well)\r\nHow to improve:\r\n- Can start letting students write lab reports earlier, or ask more open-ended questions\r\n- Can let students brainstorm how to design the experiment more before handing them the safest procedure\r\n- Can pack less tasks into the classes and may be more free time and free equipment for students to explore more",
                "Many times, I found myself unable to understand the purpose/goal of the experiment because there isn't much information given about the physical concepts we are dealing with. I think either giving the class prereqs which cover those topics or resources to teach them directly would've been helpful."

                "Yes, I would. If the student has to take a physics lab I think 205 is much better than 165, especially after the restructuring it went through last year. It is mostly a low workload course. There is only a short PreLab and questions from the previous lab (most of which you answer during the lab itself) to submit before your next lab.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it is a great practical way to exercise the knowledge you gain from a theoretical physics class. It's like the formulas and laws come to life!",
                "Totally. I hear pretty frequently that lab classes are way more work than their 0.5 credit value suggests, but this one, at least for me, felt really light. My experience in this class helped me better understand how there is more behind the simpler physics concepts that I learned about in high school that meets the eye.",
                "Yes. This is a great physics lab, and from what I hear is better organized than the lower level intro physics lab. You do not have to know python for it (though I knew python coming in). You get to work with radioactive materials. You get to do spectroscopy on a mercury lamp. You get to do astronomy on a table. You get to work with oscilloscopes. If those sentences sound exciting, take the course. If you have any interest in experimental physics you should take it. \r\n\r\nMany people warned me not to take this course as a first year my first semester and to wait until my second semester. I honestly feel like there was minimal work outside of class while also imparting very useful lab skills, and it was a perfect first year fall semester course.",
                "sure for the major. shop around if you have the  option to take it a different daythe class size, TA, and lab partners make all the difference, not quality of course",
                "Incredibly interesting class with hands-on experiments, one of the most engaging classes I had",
                "I think you have to take this course to become a physics major, but otherwise, I don't think this course is necessary unless you're looking for an introductory course to doing physics experiments that really starts from the basics.",
                "Yes, but I'd warn them about the barriers to understanding. It felt like there was a lot of unnecessary work on the end of the students to catch up in understanding before being able to perform the experiments."
