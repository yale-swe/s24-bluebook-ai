Learned a ton of foundational statistics, from the basics \"what is a Random Variable\" to \"how do you run a Markov Chain Monte Carlo to determine the average blood pressure of male and female martians.\" In the middle there was a good amount of other things: a bunch of useful distributions, how to take expectations, etc. And of course, Bayes rule.

Every week I would find myself a bit stressed whenever a PSET would be uploaded because I would take a first glance and think to myself, \"how am i supposed to do ANY of this?\" -- like it really looked like gibberish. Then, over the week everything would come together and i'd be quite impressed with how much we would learn. This class takes a bayesian approach which I was introduced to in S&DS 355 (intro to ML, fall 2020) when we covered topic models but I frankly never quite understood what was going on (and somehow got by lol). In S&DS 238 there is NO escaping understanding bayesian statistics -- you live and breath it every pset. Could not be happier to leave this course having finally understood the power of bayesian stats while also covering the more boring stats material you'd get in S&DS 241",

                "The strength is the professor Joe Chang, I'd say, who goes above and beyond to make sure that everyone is learning, from giving us extensions when needed to answering questions on Ed Discussion into the late hours. The other strength is course material: I went from being essentially illiterate in statistics to having a working understanding of a lot of core concepts. This class definitely demands a lot from students. It probably shouldn't have been my 3rd hardest class of the semester; it was too hard of a class to constantly be fighting for my attention. But overall, I had a very positive experience with it.",
                "Help me understand a lot about Bayesian!",
                "The course is designed to provide a strong overview of the fields of probability and statistics from a Bayesian perspective. As such, it can feel a bit disorganized or chaotic at points, and by necessity you won't be able to digest each topic as long as you might like. However, that's kinda the point of the course, it provides enough knowledge to have a broad understanding of the field and be able to decide which directions one should go in for your particular interests.",
                "The material is very important, and seems to be used everywhere today. However, I feel like a lot of the examples from the course were convoluted, and it might have been nice to have a formal textbook with some more clear examples.",
                "Strengths: Professor Chang!! One of the most caring professors I have had at this dang school and I'm saying this a senior graduating in December 2021. His Thursday office hours were incredibly helpful in teaching me how to problem solve. I used to read a problem and freak out because I didn't know how to do it, resulting in me reaching out for help without really having thought deeply about the problem. Something Prof. Chang imparted on me is to take a step back and actually THINK about the problem, which resulted in me feeling much more fulfilled after seeking help and completing the assignments. He is also quite simply a GOOD TEACHER (which can be hard to find especially in yale intro STEM classes!!!). His way of breaking down the concepts made someone like me without any exposure to probability theory feel like the material was within my grasp of understanding, even though it was almost always quite challenging. I genuinely can't think of any weaknesses, very happy I took this during my last semester at yale",
                "Strenghts: Prof Chang is an amazing professor who explained the content really well and is also the most thoughtful professor Ive had here (hes also very funny). This is also the most organized course Ive ever taken, and its extremely easy to find the material youre looking for - you can literally control F a keyword on canvas and youll find the corresponding slides, video, code, date, etc. The class also never tried to trick us, and even in the final there were hints to make sure we were not steering off course. Overall, unlike many STEM courses, Prof Chang makes sure this is a course built for learning, not weeding out, competition, or other academic hazing rituals.\r\n\r\nI dont see any weaknesses with this course",
                "Strengths: we covered a lot of topics (with interesting applications) and the textbook was well-written. Lectures were pretty well structured and the course was relatively well organized (all the slides & R files were posted before/right after lecture for that day). Also this is specific to the classroom but I really liked that it was a classroom setting with round tables (it was super conducive to working together in class). Weaknesses: coming from MATH 230/231, I wished there was a little more rigor in the proofs/more incentive to prove things ourselves. There were a lot of proofs we went over in class that seemed really confusing/icky and we never talked about them again.",
                "Strengths: Covers a wide array of statistics topics, is well-organized, and had clear lecture notes\r\nWeaknesses: Personally found lectures too slow to follow and the level of mathematical rigor to be underwhelming",
                "The breadth of topics weve covered was certainly a strength. Anyone, regardless of their statistics background, can leave this class with the capability to both understand and perform the statistical tests gaining traction in current research. We do tend to move quickly in lecture, which did require me to look back to the powerpoint slides and notes to really gain the most from them. Pset questions were also very challenging but a great way to really test our understanding of the weeks topics.",
                "The course was fast paced and we covered a lot of new material. There was not always a lot of synthesis between units, but if you reviewed your notes and stayed on track with the material it was totally manageable",
                "This is a fantastic course that gives a robust introduction to statistics and probability. The lectures are clear and thorough and the course reader is a very good supplement to in-class material. In terms of material and delivery, there is little that needs improvement. \r\n\r\nHowever, the course could have been better organized. The file system on Canvas was very difficult to navigate. The files were dated YYMMDD, which made it difficult to quickly find slides from a specific day. Why not label the files DDMMYY for ease of identifying lectures? Furthermore, it would be have been really helpful to make better use of the sub-folders (problem sets, problem set solutions, lecture slides, R code, etc.). \r\n\r\nAlso, setting 11:59pm on Friday as the weekly problem set due date is really unhealthy; no student should be doing homework on a Friday night. Perhaps consider a 6pm deadline next semester to encourage better work/life balance. Also, a take-home exam and an in-class exam from the final is overkill. Why not just assign a take-home exam that has 2 computational (e.g. R based) questions and 3-4 content questions? This would take a lot of pressure off of students in the final weeks of the semester, allowing them to better demonstrate their mastery of the material.",
                "well organized\r\nbut very difficult homework",
                "Strengths: lots of material to study from (recordings, pdf doc, unofficial textbook). The recordings were especially handy and I hope that practice continues.\r\nWeaknesses: not enough office hours, slow grading/incomplete grading, poor communication from the prof and teaching staff (for example, did not tell us what day the take home exam would be until a few days before)",
                "Great teaching from the instructors and the TFs (Andrew Yoon, an ULA, was especially incredible at explaining concepts!!). It was helpful when Chang compared Bayesian ways of approaching things to other traditional statistics approaches (i.e. t-tests, hypothesis testing). I learned a lot but there was a lot of new material and honestly I wish it were more socially acceptable to take this course a couple more times, as then I think I would really understand the details of this foundational material.",
                "Strengths: Useful and intuitive guidence through though mathematical material\r\nWeakness: Slides not ready before class and problem sets way to long for its weight of the final grade",
                "The problem sets were very challenging, which was good as they helped drive home the material. The lectures were sometimes a little disorganized and confusing, but I'm not sure if that was because of the lectures themselves or the layout of the room. We were in the TEAL room in Hillhouse 117, and so from many seats you couldn't even see the professor when he was talking. I think the course would have been better in a traditional lecture hall.",
                "Excellent Course. Really interesting new way to think about  statistics. The lectures were fantastic (super clear).",
                "Strengths: understanding and solving problems from two perspectives -- math and simulation\r\nWeaknesses: it will be better if the methods can be integrated with applications in social science.",
                "Strengths of this course are the powerful results we learn how to achieve. Weaknesses are the lack of continuity between material at the beginning and end and the lack of individual attention. Many of my questions on Ed discussion were ignored by the TAs.",
                "love the course and the lecturer",
                "The course had many office hours for each of its teaching fellows to allow for maximum student-teacher interaction for work.",
                "This course provides a good blend of topics so students have a flexible foundation. However, I feel like the course moved too quickly through some topics, which made it difficult to keep up.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Second half of course (computation and statistics) is much easier than first half (probability).\r\n- Practice exams are very helpful.\r\n- While very difficult if no prior experience, course is soooo helpful (I have a great basis in all three areas of the class).\r\n- Class resources are well organized (slides, Prof. Chang's notes, R code).\r\n- Exams are tough, but fair.\r\n- PSETs graded relatively quickly.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- First few weeks are very rough if you (a) have no experience with coding (specifically, R), and/or (b) probability. I felt left out of the loop.\r\n- Office hours are completely online. I found that platform to have its limits in terms of (a) meeting other students and (b) getting help on PSETs.",
                "The instructor explain the concepts in an accessible and funny way, making the lectures enjoyable.",
                "Strengths: Good intro to R, and definitely feel like you can do some good Bayesian statistics by the end.\r\nWeaknesses: No connection to teacher, first-half material is super boring.",
                "I really like the material covered in the course. The course taught me a lot and was not too easy and not too difficult. The problem sets made me think hard but were not impossible to do."

                "I'd highly recommend this course, IFF you've got a strong mathematical/computing background. I came in knowing a lot of CS, a good amount of CS, and no statistics, and I found the class challenging but manageable. If the computing had been harder or the math more foreign, I would probably have drowned with the amount of new concepts thrown at me throughout the class. So I think this class is designed for a very specific profile. If you are competent at coding, and know math, and don't know a ton of stats -- this is a great class, you'll get a ton out of it. Otherwise, tread lightly, as it starts slow but ramps up quite fast.",
                "Definitely YES!! You can have an overview of Bayesian and MCMC, which can be very helpful in any case.",

                "Yes! Definitely a lot of work in the class but eventually worth it",
                "Yes, definitely learned a lot of stats and probability, vs maybe like 241 which didn't cover R or markov chains (they're really cool tbh)",
                "I would recommend this to someone who is really interested in statistics.",
                "Yes yes yes. You hit on advanced topics not taught in any other intro level stats class at yale",
                "Absolutely if you have any interest in probability, modeling, or want to get applicable skills in stats",
                "I thought it was a well-organized course and I definitely learned a lot of interesting (and applicable) content for a low-ish/moderate amount of effort. I would caution though that some things were not super explained in class and I had to figure them out myself/with friends/from the textbook, so I would especially warn people with weaker math backgrounds to be prepared to put in some effort to learn and understand things outside of class. We also learned R as we went along, and did most psets in R, so it's definitely useful to have some coding background (but not necessary!).",
                "Yes and No. If you have a strong mathematical or computational background I highly recommend this class; however, if you are looking for an introductory statistics class I am not sure if this is the class for you. Personally, as someone with a stronger math and computational background, I found the class cover a wide array of interesting and relevant topics. On the other hand, for some of my friends with less experience coding the learning curve to adjust to using R made the class difficult and hard to follow/\r\n\r\ntl;dr if you have a strong math background this is a chill class to learn some cool stuff but if you are a little less familiar with math and coding this class is still a good class but you should be ready for a heftier workload",
                "Only if you have a deep interest in the subject matter or will definitely be using it in the future. Even though Professor Changs take on the content makes it quite engaging, the course is extremely dense. All of the topic we cover take quite a bit of time to understand requiring some thought outside of the classroom. If you dont have a personal interest in the course, I imagine this experience would be quite draining.",
                "This is the most challenging course I have taken at Yale. We had nine psets that each took 6-10 hours, two tough exams, and a take-home exam. My other classes were relatively easy so I was able to focus on this one and did reasonably well. I had other friends who took multiple tough classes and really struggled to balance them with this one. Don't take this course during a difficult semester. I 100% recommend it though. I learned way more than I thought I would - both in the theory behind a lot of statistical concepts as well as Bayesian computational tools that I will probably use in the future in place of less powerful techniques like t-tests and ANOVA.",
                "Yes, this is a fantastic crash-course in probability and statistics which would prepare for more applied course work using statistical methods.",
                "yes you can learn a lot",
                "If youre deciding between S&DS 241 and 238, I would recommend 238. The computational portion of the course is just much more practical for future work/research/employment. However, this class is pretty much just as time consuming, so its your preference if you think youd do better at proofs (in which case take 241). Overall I really did not like this class and felt it had a lot of issues, but you cant do much when its required.",
                "Definitely! Challenging though very empowering and interesting.",

I would not recommend this course to a first-year or someone looking for an advanced statistics introduction, as I was. Bayesian statistics is VERY different from AP or other intro courses, so it's definitely on its own path and not worth learning if you just want an intro.",
