                "The material is very intense and that can be a good thing. You will definitely learn a lot. However the class does not make it easier for you to learn. While the lectures are good, the class does not follow a book. So once you don't understand something in class, you're done. The syllabus was way too ambitious and we did not cover even close to all the topics mentioned there. Furthermore the class is a little bit of an improvisation so the number of assignments changed mid-way. I think Goncharov is a big strength of the class. He is very welcoming to questions and tries to get the students involved as much as possible. However, do not expect Goncharov's style to be as structured as some of the other professors. This can be a good thing or a bad thing. Depends on you.",
                "Strengths: content is very interesting, problem sets are good to help you learn. \r\nWeaknesses: slightly disorganized and the motivation is unclear at times. Goncharov goes a bit quickly at times",
                "It would be very convenient if short descriptions of the lectures were posted on Canvas after each lecture. This way keeping track of the course as well as catching up with missed lectures would be much easier.",
                "Strengths - you will learn algebraic number theory\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - you will not understand algebraic number theory until right before you take the final",
                "Goncharov is a very kind profesor who wants the students to understand and learn the material.  Psets are not easy, but they are reasonable tests of class material and extensions of the ideas from lecture.  Parts of the course seem to require material from 380 commutative algebra - I probably recommend that students take that class before or concurrently.",
                "This course had a lot of weaknesses, beginning with the fact that the material was just insanely hard. In a typical math class, you get some time to process each new lesson, and there are TAs and ULAs to help facilitate that digestion of the material. In this class, which had easily the most abstract and confusing material of any math class I have taken (and will ever take), there was no TA, no ULA, and the professor didn't even host office hours. As a result of this, the entire class felt lost for basically the entire semester, and it felt more like a fight to keep our heads above water than a class where we actually learned and developed skills and intuition.\r\n\r\nThis course needs a TA. We needed to have some way to get help on the incredibly hard psets, or even just a place to discuss the material outside of lecture to gain insight."

            "comments": [
                "Depends. If your background is not very solid, stay away from this class. Goncharov likes to connect different fields of math when he lectures so you may be lost if you're not a very solid math major. Topics that were used in discussions (though did not appear on exams) but were not listed as prerequisites were topology (usual stuff like product topology, fundamental groups, covering spaces), tensor products of modules (they were crucial in some of the things done in problem sets), gamma function, Riemann surfaces (none of the undergrads when I took the class knew Riemann surfaces), etc. In the past I think Goncharov has discussed hyperbolic geometry in relation to NT. If you know all of these things and want to challenge yourself, take the class. I have taken a lot of advanced/grad math classes but this has been by far the most difficult one for me. The material is challenging.",
                "Yes, if you are prepared for a challenge and want to learn a lot, or if you already happen to know a lot of prerequisite material including, but not limited to:\r\nCommutative algebra and tensor products of modules, category theory, exterior algebra, differential forms",
                "The content of this course is very challenging, but if you have the time and energy for the work, you will learn SO MUCH. Professor Goncharov cares a lot about individual students' understanding and loves when students ask questions (no matter how surface-level). If you show him you're engaged, he will regularly check in throughout lecture to make sure you're following. The pace of the course is also adjusted based on the class' needs. This class will not be spoon-fed to you; if you have questions (and you will!), you need to speak up. However, if you reach out, Prof. Goncharov will be available; he replies quickly to emails and always stays after class to answer more questions. If you put the necessary time and energy into studying each concept, you will come out of this class a much stronger mathematician. Note that while basic Galois theory is the only official prereq, I wouldn't recommend this class to someone who hasn't experienced some upper-level math courses (e.g. Math 315), as it's quite rigorous. Since it's a graduate course, there won't be a TA to help you, so you need to be comfortable muscling through difficult concepts on your own.",
                "Only take this course if you are interested in the subject and have a strong background in: Galois theory, modern algebra (350 alone was not enough, need tensor products, Noetherian, etc), maybe some topology or complex analysis. You will have to learn a lot on your own, because Goncharovs lectures are very fast paced. I would recommend reading after each lecture, otherwise you will be lost.",
                "Absolutely. Its excellent and the material is super interesting.",
                "If the student is willing to commit substantial time outside of class both to psets and to reviewing the stuff from lecture, then yes.  He can move pretty fast in class.  Always ask questions if you have them (he's always appreciative and knows other people wonder the same things), but also there may be times when it's not yet clear to you exactly why/where you are confused.  That's ok as long as you handle it within a reaonable time frame since much of the material is cumulative.  Study with friends.  If you can get a handle on it all, the material is very cool.  Also, you can get by with just 370, but it's very nice to have 380 (concurrently is fine) or even perhaps 310/315 if he covers zeta functions (which he didn't have time to this semester).",
                "I would not. Aside from the problems I mentioned above, the class as a whole felt disorganized. In other math classes, the professor will try to give you an outline of why you're learning what you're learning, and how new material all builds on previous material. In this class, it just felt like we sat there for an hour and got lost in an absolute whirlwind of definitions with no direction. In fact, even though I attended every lecture and completed every problem set, I don't think I could really tell you exactly what I learned in this class. We certainly learned about a lot of concepts independently, but I do not see how it all fit together, nor do I see how it is all relevant.\r\n\r\nThe other issue with this class was the teaching. It felt like the professor just glazed over issues, and while he asked if we had any questions, we were actually so lost that we didn't even know what questions to ask. The course as a whole was confusing, frustrating, and unenjoyable. The worst part about this is that I didn't need to take this course, but I wanted to. I really wanted to learn this material, but this course made me never want to touch number theory again; in fact, I would even venture to say it killed some of my love for math. Before, I was always really excited to go to class and get lost in the beautiful abstractions of math, but now I just want to finish the major and never think about algebra again."
