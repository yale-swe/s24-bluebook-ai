    "By reading the textbook and by interacting with the TAs I learned the basics of German.",
    "I learned about German grammar and developed a high-register, academic passive vocabulary.",
    "I learned about the grammatical structures of German, which helped me read German academic texts effectively.",
    "I developed a thorough, nuanced understanding of German grammar; at the end of the course, I am able to make my way through reasonably sophisticated German-language materials, with dictionary as needed.  I was able to build on my previous knowledge of the language during this course: the vocabulary presented in the textbook, which was always glossed in the lectures, helped me to develop strategies to memorize, or at least digest, a great deal of content in a timely manner.",
    "German reading and translation. Also how to use dictionaries.",
    "German grammar (reading)\r\n- German grammar has very sophisticated verb conjugations which require lots of review and practice.",
    "reading knowledge of german",
    "I started with virtually zero knowledge of German and the course exceeded by far my expectations. The online course, highly structured yet somewhat flexible, allowed me to develop important reding skills and to translate, with the help of a dictionary, relatively difficult texts.",
    "I can recognize German words, detect the word order in a German sentence, and recognize the tense most of the time. For example, I was capable of understanding a couple of German book titles in a bibliography without using a dictionary last week.",
    "By taking this course, I ultimately accomplished what I set out do when I enrolled in the first place: I feel that my reading skills in German greatly improved during the brief period that the class was in session. I have a much more intuitive understanding of the way phrases in German are constructed, and am well on my way to developing an efficient approach to translation.",
    "I was able to read journal articles in my field with help from a dictionary by the end of the course",
    "Extensive knowledge of German grammar and syntax. My vocabulary has also grown significantly.",
    "Basic proficiency in German, and a sense of how the rhythm of the language works differently to English.",
    "l gained an improved understanding of German grammar, syntax and vocabulary and developed new skills for reading unseen German academic texts. The course provided me with a broad range of new tools to analyse and interpret complex German material without being fluent in German, which is immensely useful in my field. The course has also given me more confidence in approaching German texts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The TAs! Both of them were very generous and hardworking. I learned a lot from them. The textbook is very good too, although some texts are somewhat ethnocentric and even problematic.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the instructor and her lack of empathy. This is the first time at Yale that I come across such an insensitive and unfair instructor. Although I had many pleasant and efficient interactions with her, one sufficed to destroy my whole experience in this course. The materials and activities offered were useful. However, it is my believe that much more preparation is needed for a good asynchronous course.",
    "I would have liked more quizzes on grammar (specifically on different tenses, and especially on passive constructions). It would have also been good to have more frequent vocabulary quizzes.",
    "Strengths were the intensive focus provided by the summer session. \r\n\r\nThe video recordings of lessons were the most helpful tool. They were rather short though, ranging from 10-20 minutes a day, so I felt at times like I was having to teach myself the material. The class could be improved through longer recording video sessions. \r\n\r\nI strongly suggest recommending another textbook, or finding a cheaper option. The book ended up costing me $137 to order from Amazon, which is by far the most expensive book I have purchased for a class. Making an electronic PDF available to the class would be ideal.",
    "I felt that the course focused too heavily on translation, as the graders were incredibly scrupulous about exact word choice in translations. Too much attention was put in making students translate German texts into English, and not enough attention was put into helping students read and understand advanced German texts.",
    "The strengths of the course include: a well-selected textbook and concisely presented lectures. I certainly consider this course a successful one in that it reaches its aim of developing students' ability to read German. \r\nOne drawback to the course is its timeline: had I even one more week, I feel as though I would have been able to better internalize the material. The pace of the course was sometimes difficult for me to meet, as I work almost full-time. This is not a weakness inherent in the course, but a corollary arising from the speed of the course.",
    "Online with flexible due dates. I wished that the midterm was done after Chapter 15.",
    "The course had a lot of homework and it was very fast-paced (Expected), but learning all the material is just very challenging.",
    "strengths: asynchronous format, quick turn around time for comments on assignments\r\n\r\nweaknesses: occasionally unclear instructions for assignments (ex: how long video posts should be), the types of questions that would be on the midterm were unclear (it was called a \"grammar quiz\" but also had multiple longer passages and vocabulary)",
    "The course's main stregth is its modular and organized structure, which makes it possible to squeeze in a few weeks many grammar points and to advance quickly.\r\n\r\nIt weakness is that the deadline of the two final translations coincided with the one for the last five chapters of the textbook. I feel that it would have been better to have a couple of days after finishing the textbook to focus just on the final translations.",
    "I think that the course is really good, however, I feel that the intensity of the assignments and homeworks prevents students from sitting with the material and internalizing the Grammar better. I have observed this phenomenon in all the language courses I have partcipated in or visited throughout my time as a graduate student at Yale. This makes me believe it is an institutional policy which Yale needs to revise along with its pedagogical philosophy when it comes to language learning.  The university should realize that the demographics at GSAS have changed and that there are more people like myself who try to balance Graduate school and parenting while also fighting a chronic illness, therefore expecting us to dedicate five or six hours each day for a language course sets unrealistic expectations. I would not have complained if I think that this is the only way for one to learn a language, in fact, I have majored in modern languages as an undergrad and I am proficient in a number of languages other than my native tongue. Therefore, based on my previous experiences learning foreign languages I can confidently say that I do not believe that the way language is taught at this institution is geared towards achieving optimal pedagogical outcomes and sincerely think that similar if not better outcomes can be achieved through courses that do not stress or burden students as much. This criticism is not directed at this particular course- which was relatively good- but at the institution and how it is choosing to conduct language courses that seem to ignore the diversity within the student body as well as privilege certain groups over others.",
    "I think the format of German for Reading worked incredibly well: I learned a lot, despite the fact that I typically absorb information better when conversing with groups of people in person. However, I sometimes wished there was a greater variety of assignments. The typical routine of sentence, then full text translations did not always feel sufficient as the grammar concepts to which we were introduced became more complex.",
    "My only complaint about the course were the weekly video assignments in which we were supposed to upload videos of ourselves answering questions about that week's material. I don't see any reason that we could not have just uploaded written replies to a Canvas discussion instead of recording a video. Other than that, I was very pleased with the course and was surprised by how much my German reading comprehension improved.",
    "The course was very well designed and organized, and the instructor as well as the TFs were engaged and effective teachers. The textbook was excellent and well-structured, with easy to follow assignments that gradually built up skills and knowledge. My only recommendation for improvement is to make the video presentations more engaging - they generally repeated the material in the textbook, which was useful, but harder to engage with having just read the same material. More interactive online content (e.g. non-graded fun quizzes) or additional insights in the video presentations would have made an excellent course even better."

   "comments": [
    "I am not going to recommend this course to another student. I should have listened to a friend of mine who was reluctant to recommend it to me. I am almost regretting having taken this course. If you are disciplined enough, I think it would suffice to go through the textbook, do the exercises, and save yourself the bad experiences. Also, the syllabus did not state fundamental course policies. The decisions of the instructor did not adjust to the present situation.",
    "Yes, it was helpful to do concerted language study in the summer. \r\n(I took French for Reading in the Fall, for example, and it was more difficult to keep up during the semester.)",
    "This course would be incredibly useful if I already had adequate knowledge of German grammar and wanted to improve my German to English translation, so I would recommend it for students seeking to improve their translation skills. However, I took the class personally to learn how to read German quickly and effectively (not translate it), so for me, I think the aim of the course went too far beyond what I was looking for in a German reading course.",
    "Although I have never taken another course at Yale, and therefore could not offer a comparative recommendation, I would recommend this course to anyone looking for a brief, thorough course on the German language.",
    "I will for beginning students of German who would like to understand the language. Also good for people to review and pick up past German language skills.",
    "Sure, but I would tell the student not to take any other class if he\/she is taking this class, and expect to spend a lot of time (sometimes you may need to sacrifice your regular working hours).",
    "Yes. You get out of it what you put in. This was a great introduction to reading German for me and I can now easily take the skills I acquired and apply them to improving my german comprehension",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in developing some German reading skills. After this course, I feel relatively confident in approaching some abstracts or essay excerpts written in German.",
    "It is a requirement for my subfield, so everyone I know is taking it.",
    "Yes! German for Reading is a very productive crash course for those he need to develop translation skills in a timely fashion.",
    "Yes -- if you need to be able to read German scholarship in your field, this summer course will rapidly bring you up to speed",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course for anyone wanting to get a solid grounding in reading German. I think it was well suited both to beginners and more advanced speakers, and was superbly run, with a clear structure. The instructor and the TFs were responsive and excellent teachers. I had learned a lot and will continue to return to my notes and my textbook for further study."
