                "I developed an understanding of how to interpret texts at a high level. Often the text we read of various historians, political theorists, or religious officials could appear daunting, but I became more confident in deconstructing them.",
                "I gained a foundational knowledge of the tradition of Western political and historical theory in the time periods included on the syllabus, and learned how to comparatively analyze the views presented in the texts from the syllabus, considering their interactions with each other and the way that they have influenced thought in the modern world.",
                "I developed my critical thinking skills. Professor Freedman's class helped me dig deeper into the process of uncovering motives behind historical figures' actions in our texts and the ways in which different historical actors fell into the same pattern or broke free from historical precedent. Additionally, I honed my ability to connect common thematic threads throughout the primary sources we looked at.",
                "I believe I gained a greater insight into the nature of historical and political theory, which I did not particularly understand before. I certainly feel as though I learned a lot of ways of thought--as well as just general knowledge--from all the readings that I never really had contact with, especially because I didn't know a great deal about the Roman Empire before taking this class. Outside of content, the course's rigour certainly taught me about working hard and managing my time.",

                "I think a strength of this course, was the sheer volume of material covered. We were constantly introduced to new perspectives and tasks with placing them in our ever-changing framework of reference.",
                "A main strength of this course was the in-class discussions, as I think that the way in which they were organized, with different student starters each seminar and then designated time for breakout rooms later in the class, facilitated complex and varied conversations that were very engaging. The topics presented for discussion were useful in that they made clear the greater implications of the ideas in the text in terms of how they can be applied to broad questions of government and history. One possible weakness of the course is that at times the discussions and the readings seemed to overlap a lot with  philosophy, to the point where the overall political\/historical focus of the course was lost at times.",
                "The seminar format was a strength. Professor Freedman guided our discussion, but also allowed us to debate off of each other's points and engage in thoughtful dialogue about the time period and themes of interest. I also enjoyed our breakout room discussions. Professor Freedman did an excellent job, and I don't have any particular suggestions for improvement.",
                "It seems difficult to identify any weaknesses in the course because it felt so well-crafted. Whatever difficulties I might have faced--with the amount of content, for example--is the very point of the class, and I'm not well-versed enough in other authors to be able to suggest alternatives to the ones that we read. I think that the course was strong in that it managed to provide a certain depth of understanding to each text despite the sheer number of texts that we read. At times, though, I wished that we could have a greater understanding of the historical context, or have more of an overview of certain histories from the start.",
                "Strengths: welcoming environment, availability of Professor Freedman\r\nWeaknesses: vague critiques of writing, inconsistent\/erratic grades that didn't seem to reflect the comments made, unorganized discussions during seminar",
                "Strengths: Well research and well picked course material, that covered a lot of content over the breadth of the Western canon. Seminar system very useful\r\nWeakness: I think there could be a bit of tightening and integration in the canon, developing how some of these works build off each other better.",

                "I think that the seminars were very successful  the breakout room function made the classes engaging and allowed me to feel like I was really getting to know my classmates on a greater level. The virtual pre-recorded lectures were not as engaging, as they often were quite long, and it is hard to find the proper motivation when watching a lecture asynchronously.",
                "The seminar format of the class was quite engaging, and I enjoyed the use of breakout rooms to delve deeper into our topics of discussion. I think having the option to watch our long-form lectures synchronously would be helpful, especially if we come up with specific questions for the lecturer during their presentation and want to ask those questions at the end.",
                "I think the DS cohort is a naturally engaged one, which was really helpful during seminars; awkward silences were rare, and it helped make the online discussions feel natural and lively, just like an in-person one. The lectures, too, were good. I think DS adapted quite well to online learning overall.",

                "Unfortunately, I think DS isn't very well translated online, mostly for reasons outside of faculty control. Some more way to encourage student interaction with each other through and outside of class could be beneficial, through more directed study hours together (oftentimes felt like I didn't really know my classmates outside of the classroom itself).",
                "I did not find the writing buddy system particularly fruitful, but I am inclined to think that it could be in future. The success of the breakout rooms varied based on the topic."

                "Yes! Particularly if you are lucky enough to study under Professor Freedman.",
                "Yes, because I believe that it is a great way to get acquainted with many different historically influential authors and ideas in a short amount of time. This course seems to function as a jumping-off point for any future learning, and broadens one's ability to critically consider the political situations of the modern day and understand where certain ideas originate from historically.",
                "Yes! Professor Freedman's class was not only engaging, but also helped me further develop my ability to form and articulate opinions about the past. Additionally, I now have a much stronger grasp of the strengths and weaknesses of various forms of government and social structures present in the ancient world, which provide a foundation for many of the cultures and governments of today.",
                "I would not recommend this course to just any other student, but certainly I would to people who are interested in the topic and are willing to take on the challenges. I think you learn a lot--not just in content, but also simply in how to work hard (though, having not taken many non-DS classes at Yale, I'm not sure of the workload of other Yale classes, hence why I declined to answer the previous question). And at the end of the course, you are made aware of the sheer amount that you have covered and learned.",
                "I would cautiously recommend this course to another Yale College student--Professor Freedman is arguably one of the nicest people I've met at Yale. He truly makes the classroom environment welcoming and casual. I never hesitated to share an opinion or ask a question. However, some of the comments I received on my writing were vague and seemed to predicated on a mere difference in opinion. My grades on papers didn't seem to reflect the nature of the comments provided, and the comments that he did provide did not really help me improve my subsequent papers.",
                "I think I would, if you know what DS is like. DS followed similarly to my expectations in terms of intensity and speed, and history and politics felt similar to how I expected it to go and a well-balanced branch of the course. I would just add that sometimes feedback standards aren't clear and professors grade and conduct classes in very different ways.",
