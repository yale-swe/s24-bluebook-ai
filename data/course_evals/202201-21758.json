I also learned essential concepts such as the Laplace transform, dirac delta functions, and step functions. We used the culmination of these concepts to solve boundary value problems in the form of the heat equation, wave equation, and Laplace equation.

                "The material of the course is important for many forms of engineering, so that is the strength. However, the way that this course was taught was definitely its weakness. Office hours were nominally helpful with problem sets, and the lectures were presented in a way that made it difficult to obtain much information. Overall, the course could be improved by having a more accommodating and accepting aura where mistakes and misunderstanding are accepted and not frowned upon.",
                "The class was really interesting but goes at a really fast pace. It was also taught in a classroom that was way too small which made it hard to see the board most of the time. I would love to see some more real- world applications incorporated into the class so I can really understand how to apply the work that we did.",
                "The content is great, and the problem sets are very reflective of the class. However, the lectures suck because the professor isn't very clear, and exams are a hit or miss.",
                "The course was not structured as well as other courses this is something that could definitely be improved. The office hour and review sessions also did not do example problems it was more of a derivation of the formulas when someone asked for help on a particular concept. The derivation be found in the textbook so I think the office hour/review sessions were a weak point in the course. A strength of the course was the lectures.",
                "Strengths include the TA's, who largely run the course. Weaknesses include the professor, overly difficult psets, and unclear lectures.",
                "Strengths: I think the class is pretty well organized and the exams are not too too difficult. Weaknesses: The lecturers aren't the most engaging (though it is a math class so its difficult to make lectures super fun).",
                "Strengths: The TAs are wonderful and always willing to help. SeungYun and Liam were always, always there for me and other students and willing to contribute overtime even after office hours to help us understand concepts. I also thought that by nature of the material we cover, the topics introduced in class were fascinating and relevant to any engineering discipline. I also enjoyed Dr. Hui Cao as a professor - she was very kind and humorous, and her expertise in the material is obvious in lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Dr. Cao is a wonderful professor and I can tell from the way she teaches and her uploaded notes that she cares for our learning. However, I sometimes felt that the lectures were too fast-paced, especially when going through examples of problem-solving. I would rather her focus on a few examples of a problem more thoroughly and slowly, rather than many.",

                "The strength was the material. I found it very interesting and fun to learn on my own. The weakness is that I had to learn it all on my own.",
                "There should be more focus on solving the differential equations themselves, instead of the integration parts of the problems. Trig and inverse trig integrals, for instance, should be given on exams.",
                "The course covers a lot of material and does a decent job showing how it applies to real world examples with high level application problems but cao is a very confusing lecturer and the when the content becomes really difficult the course is nearly impossible to understand, much less get anything out of it",
                "The lecture could sometime be quite confusing only for it to make sense once she did the summer right at the end.",
                "Strengths-course layout, material, book used, teacher, TAs. Weaknesses-none other than additional office hours could be helpful",
                "This course moves incredibly quickly. The instructor talks the entirety of class time and I found myself unable to process everything she was saying because I was scrambling so hard to write down everything she was explaining. I didn't have time to think about the actual processes she had taught until after the class ended, so I ultimately stopped attending this class in person. I found it worked better for me to watch the Zoom session recordings because I could pause and consider her explanation and take notes without feeling rushed. As someone who is not in the middle of a math or calculus sequence like I would imagine the majority of other students are, I found the pace and assumptions made regarding the level of understanding everyone in the course should have to be a bit challenging at times.",
                "Strengths: content in lectures felt well organized\r\nWeaknesses: last unit of content felt a bit rushed, wasn't covered as thoroughly",
                "This course is very disorganized. Lectures are fast and hard to understand. We dont really do examples in class either. The examples we do in class are never finished. Certain chapters are rushed. Exams are short but weighted very high, so each question is worth most of your grade. Psets can be excessively difficult and are still given during tests.",
                "The course content constituted the bare minimum necessary to teach the students how to solve differential equations. Content was always clear and well-organized, but there wasn't very much discussion of applications of differential equation theory to the most important problems and laws in physical sciences (only harmonic oscillators and the heat equation were treated thoroughly). Also, lectures were focused solely on how to find the answer without contextualizing what the answer means or explaining where the tools we were introduced to came from. \r\nThe course would be more interesting and the content easier to internalize if more discussion was devoted to different kinds of physical systems (e.g. quantum mechanical wavefunctions, optical systems with gain and attenuation, electromagnetic waves) and how a differential equation reflects its dynamics.\r\nTime for such discussions could be made by being less thorough in simple algebraic steps in lecture and offloading more of that to the review sessions.",
                "I mean it was a little dull but then its pretty straightforward. More time on the final section wouldve been really good. Also, the TAs stopped their review section which would have been helpful."

Be prepared to put in the work though and do textbook readings because they are the key to success. This class when taken in conjunction with physics 181 and 166L is really cool because you get to work out the equations (damping and waves) that you utilize and see in action in the physics classes so it really brings a unique perspective to everything. Also, it is important to note that there was no curve for Spring '22.",

Its probably required for your major so you have to take this anyways, but if you have other options keep them in mind. This course is not accessible for people without strong math foundations, and if you struggle with theoretical math this course will be very difficult. The psets are long and difficult, and they are usually harder than the exam material. The professor who taught this course was very difficult to understand during lecture, and was often unable to answer student questions clearly. Overall, for engineers especially this course is the most efficient way to fill math requirements, but be prepared for a potentially bad learning experience.",

                "This is a required class for most engineering students and certainly a pre-req for BME majors. I would highly recommend this class if Dr. Cao is teaching and especially if SeungYun and Liam are TA-ing. The course was fairly well organized, although difficult in terms of content. Although I might not remember every method of problem solving a few years down the line, I felt that the general patterns of analysis introduced in this course would serve anyone in STEM well.",
                "Yes I took this course just for fun senior spring and really enjoyed it.",
                "I would recommend the course material to another student because that was very interesting, but I do not think I could recommend this specific course.",

                "No. Maybe with another professor. This topic is important and I feel like my experience was diminished by this course.",
                "I would not recommend this course to anyone majoring in the physical sciences as you gain very few insights into relationships between physical systems and the equations that describe them. I would only recommend this course to students who are looking for the minimal knowledge of techniques necessary to solve the most frequent equations.",
