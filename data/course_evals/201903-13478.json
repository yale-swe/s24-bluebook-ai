   "comments": [
    "I learned how to conduct comparative analysis of texts.",
    "I learned about the way that cultures of war in Asia and the Pacific influenced literary tradition and style. I was able to connect themes of fragmentation, memory and loss across the works we read in genres of poetry, plays, and novels.",
    "I learned how to think critically about American Cold War military intervention in Asia and the Pacific, as well as how it manifested in literature and culture of the period.",
    "This course was great for thinking across genres and disciplines -- we studied novels, poems, films, and plays alongside scholarly theory and archival material. I learned how to begin reading an archive and how to edit my work, and the course introduced me to the world of cultural studies. It was amazing!",
    "The course focuses on war and temporality across multiple genres. It is a literature course (ie close reading is the primary mode of interrogation) done in English (it is not a translation course or a course that works with translations). The course trajectory and order of readings allows for ideas to develop at a steady, thought-provoking pace.",
    "I think this course was more about having the experience and freedom to discuss amongst each other and create our own analyses than learning any specific path of planned information. There were a lot of individual creative insights that came out during the assignments and papers.",
    "I learned to look from the lens of cultural militarism while reading Asian American literature, and many other skills, both in terms of research and in life."

   "comments": [
    "While I enjoyed every book in the class, some of them were not really related to the topic of Cultures of Militarism in Asia and the Pacific. This made in class discussion difficult and unproductive at times. The most interesting readings for me were the supplemental non-fiction works that we accompanied the novels. I would have loved to discuss these texts further; perhaps having primary fictional texts that are more closely related to the main topic would allow us to discuss the supplemental texts in more detail and context.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, all the texts we read in this class centered on East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. No discussion was given to South Asia or Western Asia\/the Middle East. In a class about \"Asia and the Pacific\" I think I would be very beneficial to consider what constitutes Asia, and if certain regions are going to be the focus of the class I think that should be made clear in the title of the course. It would be interesting to compare the British militarism in Hong Kong to British involvement in South Asia, or American militarism in the Pacific during WWII to more recent American involvement in Afghanistan and the Middle East. I think reading novels and texts from these different regions would be an interesting topic of discussion for what military literature is in Asia.",
    "Strengths: Our course material was engaging and Sunny was very passionate about the course material.\r\nWeaknesses: Certain course material didn't feel directly relevant to the overarching themes of the course. I also thought there should be more on militarism between Asian countries (performed by Asian countries to others).",
    "I would have loved to read more contemporary poetry in the course that speaks to the legacies of war in Asia and the Pacific. Overall, I really loved this course and think that it's a very powerful exploration of gender and cultural stereotypes and the way that militarism influenced the production of these stereotypes.",
    "While I found the topic very interesting, I felt that the interdisciplinary nature of the course could be both informative and limiting, as discussions sometimes became less focused on the text and more general.\r\n\r\nI think a bit more cohesive structure would also benefit the course: as it stands right now, it seems like each week is its own independent theme\/focus, without much relation to what comes before or after.",
    "The strengths of the course include the fantastic syllabus, our engaging conversations, and, of course, Sunny's phenomenal teaching. I would have liked to read more theory about culture, since the class was more focused on the \"militarism\" part of its title, but Sunny directed me toward good writers in cultural studies during our office hours conversations. Also, the persistent problem with English courses that are crosslisted with a bunch of other departments is that the English professor who leads the class in a discussion about a novel or poem may be working with a class where a lot of people, coming from different majors, have never done a literary analysis in a class before. The class being mostly East Asian Studies majors (as far as I could tell) of course didn't make it bad, but there were a few times when Sunny tried to get us talking about form or structure or genre in a very English-y way and the conversation kind of stalled there. Just something to be mindful about! How people are coming from different disciplines with different trainings.",
    "Strengths: course trajectory, secondary sources, format, clear expectations, camaraderie in seminar!\r\nWeaknesses: granted, \"Asia\" encompasses many, many cultures, so it would be impossible to feel like the scope was adequate, there was not enough emphasis on South Asian cultures\r\n*Note that Fall 2019 was the first time this course was offered! I am confident that future iterations of the course (as taught by Sunny) would address the weaknesses!",
    "strengths - variety of texts we engaged with (poetry, fiction, film, etc.), encouraging discussion space, fun presentation project \r\nweaknesses - syllabus order could use some reworking, but otherwise, great course!",
    "The course was very much a seminar, which was great. Students had a lot of space to discuss concepts and opinions with each other.",
    "I appreciated the creative components of this course such as a fashion assignment, a blackout assignment, and student presentations."

    "Yes! Sunny is a gem.",
    "This was a very unique course and I enjoyed taking it. I was especially thrilled to devote a semester to studying Asian American literature through the lens of militarism. We read many wonderful novels in this course, and they were paired well with academic articles that gave insight into the historical context of the literary works.",
    "I am glad I took the course, but I'm unsure whether I would do it againbut personally, I think I prefer studying more literature rather than cultural objects more generally, which are the focus of this class. Reading load is kind of heavy on particular weeks, and weekly reading respsonsesso the work load isn't exactly super high, but it is constant.",
    "I would, 100%. I learned so much and had such a great time. Everyone should get to learn with Sunny.",
    "Yes, speaking as an English major, I would recommend this course to another student. It's a tough class--readings are difficult, expectations for work quality are higher than other courses--but the rewards are immense. Don't choose this course as your fifth course option, but if you have the time and mental space, don't make the mistake of not taking this course at all.",
    "Great course that transformed the way I read various texts and categorize them as \"war\" stories or not. The supplementary readings provided along with the primary texts were illuminating and helpful especially if you are less familiar with the topics\/historical background discussed. The workload is also evenly paced, and the professor provides sufficient, generous direction in preparing for the essays. Sunny is a warm and uplifting professor in the classroom and office hours, so definitely take this course if you can!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The readings themselves were super interesting, and the students were exposed to a lot of great texts and concepts we might not otherwise have known.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student!!!"
