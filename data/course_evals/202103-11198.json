                "Strengths: very engaging and interesting \r\nWeakness: too much work for a 0.5 credit class",
                "I gained a lot from the course, but if taken as a \"fifth class\" it can feel fairly rigorous. I would say additionally that some of the experiments were hindered by the lack of proper/quality lab machines or devices. Therefore, the class and labs would go more smoothly if there were more accurate machines.",
                "This course consisted of a twice weekly lecture and an evening lab session. Lectures often had very little bearing on what was studied during lab sessions, and also felt repetitive given the fact that I was concurrently taking materials science. This course is also only worth a half credit despite requiring much more class time than some full credit courses.\r\n\r\nAnother way this course could be improved is by updating the testing equipment used in 286L. For example, the Instron machine in our lab classroom was very old and lacked a lot of the modern functions and capabilities of newer models, which would have helped with an experiment we ran at the end of the course.\r\n\r\nAlso, the only grade we receive for this course is a final lab report. Although we submitted small reports throughout, those were not graded and we did not receive much feedback on them, so I have no idea how I did in this course upon finishing."
