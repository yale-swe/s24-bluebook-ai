                "This class significantly enhanced my Chinese reading and writing skills. This, in turn, carried over to my speaking skills, where I am now able to speak in a much more professional tone using far more advanced words than before this class.",
                "- Definitely improved my Chinese skills, especially in regards to writing, grammar, and vocabulary. \r\n- Designed for heritage speakers and you can definitely tell. I really appreciated the curriculum/units we went through, which were often centered around Chinese-American identity and the topics we discussed/dabbled in (such as immigration, Chinatown, political involvement amongst immigrants, Chinese parenting, culture, etc.) are great for somebody seeking to reflect and connect with their heritage. I went into the class expecting a regular language course and this was a much appreciated added layer to the class that I think made the class more interesting and engaging.\r\n- With each unit, we learned new vocab, grammar structures, and phrases. There was an emphasize on the distinctions between causal spoken Chinese and more formal written Chinese, so often, we would learn the \"elevated\" version of common phrases."

                "I enjoyed our various projects and topics for our papers. They helped me think deeper about modern topics and also provided an opportunity to hone my writing skills. The quizzes also helped me memorize the new vocabularies.",
                "The class is very organized, and all the vocabulary is chosen so that it is easily applicable to daily life. But it goes even farther, there is not only lessons about Chinese, but deep discussions in other Chinese-related topics as well. Not sure if there are any major weaknesses, it's the best class I've taken at Yale already.",
                "Strengths\r\n- Wang Laoshi is great, she is consistently engaging and quite funny. I think she facilitates class well and made the class a better experience. She's clearly invested in our success in the class and us as individuals \r\n- I really enjoyed the small seminar setting where you eventually get to know and bond with your classmates. My classmates were great and in our experience, we really were able to form a close community within the class. \r\n- The atmosphere of the class in general was great, and felt welcoming and provided a safe space for learning and conversing\r\n- As a first year, I found that the class was a great way to connect to Yale's broader Chinese speaking community, I was introduced to opportunities like Chinese Table, Mahjong Club, and Calligraphy Club, to meet other Chinese speakers at Yale\r\n- I like the curriculum, the specific topics/units we covered were often relevant to Chinese-American identity and I think someone seeking to reflect on their identity or connect to their heritage would be able to do that in this class\r\n- Workload is consistent and quite manageable on a day by day basis. \r\n- I think as long as you put effort into the class, you will pass and do good grade wise\r\n- Really clear and concise syllabus/schedule that outlined due dates and assignments\r\n- Appreciate the final project which was collaborative and open to a lot of creative possibilities\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- I think an inevitability of heritage courses is that everyone does come in with slightly different skillsets and levels of fluency. This does mean that certain aspects of the class (ie. writing, speaking, reading) could be more challenging for some or too easy for others (though I do think this overall does mostly balances out). Additionally, I do think that the placement tests (and presumably the whole trajectory that yale CHNS courses take) do accurately place you in the CHNS course that you should be in, and there also a lot of flexibility for dropping down or moving up a level of CHNS at the beginning of the semester that I think is quite helpful if you are worried that the class is too easy/challenging. I also think that the teachers and the grading keeps this in mind and are very willing to take into account your starting point. So overall, this is not a big weakness to me, but I do think perhaps some level of further customization/catering to a specific student needs (perhaps in the form of additional optional study material or small extra credit assignments) could make the class even better\r\n- Class time lowkey could be slightly longer, as at times, we ran out of time and could not cover everything we were suppose to cover"

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It gives you more depth in both speaking, writing, and reading, and prepares you for being more professional in Chinese in the future. Also, the discussions we have in class are so in depth, and apparently there is a decent chance that the class will result in friend group.",
                "Yes, I definitely would recommend this course. Great for anyone seeking to maintain/grow their Chinese skills as a heritage speaker."
