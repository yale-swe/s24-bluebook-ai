                "Strengths: Professor Naqvi was a thoughtful and engaging discussion leader, and I thought all the films we viewed were valuable and interesting for a variety of reasons. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While this class was very immersive, it was difficult to keep track of all the elements we needed to watch or view before seminar every week, which could sometimes include multiple lecture, 1-2 student presentations, multiple readings, and multiple films. It could get overwhelming at times to juggle all of those moving parts within an online setting."

                "Asynchronous lectures were helpful, but they were rather long and made for HOURS of video watching per week. Splitting into English\/German discussion rooms was cool, but I never got to discuss with half of the class.",
                "Succeeded: It was easy to watch the films offline and Professor Naqvi ensured it was simple to access them. Breakout rooms during seminar ran smoothly. \r\n\r\nCould be improved: It would have been easier to juggle less asynchronous materials week-to-week, as the sheer amount of content we had to consume to get a bit overwhelming at times."
