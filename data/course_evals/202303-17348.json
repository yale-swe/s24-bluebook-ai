                "This class is targeted at students that want to learn to write essays that are meant to be read. Our professor told us this on the first day in class, and I don't think I fully absorbed what it meant. In this class, we learned to think critically about some truly exemplary essays. We broke the authors' works down sentence by sentence, and while I wouldn't consider myself the most meticulous reader, the insights my peers offered allowed me to engage more deeply with the author's purpose. \r\nHaving completed the course, I now understand what the professor meant about writing to be read. Words exist for more than conveying ideasor rather, if an author truly believes they have a message worth sharing, then the author will take the time to refine their text into its most engaging, impactful form. \r\nIn this class, we learned to write well, which is one of the few skills that will influence every class I take hereafter.",
                "I learned how to be very mindful and conscious about my writing, how to use different writing techniques, and the importance of sentences. I also got a lot better at in-class participation and completing readings for the class.",
                "This course was honestly a waste of time in my opinion, I didnt really learn much and found the class uninteresting",
                "This course fundamentally transformed how I write and how I think about writing. We read a diverse selection of works, including Roxane Gay, David Foster Wallace, and Joan Didion. While I learned about different forms of essays and how to craft, most of all, I gained confidence as a writer. My greatest takeaway was write to be reread."

            "comments": [
                "The biggest strength of the course is the feedback we receive on all of our papers. Professor Shirkhani puts an EXTRAORDINARY amount of time into helping her students develop as writers. This is a definite strength. \r\nAlso, you will disagree with the feedback that she gives you from time to time. But to steal a line from Stephen King's On Writing, \"The editor is always right.\" Going into the class with an open mind will really help you get the most out of it. \r\nAnother strength of the class is how interesting the model essays are. I had grown very accustomed to reading extraordinarily boring texts. In this class, however, 95% of the selection for the readings was perfect. The texts for the class are also a major class. \r\nLastly, the environment is very low-stakes. The professor is not there to fail you. The most important part of that class was learning rhetorical strategies amongst our peers while working together to improve our own craft. I feel like every student is incentivized to play an active role in shaping the class, and the grade will come pretty naturally to those that are willing to engage with the course.",
                "The course is very organized. It is very clear in advance when the essays and the drafts are due. I liked the readings we had to do for seminars. The only thing I would do is to let students know in advance that it is not necessary to buy the course packet if they don't mind printing and (minimally) organizing it in advance. The packet costs a lot more than student printing and you would have to carry hundreds of pages with you to every class.",
                "This course honestly made me a worse writer, I was encouraged to write less concisely, less clearly, and less directly",
                "The strength of this course was Prof. Shirkhani. While all ENGL 120 classes tend to have rave reviews, I cannot recommend ENGL 120 - Shirkhanis version enough. She has a spark within her that engages every single person in the room. When she picks up that piece of chalk to write down a technique, we are all waiting for that special moment when it makes contact with the board. I loved almost all of the readings and wished our discussions would never end. She was incredible at Office Hours, helping me turn my pieces from bad to good to great to phenomenal. I also loved reading Klinkenborg. The best part of this course was the amount of feedback you get on each and every piece of writing. As a STEM major with no background in writing, I was truly terrified about this course. Now, I know that I am a writer. And I will continue to be a writer even after ENGL 120. I am deeply grateful for her and this class. One major weakness was that there was a ton of confusion regarding the course packet at the beginning of the semester. While I dont believe that was Prof. Shirkhanis fault, it was a major headache. Another weakness of the course would be that Prof. Shirkhani has a soft spot for David Foster Wallace and Joan Didion. I would have preferred to read fewer pieces by those authors in order to have greater diversity in the selections read. One final weakness is that she has very unique tastes. Make sure to check with her about whether she likes your draft BEFORE you take it to someone else (e.g., Poorvu Writing Center, Residential College Writing Tutors) as you will be wasting your time otherwise."

                "I would recommend this class to a student that is willing to set aside the time that it takes to read multiple lengthy articles twice a week. Likewise, for any students that have lived absolutely incredible liveswe're talking abducted by aliens, talked Elon Musk out of a presidential bid with Kanye, or are one of the less-kept-up-with Kardashiansyou'll have no problems coming up with ideas for the many different essays that we have two write about in class. Also, there will be times when you don't understand the feedback you receive on your papers. Your best bet is to go to office hours and just ask. Sometimes, in-person chats about your essay is the best way to have breakthroughs.",
                "Yes - I had not taken english classes in high school that required me to write anything more than a 5 paragraph essay analyzing books. This class exposes you to many different types of writing and teaches you good practices for all types of writing. Very different style than academic writing, which was refreshing.",
                "10000% would recommend. This is a challenging but very rewarding course, not just students who wants to be humanities major. Seminars were very engaging, I received very clear feedback and had a great progression throughout the semester. Professor Shirkhani is very great, the class is very fun, take it if you can!!",
                "I have already recommended that several of my friends do not take English 120",
                "Absolutely. This was the best course I have ever taken at Yale. In an alternate universe, I would be an English major. For now, Ill settle for taking as many English classes as possible in my next two years."
