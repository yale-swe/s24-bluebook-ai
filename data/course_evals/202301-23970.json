Our units covered racism, sexism, and homophobia, as well as German history (post-war, East/West divide). With helpful grammar lessons (aligning with the content) throughout the course, my German language got a lot better, as well!",

                "Strengths are the professor and weaknesses are occasions where students dominate the conversation.",
                "Professor Sippel took suggestions throughout the course for what grammatical topic should be practiced next, which was really helpful. We wrote a lot in the course, which felt like a lot of work when it coincided with a usual reading assignment, but having this much writing in general was necessary for improving my German, I think. We also got a lot of prompt feedback throughout the course on our homeworks, which was great for improving throughout the semester. And the mix of videos, articles, and book chapters was a real strength of this course in terms of exposing us to a diversity of media/accents.",
                "So many strengths in this class! I really enjoyed the balance between watching movies and documentaries, reading extracts from books, and reading articles. Even though the topic of the class is fairly niche, each unit felt very different and I learned a lot about various social issues in Germany/Switzerland. Really reasonable, balanced workload and honestly no complaints or weaknesses.",

In addition to it being just plain fun and a great conversation topic, it really helped me brush up on my German, and I learned in-depth about a topic that is really important to German culture. Plus, the cross-section of Yale that I got to meet through the class was really great. The students attracted to a German class all about soccer are each super interesting in their own right!",
                "Absolutely would recommend! It's an interesting, not at all stressful class that will teach you German grammar and vocab, alongside insights into how football influences various aspects of German culture. Definitely a good first L5 class.",
