Once those fundamentals were acquired, we learned how to parameterize, describe lines and surfaces in 3D space, scalar and vector line integrals, and scalar and vector surface integrals, double integrals, triple integrals, and added to our knowledge of the fundamental theorems of calculus. This class's content was very relevant to Electromagnetism, and so it was cool to experience both courses at the same time. Each enhanced the learning in the other.",

                "The material is not easy and the workload is somewhat high but manageable. I think the biggest weakness was that the exams were out of 100 points, so every mistake translated to a huge amount of points lost. Ximera is by far the best resource to self-study, since it goes step-by-step over the content, so as the course progresses and the material starts getting harder and building upon itself, Ximera helps to make the connections between the topics.",
                "The strengths was that the teaching style was very well suited to helping students visualize with concrete examples; there was a lot of pedagogical clarity, especially when using three dimensions instead of n dimensions. However, the weakness was that this pedagogical clarity came at the expense of rigor and generality. Many of the theorems in this class were left unproven, and often times equations could've been left in a more general and thus more beautiful form, but instead were given in a specific form (P_x - Q_y, for instance).",
                "This course is not, by any means, taught well. The instruction of the course material was abysmal and the only competent teaching of the material was done by the peer tutors. I had Ian Adelstein, the current course director, as my instructor. Not once did he manage to effectively teach the subject material during lectures. The pre-class quizzes were, however, helpful and taught the lessons more effectively than Adelstein did. It got to the point where attending Adelstein's lectures was simply a waste of time as nothing of use was being taught to us in an effective way. I had to rely on the help of peer tutors to even learn the material for my homework and exams. If Adelstein, being the literal course director of Math 120, is unable to teach the course material, I can only imagine the quality of teaching from the rest of the instructors. \r\n\r\nSince coming to Yale, I have consistently been told by current students, recent graduates, and even alumni from the '90s that Math 120 is the worst-taught course at this institution and in order to have a better math instructor, you have to be in a higher-level math class. Since this course is a prerequisite for most, if not all STEM majors, you would think that it might have better instructors who are able to successfully teach the course material. \r\n\r\nIt's a shame that the current instruction of Math 120 has been so horrible when there are professors in other departments, like Physics, who have been able to successfully teach us multivariable calculus as the physics lectures are moderately aligned with the schedule of Math 120. Even though my physics class does not technically require the knowledge or ability to do multivariable calculus, the physics professor's brief introduction to these concepts greatly surpassed the lectures I sat through with my Math 120 instructor.",

                "After grading the PSETs give out answers, because by the time exams or midterms come up, I had no clue how to correct what I got wrong on my PSETs. So, it would save a lot of time and effect than going to office hours for one problem during exam week.",
                "The teaching got behind the homework. I work on the homework earlier in the week, so I started learning from TAs and the textbook. I started going to class already knowing half of the new material because it was on the homework I was already doing.",

I know a few other people in this situation, and it's a little frustrating, though I guess something that we just have to accept as a fundamental structure of the course.",
                "The strengths was the professor and way in which the content was presented. Professor Adelstein was an incredible professor who was engaged with the students and their learning experience. He cared about each student and excited the class with each lesson. His love for mathematics and learning was genuinely passed down to each student.",
                "The strengths of the course were that there were many resources made available to students if we needed additional help with the material and that pre-recorded lectures about the topics being discussed in class were also made available to us. The weakness of the course is that the pace is quite fast and there is a lot of material learned in the semester, which makes it slightly difficult to feel as though you have mastered the material.",
                "Course moves too fast. Some things are skipped that would make continuity so much easier. (Ex: my class was never taught that the normal to a plane will just be the coefficients in the equation)\r\n\r\nPsets are ridiculously hard.",

                "The course is very well organized and I received help or guidance almost every day! At the end of the semester, I felt that I learned so much and had a great time engaging with the discussed topics. All the problem sets tested rigorously the understating of the material and developed my creativity in finding a solution to a calculus problem.",
                "The course is quite instructor-dependent in terms of how material is delivered. Each instructor seems to have their own strengths regarding how best to explain material. It is very engaging and relates between mathematics and graphs very tightly and was a highly stimulating course."

                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, because it represents a backbone in the Math major, developing interesting and engaging problems and discussions around fundamental, vital concepts in the field! The course developed my critical thinking and I learned skills useful in life and in many adjacent STEM fields.",
