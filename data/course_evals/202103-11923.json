With that said, I question the usefulness of what I learned (this is a comment on diff eqs as a class, not on the professor, Erik).",

It created a sort of roadmap for how to solve differential equations.

                "Strengths: The class was taught in a very organized way. Everything connected and most of the class was applied. There were a few theoretical concepts, but overall I liked the class. The PSETS were great reflections of the concepts taught and the exams were very fair. \r\nWeaknesses: No significant weaknesses",
                "The material is taught competently and classes are generally enjoyable. I would like to see a tad more theory, but the overall mix was pretty good. I do know that other students definitely prefer the hard applications to theory, so obviously that has to be balanced.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- comprehensive overview of diff eqs.\r\n- cohesive narrative... felt like everything ran together well\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- confusing textbook... Erik was the only helpful resource for learning the material\r\n- while it was very helpful to go over homework problems for review, practice exams would be a very useful resource",
                "This course was strong in that the professor went through content thoroughly and had plenty of time to discuss concepts with students. However, I think the grading should have been more focused on problem sets, which represent the bulk of our work in the class, rather than a few tests that held extreme weight.",
                "The lectures could be made more engaging but the problem sets were very straightforward.",
                "I thought that by the end, everything came together very well. I wish we discussed applications of the work a bit more, but also given the time constraints would rather learn more methods of solving differential equations. This is a very computational course, and given that there is also an ENAS version of the course, I think this could be more proof-based in order to differentiate more from the other course. Any mention of proofs was quickly glossed over / we didn't need to know it. I think the department should recommend taking this course soon after Math 120 or other calculus because it requires integration and derivative techniques that may have been forgotten. The course material itself, though, made sense, and also the exams did not require as much calculus intricacies. I think the problem sets were all an appropriate length and reading the textbook helped a lot in understanding the material. One day in class, everyone got to write on the board and teach the class a little, which was a really great activity to feel more engaged. I think activities like this or more discussion in the course would be helpful."

If you enjoy solving math problems then it should be a good course for you. It isn't really proofs-y, so it is an excellent option if you are looking for a little less intense math elective. There is some theory covered and it is interesting, but it is not the focus of the course. If you are looking for something more pure, take an analysis course (or whatever else interests you).",
                "Hmmm... only if you need it for your major",

                "I would recommend this course to another student, but would caveat by encouraging the student to take this course soon after a calculus course, and warn that it does not have any proofs. After taking proof-based math courses, it was a bit challenging going back to computational work solely because it required relearning and refreshing earlier techniques. Also, it differs from proof-based courses because studying requires practicing as any problems as possible. However, differential equations is a useful course in any sort of field with applied mathematics and it teaches many techniques. Also, Erik was amazing and super helpful, so definitely take it with him if you have the opportunity."
