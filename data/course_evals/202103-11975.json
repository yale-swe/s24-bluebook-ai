That being said, I wholeheartedly recommend this course. Professor Elbousty is fantastic, supportive, and incredibly passionate, and some of the conversations we had were fantastic. If you feel shaky on some grammar stuff, I still recommend going through with this-- you pick up a lot on the way, and it's a lot of fun to do-- just make sure to block out ample time for the readings in order to get the most out of class discussions and look over what you didn't understand after class by yourself.\r\n\r\nOverall, could not recommend more for a higher-level Arabic course."
