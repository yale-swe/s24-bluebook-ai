In class, the discussions were very open and we learned just as much from our classmates' readings of the texts as we did our own.",
                "I learned how to engage with different types of readings for class and bring that into in-class discussions. I also feel that I improved my writing skills as Professor Wright gave us helpful, personal writing feedback throughout the class.",
                "This course allowed me to attain skills for research and scholarly reading. By the end of the course, I was able to read scholarly articles, books, and other readings effectively while still finding their lines of reasoning, important pieces of evidence, and implications. This aspect was emphasized in class through discussions, which made every reading and perspective more meaningful. Through these skills, I was then able to argue for both sides on any argument that the syllabus highlighted, which the professor encouraged to avoid cherry-picking data and understand the literature more.",
                "I learned how to skim readings really well, I liked when we were assigned one day to skim a book and get the main ideas. This course also helped my critical thinking and academic discussion skills.",
                "This course taught me from a range of texts including philosophy, race studies, and so much more. This class taught me new skills such as how to skim read efficiently and fast. This class was my most fascinating class I've taken and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
                "A great understanding of how musicians and composers attain acknowledgement and fame throughout different time periods and societal expectations.",
                "I came away with a nuanced understanding of the narratives surrounding genius and meritocracy in today's society. These ideas show up everywhere, and this class helped me look at multiple sides of them.",
                "Along with gaining a rich and diverse knowledge of musical geniuses beyond composers like Beethoven, this course gave me the opportunity to rethink my understanding of debate itself. I learned the importance of integrative complexity and being able to debate both sides of an argument. I will take the knowledge I gained in this class (musical, creative, and scientific) and the writing and reading skills I developed with me throughout my time at Yale."

                "Strengths were basically everything: Prof Wright is an amazing teacher and person in general, organized the class very well into units that focused on one \"lens\" of the broad topic of musical genius, the readings were all interesting and relevant, and the projects were fun as well. Biggest weakness was honestly the fact that we would always run out of time to finish our class discussions.",
                "A strength would definitely be Professor Wright and the class environment she created for discussion.",
                "The strengths of this course stem from its amazing professor. Lindsay Wright is truly knowledgeable and passionate about music and musicology, so her insights into every reading and comment were truly inspiring and interesting. She is also a more than understandable professor that asks its students to do their best, and also pushes them to do so. The only thing I could recommend for Prof. Wright to do is to have resources regarding writing and reading to be more readily available in the files section of the course.",
                "I thought all the material and readings were well organized and insightful, as well as the assignments. However, sometimes class felt a bit disorganized.",
                "The strengths of this class was the teaching style and assignments. It was a very freeing class and didn't feel suffocating for it being a seminar class. I also think Professor Wright was a great instructor and her enthusiasm and energy was effective in keeping me engaged and active. I would say a weaknesses was having no set office hours for shy people that would be too scared to email her.",
                "One of the big strengths of the course was the reading summaries. There were assigned readings each class, and you were given the option of summarizing whichever one you liked. The summaries ensured you understood the material thoroughly while also demonstrating sufficient knowledge necessary for class discussion.",
                "Class was so much fun. It was always a highlight of my week. The course structure (with the units focusing on contradictions in genius narratives) taught me to complicate my opinions and allow myself to believe both sides of an argument.",
                "Weekly summaries coupled with plenty of class-wide discussions and debates created the perfect environment for me to set aside any preconceived notions and learn from my peers and the authors we discussed. Our final Genius Show Scripts seemed like a perfect ending to an eye-opening and incredibly enjoyable class."

                "Yes! Absolutely! This was an awesome first year seminar: I learned a lot about an interesting topic from an incredible professor, the workload was very manageable, and as someone who was taking an otherwise stem-requirement-heavy courseload, this class was a breath of fresh air. If you can secure a spot in this class, it's one of the best you'll take as a freshman.",
                "Absolutely, I had a great experience with this class and really appreciated the way it made me reconsider the meaning of genius, musically and generally.",
                "Yes. This seminar class is interesting and engaging, and the skills received are invaluable. The environment in the classroom is welcoming, no matter the level in writing or music that one might think would be relevant to the class. Prof. Wright is truly one of the most passionate teachers I've ever had the fortune to be taught by, and she built this course to near perfection, not only by her knowledge (one could even call \"genius\"), but also through continued communication and feedback from her students.",
                "I would recommend this class for anyone interested in learning about how we can classify musical genius or genius in general. It is less so based on learning different musical geniuses but more so as to why they are classified as musical geniuses.",
                "Yes, I think it was a really engaging first-year seminar.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because of just how interesting the topic is alone. Besides that, the class was intellectually stimulating, their were minimal assignments throughout the year, the professor was amazing(both at teaching and as a person), and the class was genuinely fun.",
                "I absolutely would as music is an integral part of everyone's lives, and this course underscores the inequity and discrimination throughout the art. The Yale music department as a whole is fantastic, and this course is representative of that fact.",
                "Yes! This is such a fun class, and you will learn a lot. It is a reasonable workload, and the writing feedback is direct and very helpful.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student, whether they have any prior musical experience or not. It was a wonderful way to have open discussions, intellectual debates, and enjoyable conversation."
