I feel like I have a lot of the tools and requisite knowledge needed to continue in my future French studies. This class does not involve a lot of speaking in the class setting, so while I can write and read very well for just an introductory course, I find listening and speaking still very difficult due to the limited amount of repetitions we get in such a fast-paced course.",
                "This class is very intensive! The workload is pretty high which is great for learning the language, but can be overwhelming if you have other high-workload courses as well.",
                "I thought the strengths were the immersion method we were taught with. I also found all the course materials extremely helpful. Another strength was the collaboration with my classmates. I can't think of any weaknesses.",

You dont have to speak the language at all or have taken any french classes before, which is great for those who are very literally just beginning french. This class will get you into shape in no time and soon you will be comfortable speaking rather basic french.",
