                "Definitely reshaped a lot of my understanding of how psychology has been used in really dangerous ways. I have a different understanding of how capitalism has been a really key part of racism and slavery and how that has directly set up a lot of the ways the US operates.",
                "Interesting to see the roles of science in maintaining systems of inequality throughout history and helped to see when these factors are at play\/ focus on and understand histories of people of diverse backgrounds.",

I learned a lot of things that I did not know about society as well and how to better understand how systems of inequality and racism have shaped society, as well as how psychology has been involved in these unethical applications. I learned how to be a more well-informed psychologist as well and how I can conduct research that does not perpetuate systems of inequality.",

                "The professor went in with no plan. There were 0 lectures that he planned ahead. This guy would walk into a 50 person lecture and simply stammer around and ask the crowd if they had questions about the reading (which he could not answer, as the Processor himself did not do the readings).",
                "Content was good, but the structure of the content\/course was sometimes confusing, particularly in the beginning of the semester. This class should be a seminar, but if it continues as a lecture, it would be helpful to have presentations\/slides.",
                "The readings are really interesting and I think it's the right amount of readings (not too much or too little). I think the essays are an effective way of engaging with the class material, but I think students would have benefitted from more guidance on how to balance summarizing the class material with our own thesis argument. I will say, though, I didn't really get much out of lectures... they were kind of unorganized which was especially a shame since they were required.",
                "This class really didn't feel like a psychology class at all, mostly just \"history of racism, colonialism, etc.\" If this interests you the class is great, but if you're looking to learn about psychology\/its role at all this class isn't good. Classes were mostly lectures that weren't really relevant as the professor went on tangents unrelated to the readings\/papers, so homework readings were also ultimately pointless for the class. The class was super easy though, didn't have to pay attention in lecture too much and homework wasn't too much work.",
                "I think it's difficult in a class of this size, but I would have loved more opportunity for discussion!",
                "The content and readings were great, but the lectures were a bit unorganized\/could go in any direction. It could also be repetitive.",
                "could be improved with less group discussion, and more in depth powerpoints to help bring students back to the focus of the lecture. Also maybe a more clear syllabus structure and class plan so we know what is going on for each class",
                "The content of this course is really important but the overall organization of it made it difficult to engage with.",
                "Strength: informative group discussions Weakness: a bit disorganized - I think this class could be improved if it were taught in conjunction with Professor Khanwho has a background in historyand a psychology professor. I think the addition of a psychology professor could help shape the course in a way that appeals more to psychology majors.",
                "This course was very disorganized. I was unclear with the subject matter for each class, which made assignments very difficult.",
                "Lecturing was boring but readings were interesting",
                "Strengths: Passionate professor, interesting content, manageable workload\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were unstructured (but this could be a pro because we had good discussions) and it could be unclear what information was important to know (but this could be considered not a weakness from an educational perspective where it's more important to learn than just know what is needed for graded assignments)",
                "The strength of this course is substantially just having such a robust and rigorous course that brings to awareness the violence of racism and colonialism in the history of psychology taught by an incredibly knowledgeable and passionate Professor like Professor Khan and the Teaching Fellow he chose who were also just as passionate and dynamic.. The weakness is that this course is NOT a core requirement for an undergraduate degree or any degree at Yale as the substance of the curriculum in essential in raising awareness of biases and prejudice and their influence in the academy and how they continue to shape and influence society",
                "One strength from this course is the sizeit wasnt too big or too small. It was the perfect amount that allowed the TFs to help\/connect with us on a one-on-one basis. However, most of the time, I wasnt entirely sure what parts of the lesson I was supposed to take notes on.",
                "I'd like to talk about the readings more and how they fit into the broader unit themes of what we learn. I feel like the readings were more separate from the lectures than not.",
                "This may have been one of the worst courses I have taken at Yale. It was wholly unorganized, lectures were a repetition of the readings, and no new material was provided in class except during the guest lectures. The material is important but this course needs to be restructured if it is to ever be taught again.",
                "Could not be improved",
                "The readings were FANTASTIC! Although a few of the lectures were a bit slow or repetitive, the class was fantastic and I learned a lot from it.",
                "one strength is that the content we learned was often very interesting and enlightening. What we learned was often extrapolated to the present and could explain many systems we see in our society today and don't think to question. The content was often very interesting and relevant. One weakness is that lectures were a bit boring and hard to follow sometimes.",

                "No. Poorly executed course. You are expected to learn entirely on your own by doing the readings, as you will gain zero information from the lecture (that is not an exaggeration, this professor literally just wasted an hour of my time twice a week failing to accomplish anything academically productive) .",
                "I would recommend this course, but only if it went through some changes (ie. become a seminar or start having lecture slides). Without visual lecture slides, it was difficult to follow the professor's train of thought. Unfortunately, there was also a particular student in this class who spoke condescendingly towards others and took up a majority of classroom time. My experience in this class was negatively impacted by this student.",
                "I would! If you're going into a psychology field especially, you should be aware of the background of what you're learning and help that inform the ways you go about your work in the future.",
                "Only if they are going to put in a lot of self-driven work to do the readings and think about the material. If they are just going to go to lecture to try to get anything out of the course, then no. Also, be aware that attendance in lectures is mandatory (they make you sign in), which is especially annoying since they are not super interesting.",

                "Yes, some of the drawbacks were due the organization of the class but I believe it had to do with it being taught for the first time.",
                "To other psychology majors, probably not. Its very important to understand the relationship between psychology and colonialism\/racism, but I personally didnt find it as interesting as traditional psychology classes. As is implied by the name, this class is very history heavy and requires history skills to succeed, so psychology majors without experience in this field might struggle or find it boring.",
                "Yes",
                "No. I think the idea of this kind of course is great and definitely contains material students should learn about, but it was executed very poorly. I do not feel like I gained anything from this course.",
                "Good gut class. Learned more about the colonial history of psychology. Very much a history rather than psych course.",
                "Yes, I think it contains a lot of important information to know. Even if you are not a psychology major, it is very informative and important to know. These are things that I feel like everyone should know but you aren't really formally taught.",
                "Again....this course is easy to recommend as the strength of this course is substantially just having such a robust and rigorous course that brings to awareness the violence of racism and colonialism in the history of psychology taught by an incredibly knowledgeable and passionate Professor like Professor Khan. The weakness is that this course is NOT a core requirement for an undergraduate degree or any degree at Yale as the substance of the curriculum in essential in raising awareness of biases and prejudice and their influence in the academy and how they continue to shape and influence society",
                "Sure, the material is interesting and definitely worth learning about (especially if youre a psych major).",
                "Yes. Tariq Khan is amazing!",
                "Absolutely not. Do not take this course. Instead, ask for the syllabus and engage with the readings. You will get the same out of the course. It is not worth sitting through 2 mandatory 1.5 hour classes every week. Theyre, frankly, a waste of time.",
                "Yes. It is a really different course to others Ive taken. It is critical of the inequalities of the institution that is Yale and I learned to much about the history of psychology. I am an international student and it was very useful to gain understanding of major historical events in the US such as the enslavement, indigenous history and processes such as settler colonialism",
                "Yes!! This is a class that everyone at Yale should take, regardless of major! The readings were incredible and the class discussions were very informative.",
                "I would if you are interested in history! And don't mind a class very reading\/ essay heavy (even though the essays are short).",
                "Yes,\r\n\r\nDont expect to learn about Freud and Skinner you will learn about the emergence of colonialism and its relationship to behavior studies. Overall interesting class",
