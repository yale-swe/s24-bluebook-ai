                "I think the virtual format made this course slightly weaker than it would have been in person. But strengths: Tina Lu is great. Zhang Laoshi is also really nice. Weaknesses: I often felt lost because I'm bad at history.",
                "I think the class was very well organized. Section could have been more fruitful, but that's probably just a side effect of being virtual.",
                "I think the strength of this course is definitely the professor -- Tina Lu is a goddess! I really liked how she engaged the students and the breakout rooms were also very successful. If anything, I would've loved longer discussion times as well as input from TFs in our discussions",
                "Strengths: Professor Lu is incredibly understanding and open to help her students, the texts are well selected and follow a chronological progression, the weekly assigned reading is manageable, the workload is reasonable and engaging, Break-out rooms (Zoom Semester) helped facilitate conversation during lecture, and the material is truly interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Hard to grasp the very broad philosophical concepts in such a short amount of time. I found that many of the passages I chose for projects required deeper knowledge of Buddhism, Confucianism, Ruism, Daoism, etc., (but Professor Lu and the GAs will help you navigate the readings if you ask).",
                "Recorded lectures would have been good",
                "The breakout rooms were helpful at times, but midway through the semester I was really tired of Zoom and it was hard to engage.",
                "strengths: this is a WONDERFUL course that was specifically curated with students in mind. I really appreciated the adjustments made for COVID because I was able to study the material in this class because it was interesting, not because I was stressed out of my mind for the exams. I loved the breakout rooms and I felt like I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the material because of my level of engagement\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the last part of class after we came out of the breakout rooms I usually ended up doing something else because people were just repeating what was said in their breakout rooms. I would rather have heard directly from the professor.",
                "Strengths: the selection of passages that we read was diverse and very nicely captures the style and thinking of the authors; the professor is insightful about the content and very engaging; the breakout rooms pushed everyone to think hard about the material.\r\nWeaknesses: the prompts for the papers sometimes felt a bit vague.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lu was great, and so was my TA. The workload was pretty light but really intellectually rewarding and interesting. For homework, usually we'd just have to watch a short 10-15-minute asynchronous lecture and read a text. I appreciated the flexibility we had in choosing what we wanted to do for our projects. Most of all, the course material is fascinating. Weaknesses: Breakout rooms were hit or miss. Sometimes I'd have great discussions, but sometimes things just wouldn't click with the random group of people I was assigned. Still, I appreciated the passages that Professor Lu gave us to analyze.",
                "A lot of readings",
                "This course is very geared toward participation and discussion which made it interesting and enjoyable. It was also a good course for me personally to learn more about Chinese history and my own heritage.",
                "The class covers a lot of interesting material and the readings are great. Prof T's lectures are particularly great. But, the breakout room organization was terrible. It was a grandiose waste of time in most classes. Of a 12 minute breakout room, we could easily spend 6 minutes sitting in silence. It was really unpleasant.",
                "More time would be good, maybe split this course into a two term course",
                "This course was great at presenting material and explaining the historical context of the texts we read. I think sometimes the expectations for the three projects were sometimes vague.",
                "I thought this course was PERFECT for remote learning. The readings were not overwhelming, the lectures informative, the breakout rooms gave us a rest from sitting in front of the screen and taking notes for hours, the assignments were well-planned with the students and their differing circumstances throughout the fall semester in mind, and the professor and TAs were accessible.",
                "Strengths: No boring class - each class, I was challenged with considering how my readings for that day intersected with its historical era, as well as other documents from the same period\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps some classes could be pure lectures",
                "The strengths of this course include the interesting primary sources, Professor Lu's engaging lecturing, and the chance to discuss with classmates each class despite being online. Professor Lu was also very clear about grading and assignments, and she was super understanding about how the pandemic affected everyone greatly, so I really did feel like the emphasis was on learning how to read and engage with texts rather than coming to a singular correct interpretation or aiming for a certain grade. The only possible weakness is that not all of the TAs were from the EALL department, so some of them were interacting with the content from class for the first time. While I was fortunate enough to have a TA who was very well-versed in class content and really made discussion sections a lot more engaging, some of my friends who had different TAs voiced that their discussion sections were often stale and quiet since the TA also did not have the ability to pose leading questions when conversation died out.",
                "I thought the readings for the course were great and gave a good range of perspectives on Chinese thought. I enjoyed the intellectual journey through time as we read texts in many different genres over 3000 years of Chinese history.\r\n\r\nI was disappointed that there were some readings we never got around to discussing. Our discussion of some philosophical and religious concepts felt kind of surface-level at times, but it's obviously going to be difficult to appreciate such foreign modes of though in a limited time. I also found the writing assignments (which generally asked for close analysis or comparison of a very short passage) lended themselves more to nitpicking small details (that might've just been artifacts of translation) than developing a really deep or holistic understanding.",
                "Strengths: lots of content, enjoyable lecture activities (breakout rooms)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: maybe include more supplemental materials\/notes on Canvas in addition to the texts?",
                "The live lecture is very engaging with many interesting stories and texts. The pre-recorded lecture is helpful to understand the historical context. The TFs are extremely helpful with the papers as well as leading the discussion.",
                "The section portion of the course was great. I was able to learn a lot during section. I also liked the podcast option for the projects",
                "Very engaging lectures and discussion sections. Group work for each lecture is very fun and effective. Discussion sections allow students to analyze and dive deeper into the texts.",
                "As a Chinese American, this course had readings that I personally found interesting as I could relate them to my own cultural background. However, I had difficulty understanding some of the trends Professor Lu was trying to point out during class and in her pre recorded lectures. It might be that I am not an experienced humanities student, but a lot of the times I found myself asking \"why is this significant.\"",
                "Strengths: The asynchronous lectures were always amazing. The assignments were very fun and not too difficult. The projects were so fun and gave you a lot of creative freedom for ways that you want to engage with the texts you could do essays, videos, podcasts, art projects, anything really! Professor Lu is wonderfully supportive. The TAs all clearly care a lot about the class. You get to interact with tons of really interesting texts. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: In the bi-weekly lectures, Professor Lu consistently split us up into breakout rooms to encourage us to interact with and talk about the texts together and then have one person report our findings back to the rest of the group. This took a lot of time and I think was much less interesting than if Professor Lu just spent the whole time sharing more of her insights with me. People make disagree with me on this, and to be fair, Professor Lu also produced asynchronous lectures which were entirely her twice a week, so we definitely got our fair share of her insights. I just wish we had more of that in the synchronous lecture sections, as well.",
                "Excellent readings, lectures, and sections. I had no complaints!",
                "Strengths: Prof. T and her passion for both the course material and her students! She was always open to feedback and trying to make sure we had the best experience possible, even over virtual learning. Weaknesses: breakout rooms were sometimes awkward, but that's the nature of them when inserted into large classes. I did enjoy talking things through with my classmates, and we also were given the opportunity to present our thoughts from the breakout rooms (which I thought was a strength).",
                "This was a great course. Good class engagement, not too much work, and very interesting lectures and readings.",
                "Even through sometimes I wished that we could spend a little more time on some texts compared to the others, I think the course stayed very true to the nature of the course, which was a broad overview of important writings throughout Chinese history."

                "Pre-recorded lectures were helpful. I think it would also be nice to have recorded the parts of the live lectures that weren't breakout room discussions. However, I understand that doing so might end up encouraging people to not show up to live lecture and discussions.",
                "The breakout rooms were rough at first, but I actually really enjoyed them by the end. If you really didn't want to be the reporter you could try to avoid it, but there wasn't really a reason to. It was very low stress. Maybe the only improvement would be to have some easy breakout rooms with no reporter and no TA so they could be more loose and social. The mini lectures were good and longer ones usually coincided with shorter readings so it balanced out. I think the class succeeded in being a bright spot among chaos. Section could be improved by making it more engaging. Maybe have students submit questions before every section?",
                "I think the breakout rooms were very successful! If anything, I would've loved if lectures could have been recorded (or pre-recorded), if not the discussion as well.",
                "The break out rooms during lecture helped engage students with the new material presented. Additionally, the smaller Zoom discussion sections were useful for asking questions and delving deep into the texts. I also enjoyed the weekly videos where we could take notes and listen at our own pace.",
                "Asynchronous lectures were good",
                "Asynchronous lectures before the class were helpful to get situated.",
                "succeeded: assignments, zoom breakout rooms\r\n\r\nimproved: the time after we got back to the breakout rooms. I would have wanted something more robust from Dr. Lu instead of listening to other students.",
                "I would say everything worked really smoothly for this class (including pre-recorded lectures, breakout room discussions, and discussion sections)!",
                "I liked all of the practices! The asynchronous and synchronous lectures were both great. It maybe would have been helpful to have copies of the slides, since it's hard to absorb all of the material in the moment, and the lectures weren't recorded. I don't know if the breakout rooms could have been improved even more. The beginning-of-semester tweaks (e.g., having a TA assign a reporter) helped a bit. But ultimately I think it came down to the initiative of us, the students.",
                "The prerecorded lectures were really helpful in setting up the historical context before each class, so we knew what was happening in the era of each text.",
                "I wish the live lectures could have been recorded but I understand there might have been some logistics and other issues with doing this. However, I appreciated that the asynchronous lectures were posted promptly every week and any class announcements were conveyed very clearly via email.",
                "Prof T had a mix of pre-recorded lectures and live virtual lectures as well as break out session during the synchronous sessions",
                "Everything succeeded -- I appreciated how Professor Lu had the students' health and well-being in mind while successfully teaching a course on Chinese literature and tradition.",
                "Succeeded: The breakout rooms allowed for students to be engaged with the material at a high degree\r\n\r\nImprovements: For the Chinese section, it would be good to have written expectations far in advance of the deadlines for the various assignments since they differed from the expectations given to the regular class",
                "By making the smaller assignments completion grades, I think Professor Lu took a lot of stress and pressure of the students, which was really helpful since everyone was already facing so many challenges due to the pandemic. I also thought her use of breakout rooms was great for facilitating discussion among students even though we weren't physically together, and randomly assigning reporters to speak in class was also a good way for us to familiarize ourselves with each other. The use of discussion sections was also helpful since it allowed us to dig deeper into specific texts and was another good chance for students to meet each other.",
                "Breakout room activities were greatmade the large lecture feel small, and gave everyone a chance to discuss and speak in class",
                "The break out room works out quite well, as we always have the chance to express our ideas and thoughts in class even though this class have a lot of students.",
                "both the lecture and discussion formats allowed for effective virtual engagement.",
                "Prerecorded lectures were helpful as they provided a resource to constantly refer back to. We also used breakout rooms every class. I thought this was an interesting idea, but many may have been discouraged from participating because the activities we were given were a bit vague in terms of what it was asking.",
                "The asynchronous lectures were wonderful. All of the creative projects this semester were amazing and really engaging. In general the course worked very well over Zoom, and Professor Lu clearly spent a lot of time thinking of all the different ways we could use the tech not as limitations but as advantages. Also, Professor Lu was more than accommodating and approached these turbulent times with a real sense of support, kindness, and mentorship, and that makes all the difference. \r\n\r\n My only slight critique is that In the bi-weekly lectures, Professor Lu consistently split us up into breakout rooms to encourage us to interact with and talk about the texts together and then have one person report our findings back to the rest of the group. This took a lot of time and I think was much less interesting than if Professor Lu just spent the whole time sharing more of her insights with me. People make disagree with me on this, and to be fair, Professor Lu also produced asynchronous lectures which were entirely her twice a week, so we definitely got our fair share of her insights. I just wish we had more of that in the synchronous lecture sections, as well.",
                "I think the course handled the pandemic excellently. There was sufficient communication, and the professors handled discussions and class events in an organized and patient manner.",
                "See above.",
                "The use of zoom breakout rooms was good.",
                "Professor Lu did an amazing job of converting the course to an online format. The in-class breakout rooms were, for the most part, very engaging and informative. The asynchronous lectures were also very helpful in introducing background and context for many texts."

                "I would if you truly find the material interesting.",
                "Yes. Prof T is really nice and understanding. The material gave me a lot to ponder, especially the early material. I had no prior experience with any of the Chinese Tradition, so everything was completely new to me. I also loved the stories towards the end of the class. It also wasn't too much work which made the class much easier to enjoy. SPOILERS AHEAD: I was legitimately sad when the Qing dynasty fell after learning about the dynastic system all semester.",
                "Yes. You can learn a lot of cultural code in this course, enough to pick up some Chinese writing (perhaps in translation...) and with a decent likelihood think, \"Oh, I understand this reference!\" The professor is amazing and passionate about her subject, and she never fails to present the issues of those dead, elite, Chinese men (it can feel like a self-aware cousin of DS sometimes) in a relatable way. Still, those who are more interested in history or philosophy might find it a little difficult to adapt to the kind of analysis we do.",
                "Yes!! If you're interested in ancient Chinese texts at all (or philosophy or anything), definitely take this course. Also really helped me with being more comfortable in a seminar scenario. Loved this class!",
                "Absolutely! If you want a nice introduction the Chinese philosophy, this is the perfect course. You will get to touch upon all the major ideas and learn from a really experienced professor. Professor Lu is incredible and her teaching fellows are incredibly responsive. Professor Lu was very considerate of the extenuating circumstances of this year. She condensed the material and required fewer assignments, but it did not impact how engaging the class was at all. The course places real emphasis on reading and mentally interacting with the texts rather than handing in tons of assignments. I wish I could take this course again. Recommend to any student, any major, with any knowledge level (including none at all) of Chinese culture.",
                "Yes. Everything is clearly explained in this course.",
                "Yes definitely. Prof T is the best and she really emphasized learning during this course rather than grades.",
                "YES. Definitely. Everyone should take this class. First of all, Dr. Lu is one of the kindest, most understanding people ever. It was a pleasure to be in her class and I wish it could have been in person because she is the sweetest. Her understanding and empathy during COVID really put me at ease. I also think her enthusiasm made the class much more enjoyable and accessible. The course content is fascinating, and Dr. Lu puts it all into perspective and really works hard to facilitate student learning. If any part of you is interested in China, take this class.",
                "Yes, it's a great class to take because it improves reading and writing in general, and at the same time it is also an excellent introduction to Chinese literature. I really appreciated the wide range of texts that we read.",
                "Absolutely! The course material is fascinating, and covers so much that you're bound to find at least part of the course interesting. The projects were fun and also helped me learn. Also, Professor Lu is spectacular. She was very caring and flexible but still held us to a high standard of learning.",
                "If you are interested in Chinese thought and history",
                "Yes, I think this course is very different from most other courses at Yale and would be a nice break from traditional courses. The readings were actually very interesting (more like stories) and did not feel like a chore to read like other academic or scientific articles often do.",
                "Yes, I enjoyed the course and would recommend it",
                "Yes! Covers a lot of interesting material from a wide range of Chinese history and not very heavy workload.",
                "Yes, great class",
                "Yes! I am a non-native Chinese speaker who does not learn history well through regular history courses, so looking at history and tradition and culture through the lens of different types of literature helped introduce me to the rich history of China! I loved this course and think that anybody willing to learn more about the Chinese culture should take the course. Professor Lu is amazing and fosters an inclusive environment that makes you feel comfortable in participating and learning.",
                "Yes, it was impressively comprehensive for an ambitious overview of thousands of years of Chinese history. The course helped me situate men like Confucius, Mengzi, and others in the Chinese intellectual tradition against their legacies and intellectual descendants, helping me see strands that connect across different dynasties and eras which I would have missed otherwise.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone and everyone! Taking this course was one of the best decisions I've made during my time at Yale, and this is the one course that I truly believe to emphasize the learning process and developing skills over grades. Professor Lu is such an understanding and funny person, and her lectures are always super interesting. She also selects a wonderful variety of primary sources that differ in form, content, and identities of the authors. The workload is very manageable, and while the projects sometimes take a bit of thought to get started on, they really pushed me to look at certain texts in a completely new light and I found myself feeling super proud of the results each time. I also want to emphasize that while it was probably possible to cruise by in this class and still do well in terms of grades even while doing the bare minimum, that would be such a wasted opportunity. The more I put into this class, the more I got out of it, and the more I found myself appreciating the texts we were reading. I really cannot recommend this class enough, and I really do urge anyone who takes this class to always put forth their best effort because it is such a rewarding experience.",
                "I'd recommend this as a relatively low-workload Hu or Wr, with a few caveats. First of all, if you've already read many of the classic Chinese texts or know a lot about them, this class isn't for you. The readings are the core of the class. Also, this year the class was pretty much a gut, with a very generous grading scheme, but it seems there are usually exams (there were none this year due to remote learning), so it may be a bit more demanding other years.",
                "Yep, great course, Prof T is super kind and very knowledgeable",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes I would !",
                "Yes, if you are interested in the chinese culture or hope to learn more about it.",
                "If they have a natural background in humanities or interest in Chinese culture specifically, yes. If you are looking for a gut but still want to feel like you learned something, no.",
                "I would recommend this course to anybody interested in China; the study of traditions; great works of literature, philosophy, political thought, and more; East Asia; thinking about how we read texts in general; and people who are up for engaging with texts in ways other than just essays.",
                "Yes, it was a great supplement to other Chinese language and history classes I've taken.",
                "Yes! Prof. T is amazing and everyone should take a course with her :) The course isn't too much work, but you get what you put in -- if you listen to the pre-class lectures, do the readings, and engage in class and in section, you will learn a ton and enjoy everything!",
                "Yes! It is super interesting and non-stressful. Perfect for people who are scared of humanities classes or want to ease their way into them.",
                "Yes absolutely! This class is especially amazing if someone is looking to complete a Writing credit but values learning history as well!"
