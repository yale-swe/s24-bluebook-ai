                "This class provided a broad overview of philosophical and literary conceptions of individual and group identity throughout the modern era, from the work of Rousseau to 21st-century literary fiction. It enabled students to build analytical skills through readings, essays, and discussion while encouraging students to consider and share the ways in which the readings influenced their own opinions and beliefs.",
                "Learned about a VERY broad topic (identity theory) through the lens of literature and philosophy of the last couple centuries. Again, this class was often very broad but I think the syllabus was crafted in a very interesting way. This is a great class for people who like analyzing literature in a more philosophy-esque way or philosophy in a more literature-esque way if that makes sense. Felt very interdisciplinary and unconstrained by its form, which is cool."

                "While for the most part I felt that this course was very well put together it was also quite chaotic at times. We only had two graded assignments, a midterm paper and a final paper, and even though I don't mind having so few assignments it would have been nice to receive a bit more guidance from the professor. Another issue I had is that the amount of weekly reading we were assigned rarely compared to what we actually discussed in class. There were multiple occasions where we had been assigned hundreds of pages of reading, only to discuss a small amount (or none) of it. It would have been nice to read less and spend more time focusing on what we did read.",
                "very very interesting syllabus, I really think this class should've somehow limited itself a bit more but I don't know how. Maybe we needed a range of years for identity theory or something like that. I guess the nature of a class like this is that there are NO answers but this was a really fun class where I got to contemplate the nature of consciousness. \r\nWeaknesses- discussions sometimes felt unstructured and unhinged, I think we could've benefited from guiding discussion questions sometimes to make sure that different members of the class didn't go off on different tangents",
                "What is both difficult about this course (but also, in many ways a truly generative part of it as well) is that the concepts of \"identity\" as well as what constitutes \"modern though\" are so vague and indeterminate. I definitely did not come away from the semester with a theory of what \"identity\" is (which I imagine is part of the point of the course), and many of the authors we read at different points in the semester are thinking about the question of identity in entirely different, often incommensurable terms. But that's also what makes the class so interesting. The vagueness and generality of the course theme and the huge range of texts that it covers gives you an opportunity to really figure out what speaks to you, and to pursue those questions further in the papers and outside reading. \r\n\r\nI do think that perhaps the course could be divvied up better into seperate sub-themes or units. It was often unclear why one week followed the other, and though the class moved forward *somewhat* chronologically, I think that it would be helpful if there was a slightly more intentional way of moving through the weeks, or a way of grouping weeks according to specific themes or questions.\r\n\r\nThe strength of this course is the intensity of Professor Barasch's engagement. \"Identity\" is a concept that often lends itself to really reductive, lazy thinking, and I was just so consistently inspired by Professor Barasch's probing, penetrating questions and his constant encouragement to think in more nuanced ways. He is a model of humanist intellectual engagement.",
                "The course was full of great and very interesting texts from a variety of authors, but I sometimes felt like I wasn't sure how individual topics related to the idea of identity."

                "I would recommend it, but with the caveat that it is quite a bit of work and effort - if you're looking for an easy fifth class, this is not the one to take. The readings were all very challenging and even though we didn't have many papers, we did have weekly reading responses which took quite a bit of time. I also would only recommend this to people who like enthusiastic class discussions. If you really enjoyed Directed Studies, you will probably like this class.",
                "Yes, and I think this class would be really even better in an in-person setting. However, I would add the caveat that this is one of those classes that is much more about being in a small seminar setting and having interesting discussions than it is about learning anything particular. You may leave this class feeling like you are right where you started. But you will get very interesting context on classical humanities thinkers as well as some more \"fresh\" authors",

It includes both general theories of identity and more specific units such as racial and gender identity. A great way to familiarize yourself with some classic thinkers by relating them to modern identity issues."
