                "This class was AMAZING because Professor Clark is just great. She loves to hear student input and the class is largely discussion-based. I got to know my fellow classmates better, as well as Professor Clark. The workload was very reasonable and the class was very enjoyable all around.",
                "Overall great course. However, the prompts for the assignments (only 3 10-page papers) got a little repetitive, so that could perhaps be changed.",
                "prof. is AMAZING",
                "The course material was very interesting and always fun to discuss in class. The readings and assignments were manageable, which was great. It could have been more organized in terms of the scheduling of assignments on the syllabus, but overall the class was good.",
                "Strengths: Really interesting papers and incorporation of student contribution/thoughts from reading responses \r\nWeaknesses: Not enough structure to the class meetings",
                "It is a fantastic course. If I were to give it any small critique, it is that sometimes I felt we missed opportunities to dig deeper into ideas. It can fall into various students giving individual examples of a phenomenon without pushing further. However, when this depth is reached, it is wonderful.",
                "I loved the reading responses every week because you were reading a variety of papers to broaden your knowledge. I liked the questions for the papers that asked you to include your own thinking about a topic, not just do research and summarize. I don't have anything I would really change.",
                "I absolutely loved the course! I wouldnt change one thing. I think Professor Clark should keep her paper policy where we pick which 3 we wanted to do and when. This was extremely helpful when managing busy weeks and midterms/finals!! I also really liked how she allowed us to guide the conversations ourselves to any topics that fascinated us",
                "This course is amazing! It was one of my favorite psychology courses and probably courses at Yale. Professor Clark does so much to make the discussion engaging, exciting, and relevant. The papers are interesting and broad so you can chose topics of interests for you to focus on. The readings were great and I looked forward each week coming to class to discuss them.",
                "Professor Clark is incredible, and the format was engaging. The discussions were always great, and I started to look forward to this class every week. Some of the assignments were a bit badly formed, and some more thought could be given to the breadth and depth balance of the course."

                "Yes I would definitely recommend. Professor Clark is such a wonderful professor who is one of the top in her field. It was a great way to explore different topics without feeling like you were going to say the wrong thing.",
                "YES! Take this class! You get to have fascinating conversations about emotions that you probably have never deeply reflected on. This class really opens your mind and helps you understand yourself and others better. The class was such a delight that it didnt even feel too much like work. The papers can be really fun since you can develop your own theories and thoughts  about emotions",
                "Yes! For sure take this class, even if you are not a psychology major. I would say just be prepared for a lot of writing. We have three papers which are 8-10 pages, and 2 reading responses per week. But all of the assignments are engaging and I highly recommend even with this writing load.",
