                "Prof Chalioti is great, super pleasant and presents in an accessible way",
                "Strengths: the material was very interesting, and Prof. Chalioti presented it in an engaging manner. The weekly problem sets felt fair and were not overwhelming at all, and they reinforced learning of the material. We also got to do industry analyses, which I found to be a great experience. Weaknesses: sometimes the class felt a bit more like a small lecture than a seminar, so maybe some more discussion-based components would have been nice.",
                "Strengths: Professor Chalioti! She's so amazing, such an engaging lecturer and a caring professor. She cares about everyone's growth and offer so much help to everyone. The class is very well organized: all the documents are all up on Canvas in a timely manner. She holds a final review session that communicates expectations very clearly and there are no surprises on the final exam. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: In the latter half of the class, half of the class time is dedicated to student presentations, so the quality of the class depends on how well the student presentations are. This is one factor of uncertainty. But all of Prof's presentations are great, and I learned so much."

                "100% yes. As far as Economics senior seminars go, this is one of the best. It has the right balance between chill and work, and Prof. Chalioti is such a delight. You feel like you are really learning without feeling like you are drowning in the work. The material is interesting and applicable to the present day. I really loved this class.",
                "Yes. Professor Chalioti is enthusiastic and eager to see her students succeed. The course starts a little slow, but the material gets increasingly practical (and, in my opinion, interesting) as the semester goes on. Problem sets are helpful in reinforcing what was taught in class without requiring too much time to complete.",
                "Yes definitely! Professor Chalioti is such a fun and engaging professor. Her course is also very well structured and organized. Definitely a great course to class senior year because its one of the more chill Econ courses.",
                "YES! If you're interested in the theories of innovation or AI, this is a great class. It's also really relevant right now. Although the class is very theoretical, you get to learn about the different theories and understand the logic behind things.",
                "Professor Chalioti made this course very approachable and explained everything thoroughly. The course is very interesting if you want to learn about new technologies, including AI innovations."
