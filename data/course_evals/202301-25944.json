                "The strength of this course is the essay.  Being able to choose your own topic is really nice and Professor Schettini is really knowledgeable about the course in general. He is very helpful when you go to office hours and can recommend a lot of good places to look for sources. Also, the structure of the class forces you to work on your essay over the whole semester, so you don't have to scramble during reading week. \r\nThe weakness is the class discussion. Because everyone comes from a different level of prior knowledge, having a big discussion is really hard. I think Professor Schettini needs to assign more secondary sources because it would be helpful to have some knowledge about the the importance of these documents. It also might be helpful to have to do a reading response each week to make sure everyone is engaged with the sources.",
                "The course material is genuinely interesting, but engagement across the class was low. Perhaps the Professor could be a bit more inspired in convincing everyone to do the readings and contribute.",
                "It's just hard to focus with such a long class block. The readings and discussions, as well as a final project were strengths. Professor Schettini's feedback is amazing and unlike any other feedback I've gotten at Yale.",
                "I wish it were shorter and met twice a week because it was hard to stay focused the entire time.",
                "Strengths: great professor, interesting content, low workload. Weakness: sometimes seminar moved a bit slowly, and could focus on more historical background.",
                "The course itself is very well designed, with each week focusing on a different topic. I loved how the discussions would diverge from specific questions about the readings to larger questions about broad concepts."

                "I wouldn't recommend this course unless you want to learn more about the Age of Revolutions and have some background knowledge of the time period. I came in with almost none, and week to week, this course was hard to get through and I don't think I got as much out of it as someone who would have had more background knowledge.",
                "Absolutely! It's so interesting and a much better way to learn about important authors than big lecture halls.",
                "I really enjoyed Glauco's teacher and mentorship. He was always ready to help and go above and beyond.",
