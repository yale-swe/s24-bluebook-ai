I also gained knowledge on different resources to use in translation, and developed skills in finding a balance between literal and liberal translation styles. Additionally, this course really changed the way I read French and how I view translated pieces in general now, since I now understand all the thought that goes into a good translation."

                "I enjoyed the wide variety of texts, each with their own difficulties and interesting takeaways. I'm not sure there were many weaknesses since this class was exactly what it sounds like (ie translation), but sometimes the workshop format where you translate the text for homework and then pair up to discuss phrases that were challenging became a bit repetitive after a few weeks.",
                "The strengths of this course were Professor Waters' passion for translation and the interesting assortment of assignments we were given. I thought the pieces Professor Waters chose for us to work on were all very different in style and all posed different challenges, so each assignment was exciting. I also really enjoyed the workshop style of the course since I've never been able to work so closely with my peers before and have so much of a course centered on hands-on learning. I don't think this course had any weaknesses, and I hope the style of this course is maintained for the future."

                "I would recommend this course only to other students who are very confident in their French proficiency and who enjoy somewhat tedious work of literary analysis, dictionary scouring, and intensive editing. You really improve a lot over the semester and the work is worthwhile, but it can feel monotonous at times.",
                "Yes! But this was Prof Water's last semester teaching it and I imagine this course is very professor-dependent. The workload is very light (you translate around 500 words before class every week, one midterm in-class translation, one 2000 word final project) and then talk about the week's translation (as a group and in pairs). I understand that the best way to learn how to translate is to translate and that there may not be much to \"teach,\" so while I did gain a lot of experience I'm not sure I can articulate exactly what I've learned after this semester. My French didn't really improve, but that also isn't the goal of the class. So I would recommend taking it as a fun, low-stress class and if you think you'd enjoy translating.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any other student studying French! Although Professor Waters is retiring, she was such a passionate and inspiring professor. Also, this course was genuinely just a lot of fun. Having a course focus on the subtleties and nuances of language was genuinely such a dream for me, and this course really changed the way I read French and understand translation between any languages. This course also introduced me to so many different styles of literature and different authors, which I think any French student would greatly benefit from."
