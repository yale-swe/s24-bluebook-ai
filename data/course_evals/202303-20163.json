You review grammar, but, while important, it is not the primary focus of the course which is really nice. Instead, you focus more on the application of French, whether that be improving your understanding, writing, or speaking. You also bond with your class which is really nice! \r\nWeaknesses - Sometimes I felt like I was swamped with work if I ever got behind. So just DON'T GET BEHIND!! But the class only meets 3 times a week, so it's honestly not bad by any means",
                "Mme Schneider is a sweetheart and genuinely cares about everyone's learning in the class. My French speaking improved a lot as I was constantly pushed to think quickly and voice out my ideas in class. The assignments were also very fair; as long as you put in the work getting a good grade was not hard. The course was organized really well too."

                "YESSS!!! TAKE THIS COURSE!!! If you have any interest in pursuing French, whether that be for a certificate or a major or simply to learn the language, THIS CLASS IS FANTASTIC! I'm personally not majoring in French, but I was unsure whether I wanted to pursue learning the language in college, but this class genuinely reinvigorated my love for the language. Please take this class, it's genuinely such a great learning experience! Mme. Schneider is also an INCREDIBLE teacher. Once you become less intimidated by her signature French tough love, you realize how much fun she is and how much she cares about her students. MOST IMPORTANTLY, your confidence in yourself and your capabilities will increase so much throughout the term!",
