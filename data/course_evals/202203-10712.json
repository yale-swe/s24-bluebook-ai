                "I learned a lot of history about different Latin American cultures including a lot of people, art and music. My writing ability in Spanish has definitely improved.",
                "I learned about the past and gained a better understanding of how it has shaped the world we live in today, both within Latin American and outside of it. We learned about the people, events, and ideas that have influenced the development of human societies and cultures, as well as the ways in which these societies and cultures have interacted with each other, in a Latin American context. Through the study of LatAm history and culture, we also learned valuable lessons about the consequences of human actions and gain a greater appreciation for the complexity and diversity of the world we live in.",
                "This class gave me an overview of the history of Latin America from around the time of colonization to the present. We also were exposed to literature and films from different periods and countries. This class emphasized the complexity of Latin America, its similarities with countries in other parts of the world, and how \"Latin America\" is a term imposed from the outside, and many countries in the region do not see themselves as part of a cohesive group. This course also strengthened my listening comprehension and academic writing in Spanish.",
                "I learned so much about the history of Latin American countries. Professor Gonzlez-Prez gave lectures that explored centuries of history, both politically and culturally. I understand a lot more about what has led to some of the economic and political states of specific Latin American countries and their interactions nationally and internationally.",
                "I learned a lot of Latin American history with topics including music, culture, politics, and more.",
                "Very true to the syllabus and course description, Latin American history from colonization to present time! Professor Anibal mostly assigned readings from a small textbook but also made learning fun by assigning some movies, documentaries, and music.",
                "Insight into the history of other cultures. Important events in other cultures.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of Latin America and became a stronger spanish listener, writer, and reader.",
                "Broad overview of Latin American history from the colonial era to the present",
                "Received a high level overview of Latin American history - major events and perspectives. There was a lot of information to cover, so we did not go into a lot of detail with many topics in lecture, but there were a lot of materials that covered additional information if you were interested.",
                "Honestly this was just a latin american history course, not culture.",
                "spanish",
                "I learned a lot about Latin American history through close-ups of historical events like wars of independence and the Cold War. I also got a more in depth look at specifics of the conquest of the Americas from the indigenous vantage point.",
                "Information about Latin American history, an introduction to the Latin American archives in Sterling and Bass, and the development of the ability to write in Spanish",
                "I learned about the vast and complex history that covers what is today Latin America. The class was a lecture-style class in spanish which took some getting used to as all my language classes in the past have been very participation based.",
                "Taking this class, I became far more comfortable listening to and understanding native Spanish speakers as the course as well as all the course readings were entirely in Spanish. Prior to this class, I had never taken a language course entirely in the language of study so this was a course which fully bettered me as a global citizen.",
                "Learned about the development of Latin American societies from 1492 to the present day. Focused on indigenous perspectives and interactions with European conquistadors. Political, social, and economic relations from different cultures were studied.",
                "The course expanded my vocabulary and had me learning the language and culture primarily through listening. This was a stark difference relative to previous classes that were designed for learning through speaking.",
                "I learned a lot of basic knowledge about Latin American cultures, enough to form the basis of several research projects.",
                "Some practice reading, writing, and interpreting spoken Spanish, along with a fair amount of knowledge about Latin American culture.",
                "Learned a lot about Latin American history, current events, literature.",
                "A lot of culture background on Latin America(in the form of films, music, journalism), vocabulary from a number of different Spanish speaking countries, historical knowledge",
                "I learned a lot about historical events and key figures in the development of Latin American culture. As a non-native speaker, this class also improved my listening comprehension skills significantly, as I had never been in a class taught 100% in Spanish before.",
                "I learned some about the cultures of Latin America especially before the quizzes but beyond the quizzes it was difficult to stay engaged given the lecture format.",
                "I felt that I got very little out of this Spanish class.  All of Latin American culture is impossible to encapsulate in a semester class, and trying to made it difficult to focus on one area for more than a class.  I did not practice my Spanish at all this semester as participation was rare and there was no discussion section offered.",

            "comments": [
                "A strength of this course is the large amount of different topics that are covered throughout the semester. It is definitely an information overload, in a good way. A weakness is the lack of student engagement with the lecture class. It is difficult to get students to participate but there were never really many opportunities to do so. I wish there was more interaction between the student and the professor.",
                "It was well-organized and easy to navigate, with clearly defined learning objectives and a variety of engaging learning materials and activities, such as novels, short stories, movies, and songs. The course provided ample opportunities for student interaction and feedback, and was regularly monitored and updated by both the instructor and the single TA to ensure that it remains relevant and effective. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, this course provided support for other students who needed additional help or have special needs. The general vibe was that Prof. Anibal was very thoughtful, funny, and witty. Overall, a great class that effectively supported student learning and engagement.",
                "I think that the history and literature in this course are very valuable for giving people an overview of Latin America. The course was interdisciplinary, and incorporated history, literature, art, economics and politics. The quizzes were mainly focused on memorization of terms, so I learned less than if we were tested based on more conceptual short answer questions. The class did not have a discussion section, so there is little opportunity to practice speaking in Spanish.",
                "The workload was manageable, the readings were very informative, and the quizzes were a good opportunity to demonstrate understanding. A lot of weight is put in the final paper (maybe too much of the grade distribution), but the opportunity to research something of our own choosing and practice our writing abilities in spanish was useful and enjoyable.",
                "lectures could be more engaging",
                "This course is quite difficult if you are not a native speaker. Professor Gonzalez speaks very fast and with a thick accent. As a non-native speaker, I had a lot of trouble understanding him and staying engaged in lecture. Also, the quizzes are quite difficult.",
                "Strengths: Lectures are well made, quizzes are reasonable. Professor Anibal is cheerful and well versed in the history, his office hours are very approachable and his class was overall not bad to wake up for a 9am!\r\nWeaknesses: grade is very much unclear. By the syllabus it seems the final paper is worth about 65% and there is very little guidance on it, only a simple prompt and how to do citations. The course is mainly learning historical content and not about how to write/etc, so it seems a little odd that the paper weigh so much. I haven't gotten my grade back yet so maybe grading was reasonable!",
                "Was an interesting course. Weakness was lectures were not always engaging. The three quizzes were hard to study for as we did not get much guidance and they ended up being very niche. One paper being the majority of a grade is unfair because students do not receive any guidance or feedback to help them do well. Final project was a blind assignment.",
                "Strengths: engaging subject matter overall\r\nWeaknesses: very repetitive structure, not super engaging. I think I would have liked it better if we'd explored different lecture styles or had a section",
                "The strengths of the course is the content. I really enjoyed reading and learning more about Latin American history. However, the only downside in my opinion were the grade distribution, since so much rested on the essay and the quizzes. Perhaps implementing more assignments or instead of a large paper, three four page papers may be better to lessen the stress of the student. Those are the strengths and weaknesses of the course.",
                "Professor Gonzlez is a kind and engaging lecturer. You could learn a lot from the class, if you chose to engage with it - attend lectures, do the readings, etc. The final paper is 12-15 pages in Spanish, which was quite daunting for me, as it was also worth a large portion of the grade.",
                "quizzes were unreasonable",
                "Strengths - fair workload, interested lectures, professor who was passionate about the subject matter\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - oftentimes seemed like a history class just in another language",
                "Strengths were Professor Gonzlez Prezs passion for the material and the clarity of quiz material. The weakness was that no timeline was explicitly given for the final paper until the very end.",
                "The issue with this course was that there was a lot of information covered and the format of the quizzes made it very difficult to study. These were the hardest quizzes I have ever had to take and made the class quite stressful at times. In addition, since there is so much history to cover in Latin America, the content bounced around a lot and it was difficult to keep up at times. However, both the professor and the TF were always available and flexible with issues and to help understand the content.",
                "The weakness of this course was that the textbook readings started to not line up with the lectures about halfway through the course. While it would have been helpful to have additional readings as support, this also made it so that the work outside of class was minimal if there was not a quiz or the paper. A major strength of the course would be that you mainly have to study the lecture material for the quizzes, which is content covered in the slides and accessible to you outside of class. Also, a major strength are the review sessions and Professor Anibal! He is the most passionate teacher and LOVES the material!",
                "The course content, along with Professor Gonzalez's expertise and interest in the subject matter, made this course interesting. I believe it could have benefitted from a more structured exam or essay schedule, though.",
                "Strengths: unique perspective on indigenous rights and interactions, well-organized course, exposure to primary and secondary historical sources. \r\nWeaknesses: readings can be dense at times and slightly difficult to understand due to older Spanish terms, lecture format makes it hard to practice speaking Spanish.",
                "Strengths: Relatively easy to keep up with class expectations, interesting content that appeals to all students of Spanish, and helpful guidance for all assessments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of engagement with students, class was largely lecture-based (so we do a lot more listening than speaking, which is a positive and a negative at the same time)",
                "The needs to be more thought put into the course's graded assignments. There was very little incentive to engage with the material and the assignments themselves hardly facilitated learning.",
                "Strengths: kind and interesting professor who cares for his students \r\nWeaknesses: minimal class engagement and only three short quizzes and a final paper as assessments, your grade is almost entirely based off your final essay",
                "Strengths: Great class, really engaging!! I really appreciate the PowerPoints \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would like the quizzes to be worth more o the grade or at least that the final paper is not worth a majority of the grade",
                "The content choices were a strength; I feel like all concepts were given context and that the range of countries and regions studied varied a good amount. However, as it is a lot of content to consume, a major weakness of the course was the lack of engagement from students to ensure that we were retaining the information. The only requirement was to attend lecture, where most students didn't speak at all. 75 minutes of listening to the professor talk without ever speaking back or responding to what he was saying made it easy to miss information if you got distracted even for a second. I think the course would improve if we had discussion boards or in-class responses to make or something where students could practice their speaking and writing, which would help with information retention for quizzes. The course structure of only 3 small quizzes and a paper that's 65% of your grade is a lot. I wish the grade breakdown allowed for smaller engagement and less pressure on the final paper being the determining factor of your overall grade.",
                "Strengths: professor Gonzalez-Perez is a  really nice guy. Lots of review before quizzes, interesting research paper. \r\n\r\nWeakness: not engaging lectures. Poor grading system with only 3 quizzes and one paper.",
                "Prof Gonzalez is super kind and understanding. The main weaknesses is that it was unclear what might be on the quiz, the final paper is worth too much, there are very limited opportunities to participate and practice your Spanish.",
                "The coursework was really manageable and the professor was really passionate and understanding.",
                "Three quizzes that had very specific vocabulary you needed to remember. The first quiz really threw me off guard but once you go very thoroughly through the reading its not bad at all. Then there is a long final paper that took time but was interesting to write.",
                "Weaknesses - This course would be excellent if it were taught in its intended seminar format, but the lecture was nearly impossible to get excited for.  I only attended class because of the attendance requirement but seldom did work or took notes in class.  There was no discussion section and no participation required, so I feel like my Spanish greatly suffered.\r\n\r\nStrengths - The professor is a sweetheart and very flexible with work.  The subject matter itself is very interesting, and the workload is incredibly light.",

                "Yes, if they need the credit. It is not particularly a class I would take for fun since the topic seems interesting, but when the class just feels like a history class, it makes it less of a fun class to take. Anibal is an amazing professor but I think there could be other Spanish classes that are more interesting.",
                "100%. As long as you can tackled the Spanish level needed, it is a wonderful course.",
                "I would recommend this class because it gives a good overview Latin American history and culture. The workload is a mix of short 15 minute quizzes and a 12-15 page paper, which makes the workload manageable. The 12-15 page paper is on a topic of your choice, giving you the opportunity to explore a part of the course that interests you in further depth.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student looking to improve their spanish comprehension and writing. I would also recommend it to any history student looking for a broad background of the development of Latin America from pre-colonialism to modernism.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you are a native speaker or very confident in your Spanish abilities. It isn't a ton of work, but it's hard to understand the professor and the quizzes are difficult.",
                "If a student is looking for L5 Spanish that has a low workload but you still learn a lot about Latin American History, yes! Although you get no feedback on your work because there is hardly anything assigned. If a student is hoping to improve their writing and speaking in Spanish then no because it's a lecture format and there's only one final paper (with very little guidance).",
                "Yes interesting material.",
                "Yes! The professor did an awesome job organizing material for the course, and lectures were engaging.",
                "No. I like the professor a lot, but this isn't the best medium through which to learn this history (which is way too complex to be taught just out of a textbook)!",
                "I would recommend this course for another student. It is a good course to take, extremely interesting, and worth the time. However, I may emphasize that it is more of a history course taught in Spanish than a Spanish course using history as a foundation. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed learning the material!",
                "Yes, if you are hoping to learn a bit about Latin American history and culture, or are looking for a relatively relaxed L5 class. But you should be prepared to put in a bit of work to study for the quizzes and write the final paper in Spanish.",
                "no because of the quizzes",
                "I would because it was very interesting to have a little bit of everything (movies, readings, history lessons, songs) in an L5 course. The professor is also an excellent lecturer.",
                "Yes. You will learn so much about Latin American history, and you will be immersed in Spanish.",
                "I do not think I would recommend this course to another student. For an L5 student, the use of Spanish was not an issue but rather the content was extremely difficult. The 3 quizzes and a 15 page paper is difficult for any class, especially in Spanish.",
                "Yes! I took this class as an L5 which could finish the language requirement and it was definitely a class that you can do well in without putting in so so much work. Generally, if I went to the review sessions and studied the slides, I could do well on quizzes and besides that it was just the end of term paper. Also, the actual content it pretty interesting (a mix of history, literature, art, etc)!",
                "I believe students with a high level of Spanish proficiency would gain the most from this course, as it is somewhat self-directed. The lecture format made it somewhat hard to always stay fully engaged, but the content is very interesting and Professor Gonzalez clearly wants students to succeed.",
                "Yes, if you would like to have a comprehensive overview of Latin American cultures and their evolution over time, this course provides thorough examination. It is also unique in that it places an emphasis on understanding the role of indigenous communities in the development of the New World.",
                "Yes, it's on the easier end of L5 Spanish classes, so I would definitely suggest it to anyone interested in learning about Spanish culture and deeper meanings behind the language.",
                "Yes, I would. For non-Latin Americans, this course is essential to learning basic history and culture about the region. Its a very engaging course, and even if you do the textbook readings, you learn so much interesting information. The Spanish aspect is not too tough.",
                "Pretty easy L5 Spanish class. Professor is a sweetheart.",
                "Yes, if youre genuinely interested in the class and can hold yourself accountable to the readings and lectures",

                "I would if they are a native speaker. However, if they're coming straight out of high school like I did, I would warn that the class may be more intimidating because of how little engagement is required and how easy it is to get lost.",
                "No, in its current state I would not. The lectures are difficult to engage with and very homogenous. If you have a solid grasp of Spanish, it may not be too hard. However, the quizzes are tough and need to be studied for carefully.",
                "If you need another L5 credit its fine but would be better as a seminar",
                "Yes!",

Otherwise, do not waste your time getting up for a 9am twice a week for a semester where you will learn very little new material that isn't already covered in the culture section of L1-4 classes and never use speaking skills in class.  The reading is basically optional because of the lack of participation, but this makes the quizzes impossibly difficult.  I wish that I could recommend this class because Professor Gonzalez-Perez is awesome, but the class unfortunately is not.",
