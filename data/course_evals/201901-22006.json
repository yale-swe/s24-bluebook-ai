    "It's hard to say what this course is about. It's basically just a look into the mind of of Charles Hill, an intellectual in every sense possible.",
    "A lot - but nothing I can put my finger on. I was exposed to a way of analysis, and gained a brief understanding of a range of cultures and societies and political theories. I really enjoyed the class, but am not sure I can explain very well what I learned.",
    "Single most important class taught at Yale, hands down.",
    "I gained great insight into world order, and how systems of world order are established. I learned why our state system today appears the way it does.",
    "Great class. Take it.",
    "A critical insight into the art of how to think, augmented by the most creatively challenging array of history and archetypes of thought across the peoples of the world.  The midterm examination's photographs of a mosque covered by a black shroud, of an owl over a grave, etc. -- new content to be considered in light of the archetypes of the class for the arrangement of societies -- was the entelechy of my Yale experience.",
    "Gained insight into the intersection of world order and greater ideas expressed in art and literature.",
    "This is the best course I have ever taken. I learned about the current system of World Order, and about those that have shaped world order. Most importantly, I learned how the liberal arts shape world order, and how to think in terms of a statesman."

   "comments": [
    "There is nothing like this course- it is pre-disciplinary and very wide ranging. A summary of DS and European history all in one.",
    "Strengths: Professor Hill knows so much and is so engaging to listen to. The other students also had a lot of really interesting insight and I think this is likely to be the case every year because the class is suited to that kind of student (yes it's full of section assholes but I'm also a section asshole so I really liked that)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like there was a lot of pre-requisite literary and cultural knowledge which I and some other students did not have. This made it hard to understand all components of the class.",
    "The only thing that could've made it better were if it weren't on Hillhouse at 9:25 on Fridays.\r\n\r\nI suppose it would've been nice if the readings were uploaded on Canvas, so we did not have to purchase a course packet from TYCO.",
    "Single most important class taught at Yale, hands down.",
    "This is a course unlike any other I have ever seen or heard about. Part of it's great strength is it's uniqueness.",
    "All strong - Hill is a gem",
    "It is a fairly special course. It should be taken after relevant coursework in political science. Its not a requirement but the background can help make sense of the general ideas discussed in the seminar.",
    "This is a fantastic, very engaging course. The class really got me to think about our world today."

   "comments": [
    "There is almost zero work involved. Readings did not relate to class discussion and the midterm could not be studied for. The seminar is an incredible intellectual environment. A must take.",
    "Yes, not a lot of work and interesting. Easy A-, probably an easy A too but just a little arbitrary because there are almost no assignments",
    "Yes. The midterm was an incredible break from tradition as we were encouraged to think rather than know and the final paper allows us to explore any of our interests. Charles Hill is a great teacher and will encourage you to think outside the box.",
    "A must take. I'm a second semester senior and I still enjoyed trekking up Hillhouse every Friday morning for the brilliant Prof. Hill. \r\n\r\nThe class really forces you to think about the important things in life, such as the purpose of a college education. It may have been the most intellectually stimulating course I've taken.\r\n\r\nProf. Hill is brutally honest and has many interesting anecdotes from over the years. He is also a quick grader and accessible for meetings.\r\n\r\nThe midterm is truly unlike any Yale exam. It's basically a diagnostic exam that you can't really study for, but fortunately the grades don't go below a B for it, so don't worry about bombing the course. \r\n\r\nMost weeks, there are actually a doable amount of readings; however, it's not particularly important to do them.",
    "Yes. Single most important class taught at Yale, hands down.",
    "If any student can manage to get into this seminar, or any seminar with Professor Hill, they absolutely should.",
    "YES! TAKE IT!!!!!!!!!",
    "The greatest class at Yale, owing to Charlie Hill.  Indispensable to entry into government service, at a time when realpolitik and a blind embrace of the scientific method has eroded the constitution of civil society in America:  the seminar gives a critical insight into the art of how one can think about governance, augmented by the most creatively challenging array of history and archetypes of thought across the peoples of the world.  The midterm examination's photographs of a mosque covered by a black shroud, of an owl over a grave, etc. -- new content to be considered in light of the archetypes of the class for the arrangement of societies -- was the entelechy of my Yale experience.",
    "It is a fairly special course. It should be taken after relevant coursework in political science. Its not a requirement but the background can help make sense of the general ideas discussed in the seminar. Best aspect is how accessible prof Hill is. He is generous with his time and has very interesting office hours.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course. Everything discussed in class is very interesting, and the class really gets you to think. Professor Hill is incredibly knowledgeable and fantastic to listen to."
