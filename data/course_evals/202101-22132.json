                "The course combined both theoretical social movement history as well as practical thinking about policy proposals. I have a much stronger grasp of the theory of social movements (particularly Black-led and urban-centered social movements in the US in the 20th century) that I believe I can apply to my future thinking and work on urban equity.",
                "Professor Hinton's class allowed me to understand and trace the deep historical roots of systemic and racial inequality in the United States, particularly for Black urban communities. I had the opportunity to study thinkers ranging from Manning Marable to Keeanga Yamhatta-Taylor to Robin D.G. Kelley, and focus on the impact of the post-civil rights movement period, rather than merely stopping at the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Overall, this course allowed me to gain a deep understanding of the nuances between various radical social movements during the 1960s and 1970s, and their implications for conversations around social justice today.",
                "I learned about different historical and sociopolitical trends that gave rise to the levels of segregation we see in cities throughout the United States today. We discussed the time period between the late 60s and early 70s up until the early 2010s, making references and connections to relevant comtemporary events.",
                "The history of racial inequality following the civil rights movement",
                "This course opened with a few theoretical readings related to race and the relationships between capitalism and racism. We then talked about the Black Power movement and the Black Panther Party; unions, deindustrialization, and unemployment; public housing; mass incarceration and policing; the late twentieth-century Black middle class; Black mayors; and a few closing readings (we mostly focused on a Robin D. G. Kelley piece about Black students and activism within the university). I feel like many history classes taper off around 1965 or 1968, so this class offered an introduction to many topics that other classes don't get to cover. I especially enjoyed the weeks on the Black Power movement and thought that I learned a lot from them. \r\n\r\nI also enjoyed the media analysis assignment in this class, where we each picked a news article and critiqued the way that it approached a topic relevant to the course. I think that exercise has helped me approach news sources more critically outside of class.",
                "I learned themes of urban history and policies, specifically about race and inequality between 1960-2020. I also learned and practiced historical writing techniques.",
                "This course helped develop my understanding of the institutional and government policies that contributed to poverty and inequality in the post civil rights era. It really emphasized the role of the state in perpetuating harmful rhetoric and acting on it to oppress black and brown communities. This course highlighted the lasting impact of those policies and how they manifest in spaces today.",
                "This course provided me with a strong understanding of what defines \"urban inequality\" and the political, social, and economic inequality that persists today even after the gains of the Civil Rights Movement. This course taught me how to read and think more critically. The Media Analysis assignment helped me to unpack a current newspaper article and place it in historical context. The Policy Recommendation allowed me to be in the shoes of a policymaker and imagine a better world, being both creative and realistic. This assignment combined historical analysis, primary and secondary sources, and policymaking skills. The policy caucus groups also allowed me to learn from my classmates and their own research topics. Overall, this course has shown me what has changed over time but also what parallels we see today with history of the past."

                "Professor Hinton is a great professor, and combined the perfect mix of seminar discussion and course instruction. Sometimes the reading load felt a little heavy, or at least not consistent, and we would spend time in class discussing previous weeks' readings, rather than that which had just been assigned.",
                "Strengths - Professor Hinton is a phenomenal professor who is cogent and clear in her lecturing, cleverly facilitates profound class discussion, and is a professor who clearly cares about her students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I wish I had more of the class! We covered so much ground I think it easily could have been two or three separate semesters of material. If I could have taken multiple semesters with Prof Hinton, that would have been perfect. Within the one semester, I think students would have been aided by even more roadmapping of the course's direction.",
                "Professor Hinton is the strength of this course -- the depth of her knowledge on these topics, and this period in particular, is immense. It makes discussions that much more interesting, because Professor Hinton always has some new tidbit to add into the conversation around the readings that we wouldn't otherwise had known.\r\n\r\nI also really enjoyed how vibrant discussions were in this seminar; they were honestly more vibrant and interesting than most history seminars I've been in. The course felt like an intellectual space that was also a community (even in Zoom world), making time pass by as we grappled with questions around the readings and the implications for the modern-day.\r\n\r\nReadings were a bit heavy at times, but they were absolutely worth it! Just make sure you carve out the time to consistently do them.",
                "no real weaknesses. strengths: great readings, discussion, and the midterm and final assessments offer great unconventional ways to demonstrate progress in the course. Professor Hinton is incredibly knowledgable, understanding, flexible, and engaging! The major strength of the course is the discussion and engagement with the readings each week.",
                "The subject matter and the readings were both incredible. I think that one of the weaknesses of the course was just that there were too many good things to read. Every reading I came across was enjoyable, informative, and gave us a lot to talk about during the class. There were, however, some weeks where it seemed as if the reading could've been two-weeks worth or so. As a result, people sometimes came to class on different pages and having read different sections of the readings as a whole. But each reading and, as a result, each seminar discussion was incredibly rich and productive. It was a pleasure to learn from these readings and from my classmates.",
                "It was great!",
                "This course was awesome! Some big strengths were how much it was grounded in historical context but drew lots of discussion into present day, Prof Hinton's dynamic lectures, and how well-chosen the readings were. The only thing that I wish would be changed is the amount of reading. I think it would be better to focus on Max 3-4 readings a week rather than the 6-7 we sometimes had.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hinton. She is not only incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about this material but also is so supportive and encouraging and actually wants to hear what we have to say. The readings are also wonderful!!!! I learned so much. Will keep my notes forever. Loved the policy recommendation final paper - it was a lot of fun to write. Also the policy caucus allowed us to work in groups on topics we're passionate about and lead a class discussion and that was super fun. Loved the structure of the class also. And everyone who took this class was wonderful - a great group of students who care about inequality and have many smart things to say about it. Starting with Du Bois and Baldwin and Malcolm X was really impactful. Also I can't believe I hadn't read Manning Marable before this course. A must-read. Also this class is very solution-driven. We actually talk about HOW to make change. More classes should do this. \r\nOther syllabus highlights: There Are No Children Here, Hoop Dreams, From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation, Huey Newton's Dissertation, The Black Power Mixtape. Honestly everything. Also we watched Judas and the Black Messiah which was amazing! Super relevant to what we were discussing. \r\nAlso took this class during the Derek Chauvin trial and to have this space to read and reflect and discuss during a difficult time was so worthwhile and important and really provided some meaning to everything that has been happening. I will miss this course a lot. \r\n\r\nNo real weaknesses. Some weeks are quite reading heavy but that's all.",
                "Prof. Hinton is a strength! She brought a wealth of knowledge and energy to our class discussions every week, and it was really exciting to get to learn from her around the time that her new book came out. Prof. Hinton always seemed to be genuinely interested in everything that we had to say during our class discussions, so I appreciated the dedication that she brought to teaching in that regard. Prof. Hinton also offered to look at drafts of our assignments before we turned them in, and I found it helpful to meet with her and get feedback on my writing. I appreciate it when professors offer to do this, so that was a part of the course that I found especially helpful. \r\n\r\nThe theoretical readings that we opened the course with were really strong and provided a lot of great things for us to talk about seminar. Regarding the readings in other weeks, I didn't enjoy some of the reported narrative pieces that we read quite as much, such as the Kotlowitz book and the Anson book. Since I didn't have a thorough background in the topics that this books were intended to address on the syllabus, I think that I would have appreciated reading a scholarly history book (or sections from a book) that provided a more thorough historical grounding than the narratives about individual people and families did. I'm not sure if other students might disagree, so perhaps having one of the reported narrative-style books on the syllabus instead of two could be a compromise adjustment. I also think that some of the weeks of this course had too much reading to keep up with. If this course is taught again, I would recommend trying to pare down the reading in a few of the heavier weeks. \r\n\r\nThe two major writing assignments that we had in this course were helpful and fun to write (the media analysis and the final paper). It was nice that we were given a lot of flexibility in choosing what to write about, so we could choose to address whatever interested us most. On the other hand, I thought that the reading responses were a bit stressful. Personally, I would have preferred having a second short writing assignment or being asked to write a slightly longer final paper instead of having to do the reading responses several times during the semester. I did appreciate that we didn't need to write them every week, though, and that we had some flexibility because we could choose which of the five weeks we were going to do the responses for.",
                "There are many strengths of this course. First, the time period of this course was slightly more recent than many history courses at Yale. In addition, the enthusiasm and knowledge of the instructor, Professor Elizabeth Hinton, is a major strength. Hinton's use of a pre-class email discussion chain also helped improve class discussion. She also often led class (rather than relying on student discussion leaders). Finally, the topics were interesting, and her in class mini lectures often provided essential background information. The weaknesses of the course were the too-heavy reading load, and slight disorganization of the topics. Some weeks, the reading was manageable and wonderful, but other weeks (particularly toward the end of the term), the reading was near (or even exceeded) 300 pages/week. This was extremely hard to complete, and sometimes hindered class discussion, as the class struggled to finish all the reading, and we rarely had enough time to discuss everything. It would have been helpful to slightly reduce the number of pages per week. Finally, slightly more attention to the divisions in weekly topics might have helped bring the course together-- some weeks, the discussion seemed focused on a place (detroit, chicago), others, the discussion seemed focused on a time period (the great migration & early 1900s, the reagan years), and still others, we focused on a type of policy (housing, welfare). It might have been helpful to either choose one method of topic division (for instance, making the course chronological, then tracking these different themes through time) or just to be more explicit about the organization of that week or that segment of the course.",
                "I appreciated the forward thinking nature of this course in that we were offered space to visualize change and how actions could be taken to remedy the injustices. I think many courses typically focus on the problem and dissecting the causes of the problem, with little regard to actually addressing it and I am grateful that solutions were a major component of this course. The course was structured chronologically in a way that helped to contextualize the material. There was a lot of reading in the course and discussion could have been improved if there were instructions of which readings in particular to focus on each week. Sometimes we ran out of time for discussion and we revisited readings from two or three weeks prior, which made it slightly more difficult to recollect. I think the course could be improved with greater time management or specificity on what we want to focus on for a particular week.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hinton!! She is an engaging and supportive professor, she is very knowledgeable and an expert on many of these topics with first-hand research experience but is also open to learning and hearing our ideas. This course also provided a strong historical foundation for understanding current events and persistent inequality today. I wish we had more face time with our professor though and more opportunities to get feedback. The email chains/reading responses were really helpful for my understanding. They allowed us to engage with the reading before class each week and share our thoughts beyond talking in class.\r\nWeaknesses: the readings were often very long and hard to know what is most important so maybe a way to highlight what we should pay attention to before we do the readings would be helpful."

Overall, I think this worked out well for us and we were still able to have engaging class discussions over Zoom. \r\n\r\nI also appreciated that there was some flexibility in the weekly reading responses, since we didn't have to write every week and could choose which five weeks we were going to write for. I think that seemingly small adjustments like that can make a course more manageable during tough semesters like this. I took another seminar this semester that also had reading responses, but we were required to write every week and I found that very challenging.",

I've had quite a few professors use reading responses, and this was the first time that I felt the reading discussions were exciting to read and helpful to promoting class discussion.

                "Definitely! If you have a chance to take a class with Professor Hinton, do not pass it up. She is one of the kindest professors that I've had the chance to take a class with at Yale -- aside from genuinely caring about her students, she is also just a wealth of knowledge on Black history, the post-1960s era, and urban inequality (among many more things). The syllabus for this class is a gift in-and-of itself, and is one that you probably won't find in many other courses at Yale. \r\n\r\nAll in all, however, the biggest reason I'd recommend that someone take this class is because I'll genuinely miss it. Each and every discussion was stimulating and made me think about society in some new way. Conversations in this class never felt boring or stale, or like we were saying things just to fill up space. Professor Hinton really pushes you to think in more expansive and imaginative ways during each seminar, to not let the current state of the world limit what it can become.",
                "Absolutely! If you have the chance, I highly recommend it. Professor Hinton provides an excellent learning environment, and the readings provide the foundation for incredible class discussion.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Not only do you learn a lot from the readings and from Professor Hinton, but you do so alongside other folks who typically are at the same starting point as you are with many of the topics we discuss. The best past about this class is the seminar discussions, so if you're a seminar-oriented kind of person I think this class has a lot to offer.",
                "Yes!!",
                "Yes! This course is so important. I appreciated that this course started where other AFAM courses tend to leave off (in the 1960s) and talked about how the post Civil Rights era created the environment we see today. Discussion was always fruitful and Prof H does a great job of making everyone feel comfortable to share in class. \r\n\r\nI would just say that if you're thinking about taking this course, be ready to do a LOT of readings. Per week, it was about 200 pages of readings, including full books that we'd have to read in a week and comment on the day before class. That being said, it was worth it for me! Prof H gives plenty of feedback on assignments and was always available for support (plus, it's just awesome to be able to learn from her, and seeing the strides she's making in the field). And, for other ND students searching for accommodating professors, Prof Hinton was always willing to work with me on deadlines and other support.",
                "Absolutely. Every single person should take this class. I will genuinely miss going to this class every week and would leave every class with a million thoughts running through my head and felt so excited about everything we had discussed. Having this class to keep me grounded in a crazy year was unbelievable valuable, and the lessons I learned in this course will continue to be relevant for many years to come.",
                "Yes, I would. Prof. Hinton was a great professor to get to meet and learn from, so I would recommend checking out anything that she happens to be teaching. For this course, I thought it was really great to get to take a course that focused on post-1965 Black history. I feel like a lot of Yale students expect other students to already know about some of topics that were addressed in this course, but this material lies in an area that a lot of history courses don't cover. I thought this course was very accessible though, so I didn't feel like I needed a lot of background knowledge coming in.",
                "Yes! This is a wonderful course with a terrific professor! I'd absolutely recommend this, particularly to someone interested in recent American history with a policy-leaning interest.",
                "Yes, I would! This course is so important to understanding the problems we face in society today and the racist policies that shape the life outcomes of individuals. Everyone should know this history. I also felt like the structure of the course was conducive to building community. It was a small group and we often did small group projects that helped us connect with one another.",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to another student if you're interested in post-civil rights history, urban inequality, or any issue related to education, housing, health care, etc. This course covers a lot of material but provides a really great historical foundation for understanding the inequality we encounter today. It is also a privilege to learn from Professor Hinton who is an expert in some of these very topics."
