                "This course was truly a seminar environment -- Professor McEnroe would give us a topic to explore every week, and we would just have a discussion for the whole class about what we discovered. It was an extremely welcoming environment. There are no glaring weaknesses to this course.",
                "No weaknesses. I loved this course.",
                "The great strength is the weekly diary. McEnroe gives great (and funny) feedback. It really forces you to dig through some news and think hard about why it does or doesn't work. Since they are so self-styled and you can choose what you write about, the diaries don't really feel like typical academic work and aren't draining to write. The discussions could sometimes be a little dry or easy to check out of. The end-of-semester group project was fun but would maybe be better in smaller groups. Maybe adding some small-group discussion would help. Guest speakers would be cool too.",
                "Strengths: this course forces you to keep up with the news, which is great. It also forces you to look at political journalism through a new lens for the diaries, and you find yourself picking up on things you always missed before; it's a super chill class assignments wise (no exams, just weekly diaries) and if you really get involved in the diaries each week, the work is actually super fun; McEnroe is both funny and really in-tune to the course, and he's great to learn from every week\r\nWeaknesses: None. I loved everything about this class",
                "I enjoyed the ownership of the course, and the ability to feel like I was really gaining something from the class.",
                "Strengths: Positive environment, manageable workload, and excellent organization\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "I found the class structure (free flowing class discussions/weekly writing assignments) to foster a very intellectually stimulating and productive learning environment. There is not much that couldve been improved.",

                "Absolutely. I think this is an amazing course to take before you graduate. Since high school, I've grown more and more exhausted from reading the news. However, this course resparked my interest in keeping up with the current events, as well as exploring more unconventional methods of obtaining current events (e.g, TikToks).",
                "Yes! Absolutely phenomenal course, with a witty and brilliant instructor.",
                "Absolutely, especially for aspiring journalists. The industry is incredibly complex, and what was true five years ago is probably not today. McEnroe and your diaries help you get a sense on the most absolutely current trends  Twitter and Substack and TikTok were relevant for us to discuss this semester, but maybe not in the future! Who knows?",
                "Yes! It was a really fun course where the learning comes from the people and discussion.",
                "Absolutely. This is a great course to take. It forces you to keep up with the news, and the diary entries are really fun to write each week, especially because McEnroe will write back to you. He's super passionate about the course, and he's spent so many years in this industry that he knows so many behind the scenes facts. It's also a really great course to take with relatively low workload and stress. As long as you can agree to keep up with the news during the week, you're basically set for the entire semester. It makes it so much easier to enjoy the class because it's low stress. I can't say enough good things about this class. Take it if you can",
                "Absolutely. It strikes a rare balance between manageable course load and significant positive takeaways.",
                "Absolutely, being able to take a course with McEnroe is a privilege, and I'd encourage every student (polisci or otherwise) to apply.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student interested in political journalism/staying abreast on the news. The variety of personalities and backgrounds present in our class made for engaging discussions.",
