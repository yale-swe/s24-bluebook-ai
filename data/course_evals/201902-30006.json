    "I developed an appreciation and sense of awareness to how exhibits in museums portray themselves.",
    "I came into this class knowing absolutely nothing about American Museums, the political, social, economic key structures behind them, or the ways in which they impact not only the general public visitors, but also how they engage across the globe on a multi-national level in order to create appropriate progressive change and awareness. Professor Pitti is one of the best Professors I've ever had, and he taught the course in a way where I left everyday feeling like I could easily understand exactly what he was trying to teach us. It's been a long time since I've been in a class where I felt I was walking away with a whole new plethora of information and knowledge. I loved everything about this course and Professor Pitti, and this class made my experience at Yale amazing.",
    "As an international student, I was initially unfamiliar with the topic of American history, compared to my peers. Nevertheless, over the course of the summer session, I was not only acquainted with several facets of the collective American identity but learned about how their circumstances influenced their eventual presentation in the various Smithsonian museums. The large scope of the course covered the Asian-American identity, the Enola Gay controversy, the Bracero Program, the multiplicity of Native American communities and the conception and philosophies of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Through the lens of the museum, I further gained the skills to critically analyse and consider the disparate elements of an exhibit and their accompanying effectiveness in portraying a national history. Exposure to the many different exhibitions both physically as well as through academic writing prompted a deeper understanding of the institution of the museum itself, and I gained a greater appreciation of the many communities that require representation as well as the complex politics that underlie identity-based exhibitions. As a whole, I not only learned more about the history of the museum itself, and its evolution, but how museums can better serve the communities that require them to attain greater relevance.",
    "I learned about the Smithsonian Institution as a national treasure, a hub of information about American history and contemporary issue facing us today.  I learned about various ethnic issues and their struggles for equality and advancement at the behest  of the national narrative through museums.  I was introduced to the physical institutions themselves in D.C. which was amazing and very insightful."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are that the class is very engaging and the field trip is fun yet educational. The only weakness may be the mandatory presentations.",
    "This course used group discussion, individual projects, intellectual and critical thinking to answer big questions, and insight from instructor lectures to convey all the information taught in this class. It was a perfect mix of engagement and lecture material, and it kept a three hour class feeling almost too short. I was never bored or disengaged while in class.",
    "A strength of the course is undoubtedly its curriculum readings which are well-chosen and deeply relevant. One gets a thorough look at the exhibitions through the academic articles as well as the discussions they spawned, the controversies they've created and the communities they've impacted. The fact that we were able to learn through multiple mediums such as podcasts and videos atop the readings helped to further enhance the learning process. Finally, the trip to D.C. is, as Prof. Pitti has mentioned and others I believe have attested to, integral to the experience. Encountering and experiencing the exhibits firsthand, as well as thinking critically about them, was a key and unique aspect of the class that should remain a fundamental element to the course. \r\n\r\nOne area that the course could improve on is perhaps its distribution of assignments nearing the end of the curriculum. I believe shifting the D.C. trip forward a week earlier could help make the final week of assignments less stressful and condensed, thus benefitting everyone.",
    "In my opinion this course was very well organized, maintained and expressed by Prof. Pitti.  Amazing professor in deed!!  I didn't see any weaknesses other than perhaps the trip can be moved up a week as I had trouble negotiating time to study for my upcoming finals and preparing my papers for both classes.  That would be my only suggestion.  The trip itself was great!  I enjoyed it immensely and wouldn't change anything about it except the dates."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is an easily approachable humanities credit. Also, the DC trip allows you to enjoy the summer during your session.",
    "YES! This class is a real hidden treasure, and if Professor Pitti was the faculty member teaching it again, then I would absolutely vouch to anyone that this class is a course that is well worth your time. It was relevant, challenging, fun, critical, and exciting- all in one thanks to Professor P.",
    "Yes. The course provides the tools for a sharp analysis of an institution that is only growing in cultural relevance. By situating us amid the organization of the Smithsonian, one is put at the forefront of innovative museum practices, the crux of the education of American history and the centre of intersecting politics, identities, histories and controversies. The course opens a door into critically looking and thinking about the presentation of history, science, culture and objects that is both culturally rooted and ideologically universal: the same theories I've learned in this class apply across the globe, where museums are growing in relevance and possess immense cultural currency.",
    "Yes, this is not only a great history and museum course but it engages so many more facets that a student can grow in particularly gender, sex, race and nationality issues.  Great class thank you Prof. Pitti."
