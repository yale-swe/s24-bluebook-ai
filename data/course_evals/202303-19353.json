I specifically developed skills in metrical scansion, metaphor, and close reading. I also developed my writing skills across the three essays in the course. Through the course, we engaged in a survey of English literature crossing the neo-classical (Pope and Wheatley), romantic (Wordsworth), Victorian (Tennyson and Rossetti), modernist (Eliot), and contemporary (Brooks and Milner) eras of poetry. Through the course, we also developed a notion of an \"ars poetica,\" what it means to write poetry, and what the point of writing poetry is.",

I was disappointed on how little instruction was geared to actually improving as a reader/writer, especially for this being a foundational English course.

The course is set up in a very accessible manner, and though I entered with an interest in poetry, I exited with an even greater appreciation of it.
