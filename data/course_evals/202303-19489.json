In addition to reading a lot of great books, this course helped me to develop the skills of close reading and literary comparison\/analysis, as well as both academic and creative writing."

                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in English, writing, politics, or history. It was fascinating to learn about the origins of the novel form and to track the differences (and surprising similarities) between centuries and writers. In addition to being incredibly understanding and kind, Professor Campbell is an insightful speaker and discussion-leader, and I really enjoyed the class's simultaneous exploration of novelistic techniques and socio-political trends."
