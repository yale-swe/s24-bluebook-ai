For instance, half of class could be dedicated to discussion, and then the other half of the class could be dedicated to the presentation or videos to make sure we got to everything. I also think that some of our writing assignments could have been a bit more specific, because it was difficult to choose topics when the prompt was that we could write about anything.",

                "The content of this course was very interesting and well-taught, but class discussions lacked direction and energy. I think engagement with the material could be improved through more interactive class discussions and the implementation of smaller group discussions surrounding the readings and any questions/ideas that we may have had. Thus, improving the class environment will help students engage with the course materials at a higher level."

The workload isn't bad - there are weekly readings (you do have to do at least some of them to get something out of class discussion) and a few papers. Prof. Watts is great and can answer pretty much any question you have. However, if you aren't all that interested in the course material, it can get boring.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in anthropology and/or primates and doesn't have a lot of experience in the subject. I came in with very little knowledge of anthropology, but it wasn't too difficult for me to understand anything that was presented, and I learned a decent amount.",
                "Yes. Mr Watts is super enthusiastic about this subject. So knowledgeable it is inspiring",
                "Yes! I think this course allows you to learn about human evolution to an extent that high school courses did not allow. Its a super neat subject to explore, even if anthro isnt your major."
