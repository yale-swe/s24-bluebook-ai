By the end of the semester, I was able to communicate in German with simple phrases to describe my daily life as well as plans for the future. Overall, it was exactly what one would ideally learn from an A1 course.",

I think a weakness for me was the amount of time the asynchronous work took.  I don't think it should've taken longer than the 50 minute class, but I was often working on it for a couple hours.",

                "The strengths of the course were our super helpful instructor (Max), the highly engaging class setting, Friday asynchronous days, and the breadth of topics covered. The only weakness I can potentially think of is that I wish we had spent more time in class explaining German cases instead of pushing that to be a topic for office hours.",

                "yes!!!! 100%!!!! so much fun",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who has little to no knowledge of the German language and would like to improve that. My recommendation is enhanced even more if it is an option to have Max Phillips as one's professor. While the workload fluctuates and may become overwhelming by the end of the semester, each class will be super engaging and productive. By the time that the semester ends, I guarantee that you will understand/speak German at an A1 level thanks to the class conversations and projects.",
