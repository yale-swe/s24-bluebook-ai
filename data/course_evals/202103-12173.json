                "I gained so much knowledge in Chinese 110. I came in knowing limited Chinese and ended the class being able to have a full conversation, read a variety of characters, and much more. The class placed an emphasis on learning how to speak, so I became much more comfortable with that. I also learned how Chinese grammar structure works, learned a ton of vocabulary, and overall improved my reading and writing abilities, as well as my pronunciation.",

This course required a lot of discipline in order to stay up to date with the vocabulary, grammar, etc. from each new lesson. I was glad to see how much I was able to improve my Chinese skills in such a short period of time."

                "Course is extremely rigorous. It requires to study a lot due to the pace of the classes. As a result, it serves a great introduction to  Chinese.",
                "Li Laoshi was very good at involving every student in class. Each of us learned that we could say new things in Chinese daily. A substantial but manageable amount of daily homework reinforced what we'd studied in class. I was occasionally a little confused about the way assignments were graded on Canvas.",
                "Strengthes were class is engaging, weakness is that it was too fast paced I think.",
                "You learn a lot and it's engaging to be in a small, interactive classroom",
                "I think there is a very good support structure - all the teachers and TAs want you to succeed and are willing to help.",
                "I enjoy how small the class size is - it facilitates a very collaborative and engaging environment. I also like how we meet everyday, this really helps with speaking and getting familiar with the language. The class time of 50 minutes is also perfect. A weakness of the course is that we usually learn straight out of the textbook. I think it would be helpful to read about conversations out of the textbook or engage with some materials outside of it, but I understand there are time constraints.",
                "There are so many strengths to the course but definitely the ones I benefited the most from were the small class size, the great professor, and the closeness of our class.",
                "The strength of this course is that this course requires a lot of engagement, both in the classroom and outside. Although this can prove to be challenging and a bit nerve-wrecking, especially in the beginning when you have absolutely no knowledge of Chinese, it forces you to practice daily and really hone in on your strengths and weaknesses. The only weakness I would say is that the expectation of listening comprehension sometimes moved too fast. It was very easy to feel very behind. I think this could be improved by introducing more listening comprehension practice outside of the classroom that isn't just listening to the lessons' dialogues."

If you only want to fulfill the language requirement and that's it, this might not be the course for you. I think this course is fit for anyone who is dedicated to actually learning Chinese."
