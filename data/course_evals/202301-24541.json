Specifically, we went over the urban-rural disparity, the aging problem, gender inequality, marriage and dating, and other pertinent topics. As a Chinese American, this was a very enlightening class because it made me feel better equipped to talk about my family's homeland and helped me gain a deeper appreciation for sociology classes.",

                "Wished the lectures were less of the professor talking at us. Since it's such a small class, I hoped it would be more seminar-style and engaging. Some of the slides also had way too much text and dense graphs/charts. Also the fact that there were two major final assignments were a lot, considering the lack of guidance we got for both. Wish there was more support on both those fronts.",
                "The professor often posed open-ended questions to the students and encouraged us to answer them while remaining open-minded. It was a very comfortable and safe discussion space. I loved it.",
                "A really great course, very engaging lesson plans, students learn a lot and the class is very dynamic and interactive.",
                "I loved that students lead the class once a week. Really forced us to engage with the material and made workload more manageable.",
                "course material was really interesting but there wasn't much guidance on assignments. In this way, the class could be improved by discussing the assignment expectations more in detail earlier before they are due",
                "The course was a fun exploration of social issues in China. Professor Emma made the class feel like a seminar even though it is a lecture. I thought that the debate at the end of the course could have been more engaging. It might have been because Professor Emma was on maternity leave for the second half of the semester. Also, there could have been more feedback on how the student was doing throughout the course."

Also mused a lot about US-China relationship and comparisons, which I found thought-provoking. Not too much workjust the final assignments that weigh on you.",
                "Yes! Absolutely. Very stress-free with only a debate, final interview project, and final paper to write. There are discussion posts you have to write following each student-led discussion and one that you have to lead as well, but it is very doable. The professor is also very knowledgeable and kind.",
