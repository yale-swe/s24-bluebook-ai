                "We read interesting plays, developed our writing and performing skills, learned how to synthesize our ideas to create a piece, and how to leave our comfort zones. We also learned about the creative process.",
                "Observing acting techniques from performances assigned to watch, develop original pieces with a limited time frame, work together with classmates on what works and doesn't in a one-person play.",
                "I have learned a lot about how to effectively tell stories and many ways in which to do so. I have also learned a lot about how to engage with an audience, even if you're up on stage alone.",
                "You really get to work on your ability to communicate with an audience. Not just in an acting capacity, but any form of presentation really.",
                "Throughout this course, I learned how to analyze plays, and I developed better acting skills. However, this course is not a writing course. We didn't talk about composing a play at all, just acting, despite the name of the course, which was disappointing to be frank.",
                "You learn a lot about the niche medium of the one person play - different styles and interpretations. Exercises in class are conducive to exploring what form you want your final 10-minute OPP to take. Overall, everything you do is directly or indirectly geared toward to final in a practical manner. You learn to develop how to be creative as opposed to how to write a OPP which allows the course to be open for anyone interested in the arts - not just acting or writing.",
                "I learned a lot about the writing process for all forms of creative writing. I loved all the readings about the process of writing and the various examples of great one person-plays that we watched. I feel like I've learned various methods of storytelling that I can experiment with. This class showed me how to keep up your inspiration and be a consistent writer.",
                "This course taught me a great deal about theatre and the creative process. I had limited experience with theatre before this semester, and never considered myself to be very interested in plays. However, the section of shows to at we watched, read, and analyzed challenged that perception and made me realize how amazing and provoking that world can be.",
                "I had a lot of self-discovery that was guided by this course through the different exercise, daily journaling, and writing of performances. I matured as a performer and as a writer. I gained confidence during the course as well, learning boldness.",
                "I learned a lot about the crafts of playwriting and acting, as well as different artistic techniques and methods, through taking this course.",
                "Before this course, I never realized how crucial it was as an artist or writer to practice your craft every single day. This course, above all, taught me that dedication to your work requires consistency, no matter the duration you spend working. The course gleans from different theatre-makers, writers, and performers to truly hone in on this point. The course also proved the importance of collaboration in the writing and rehearsing stages, as we were encouraged every week to share or perform pieces set as exercises over the weekend, usually related to the assigned weekly reading. The small, intimate environment of a first-year seminar made it feel safe and inviting to perform, especially for those who were totally new to theatre. Overall, this class definitely required a lot of work, but if you are able to overcome the battle of consistency and make writing a habit, it will be highly rewarding to have 2 original one-person plays by the end of the semester."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: a lot of freedom was given to students in terms of how to write their play. It also had a great sense of community and it felt safe to explore our ideas.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes assignments were posted late in the week which made it difficult to plan our time out well. Sometimes the feedback provided by Hal was unclear. I would also suggest having a full draft due two weeks before the performance. It was very easy to procrastinate writing our plays because there was no tangible deadline other than the final performance date.",
                "Strengths: Great guest lecturers, interesting readings and video performances, great for exploring different types of performance.\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Brooks will hold you accountable to the level of a professional actor, this is good in the sense that you are learning from your mistakes, but becomes annoying as if you make a single movement out of character, that is the only thing he will focus on. This is hard for students who have never done theatre especially since it's not natural to be that character. The grading sucks, especially on essays. His grading is confusing as you don't really know what he's looking for. The prompts are very broad, so it becomes difficult to really guess his focus. You don't learn any techniques on how to write a play, he just gives you videos and expects you to learn from them and not really give other guidance, especially on emotions or how to use the space around you. His feedback is a little aggressive and sounds more like he wants to roast you rather than help you.",
                "I thought this course brought together an amazing group of students and it was such a pleasure to watch everyone's works throughout the semester and specifically in our midterm and final performances. I think this course could be improved by changing the readings from things that have more of a focus on how to be creative to pieces that help teach you how to write a play. I felt like we missed out on some content that could have aided us as we wrote our midterm and final performances. Or perhaps more guidance from the professor in how to go about writing a play. I feel like we were slightly just thrown out into the water on our own.",
                "This class will push you to think creatively. After a while, it's just a matter of \"I have so many ideas I can't choose which one to present\".",
                "The strengths of this course are that many of the exercises were fun, and I was exposed to some really fantastic works of art. However, the course does not adequately explain nor teach how to compose a play, solely execute it. There were also many exercises, such as the morning pages, that felt like busywork and did not contribute to my learning at all.",
                "Strengths: Thorough and rounded learning of the OPP; collaborative and fun environment; good variety of teaching styles based on class content; good balance of theory and practice!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: MORNING PAGES WILL BE THE DEATH OF YOU; would be nice to have more direct guidance on how to write a play especially as many dont have experience.",
                "I really loved most things about this course. The readings and pieces we watched were all fantastic. I loved the exercises. I wish there was more emphasis on the actual writing of our pieces though. I wish there was a class dedicated to a writer's workshop type vibe where we all discuss our character, conflict, methods, etc in small groups for feedback. But otherwise I think this class was great and I liked most everything about it. The guest teachers, especially Nilaja Sun, were fantastic.",
                "This course certainly fosters great collaboration and pushed me outside of my comfort zone. It should certainly be continued in the future. A weakness is that the assignments were typically posted on late Wednesday or Thursday, which meant it largely had to be pushed to the weekend.",
                "A strength of the course was getting to know the other students intimately, sharing stories and work together. Another strength was getting to spend time with different creative works that were varied and interesting. I liked being given the space to write anything for our performances, and getting to see what that freedom gave rise to in eighteen different plays was a high point. I think a weakness was organization because sometimes the homework for the week wouldn't be updated until a few days after class. I do wish we had learned more about how to structure and compose a play while writing it.",
                "Weakness: very unclear guidelines about criteria for midterm",
                "This course is highly interactive and demands full engagement from all homework and time in class, which is great for those who love the material at hand. However, the workload can feel overwhelming at times, as the class requires a lot of external work to compensate for only meeting once a week.",
                "Strengths: Prof Brooks has curated a lot of different resources and examples of plays that are watched\/read across the span of the semester... these sources helped greatly with writing our own plays. It also encourages you to work every day, which is the real essence of this course.\r\nWeaknesses: I initially enrolled in this course thinking there would be a sort of workshop feel to the seminar, where we brought in extracts of work on our midterm and then final plays to receive feedback\/experiment with in the room. This was definitely not the case: we didn't have any class time dedicated to working on or sharing our one-person plays (other than maybe 1 session before the final performance, labeled \"Dress rehearsal\", which was more of a static reading exercise of a paragraph of our piece), and so my peers and I felt the actual playwriting element of the course stood separate to the class and course material."

            "comments": [
                "If you are interested in theater already, yes. If you are not a theatre major, I would proceed with caution. Almost everyone was a theatre major, and if they were not, then they were a performer in another capacity. Despite this, it's a fun class which pushes you out of your comfort zone.",
                "Yes, if the student has done theatre in the past and is used to directors who like to preach they know it all but never teach it. The class is pretty self-explanatory in the sense you get to write two short plays, but you are on your own for that. There is very little support from a director's perspective and it becomes hard when you have never been on a stage.",
                "I don't think I would recommend this course to another student. I just did not get what I expected out of the course. If I were talking about this course with another student, I would be honest with them about my experience and have them come to the conclusion themself after hearing what I have to say. I just wasn't satisfied overall with the course considering what I thought it could have been.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to someone who has never done Theater before. For this course, you'll get out what you put into it. If you consistently do the readings and prepare for class exercises you will find the class much more beneficial. If you're planning on taking the class as a gut then I would say it's not worth it since you can't really fake your way through the 2 hours of class. That all having been said, this was my only class where I genuinely enjoyed most of the readings and actually found that they helped with growing as a performer.",
                "Definitely! It's great to work with Hal and other first-years. Even if you don't have an acting background, this class is very enjoyable and it will teach you skills you didn't know you needed.",
                "Honestly, no. The course is marketed as a class for beginners, and it is simply not for beginners. We were expected to know how to act well right from the jump, and while the course does reward improvement, it's not just a fun silly course for people kind of interested in acting. This is just my personal experience, so for people that truly love acting and performing, this might be the course for you. Just not newbies.",
                "I would recommend this to any student who wants to be involved in creative writing in some capacity. If you hate acting and get nervous a lot part of this class is going to be very anxiety inducing but it's worth pushing through.",
                "Yes, it pushed me outside of my comfort zone, expanded my artistic taste, and brought me closer to my classmates.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who was looking for something interesting to spice up their coursework. I think the course is a good one for someone who hasn't done theater before and wants to experiment. The workload was a little more than expected, mostly because of thirty minutes seven days a week of journaling, but otherwise wasn't super heavy.",
                "No, I would not recommend this course to another student.",
                "I would recommend this course, as I think it definitely pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me about playwriting and acting in a way I'd never been taught before. However, if you're not someone at least marginally interested in theatre and performance, the workload of the course will likely be not worth it.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are new to theatre or playwriting, and are willing to dedicate time and consistent effort to developing the skill set of performance and writing. Though this class met once a week, it definitely was the greatest in terms of workload each week. You also have to complete \"morning pages\" every day, 3 freeform pages of writing that you do have to show proof of, so no loopholes! In addition, there are weekly discussion posts based on readings, usually around 2 pieces of theatre to watch, as well as a writing or performance exercise that you rehease ahead of time to show during class. That being said, the course has a huge reward feeling on the other side, as it brought all our peers together as we cheered each other on and became very comfortable and supportive of one another. It also was an incredible feeling to perform a piece of your own work, first in the form of a 5-minute play for the midterm and then a 10-minute play for the final. If you are excited about theatre and are interested in the process of writing and creation, this is definitely a class I would recommend."
