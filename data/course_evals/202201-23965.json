An increased capacity for close reading and analysis in discussion. A great relationship with the professor. Practice with analytical writing.",
                "The class developed my capacity to analyze literature over a series of means. I acquired an up-close understanding with each of the texts we read, allowing me a sequence of literature from which to pull.",

                "All the books that we read were amazing! However, I would take Hadji Murat off the syllabus only because it felt like it did not connect well to most of the other works.",
                "Strengths: Office hours, in-class discussions, writing feedback in particular was very useful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I only wish that this feedback for the writing could have maybe been given back in a more organized and timely fashion. The comments were so helpful but I wish I had the time to apply it to my second and third papers. This was my only qualm with this course though!",
                "Strengths: Pace, volume of texts, variety of texts, inclusion of diverse authors, discussion abilities of classmates, expertise of instructor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Prof. Slanski was not great at grading papers or giving them backI found myself wanting more feedback; I found many of the non-paper assignments superfluous",
                "The readings for this course are often the heaviest in Directed Studies, but their balance and the selections from the text feel mostly more manageable. The per-class discussion posts helped with analysis, but they did at times put extra weight on the reading workload. All of the discussions were in-depth and revelatory as they pertained to the works. While students had plenty of great opportunities for engagement during paper writing, papers did take some time to be returned, which at times made it hard to approximate an overall grade.",
                "This course is generally very strong in the progression of the material and the way it builds on themes established in first semester DS literature. I would suggest only reading Part 1 of Don Quixote because it felt like too much material for the time allotted to process it. I would also suggest that Hadji Murat should be replaced with something else or read at a different time in the course because it felt like it interrupted what would have been a strong thematic progression from Madame Bovary to Combray to To the Lighthouse."

                "I would absolutely recommend DS if you are interested in the humanities, and among the three courses, literature is definitely my favorite. Although we never get to cover everything given the time limit and the insanely fast pace of the course, I LOVE every single moment we did get to zoom in and discuss in depth. I learned so much from my professor and classmates alike. I've gained so much insights into the texts and feel strongly motivated to learn more beyond DS. Some of the skills and perspectives I've gained also helped me to read books in general and even apply to other fields of study.",
                "Of course! This was such a great overview of so many impactful books. I loved every second of the reading and especially towards the end with Omeros.",
                "Absolutely, for all the reasons one recommends DS. Incredible.",
                "Without hesitation. DS Literature is a fantastic approach to looking at some wonderful pieces of literature within the Western tradition. There is a good balance of depth and breadth in the course, and the texts and fellow students' engagement withand insights regardingthem are incredibly stimulating and thought-provoking.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. As heavy as they are, the readings are fantastic, as are the discussions. The rigor of the class bolsters reading skills and capacities, teaching students to read and absorb in great amounts, strengthening analysis and writing skills."
