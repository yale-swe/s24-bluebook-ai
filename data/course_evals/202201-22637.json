                "I was exposed to several different artists practices involving drawing. This fosters growth and exploration for personal work in relation to drawing. We were also provided information with proffesional art practices, and various skills that could be applied to our art making practices.",

                "If you're looking for a structured art class where the assignments are prompted by what materials to use, this might not be the best for you. For me, as someone who'd only worked with a narrow set of mediums, sometimes I would revert back to what I was comfortable using. This class doesn't teach you technical skills, but it's good for experimentation!",
                "There was a great balance between lectures and critiques in this course. I wish we could have seen more of Rachelle's own work in class.",
                "The class crit style was amazing, my favorite so far. Having it be different each time with different levels of engagement was very nice and productive. Group work sessions were certainly a highlight as well. Overall the structure of the class emphasized taking inspiration from our classmates whicch was infcredibly exciting for me. Personally I would've been interseted in what texts and readings would have been relevant to the class. Although adding readings would make the workload decentlly high, so an optional reading here or there would have been nice.",
                "The biggest thing in the course was class size. There were almost 25 students in the class, and so critiques took up far too much time in the course and there wasn't enough in class workshops for there to be real help with the technical aspects. I think if the class was capped at 9 students or even split into two classes, everything would have functioned much better.",
                "the class was amazing. I think it's strenghts were the group projects and the introdution to different mediums and new techniques.",
                "Strength: generative for experimentation\r\nWeakness: less structured feedback in critiques",
