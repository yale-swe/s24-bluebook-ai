                "I personally do not see any weaknesses to this course. While the variety of authors did make this course more challenging than courses that focus on a single author, this variety caused my Latin skills to improve drastically. Moreover, Professor Lenski provided a lot of support in transition from author to author. The way Professor Lenski broke down incredibly hard grammatical passages was amazing; I have not had a Professor at Yale who has been able to do so as fluidly as he did. Moreover, the weekly scholarly articles were always very interesting and kept the class very engaged in the material. Finally, the exposure of later Latin was a very worthwhile challenge that Professor Lenski did not make too daunting due to his support.",
