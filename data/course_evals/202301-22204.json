            "comments": [
                "Strengths:\r\n - This class puts you in close contact with other theater-makers at Yale more so than any other class at Yale  I've personally met some of the best directors and actors at this university through this class)\r\n - Toni Dorfman is one of the most kind-hearted professors at Yale\r\n - Whether scenes are being put on or there's some other exercise, the class sessions themselves are genuinely fun\r\n - Watching someone else direct your scenes, and directing scenes with the playwright in the room, is absolutely invaluable, and not something you'd be able to find in any other class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n - Feedback is sometimes a little bit spotty  I wish I had gotten more specific and consistent instruction on how to improve\r\n - This course requires everyone to buy in and fully commit. There were a few times that scenes would get delayed for several class sections because either the playwright or the director wouldn't be in attendance, and then this would mess up the whole schedule. This isn't really \"solvable,\" since it's inherent to the design of the class, but it can be a bit frustrating.",
                "The cross sections between playwriting and directing helped me develop my skills in both fields. I wish we had been able to receive feedback on scenes before we embarked on directing\/writing the next ones however this wasnt at the fault of the professor. Having to change our class schedule based on student conflicts made this not possible and the professor always tried her hardest to get things to us as soon as possible and when we did receive feedback it was always helpful. Maybe structuring it where the students of the class are the actors or giving two weeks to prepare a scene for direction rather than one with the intermediate weeks being focused on playwriting and workshopping scripts would have worked better, but none of this is at the fault of the professor. She did the most excellent job with the conditions she was given and we all were able to experiment more often than (at least I will speak for myself) we have gotten to in other classes offered at Yale.",
                "Working with my fellow classmates, and getting their and Toni's feedback made this class wonderful. I think sometimes the turn-around between getting a script & presenting may have been too quick, especially when it was difficult to find actors who could jump in.  I know Toni said actors used to be able to take this class and it could be helpful to allow people who just want to act to join the class so they can also practice their craft.  If not, definitely find some friends who are free during the time bloc and get them to basically audit the class."

                "Absolutely. This course is totally unique. It will allow you to develop your craft while bringing you closer to equally passionate peers. It was a genuinely inspirational experience.",
                "I absolutely would recommend this course. I came into it expecting to grow as a director but more than anything, I grew as a playwright. I never had much confidence in my playwriting abilities until this course and partaking in it had made me excited to keep trying my hand at playwriting. The professor is also extremely knowledgeable at directing and many of the lessons I learned from her have carried over into other work I have done on campus. I think this course is built for anyone who is wants to not only build up their skills and confidence as playwrights and directors, but anyone looking to explore their creative side in an environment that is supportive and constructive into maximizing your talents. There are many words of wisdom I gained that apply beyond theater that I gained from being a part of this class that are incomparable and irreplaceable.",
                "Yes, I would. It is such a great opportunity to write something and then see it come to life. However, it does require a lot of time to find actors and the turn around time between the distribution of scenes and the presentations can be pretty short. Toni is really great though, and as someone who has never directed before, I definitely learned a lot about directing from Toni and the other directors in the class. Presentations were alwasy fun, and I learned a lot from the talkbacks after each scene. I also appreciated the observer notebook exercise; I learned how to be a more engaged observer of the world.",
                "Yes. Especially if you've taken Director and the Text and\/or have experience directing there's nothing like having an instructor to give you feedback and help you grow. If you consider yourself only a director or only a playwright, you will have to step out of your comfort zone, but it doesn't feel like a lot of pressure.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to improve and workshop their playwrighting\/directing skills in a collaborative supportive environment."
