    "I learned how medicine and the arts are intertwined in everyday life and how they are more similar than one might think.",
    "I learned how to think critically and formulate an argument. I also learned how to support it with well-supported evidence and analysis. I strengthen my writing skills as well.",
    "I learned how to think across multiple subjects and largely improved my writing skills.",
    "I was able to learn more about the resources on Yale's campus to help me. I learned that my work can always get better and that I am not alone in my college journey. I learned that medicine is really interesting.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of academic writing at the college level. Additionally I learned a lot about the intersections of medicine and art."

   "comments": [
    "The in-class exercises and activities such as peer-reviews and student led discussions\/debates were the highlights of the class.  I think a clearer syllabus\/schedule would have helped for organization purposes.",
    "The texts read in this course are hard to understand. But, I felt that the teacher provided enough resources to interpret the text. The last assignment was very fun to complete.",
    "I thought that discussions could have been facilitated better. I found the reading material extremely engaging.",
    "I think there were sometimes where I felt a lack of help in my teacher just letting me go about my assignments without as much feedback as I wanted.",
    "I think this course was a great introduction to writing at the college level and also learning about topics that I'm interested in. We had writing workshops that were very helpful. However, I think they would have been more helpful had they been scheduled before a paper was due and not after the deadline had been passed. Having the workshops during the writing process for a paper would have been more helpful in either the beginnings of writing the paper or the revision stages. Additionally, I found peer review in class was helpful in the revising stages. However, there was peer review only for the research paper and not on any of the other papers, and I think it would have been better to have peer review for all the papers throughout the course. Additionally, I found detailed instructor feedback on drafts was helpful for the research paper, but it was not implemented for the other papers which I think would also have been helpful for drafts for the other papers."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course, especially to students who are like me and more comfortable with the sciences than humanities.",
    "I would recommend this to aspiring medical students as it highlights the importance of keeping in touch with humanity in a profession that stresses impersonal interactions.",
    "Yes, this course is great for people who want to strengthen thier writing skills and learn about the connections between medicine and the arts. This course taught me a lot about how a doctor can also be a writer and in the same way how art can be used to interpret and treat diseases.",
    "Yes. If you are interested in the arts or in medicine, it is a really interesting way to approach either subject.",
    "I would. I loved my professor and she was very helpful in my learning in this course.",
    "I definitely recommend this course to another student especially those interested in the fields of art, medicine, or public health. I also recommend this course to students looking for a class that provides an introduction to academic writing at the college level."
