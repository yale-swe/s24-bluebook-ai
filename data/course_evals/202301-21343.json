                "The lectures are structured in a way that is focused on application of the concepts to enhance understanding and a deeper level of proficiency with the material. The course could benefit from course/lecture notes being made available, as right now the textbook is the only source of reference when reviewing course material.",
                "Strengths - the professor is passionate, knowledgable and very engaging \r\nWeaknesses - occasionally the professor will go to fast and will not fully explain mathematical models - there is quite a lot of content to cover in the semester (very rewarding if you manage to grasp all of the content though)",
                "Tolga is an incredibly engaging instructor, who cares about his students learning and success and sprinkles his lessons with insights about life and humor. He has been teaching the course for a long time and is very experienced. I enjoyed the class and learned a lot about econ and its application to real life. I found the intimate class setting much more conducive to my personal learning process than a massive lecture, but it does mean that there is a more challenging grading curve. While having less psets makes the experience throughout the semester better, it could have been nice to get more regular practice to prepare for our midterm and final."

                "Yes. Even if you are not an economics major it is worth taking this course becuase it will help you to understand much about our world and even help you in other fields where economics is relevant.",

The bigger lecture might be a better fit for some, especially if they are concerned about the curve. However, given the smaller class size and Tolgas experienced, engaging instruction I am very happy with my choice."
