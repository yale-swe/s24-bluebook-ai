The focus on the Bible's textual inconsistencies and ambiguities has been particularly interesting. Despite not coming from a religious background, I can see how this material would be life-altering for people who had grown up in certain religious traditions!",

The course teaches you to read the Bible as we would read the religious and cultural texts of other ancient Near Eastern religions. You learn how to think more critically about the text as a work reflecting the time and the associated prevailing attitudes and needs of the people.",

                "I basically know the whole bible now which is pretty sick",
                "I gained a deeper appreciation of the Bible as a work of literature. Having grown up in a religious household, it was wonderful to find a new perspective on this familiar content. I especially enjoyed learning about the various sources and how they were combined to make the Bible as we know it.",
                "I actually learned so much of the origins of popular philosophical ideas and movements today.",
                "Learned everything I could ever want to know about the Old Testament",

For example, we may read a passage and try to parse out possible source documents, discover the beliefs of the final redactor, or interpret the text as it would be held in cannon. This class was a great exercise in reading with intention and practicing objectivity. We had to put aside our presuppositions about the Bible, and by doing that I completely transformed my understanding of what the Bible is and what it means.",

I also learned an introductory history of Israel from its beginnings from the ancient Near East up to the Second Temple Period. While the emphasis of this course was Biblical content, it also taught students how to close read texts for literary themes, type scenes, and ambiguities. I also learned the basics of Biblical exegesis. Overall, I developed all the knowledge and skills that I had hoped to from this course.",

I learned how to question established assumptions, analyze specific language, interpret something in the context of its history, etc. I gained knowledge about different interpretations of the Bible as well as the historical circumstances surrounding the writing of the Bible.",

I learned how to read the Bible with an eye for how the biblical narrator uses all of the literary elements of Shakespeare to construct narratives. I read the biblical stories, which has enriched my life well beyond this course. I gained the ability to read the sparse text, identify its many gaps and contradictions, and think critically about what those literary features allow the narrator(s) to achieve. I learned about the Ancient Near Eastern context from which the biblical narrative arose. And I gained a newfound appreciation for the singularity of the Hebrew Bible -- which made it possible for a persecuted nation in exile to remain faithful to its God despite a loss of its land and its Temple."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Hayes. She's spectacular, and I feel bad for later students that they won't get to take her. Also the myriad ways she engages the class--not just lecturing, but reading exercises, small-group work, and acting activities\r\nWeaknesses: way too much reading from the Bible, especially for an introductory lecture course. I found my eyes glazing over the words most of the time and barely absorbed anything. It would have been much more valuable to have fewer chapters to read that we can spend more time thinking about. Another weakness is the timing of the final paper. It's tough to manage that with the final exam right around the corner.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hayes (who took the time to learn every single person's name in the 80-person class!); the acting/reading-out-loud activities that helped enrich my understanding of the material; the mix of Bible readings and other sources; the varied ways that we spent our class time; a final paper prompt that is actually fun to work on; and so much more. Weaknesses: lots of the graded coursework is concentrated at the end of the semester (10-12 page final paper due during reading period and then a final exam). Besides that uncertainty about our grades at this point in the semester, I'm feeling crunched on both assignments and like I probably won't produce my best work. I would love some benchmark final paper deadlines throughout the last few weeks of classes to get us on track, especially given that the prompt is a totally new style of paper and analysis for most students in the class.",
                "Strengths: Hayes has been teaching this course forever and knows it like the back of her hands.\r\nWeaknesses: not being taught again because she's retiring :(",
                "Strengths: Professor Hayes is an incredible professor and presents fascinating material. It is unfortunate that she won't be teaching this course in the future. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: in this iteration of the course, because it was larger (I think because this is the last time she is teaching it) we would sometimes split into smaller groups to facilitate discussions. While our TA was very competent, she was not Professor Hayes. But I don't know if this is so relevant for the future.",
                "Instructor is absolutely top notch. Too bad she's retiring!",
                "Everything about the course is great",
                "I did not like the flipped classroom, too many things to keep up with per week.",
                "This was a perfect course, best Ive ever taken. The flipped classroom model worked great. Christine Hayes is a gem. No weaknesses.",
                "The course does a great job of giving a full overview of the Biblical canon.\r\nThe greatest weakness of this class is the flipped classroom format. The textbook is great, but Prof. Hayes is the main reason anybody should take this class and I wanted more face time with her!",
                "I didnt like the split schedule",
                "No sincere weaknesses, just strength, power, glory, beauty, etc.",
                "I thought the flipped class format wasn't great",
                "Strengths: The content matter is incredibly interesting. Professor Hayes is an amazing lecturer, and she has great insight as to how the text can be interpreted in various historical and contemporary contexts. Major pro: study guides for the exams are super helpful, they give you a list of vocabulary you should memorize and a set of possible essay topics. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I personally am not a fan of the flipped-classroom style. I would have just liked if every class was like a lecture. I didn't find the discussion based classes to be super helpful, since it was often about secondary sources. On that note, the amount of secondary (non Bible) readings for this class is completely unnecessary. Some are important for understanding different Biblical theories and for the final paper, but some are never really mentioned again.",
                "Fantastic course, no improvements necessary",
                "I think the lectures are amazing--but it was a bit of a disappointment that it was a flipped classroom. This meant that I was watching these fascinating lectures by myself and then class was very much less engaging. The class was sometimes a section, which was very specific and narrow focused, or the class somewhat repeated the lecture--but in a different way. This meant I was sometimes confused about what information we should know--since the in person lecture sometimes emphasized or talked about different points than the at home lecture.",
                "Strengths - very interesting material. Professor Hayes is amazing.\r\nWeaknesses - extremely high workload. 2 lectures to watch in your own time on top of two hour and 15 minute lectures",
                "No weaknesses. Only strengths. Professor Hayes is the best professor I have ever had.",
                "Very clear idea of what the course is about, excellent resources made available to get a grasp of the material, prof is amazing. Perhaps more words could be given to how the Bible has been read and the impact those readings have had on civilisations. I would've liked to hear more about the comparison between the Judaic and Christian arrangements and ordering of the books that make up the Bible.",
                "The biggest strength of the course is Christine Hayes",
                "Almost a perfectly designed course; small lecture/large seminar style was amazing.",
                "I really enjoyed the flipped classroom aspect of the course. Being able to take notes on my own and then discuss content in class was very helpful. At times, the in-class activities felt a bit repetitive or unnecessary, but this was rare. The main strength of this course was the commitment towards making the content interesting. I also enjoyed how clear the expectations for class, exams, etc. were made.",
                "The double classroom was hard, watching lectures online and going in person made essentially 4 classes per week. But, the discussion sections, interactive teachings, and conversations were great.",
                "Very interesting and well organized",
                "I personally do not love the flipped class style. Watching videos or reading text and then hearing the same material repeated in lecture decreases my engagement. One class, I was unable to do the textbook reading ahead of time, and I actually found myself much more engaged in the lecture.\r\n\r\n I did really enjoy the section style teaching. It was great to hear different opinions on the same texts.",
                "The course was pretty fantastic all around, expectations were very clear & classes were really enjoyable.",
                "No improvements. Professor was amazing.",
                "Strengths: amazing well-spoken professor, well-organized course with clear directions and expectations, engaging material and lectures, emphasis on conversation and participation\r\nWeaknesses: dense readings",
                "This course is perfect",
                "This was a great course. Everything was excellent except, with only one exception. I am personally not a fan on how the class is geared around the external lectures/reading instead of what we learned in class. I understand that some people like that however.",
                "Strengths: Probably the single best-designed class I've taken. The Prof gave you realistic and helpful study guides that really prepared you for exams. Expectations were always very clear. The teaching team really wanted you to succeed. Also, I really enjoyed writing the final paper (exegesis).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course is a lot of work. There is just so much reading on top of the recorded lectures that it feels somewhat unrealistic. I wanted to do all the reading, but I simply didn't have the time.\r\n\r\nWays to improve: I think this should be a year-long course. There is just so much material that I would love to learn about, and one semester feels like too little time to cover the entire Hebrew Bible.",
                "It was one of the reasons why I applied to Yale. I am so glad I had the opportunity to take this class.",
                "Professor Hayes is the strength  the classes were so interesting and story oriented and unique. Weakness is I felt like the final exam was too much memorization, and there were often just way too many readings to keep up with.",
                "Strengths: Christine Hayes. The syllabus and lesson plans. The discussion-focused nature of the class and the in-class participation (despite there being 80 kids in the class)"

I got SO much out of this class despite having very little prior exposure to the Bible, and I know I'm going to be thinking about this material for a long time! This class strikes the sweet spot of being a fantastic, intellectually engaging course while also having practical applications and offering helpful context about a document that many people interact with in their religious or cultural everyday lives. I feel so much better informed about this foundational text in many Western societies.",

This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale -- it completely transformed the way I see a text that I've looked at in different ways for my entire life, and Professor Hayes brought an enthusiasm and a level of care to her teaching that is nearly unparalleled among professors I've had. I was on the fence about taking this class at the beginning of the semester and am so, so glad I chose to take it.",

                "YES",
                "YES. I loved this course so much. You don't have to be of any specific faith to enjoy this course. I guess for some people who are deeply attached to what their faith says about the Bible (for example, that the Torah was authored by Moses, or all events are historically accurate), it may be upsetting to hear the professor say that many parts of the Bible have no historical backing. Also, this course isn't a gut. The exams aren't hard if you study and keep up with the lectures, but that in and of itself is a big time commitment.",
                "Absolutely, learned so much and it was super enjoyable and interesting",

It is truly phenomenal because by the end of the course I felt like I was reading a text that I already had strong opinions about as if I had never read it before - and this opened my eyes.",
                "yes!",

While I do not know if it will be taught again under a different professor, I greatly enjoyed the class under Prof. Hayes. The workload (particularly the reading load) was intense but worthwhile.
