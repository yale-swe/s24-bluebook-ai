                "Strengths- this is a brilliant class- the weekly syllabus means it is easy to know where you are and what to expect. the teaching is also brilliant. Professor Conlin created a classroom that felt like a safe place to continue learning language and that it was ok to make mistakes. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there are a couple of elements of the course that are slightly disorganised which means at the end of the course there are suddenly a lot of deadlines. but this is easily managed when it has all been explained.",
                "I loved it!",
                "No weaknesses. Would recommend highly. Kind teachers, easy to learn, good community.",
                "A strength of this course was definitely having Professor Conlin as an instructor. Prof. Conlin consistently found ways to make class both engaging, yet entertaining. She incorporated a nice balance of different teaching methods, so that it was accommodating for students with different learning styles. This course also offered the opportunity for students to immerse themselves in the ASL community at Yale. The ASL at Yale Community is growing rapidly, and I am pleased to be a part of this group here at Yale. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course is perhaps the fact that there were many more homework assignments in this course than there were in either ASL I or II. I realize that this is expected, as students are progressing through the language; however, I did not expect such a sharp increase in assignments."

                "Yes, without a doubt. This class helped me feel much more confident conversing in ASL. The course also greatly refined my ASL grammar and storytelling skills. Finally, this class offers plentiful opportunities to connect with the Yale ASL Community at large. This community is composed of many kind individuals who truly express a love for this language."
