                "The course provided an introduction to different laboratory methods and instruments in archaeology as well and emphasized the sort of questions and concerns archaeologists have to think about. It also was a good introduction to the properties of various materials such as ceramics, glass, bone, and stone. There was also a lot of time (maybe even too much) spent on data presentation, including graphics, posters, and presentations, that would be pretty useful in many academic or professional fields.",
                "This course was a broad survey of some of the bigger specializations within archaeology and they science and analysis that is required to successfully study archaeology. We learned about lithics, pottery and ceramics, zooarchaeology and bioarchaeology among other branches, and also learned about statistics and the approaches to data analysis that are used in the field. This semester, the broader theme was African Archaeology, and we had several guest lecturers from other members in the department who are currently doing work in Africa, as well as other lectures from visiting students and staff to learn more about their work. The second half of the course was focused on our own projects with African collections of the University, and learning how to approach these collections and how to display our findings in a scientific poster.",
                "You learn about the basic materials that come up in archaeological excavations and subsequently end up in labs.  You also learn about some basic tools and techniques that are used in labs to generate findings from archaeological materials. Finally, you develop skills in giving presentations, designing academic posters, and overall, just presenting information in the best way possible."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Michael and Ellery are extremely knowledgeable and approachable. The course expectations are clearly outlined. The class's structure allows you to really pursue your own interests and then apply it which enables a much higher level of engagement. I left the class really feeling like I accomplished something and gained a much stronger footing in lab science and quantitative methods. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Felt a little rushed to get the project put together in time/analyzed. Deadlines crept up quickly.",
                "I sometimes felt unsure as to how detailed my notes for the readings should be, given that many pages of reading on advanced scientific processes were assigned. I think if the readings were shorter, with more relevant application to a particular case study, I would have been more engaged with the class. As it was, I felt I skimmed things because I knew I wouldn't really need to know it for anything.",
                "Weaknesses: The readings as whole were extremely tedious. In the ceramics pXRF activity, there were too many people in each group so a lot of people had to just stand around, and those people mostly slacked off during the analysis part. Given the limited number of instruments, I think it would be better to have smaller groups with a smaller number of sherds each.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Professor Frahm made it clear that there were no activities with pre-ordained correct answers, and that held true throughout the course. It was pretty amazing to analyze real artifacts and have real results that nobody knew before. As someone with a directly relevant major, I will absolutely use all the skills and knowledge from the class in many future courses. The class also felt like a very low-pressure environment, as each person was individually motivated and interested in the subject.",
                "I felt that the course was well structured, and that it covered a wide breadth of information without being overwhelming. It was also very conducive to learning from our peers, especially from the grad students in the class, but I never felt a distinct hierarchy between the grad students and the undergrads. I think that having students do smaller tasks and reports would be beneficial, or covering how these reports are written and outlining specific expectations for them would be very helpful, especially for the pXRF lab since it was difficult to complete that report without previous experience or specific instructions. Otherwise, the course was very well designed to engage students and not make the 3-hour class boring.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it is small and the professor and TF were super approachable. The weaknesses are that feedback was seldom received (especially in the first 2/3 of the class when we had to give in note, take quizzes, etc.). This made it tough to judge how we were doing leading into the final project."

            "comments": [
                "Yes if they are looking for a way to do an independent project that allows them to learn more about how to carry out lab science experiments in archaeology.",
                "If you have a serious interest in archaeology, especially the scientific methods involved, then yes. The final project is fun if you have experience with statistics.",
                "It can get somewhat technical, so if you already have a real interest in archaeology, yes; otherwise, no. The three-hour class time looks daunting, but I don't think Professor Frahm actually kept us the full three hours a single time.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to other humanities and social science students looking for an engaging and interesting science credit, and especially for students of art history and other object-related fields. It opens up new perspectives that I think the humanities are often lacking, and provides different lenses through which one may analyze artifacts that simple artistic interpretation misses out on. It was fun, the readings were manageable, and the final project was engaging and well guided by the professor and TF, who provided a lot of support to the students as they completed it.",
                "Yes! Absolutely! This class was fantastic, and the end product is something I am truly proud of. The course was at times boring, given it was a lot of reading and being lectured at, but being in a small class and in a lab meant that examples were often within reach, and much time was spent doing hands on activities that corresponded to what we had read. The skills learned toward the end of the class really made it all worth it. You learn the dos and don'ts of presenting, a skill which will be useful for the rest of my time at Yale and beyond. You also get opportunities to work with other professors and researchers on their active research and ultimately to produce something novel."
