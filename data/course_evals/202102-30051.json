Weaknesses include the direction of the course for specific students, as material was taught such that students with previous exposure to the material would thrive much more than those without.",
                "A strength of this course is the selection of material. I think that it is well chosen for the scope of this class. I think that a \"weakness\" of this class is the sheer quantity of reading you have to do per week -- it almost detracts from how in-depth you can go per work.",
                "Usually this class isn't a big as it was the Summer, and I do beleive the size was a detriment. I enjoyed it nonetheless.",
                "Strengths- interesting content, professor clearly has a deep knowledge of material\r\nWeaknesses- extremely high reading load, boring method of assessments. I thought the quizzes where stressful and didn't allow me to show my knowledge creatively.",
                "Strengths: Great syllabus, very sweet and approachable professor.\r\nWeaknesses: Wish there was more discussion, but I believe that was mostly inhibited by the Zoom format.",
                "This course was great and no weaknesses come to mind, except perhaps its size should be capped.",
                "Strength: Clear organization and communication of expectations\r\nWeakness: A lot of the readings are very 'mainstream' so not much flexibility with learning new material besides perhaps choosing to write a final essay instead of taking the exam",
                "Strengths: Professor Freudenburg is a fun and engaging lecturer. It was always fun to listen to him talk. The TAs were also super knowledgeable and nice and gave good lectures themselves. Quizzes were perfectly reasonable. Material was very engaging and discussions were pretty interesting as well. Weaknesses: there is definitely a lot of reading. I think this class would be difficult to take if you're taking another summer class at the same time.",
                "Strengths: so much knowledge. You will never get to cover so much material in so little time with such incredible instructors.\r\nWeakness: it is a lot, the classes are incredibly long and you can get exhausted in them and there is so much material it can be hard to dive into each piece",
                "Strengths: lectures with Prof Freudenburg!!!! he's amazing. Take anything with him. Weaknesses: I thought breakout room discussions were not the most intellectually challenging."

                "Yes! The content was very interesting, and both Professor Freudenburg and the teaching fellows clearly cared about their students' education and growth.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student looking to take a closer look at the Ancient Greek myths, as the Roman part of the course did not allow for as much discussion as I would have liked. Also, the reading for each class is quite intense, so you may not fully explore all of the rich ideas in each work.",
                "I would recommend this course for someone already familiar with Greek and Roman myths. It enriches the study of this class, and helps with the broader picture.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who was very interested in the material. However, I could see it being a real struggle for someone with no great interest in classical mythology.",
                "This is a solid class for anyone wanting an intro to mythology/the ancient world, but I would specifically recommend if you have some background with classics or Latin specifically. There was a fair amount of Latin-related content in the lectures. Of course you can do very well without knowing Latin, but it seems the experience is overall fuller if you do have at least some basic knowledge of the language. There is also a lot of archaeology content in the lectures. Also, the TA's are both really into art, and most of their breakout rooms are about pottery/paintings. So if you dislike art analysis this may not be for you.",
                "Yes, very much so. It's a lot of reading - while it is not essential to do all the reading all the time, the course is much better if you actually have time to do it. The class is a lot of fun. I had a bit of a background in classics, and this class is especially interesting for those who have studied classics before but haven't read all the works on the syllabus (though the course was accessible to non-classics students as well). And the other work might seem daunting, but it isn't. There are three quizzes that are pretty easy if you do/are familiar with the reading (basic IDs and a general essay) and a final exam or paper.",
                "It's a fun survey, the Prof is awesome and I'm sure the people will be in future years as well (there's a good mix of Classics majors and other STEM focused people, at Yale and beyond). It's not super in depth analysis for the most part, but one can still learn what one wants to get out of it (especially as the Prof is very open and willing to meet with students in office hours).",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to someone else. You really are learning about stories, and they are truly fascinating stories when you begin to dissect them. The assessments were not too difficult if you study for them a bit, and all the instructors are great.",
                "Yes! I loved this class, I truly felt like I learned so much. I would warn them about the MASSIVE amount of reading. You can still manage to get by and the quizzes arent that tough if you pay attention in class and take some notes.",
