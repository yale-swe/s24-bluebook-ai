                "The course covered the vast history of China very broadly. This class was greatly helpful in improving my writing abilities and I am certain what I learned was at the very least on par with a writing composition class. It was a very enjoyable way to improve my writing.",
                "provided me with a good amount of knowledge of china",
                "I learned about Song, Qing, and modern-day China. I practiced reading primary sources closely and looking for surprising things to do with them. I learned about how historians use lots of types of primary sources that go beyond texts, such as images. Movable type printing happened first in China or Japan!",
                "I learned a very general overview of China and how to write better and more concise.",
                "Very high level and not very intellectually stimulating overview of broad Chinese history.",
                "Learned SO much about connecting history and present. Loved the current events. Felt so plugged in \/ like I could have interesting conversations with family and friends.",
                "This course deepened my understanding of China's historical context, culture, and contemporary politics, fueling my interest to continue studying the Indo-Pacific and China's role in Global Affairs.",
                "General overview of the Song Dynasty and recent Chinese history since the eighties. You will learn to write how Professor Hansen prefers. Interesting content related to current territorial disputes and the history of protest in China."

                "I really like the current events portion of the class! I sometimes felt like the class was busy-work oriented, such as the map quiz or the short essays, and I felt like I could've understood the material better through more engaging lecture.",
                "More weaknesses then strengths. Class lectures and slides were very unorganized and confusing. it felt like there was no structure at all to the class at all.",
                "Very disjointed, especially between narrative and history. Often found myself lost in lecture.\r\n\r\nThe structure did not make sense to me, as to how the articles, lectures and readings coalesced.",
                "Strengths: Opportunities for extra-credit means that you can get an A if you do all 3. Weaknesses: The course jumped around way too much. You go from the Song dynasty to the Qing, basically skipping 400 years for no apparent reason. The stuff we learned about never felt purposeful (e.g. family history in the 12th century?) Material might've been more interesting if the course was taught more chronologically.",
                "Strengths: Interesting content and variety of activities\/assignments. Get to see some cool artifacts. \r\nWeaknesses: Lecture content didn't seem optimally organized and it felt like we lost sight of the bigger picture sometimes. Dr. Hansen's writing style that she expects is also pretty odd (short intros\/minimal thesis with hot takes) and she essentially forces you to conform to it. Grading seemed a little harsher at the beginning.",
                "STRENGTHS: Genuinely fantastic professor, great TAs, interesting lectures, great trips to the Beinecke, interesting assignments, modest workload, reasonable grading, extra-credit assignments, ungraded pre-quizzes (which also serve as note-taking templates), real-time coverage of current events, etc. WEAKNESSES: Could've moved much faster and covered more content.",
                "The pre-quiz at the beginning of lectures is very nice for letting us know what we should focus on throughout the lesson. I do wish more time was spent on ancient China although I do understand it is tough to compress it into one semester. I also think more time should have been allotted for the final presentation. It is difficult to show extensive knowledge and command of course material in only a few minutes.",
                "the class jumped back and forward in time too often and the in class writing assessment was something we had not done before and had no practice in",
                "Strengths: Reasonable amount of reading assigned. Clear expectations. Lecture outlines. Feedback on writing. Interesting topics. I liked having the news articles to connect what we were learning to the present day. Visits to Sterling and the Beinecke were awesome!\r\nWeakness: A lot of my classmates and I struggled to find 'hot takes' for our essays, and I wish we had more instruction\/guidance on how to do that.",
                "Strengths- the faculty grade things very quickly and the readings directly apply to the assignments\r\nWeaknesses- it is hard to get an A without constantly meeting with the teaching staff and the workload if you want an A is much higher than expected and requires you do every single extra credit assignment. The feedback and expectations is also unclear.",
                "Weaknesses: lecture style, assignment topic choices, unclear grading regime\r\nStrengths?: gut?",
                "Confusing grading and instructions pretty disorganized",
                "Genuinely fascinating and relevant content, however, I think the course title is a bit misleading. This is not a general overview of all of Chinese history, rather, it tracks 3 specific themes and cherry picks from certain moments in certain dynasties that connect to current day issues in China."

                "Taking a lower level class as an upper level student was a weird experience, because I felt like I was being graded for skills that I had already developed (citations, writing a short essay). I often felt like the grading was petty (docked points for being one word over the word count) so unless you're an underclassman I would say no.",
                "No, if there are other chinese history classes i would take that instead. it was reletivly easy for a writing credit but id personally rather take a more organized class.",
                "Definitely not. This was barely a writing credit, as there was not much writing involved and the final is a presentation.",
                "Yes",
                "No - the course jumps around way too much, much of the material is unappealing (e.g. analyzing family history in the 12th century), and basically all assignments were on annoying topics \/ poorly phrased to make responding to them an unnecessary pain. I would not take it again.",
                "Yes if you're interested in Chinese history and willing to conform your writing style to her expectations. Workload is pretty average for a writing credit (aka quite a bit), especially considering the extra credit essays which I think most people did. The content is worth it IMO.",
                "So far, HIST 321 is perhaps the best course Ive taken at Yale.\r\n1. Prof. Hansen is an extremely good professor. She is self-aware and approachable to a degree that most professors could only dream of.\r\n2. The periodic field trips (so to speak) to the Beinecke and elsewhere were very enjoyable.\r\n3. The primary-source analysis that we were tasked with was a lot of fun.\r\n4. The volume of readings was very manageable, although not always predictable.\r\n5. The course was very front-heavy, which left me with time to focus on my other classes during the reading period.\r\n6. The grading was very reasonable, and Prof. Hansen offers generous extra-credit assignments. It is a very easy writing credit if that's what you're looking for.\r\n7. The blend between the past and the present was quite appropriate.\r\n8. In my opinion, the course couldve moved faster and covered more content.",
                "I would, it is a great way to improve writing skills while learning about interesting, important history.",
                "yes but only if you are in need of a writing credit. If it was better organized then it would be better. It also does not involve ordinary writing skills.",
                "If you want an introduction to Chinese history, this is a good course to take. The themes are protests\/territorial disputes, family life, and more broadly how the past informs the present in China. The course also has a reasonable workload and mostly interesting readings. It is also frontloaded, so there is less work at the end of the semester.",
                "No I would not if they want to take it for an A and learn a lot about China. As someone who went in knowing nothing, I learned quite a lot. For people who had basic information on China though, it was not helpful.",
                "Not necessarily. You enter hoping to learn some interesting things about China and leave knowing a little bit about the Qing and Ming Dynasties. Not to mention, your writing doesn't improve much given the maximum length of each assignment is roughly 500 words. It is a gut for a writing credit, but grading is highly inconsistent, harsh, and the professor's rationale for grading decisions is highly irrational-- to put it lightly.",
                "As long as Valerie Hansen is teaching this course, I do not recommend it.",
                "Honestly, no. For a supposed introductory writing and history class, as a junior at Yale, this was one of the most demanding and niche courses I have taken, and was often a source of headache. Expectations were entirely unclear and students would leave class and section mutually commiserating about an utter lack of instruction even when we asked for clarification. There seemed to be a consensus among the students in this course that this was a \"suck it up and deal with it\" type of class. Be ready to have your papers picked apart in minute detail and to be bewildered by the feedback, with no opportunity for improvement. Also, based on how harsh grading is, the extra credit is not entirely optional if you want to do even OK in this course. The saving grace of the course was Luke the TF."
