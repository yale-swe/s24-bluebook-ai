I learned how to take a framework of thinking from an essayist and apply it to classes I was taking in real life. I learned how to expand on ideas and dig deeper and deeper into what those ideas are telling us about the world they were created in.",
                "This is a fantastic course that gives you a wide range of theoretical and practical frameworks with which to think about science and technology from an STS and feminist epistemology perspective. Readings ranged from Kim Tallbear on Native American DNA, historicising and contextualising the idea of 'objectivity', Donna Haraway's situated knowledges and partial perspectives, gendered metaphors in scientific discussions of sex and how sex is used in cell research, how algorithms can reinforce racism and sexism, and more.",

                "This course provided a chance to explore the history of science via a variety of sources. I gained exposure to many diverse and thoughtful critiques, as well as technoscientific imaginings. Professor Vora encouraged students to think with sources, rather than against, and this really affected the way we read different authors. Although we as a class developed many of our own critiques, with Professor Vora's direction and support, we were able to also come to important understandings about the development of scientific methods, objectivity, and technoscience. If you are interested in a more critical and self-reflective science, this course provides an incredibly generative space.",

                "Strengths - course content is really interesting and necessary for anyone considering career in STEM, Professor Vora is a great resource and has a plethora of knowledge in this field Weaknesses - sometimes instructions for assignments were not very clear",
                "Strengths: The readings covered a wide range of theory and analysis and each of them felt both relevant and enlightening. None of the readings felt extraneous or uninteresting. Professor Vora was a very knowledgeable and dedicated professor who displayed both kindness to us as well as an interest in our academic work. Discussions were really great and often we started to run out of time for the planned activity or had to be cut short because of how much interesting discussion was going on! The large room we were in was not very conducive to a close seminar atmosphere but there still ended up feeling like there was a good dynamic going on. Doing reading responses via Perusall was also amazing as it allowed us to read each other's insights before class and engage more closely with the readings. The project, where you create a workshop or other form of communication on a topic of your interest, is another strength of this class.\r\nWeaknesses: A little more structured guidance on assessments might have been appreciated, although this got a lot better as the semester went on and will probably be improved by the time this class is taught again, since this was the first time it was happening.",
                "interesting and insightful readings that tapped on different applied issues, but which made it sometimes difficult to synthesize everything we learnt! \r\nwould be better (for the presenter and the class) if it was encouraged\/ mandatory to meet the professor prior to discussion leadership, or if we could experiment with different modes of discussion (e.g. more small group\/ whiteboard based discussions)",
                "Strengths: in general, the readings were incredibly interesting and helpful; students were encouraged to bring their life experiences into class as a form of knowledge and critique; class discussions were well facilitated (if a bit intimidating at times, just because the material\/concepts was new for many of us); assignments and final project were quite well organized in terms of semester timeline; Professor Vora was accessible and kind to students, as well as accommodating multiple styles of engagement with the text\/discussion; Professor Vora is also incredibly knowledgable on these topics, and works hard to support student interests\/curiosities, especially in their particular areas of research.\r\nWeaknesses: the readings were sometimes a bit more dense \/ challenging (although we usually walked through them in class together), but it was still quite a bit to get through each week; some assignments were unclear in their exact requirements, leading to different results for many of us (however, this was addressed as the semester progressed past ~halfway and then a quite thorough and helpful rubric was there for following assignments).",
                "strengths: \r\nthe class was very well structured and organized each week\r\nweakness:\r\ni wish there were more interactive elements to the class beyond just reading and discussing. I really enjoyed our final project and something less intensive as that throughout the class would have been nice.",
                "Strengths: I think every student should take this course, and I am very grateful that I took it as a first year. This course provides fundamental reading to give you the opportunity to challenge your own beliefs and create new ones from a feminist perspective. Professor Vora is incredibly understanding and accommodating. I really enjoyed Perusall and discussing with my classmates about things mentioned in the texts. This class allows you to bring your own experiences as part of the emotional engagement with your learning. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would really liked it if professor Vora would've encouraged us to challenge the texts. I would've liked if we could've done more to create our interventions in class and throughout this course, or if this course be in two parts: 1.) this course as the first part, and 2.) the creation and implementation of the intervention."

Professor Vora has so much knowledge and is doing incredible work. You are also exposed to scholarship from incredible scholars. If you are going into any STEM field, please take this course.",
                "This course changed the way I hold myself in my classes. It gave me a greater understanding of the way Yale presents and locks up its knowledge, and it made me want to bring about change to most of the fields of study I hope going into. I loved every reading because I always knew after finishing it and reading it again, I would be able to bring a new insight to my life about the way I understand the world. It gave me so much to think about, and I hope it leads to my classmates and I bringing about real change!",
                "100% recommend, especially for either STEM students or people interested in STS\/Science Studies, although several people in this class were also social science\/humanities\/econ majors and everyone was able to apply the theory to their own academic work in really interesting ways! This class gives you a lot of really foundational theoretical concepts surrounding feminist epistemology that are applicable to all sorts of work (and I found myself using some of the class readings as frameworks for other class assignments).  Definitely recommend if you are the slightest bit interested in science and what a feminist science might look like, as well as if you have ever been a little uncomfortable working in a scientific discipline and thought that there were things that could be done better or differently.",
                "Yes definitely, this was possibly my favorite class this semester! I also appreciate how the class is designed to be accessible to any student with an interest in examining the implicit biases within seemingly-neutral science and tech discourse (regardless of what discipline we might be from)",
                "I would so so highly recommend! This course is one of the best I've taken at Yale, and an absolute must for 1) STEM majors, 2) anyone interested in thoughtfully engaging with science, and 3) those pursuing a Science and Technology Studies focus as a part of their major. It's engaging on many levels, and Professor Vora accommodates student needs\/interests quite well. The readings might feel a little intense at times, but there are many resources to support (including classmates, Professor Vora, and a developing STS undergrad group). I feel that this course has been a really key part of my undergrad experience and learning.",
                "I would, this course was very unique and a great first experience into a seminar type class",
                "10000% -- I think everyone should take this course, especially first-years and sophomores even though it is classified as a junior seminar. This course re-defines the way you think about the world and the knowledge you just assume to be true."
