In theory, I would have absolutely loved this class, but it was completely ruined by Professor Fahmy. He is disorganized, unclear, and did not follow the syllabus in any way. If it is possible to have immunoengineering be taught by another professor, please switch the professor. Or at the very least, please REQUIRE him to hire a TF. This subject matter is so fascinating, and it deserved to be delivered well, by a competent professor.",
                "so incredibly disorganized",
                "Strengths: Interesting topics, low workload, easy grading, prof readily available to meet in office hours, interesting final project\r\nWeaknesses: unorganized (prof rarely posted lecture slides or grades), long tangents in class (didnt ever know what we were supposed to know), readings posted last-minute (such as the day before class or exams), overly complicated grading protocols, overall we didn't cover that much material\r\nThe class could be improved if the prof stays on schedule and posts lecture slides/notes after each class",
                "Strengths: interesting info when you look past all the flaws of this course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Fahmy is incredibly unreliable. Doesn't send back or grade anything until weeks or months later (as I write this, I still have not received graded assignments from months ago). Professor changed the date of the midterm, the day it was supposed to be administered. Terrible at communicating and responding to emails. The classes were all over the place. Homework assignments took FOREVER and since we didn't really learn anything in class, we had to spend hours looking though his notes which were so unclear.",
                "The course imparted a lot of knowledge that was very relevant to issues happening around us. It also included a fun project. The structure of the course and the knowledge it imparts is great but I'm hoping that in the future course materials will be posted promptly.",
                "The professor is all over the place but the class has some very interesting topics.",
                "The organization was atrocious. The lectures were impossible to follow. The midterm was a complete mess. The grading was inconsistent. The professor was impossible to reach or get in touch with. All of these things would have to be completely changed in order for me to recommend this course to any student.",
                "The course itself is very interesting but Professor Fahmy is incredibly disorganized. Hes very clearly passionate about what he teaches but the issue arises when grades are posted weeks if not months later, the material for class is poster right before or not at all or he changes the midterm several times. This course would be made 100 times better with a TF.",
                "Strengths: Material is very interesting, you will definitely get an A. Weaknesses: Course is very very disorganized. Professor does not use TAs and sometimes it is very had to get ahold of him."

            "comments": [
                "I would never recommend this course to another student (unless taught by a professor other than Professor Fahmy). \r\n\r\nI should have known not to take this course when we still hadn't received any sort of syllabus by the second week of classes. When we did finally receive the syllabus, it was meaningless, as Professor Fahmy did not follow it whatsoever. Deadlines were unclear, assignments were given completely at random, and the entire course was chaos. At the beginning of the term, Professor Fahmy explained to us that he did not want to have a TF for the course because he wanted as much face-to-face interaction with students as possible. In theory, great! Love a hands-on professor. In practice, absolutely terrible. Professor Fahmy gave all students his cellphone number as well as email so we would have multiple ways to contact him- again, great in theory. I NEVER received a response to ANY text or email sent to Professor Fahmy. Whether it was asking a clarifying question on the material or trying to get my final project idea approved, he never once answered a single communication I sent him, and this was the same for most classmates. If you are going to refuse to have a TF, you need to be able to be contacted! \r\n\r\nAlso, if you refuse to have a TF, you need to be able to design problem sets, give them to students, and grade them in a timely manner. Per the syllabus, we were supposed to have one problem set a week- standard stuff. Instead, we were assigned 1 on 9/14 due 9/21, 2 due 10/12, 3 on 10/13 due 10/18, and 4 on 11/28 due 12/2. Problem sets 3 and 4 STILL have not been graded, and today is December 12th. He gives no warnings for when he will actually give an assignment, and as you can see from the dates, does not even consistently give a full week for completing an assignment. \r\n\r\nLet's get into the midterm: we were supposed to have a take-home exam given to us on 10/19 (the Tuesday before fall break). 2 hours before the exam was supposed to be posted, we received an email that the exam would not be posted because Professor Fahmy was having dental surgery. Surgery sucks, and I feel bad for him, but he had had this surgery planned for months- he could have planned when to have the exam around this, instead of intending for the exam to be THE DAY OF HIS SURGERY and canceling the exam at the last minute. He rescheduled the exam for 10/28, the Thursday after fall break and told us he would be converting it to an IN-PERSON instead of take home exam. Giving us a little over a week to study, the week of which was supposed to be a BREAK, he swapped the whole format of the test. Two days before the test, he reversed again, saying it would be take home. This, understandably, caused a lot of anxiety, especially since he was recovering from surgery and no one could reach him to ask any questions.\r\n\r\nFurther side effect of his surgery: the Tuesday immediately after break (10/26), he showed up to class seemingly high as a kite on post-surgery medications. He gave us a handout that was supposed to be an analogy for T cell recognition of antigen-presenting cells... but the T cells were a bunch of cartoons of Donald Trump's head attached to a rollerblade?! And the rollerblade was skating around the United States trying to find another rollerblade of hands holding out food?! It was more incoherent than usual and frankly, bizarre and a bit alarming, especially with the punctuation of him repeatedly slapping the projector screen to make his points.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the total lack of professionalism and clarity surrounding any of the assignments or the midterm, Professor Fahmy consistently shows up to class 10 or more minutes late. It is disrespectful of student time. Furthermore, Professor Fahmy would disparage the idea of COVID-19 booster shots in class, saying he believed it would make us less immune rather than more immune, but he failed to send us any papers or scientific backing to support this belief.",
                "no. its not a hard class but the disorganization can be very frustrating",
                "I would probably not recommend this course to another student unless you are prepared for a chaotic but easily graded class. The lack of organization caused unnecessary stress, and the topics could have been learned quicker by directly reading the textbook or research papers.",
                "Prof Fahmy is a really great person and clearly very smart, but a terrible professor. He is not meant to instruct. Maybe he is great at having conversations and engaging in intellectual discussion, but he cannot teach, stick to a schedule or ever respond to emails on time.... I would therefore not recommend this class to any student.",
                "This course was a great wealth of knowledge regarding the covid situation and other health related problems. You will appreciate the knowledge gained.",
                "Yes the class is very interesting and the professor typically grades fairly.",
                "I would not in the state that it was taught. The material is promising but everything about the execution of this course is horrible. The class did not follow the syllabus, there was no educational organization to topics, the lecture was a complete waste of time because it was impossible to follow. The lecture notes were very helpful but did not at all reflect the knowledge gained in class. Nearly everything I learned was learned by reading the post-lecture notes which made me feel that attending class was overall a waste of time.",
                "While the Professor is incredibly understanding, I would only recommend this course if a TF is provided. The organization is dismal and takes away from the actual learning (which is very interesting material, to be honest).",
                "Yes, because the material is very very interesting. However, be prepared for a class that is very disorganized."
