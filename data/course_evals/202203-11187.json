                "I would! The class is quite low-stress and the teacher is super supportative. Many people find a group of close friends through their Chinese class and this was definitely true for me. The content of the class is what it is, but, particularly for this class, there is a lot of valuable learning done outside of the textbook. This class was probably the class that was most engaging for me this semester and is probably one of the few I will actually miss.",
                "Yes 100%, especially with Wang laoshi! You get to learn much much more about your heritage, and I feel like it has allowed me to connect with my family on a deeper level.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to students who want to engage with more Chinese culture and make friends.",
                "Absolutely, a great way to find a community of like minded individuals and reinvigorate your knowledge of Chinese culture and language.",
                "Yes! besides all the academic benefits, the smaller size of the class makes it a tighter knit group where everyone knows each other and there is a strong sense of community."
