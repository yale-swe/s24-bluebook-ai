                "It is hard to stay 100% engaged with a course that meets every day and has homework every day but not in consistent amounts - some days the homework was very light and on other days it would take me hours. This course could be improved so much by going back to the basics of Chinese - e.g teaching us more verbs rather than niche vocabulary - and practising how to ask and respond to questions for the sake of understanding question structure, rather than understanding meaning and giving a high-level response. Maybe a weekly verb vocab list with a short test would be useful. This course could also do a better job of teaching students how to break down a sentence in a reading comprehension and understand its meaning. Even if I understand all the chinese words in a sentence sometimes the meaning of the sentence is still not obvious to me. \r\n\r\nAlso, most of the canvas homework quizzes \/ reading comprehension quizzes use SO much new or niche vocabulary that it is impossible to guess the meaning of the characters from context alone. I think generally the homework is too hard. It would be better if the homework lined up more accurately with what was learnt in class that day and was used just to consolidate knowledge rather than making us guess at unfamiliar vocab.",
