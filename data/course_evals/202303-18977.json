                "Through this course I was able to gain a better understanding of how political institutions and the economy in Latin America has been shaped through colonial legacy, and democratization.",
                "I learned so much about macroeconomics and politics overall. I really enjoyed the lecture format because it optimized the amount of content we could cover in class. I started this class off feeling very incapable of the material and multiple times I asked the professor if I should even be in there because I had no prior experience with Econ or politics. She told me to stick to it and I definitely learned a lot and am thankful for how easy she made it to ingest.",
                "I gained valuable knowledge in the study of Latin American Politics especially in nuanced areas such as development, migration, social policy, and stability of democracy in the region. Through lecture, section, and the readings a gained a better understanding of scholarly literature and how the study of a certain region in the field political science changes overtime. I gained valuable skills in reasoning and creating connections through content covered in lecture and in the readings.",
                "I learned a lot about Latin America and its history more broadly, and how this impacts the current political climate. This course allowed be the evaluate Latin Americans politics not just from an American persepective which I liked.",
                "Going into this course, I was a little worried that the takeaway would be like, \"Latin America exists. It has some problems.\" I feel like I've taken other polisci classes that have that surface-level exploration. This is definitely not that kind of class. I felt like I learned real, practical things that I absolutely did not know before about Latin America's economy and political situation, things that I wouldn't have found obvious at the beginning. I have a much better understanding now of Latin America's economic history and a more nuanced picture of modern latin america."

                "Professor is very engaged with the content and makes herself accessible to you if you need help. No weaknesses.",
                "I think a strength of the course was the ability to engage in a more niche interests in a Latin American country through newspaper assignments, I believe something that can be improved it the time window for exams. It takes a lot longer to hand write an essay than it would to type one, so the time constraint was a bit difficult for many of us in the class.",
                "The strengths are the class format and section. I learned a lot from class conversation as well. The weakness is the level of reading, but it helped that we would break it down in section.",
                "The strengths of the class is the TF and its content. Its a great introduction class to Latin American politics and you really do learn a lot. The readings can be a little heavy sometimes but the professor and TF do a great job of unpacking the material in class and section. No major weaknesses.",
                "The whole class needs to be thrown away. The lectures are too dense, and the fast pace in which they are taught do not facilitate student learning. The amount of reading expected for this class is ridiculous, and I always left lecture feeling like learned nothing. Most of my learning was done in section, where our TF did a great job at actually teaching us the main themes of the readings.",
                "The course is very good at encouraging students to engage with the lecture material during lecture as well as through discussions posts through section. The course is very clearly outlined as well with distinct lessons and modules and readings to accompany the certain topic for the week. The pacing of the class itself was also fairly reasonable as well. One weakness of the class was sometimes the content covered was convoluted itself and it was hard to determine how the lecture topic of the week connected with the main theme of the class.",
                "Very engaging, interesting readings, and lecture always facilitated discussion. I loved my section and TA, and always came out of section with more clarity and interest in course topics.",
                "I appreciated the organization of the syllabus; we covered a lot of content and moved briskly, but it never felt overwhelming. I wish there had been more attention paid to case studies and national histories, rather than regional political science models and political economy. I think that I'd have learned something more concrete about the region that way.",
                "Strengths: AMAZING professor. Extremely knowledgeable about her subject and actually skilled at transmitting that information to students. Professor Sellars has a nuanced and complex understanding of Latin American politics that students can absorb. Also amazing TA! Sofia was such a valuable resource; she simplified and clarified all of the ideas presented in the readings and lectures so that they were easy to grasp and remember. Well-organized and structured class. \r\nWeaknesses: Although Sofia is amazing, each discussion section is a little less like a discussion and more like a mini-lecture. I think that can be great sometimes- I definitely got a lot out of section with her- but expect discussion sections to involve a lot more listening and taking notes than discussion."

                "I would definitely recommend this class because it teaches you politics and focuses specifically on Latin America which is so intricate. I thought I knew a lot about Latin America but I learned so much more than I expected.",
                "Yes I would, its a great class and you really do learn a lot about Latin America.",
                "yes. definitely. interesting and also not a hard/heavy workload so you can actually internalize what you are learning and reading instead of just doing the work to get a good grade.",
                "No. The lectures are too dense, and the fast pace in which they are taught do not facilitate student learning. The amount of reading expected for this class is ridiculous, and I always left lecture feeling like learned nothing. Most of my learning was done in section, where our TF did a great job at actually teaching us the main themes of the readings.",
                "I definitely would recommend this course to other students especially because it takes a nuanced approach to the study of Latin American politics and the region in general and doesn't just focus on the political aspects of the region. The content of the lectures is very interesting and informative, allowing students to gain a greater understanding of this region which is largely mischaracterized or misunderstood. A very interesting region to study.",
                "Yes, I definitely would. It was a great introductory course and I feel like I learned a lot.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! This course offers an overview of Latin American politics that is actually practical and useful. I felt like I walked away being able to point at specific practical things that I learned. Sometimes I walk away from a polisci class feeling that much of what I learned was obvious or could be assumed- not so with this class. Amazing and engaging professor and TA!"
