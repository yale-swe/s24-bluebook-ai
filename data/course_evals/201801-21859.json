    "I gained a baseline of knowledge about social psychology and its origin.",
    "I learned about many aspects of the field of social psychology, including prejudice, aggression, emotion, attraction\/relationships, and altruism. I also learned about the types of studies that have been conducted in the field of social psychology to understand human behavior.",
    "I learned the outcomes of some famous psych experiments. Learned that a psych is good at employing the scientific method but goes completely haywire when conclusions are to be drawn from these experiments. Thus, many different experiments that are meant to test the same thing don't reproduce similar results.",
    "Interesting psychology class. learned about mannerism and social situations that influence our behavior, interesting for the real world",
    "This class content was very interesting. I have previously done research in social psychology so it was really cool to learn more about something that I had gotten hands-on experience with previously.",
    "social insights",
    "I learned a lot about social psychology!! :)",
    "I learned concepts in social psychology that I can now observe in everyday life.",
    "I received a great overview of the field of social psychology. Very interesting stuff! I really enjoyed coming to lecture every day. It's as if I learned something mind-blowing every single lecture!",
    "I learned about the major studies and theories of social psychology",
    "Solid information about the various influences that the social world has on one's behavior, thoughts, and actions.",
    "Learnt about human social interactions",
    "This course educated me about a lot of the research that has been done on problems that prevail in our world today: topics such as racial profiling, sexual abuse, and stereotypes to name a few.",
    "You learn basic\/general knowledge in social psychology.",
    "Learned important information about behavior that is applicable to everyday situations.",
    "I learned new things about self control, groups, perception, etc. topics in social psychology.",
    "Learnt a lot about social psychology and the effect of situation on behavior.",
    "In social psychology, I learned about the subtleties of interpersonal relationships. I really enjoyed developing my knowledge of different theories of social cognition.",
    "You learn about social psychology, why people behave the way they do in social situations, how to think about your own relationships.",
    "By taking this course, I learned a lot of intriguing information about different psychological studies and what they reveal about the human condition. I learned about certain patterns and tendencies that often guide our actions; I also learned about the circumstances that can help create a variety of situations, including dark scenarios involving conformity, violence, etc. Ultimately, I feel much more educated about the reasoning behind why we do things the way we do.",
    "This class gave me a broad introduction to the exciting field of social psychology. The insights I have learned about the influences that our situation have our own behavior has given me a different lens through which I see the world. I really enjoyed what I learned in this class and being able to apply it to my life.",
    "I learned so much about implicit, behind-the-scenes activity in the human mind. I expanded my perspective on the society we're in because I  now understand that our behavior is much more complex than the cut-and-dry answers that we try to give credit for. I understand more now where I want to take my psychology degree.",
    "I learned a lot about social psychology! It was a good, standard, basic lecture course.",
    "I learned quite a bit about how people react in different situations and the reasons for those reactions",
    "I learnt a lot about the most common topics in Social Psychology, which provided me with a good foundation in delving into it deeper in the future.",
    "A broad understanding of social psychology and its diverse applications.",
    "I learned the basics of social psychology - the influence of groups and situations on thoughts and behavior, and about attention, attitudes, aggression, altruism, motivation, etc. in a social context.",
    "Good general knowledge of famous experiments in the field of social psychology.",
    "I learned more about what motivates and scares humans, and why we tend to act the way that we do."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A strength is the amazing, humble professor. A weakness was the level of engagement of the TF's. They didn't seem to care about the students and they graded very differently.",
    "This course is good the way it is",
    "a little repetitive",
    "This class is a standard lecture. There are slides and notes. I personally do not have a problem with this style of lecture, but I can see some students having a hard time engaging.",
    "not any grades other than test",
    "Strengths: very interesting lecture and professor delivered information in a very natural and smooth way, lectures were prompt and never used more time than needed\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: try to resist repeating info at the end of the class, include an essay or monthly short opinion paragraph to balance out the exam grades in a fair way",
    "Grade purely based on how well we can retain very specific points of information, not conducive to learning enjoyably",
    "It covered a lot of material that was very interesting, but by the end of the course information felt repetitive.",
    "Strengths: Lectures are pretty interesting (although get a little repetitive by the end of the semester)\r\n-The concepts are immediately noticeable in everyday life which makes them especially interesting\r\n-Only 3 tests which are easy as long as you've read the textbook and gone to lecture\r\n-Lecture never takes the full class period - it's usually only 50 minutes\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures get repetitive by the end of the course",
    "The lecture was not as interesting or engaging as it could be, given the really interesting material",
    "The information is presented thoroughly by the professor and he provides awesome slides to supplement the lecture material. The class could be more engaging though.",
    "well organized but one bad exam affects your entire grade and you aren't sure if it is curved or not until the end",
    "I loved this course. My only criticism would be that sometimes it felt a little redundant but I think that's just because social psychology is such an interconnected discipline.",
    "This is a very cut and dry course. Difficult to do extremely well, but easy to do decently.",
    "The professor and TA's don't give feedback after they graded your exam. All of the exams have free response questions and points are deducted for no reason. This is a course will little teacher engagement, at the very least, a few comments on the exam would be helpful.",
    "I hope there are more interactions between the professor and the students.",
    "The lectures are incredibly informative, though sometimes they move a bit too quickly (the slides are flipped through at a rapid speed). The multiple choice on the exams was often very tricky.",
    "This course has interesting material that could apply well to students' lives, but students were not given any chance to apply or reflect on what we were learning as the only way evaluation was test. If there were written responses or even journal entries, it would be improved.",
    "A lot of lecture time but no questions",
    "Strengths: Social psychology was well organized and clearly taught, with a central topic for every class or two. John Bargh was very respectful of his students' time and his careful organization of class material contributed to that. Professor Bargh clearly had identified the rhythm\/style of teaching that worked best for the course contents.\r\nWeaknesses: Making the class more interactive, assigning a group project (or even just a research paper!) might help liven the class up and encourage more communication between students.",
    "I think it's always a bad sign if all you have to do is read the textbook to coast through the class, but Bargh is a dynamic lecturer, even if disorganized.",
    "Strengths=manageable workload, intriguing powerpoint and lectures\r\nWeaknesses= some test questions seemed overly specific, and it was hard to bring up low grades; I didn't always understand why I had gotten points off for a short answer question",
    "It's really straightforward. Lecture. Readings. Exams. I really enjoyed this part. Although I would hate to have section for such a class, it would have been nice to be able to discuss the lecture material and readings in section.",
    "The course is packed with information, and I appreciate that, but it's so hard to effectively learn so much information at once. I  think he could separate the tests into more than 3, maybe 4 or 5, so It will be easier to take in information.",
    "Can be slightly bland and repetitive, but the material is literally so interesting",
    "More engaging lectures.",
    "A TON of info packed into a short time period...learned a lot! Perhaps could work to make the class feel more engaging, but I pretty standard for a large lecture.",
    "Add a paper at the end so it is just three tests",
    "The course had a clear assessment method, and instructions were really clear in assignments. It would be great if there will be more time to engage in discussions with the TAs and Professor Bargh, such as through tutorials, to discuss about the topics.",
    "The course would be much more engaging and useful if there were more hands-on applications of the studies and concepts we are learning instead of a mere memorization of many definitions.",
    "This course was well structured to provide a solid introduction to social psychology. Professor Bargh is obviously very experienced with teaching this course, and does a good job presenting lecture material. I also really appreciate the testing format with 3 midterms - it evenly spreads out studying and is an effective but relatively stress-free way of absorbing the material.\r\nI think that the format of the lecture slides leaves a LOT to be improved - the poor font and background color choices, the often very small and nearly illegible font and the odd bullet\/list formatting makes it very hard to take notes or even follow what is otherwise an excellent lecture.",
    "Could be improved if the slides didn't repeat the same experiments so many times.",
    "I really liked this course. I think that the material was presented well and that the content was very interesting."

   "comments": [
    "It's a dry class, but if psychology is something that really interests you then by all means take it",
    "Yes, especially if the TF's would change.",
    "The format of the class is really straightforward (three in-class exams) and there is no homework other than assigned textbook reading. I would recommend this course if you are interested in social psychology (and not just to fulfill a distributional requirement or major requirement), but it's one of the those courses where you get as much as you put in.",
    "Yes , easy and interesting psychology credit",
    "Yep, good gut",
    "Interesting psychology class. learned about mannerism and social situations that influence our behavior, interesting for the real world",
    "Yes, I think this is a great class to take for anyone, not just psychology majors.",
    "yes very interesting",
    "Yes, if you go to class and do the readings, you'll be fine.",
    "It's very interesting material. Lectures are ok but definitely read the textbook",
    "Yes because Professor Bargh is amazing and everyone should get to know him. Also though, you'll need to take it for psych or pre-med I'm sure so it's good either way.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's only 3 non-cumulative tests (multiple choice and short answer) which are pretty easy as long as you've gone to lecture and read the textbook chapters (about half the questions on the test come from the textbook so you have to read it). It's a great CR\/D (although you might end up wanting to convert) and also a great 5th class. The concepts are super relevant to everyday life which makes it fun and interesting to learn about.",
    "This class was an easy fifth class, but not the most interesting. (Being in Davies didn't help...)",
    "Yes, I really enjoyed the course. If you have any interest in psychology and behavior then this is a good introduction course. The material isn't always the most mind-blowing, but it is a good foundation for upper-level courses.",
    "yes",
    "Absolutely! This course teaches you about how humans interact with one another so there really wasn't any part of it that wasn't immediately relevant to my own life.",
    "Only if required.",
    "A great course for psyc and non-psyc majors to get to know social psychology, which is a rather new academic field.",
    "Wonderful class in which you can learn relevant information regarding the behavior of others.",
    "Yes. Loved this class!",
    "I would not recommend this course because there was very little interaction within the course for improvement - this is largely because the only method for evaluation was exams. In this way, since students could contribute very little, student learning wasn't put at the forefront and was not very engaging. Courses like Yarrow Dunham's Intro to Psychology, which had exams as well as reading responses, was more engaging despite being a lecture class.",
    "Yes, if they're good at taking exams because we only had tests.",
    "Yes! The class was an engaging and comprehensive introduction to topics in social psychology. Both psychology students and non-majors would enjoy the course.",
    "not a gut, don't play yourself.  three non cumulative midterms but they all require you to actually go to class and do the readings.  Honestly wouldn't take this unless your a psych major or just really interested in the material",
    "I would recommend if you're looking for an introductory psychology class that won't require you to have any background knowledge! I think I learned some interesting things. Plus there's no time-consuming busy work, just 3 in-class exams that you should do well on if you just read the textbook closely enough. It's a good fifth class.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes! I learned many interesting facts that I will remember. The textbook is also very accessible, and the workload is low-stress.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to another student. If you love psychology\/sociology and\/or human behavior, this would be a great class for you. The topic itself is reason enough to take the class. It's really straightforward and you'll gain important insights into the world around you.",
    "Yes; It is so necessary to have a deeper understanding of human interaction, especially when immersed in a specific situational context. We would approach our evaluations of situations much more carefully.",
    "Yes! Bargh is so kind aven if the lectures themselves can be slightly monotone",
    "Yes, if and only if they have a strong interest in the material. Otherwise, students will have little motivation to sit through disengaging,  uninformative, and incoherent lectures.",
    "If you're interested in the subject, yes! You'll learn a lot!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student! Social psych was so interesting and enjoyable. The structure of 3 non-cumulative exams is also really nice. It was a great class overall and a really positive experience!",
    "Yes just gotta prepare a ton for the three tests",
    "Yes, especially if you want to gain a basic, but clear understanding of the most influential topics in Social Psychology.",
    "Yes - if you're interested in social psychology or are a Psych major, this is a really good foundation course taught by a good professor.",
    "This is an interesting course if you are looking for a chance to learn more about psychology without a huge commitment.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who wants to learn more about why humans act the way that we do."
