   "comments": [
    "All sorts of physics, how to use logger pro, and how to write a lab report.",
    "I learned how to analyze dataset in LoggerPro and to think critically about experimental flaws in physics.",
    "Was actually helpful in fleshing out the real world applications of physics after taking the course over the school year.",
    "applying physics concepts to demonstrations",
    "At a deeper level, I learned how we can apply the basic principles of theoretical physics to real world problems. I was able to connect these experiments to things I experience on a daily basis.",
    "I learned how physical quantities are generally measured and how mechanical physics experiments are designed\/executed. I learned about measurements of uncertainty, and how we can analyze data within parameters of error.",
    "Working with introductory physics material, mechanics, forces etc. For someone who prefers more hands-on work it was unfortunate that we didn't get to touch any equipment. But the PLA assignments made room for individual experimental planning and the practical part, which I thought was the really great addition.",
    "I gained an understanding of making faithful physical measurements, writing summaries of procedures and results, and specific knowledge about topics like rotation, fitting data to models, and gyroscopes.",
    "Deeper understanding of physics",
    "I learned about techniques for measuring physical phenomena.",
    "I learned how to write a more concise lab summaries, as well as applying the concepts to real life scenarios.",
    "I learned about mechanics and how such concepts could be explored in a laboratory setting. I also learned a lot about how to use lab software, such as LoggerPro, in experimentation.",
    "I gained insight into how the kinematic and dynamic principles govern motion in the real world. I also learned how to systematically deal with uncertainty, and how statistical laws effect measurement and data. This was my biggest take away from the course. I also learned what is important to include in a lab notebook."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: TF's and professors are super passionate\/willing to help. Weaknesses: Sometimes the workload is a little intense if you're taking it in conjunction with 180 during the summer. 180\/165 will definitely have to be your number one priority (ie I would probably not do an internship while taking both).",
    "Some of the What's The Flaw videos seemed to be pointedly vague as to push students to work on DIY experiments.",
    "It was actually very well done as it was fitted to be online for the first time.",
    "this course was taught as well as possible over zoom. it was hard sometimes to troubleshoot with software and explaining concepts sometimes, but sharing screens helped. the ta and professors were very helpful",
    "Strengths: For an online course, the format of the actual labs was actually better than the in person lab. I was able to work at my own pace which was personally a lot more enlightening than working with a partner who was \"faster\" and\/or wanted to rush through it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The \"post lab activities\" were a good idea, but it ended up being more of a stressor than something fun.",
    "strengths: easy to follow assignments, mostly interesting topics, very helpful TAs\r\nweaknesses: low cohesion\/interaction in our section, I would've enjoyed talking more freely (maybe a result of the online format) \r\ngood course overall, though!",
    "Strengths:\r\nProfessors did a good job of being available during labs\r\nLabs were not very difficult, although they were time consuming\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nPost-lab activities were far too time consuming and basically had us doing two labs in one\r\nOnline format is not for everyone",
    "The lab handouts could have been posted a bit more in advance, because sometimes it was a bit inconvenient to find time before the session when there were other things going on. There isn't as much interaction among students, and the way the zoom lab session goes it's harder to ask questions when it seems like you are more behind than others. I personally think smaller breakout rooms would be good to try out more, but I know this working style varies among students.",
    "It was difficult to do an online physics class, so I think they did a good job of converting it to an online formate and I can't think of anything they could have done to make it better, though some labs seemed unnecessarily long, and it was a bummer to not be able to actually play with the physics toys in person.",
    "Understanding that it is an online course, I dont have suggestions for changes, since I had a much better experience than in certain infamous Yale lab courses. Expectations were very fair, and I never felt like I lost points unfairly. Experimental concepts and difficulty seem to build off of each other, and the instructors were attentive to the timelines of other courses when scheduling post-lab assignments.",
    "Great transition to online",
    "I didn't enjoy the PLA's that we had to do every week. I would have much rather had a final exam than have the extra labs.",
    "I thought the course was very well adapted for the online format.",
    "The obvious weakness was the lack of in person interaction with the equipment.",
    "This course is very engaging if you choose to make it. The at-home DIY assignments are very fun and give you a great opportunity to think about how easily physics experimentation can be done. Dr. Cahn, Professor Barrett, and the entire teaching team are also incredible. I really appreciated how much they devoted to this class and how excited they were to teach it. There were some issues due to the conversion of the class from the in-person to the online format. For example, sometimes the lab manual could be slightly confusing as it explained both the in-person and online procedures in a way that was not quite explicit.",
    "The strength of this course was the post lab activities. I enjoyed creating my own experiments with materials I found around the house. I was relatively lucky to have a lot of equipment at home that related to our labs. I think this course could be improved by providing off-campus students with materials."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely. It's not super insanely hard, and you learn plenty of cool stuff (like how Bananas are radioactive!). I might wait till its offered in person again though. As good of a job as the professors and TF's do, you do miss a lot of practice using the equipment that we use to take the data. If that's super important to you then probably hold off. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend.",
    "I was very concerned with how an online lab would turn out, especially Physics Lab. However, I feel that that teaching staff worked really hard to explain materials and adapt on the fly to the needs and challenges that arose. I especially appreciated their positive energy and encouragement. It is clear that they truly care about students learning the materials.",
    "Yes! Good class especially to take over the summer.",
    "yes - it wasn't that bad, but likely only would be taken because it is a requirement for something",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a student who is interested in and\/or needs to take physics. For an online course, this was done very well-- I'm impressed.",
    "Yes, though I was skeptical about enrolling in the course (I had heard negative reviews or that it was boring), I actually enjoyed completing this premed requirement. The post lab assignments had us doing experiments at home, which was fun to design and to work through the problems of experimental design. I enjoyed getting to know my TA, and felt that I exited the course with a very solid foundation of physics analysis.",
    "Only if you must, an online summer lab course is not the way to go.",
    "Yes I thought it was interesting. I would recommend students who may not have considered quantitative stuff to be their field to still try it out. But as mentioned earlier it would have been nice to have a little bit more time with the handouts in case someone wanted to brush up on the concepts more.",
    "I would recommend they take it in person, but it wasn't horrible.",
    "I would, as the experiments performed are interesting, the instructors and TAs are very supportive, and the assessment is fair.",
    "Yes, great course.",
    "Yes, I really enjoyed it",
    "Yes, it was a very low-stress course.",
    "If you have reservations about taking this class online, do not. Though it was not quite the same as actually getting to put the experiment together with your hands, Dr. Cahn's videos help you to really understand what is going on. I really enjoyed getting to take this class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. Although I cannot speak to its advantages or disadvantages compared to an in person experience, I felt I still gained comparable the skills and knowledge to what I would have with in person instruction."
