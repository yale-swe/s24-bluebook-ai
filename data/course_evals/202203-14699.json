                "critical thinking, writing skills, first-hand knowledge of philosophers, time management, communication, self confidence, meeting deadlines, listening and knowing what questions to ask; I leave this course with great in-depth knowledge of the material covered, making tangible connections between texts and spheres.",
                "I gained knowledge about numerous philosophers from Ancient Greece and Rome, as well as writing skills for philosophy papers, discussion skills, and insight into how to think about and analyze difficult texts.",
                "Having never taken a philosophy course before, this class taught me how to, above all else, engage with ideas. The questions that define philosophy are among the most important we can answer. What does it mean to live the good life? Where do we come from? How are we to understand the complex (and sometimes inexplicable) world around us? How can we be happy? Etc etc. It was by diving into complicated texts that I began to understand the enormity of these questions, and begin to formulate my own opinions on them.\r\n\r\nAs for skills, I think time management and paper writing are at the top. Learning how to grind out a cogent, original, and persuasive piece of writing in a short period of time is not something I had previously done. The structure of DS allowed me to hone this skill, and I am very much grateful to have had that opportunity.",
                "Proper analysis of philosophical works. Excellent understanding of early Western political thought, Plato -> Augustine.",
                "Due to the fast-paced structure and the broad scope of the course, I dont think I necessarily gained any hard skills like writing, but rather I developed a broader understanding of philosophy and an ability to engage with and understand a great body of intellectual material in a short span of time. DS focus on breadth over depth can be frustrating at first, but at the end of the term, this approach did allow me to gain a wider perspective on various schools of thought in philosophy.",
                "I developed a broad understanding of ancient philosophy, as well as analytical and essay writing skills.",
                "I learned how to read more carefully, but more importantly, I learned how to deeply interact with the text as a reader. Professor Schillinger taught me how to abandon what I thought I knew previously and approach the books with a tabula rasa, leading me to shed my ego that had previously interfered with proper understanding.",
                "This course significantly increased my confidence in dissecting very small, rich portions of text, particularly those that discuss very complex universal concepts and philosophies. While we could spend multiple class periods on just a few lines, this course managed to bridge both depth and breadth and allow us to explore both a variety of philosophies and the extent of each one individually."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: discussion moderation, group spirit, good guiding questions, grading was fair and feedback was incredibly useful; weaknesses: pace was too quick and sometimes discussion felt shallow",
                "This course was amazing. I enjoyed the readings even when on my own, and coming to class to discuss with the Professor Schillinger and my classmates made it all the better. Our discussions were definitely my favorite part of the course, as we all had listened to a lecture about the material prior to coming to class and Prof. Schillinger provided even more context at the beginnings of each seminar.",
                "Strengths: DS teaches you how to write a lot of papers and write them well. It teaches you how to engage with, challenge, and grapple with difficult ideas, and it exposes you to a canonic school of thought. Few (if any) similar programs exist, and the experience you receive from DS is truly unparalleled.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Too much reading. I fell into a pattern of completing all the reading before beginning to write papers, and that hampered my paper-writing abilities. I'm not sure there is a solution, however -- DS is meant to be a broad survey, and the mountains of reading are part of the program. Perhaps it would be helpful to know that we don't need to read everything.",
                "Strength was seminar with professor Schillinger. Schillinger grounded the discussions in the text and facilitated great dialogue between the students.",
                "DS is a fast-paced course, and this not only makes it difficult but also can leave you feeling like youre moving onto another material before youre able to engage with a text or author in depth. Since all this process of reading and discussing texts is accompanied by paper assignments, it might also feel overwhelming. On the flip side, this fast-paced structure and the demanding reading load compels one to become a faster reader and writer, as well as making it possible to see patterns and draw connections between a broad body of work since one goes over so many texts and different thinkers.",
                "There was not enough time allocated to each book (especially the Arabic philosophers) for me to understand them completely. However, overall this was a really great course to understand ancient philosophy as a whole with no prior experience.",
                "There were no weaknesses with the course within control of the instructor. Professor Schillinger was an incredibly intelligent and kind instructor, and made the class interesting and worthwhile. He understands what it's like to be a student and could empathize with our experience in significant ways. One time, for example, he kindly brought us donuts at a time in the semester when he knew we were mentally exhausted. The class itself was run very well. The books we read were carefully chosen by the administration, and gave us an incredible background in philosophy.",
                "This course did an excellent job of going with the flow of student ideas while sticking close to very complex yet intriguing texts. I feel much more comfortable understanding the variety but also the depth of multiple ancient philosophies and the work of several philosophers. Still, I hope that future DS philosophy courses may be more strategic about how much reading is assigned, especially given that so little of the text is actually able to be meaningfully covered in class."

            "comments": [
                "Absolutely. While DS is not for everyone, it is an interesting change for me as a STEM student. I improved my intrapersonal skills even if I will not be pursuing humanities as a major. The professors in DS are incredible and approachable.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in philosophy to any extent. Even if the subject matter is not your typical favorite, the class is made relevant to each of our lives due to the broad questions which are asked. No one can escape wondering what it means to be happy or how we should best live our lives, and this course provides a multitude of ways to think about the answers.",
                "Definitely, but only if someone is interested in ideas. Coming into DS, I had had no previous exposure to the Western Canon, and I was not particularly keen on taking two literature courses. What excited me, however, was the structure of the course. Having completed one semester, I now feel as though it is the content that I found most rewarding. I don't mean to say that the DS content is better than anything I've ever read (and I've certainly read more interesting texts), but the ideas embedded within DS works are beautiful and multilayered and, quite frankly, fascinating. So my recommendation for someone considering DS would be this: take the course if you are interested in grappling with new ideas, and take the class if you want to improve your writing. Only if they meet these two criteria would I recommend DS.",
                "I would recommend DS to all. I would specifically recommend Schillingers seminar.",
                "Yes, I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student, especially with Schillinger. You get to read many great texts and put them into conversation. Your writing will improve greatly, and you'll meet a cohort of likeminded students that are a great network to have first year.",
                "It is not really possible to have both breadth and depth together when working with the entire Western cannon. If one is interested in gaining a broader understanding of Western philosophy, recognizing that theyll be spending limited time on each work and school of thought and be required to do a lot of reading and writing, I would recommend it. This course builds a strong foundation to make it possible to go more into depth afterwards. Also, the course has a greater emphasis on Plato and Aristotle, so even though it felt like there was much more to discuss, I have a much more extensive picture in mind regarding these thinkers, covering different fields that range from ontology to ethics.",
                "Yes; again, this was a really great course to understand ancient philosophy as a whole with no prior experience. However, the workload (reading and essay writing) is very challenging--you get as much out of this course as you put in.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student not only because of its structure as a seminar that allowed us to make friends and talk in in-depth ways about the text, but also because of the professor. He is truly inspiring as an instructor, always pushing us to look at the texts from a different perspective while encouraging us to trust our instincts. I feel much more capable as a Yale student after taking his class.",
                "I would recommend this class to those with a background or deep interest in philosophy. It is definitely challenging even for those with some previous knowledge in philosophy, but for those who enjoy philosophical conversations, the class had an excellent flow and comfortable openness to it that I think many would enjoy."
