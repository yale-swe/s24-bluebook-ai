                "I developed stronger reading skills since the high reading pace of the course pushed me to become a more efficient reader \/ learn how to annotate \/ retain the key points for discussion. The discussion-based seminars helped me improve in formulating and presenting my ideas to a group. The text we read were often connected to contemporary questions \/ issues in politics, which provided new avenues regarding how to interact with ancient texts in a contemporary context.",
                "Knowledge of both historical AND political thought in the classical world, critical thinking about our engagement in the world around us.",
                "I learned how to develop an effective exegesis and synthesize ideas from different texts.",
                "I became better at analyzing changes and continuities across different time periods as well as historical close reading.",
                "I learned how to think critically and cohesively about history through the material we covered, expanding my knowledge from just a general overview of historical facts to a more-in depth understanding about the mindsets and \"thought\" that pervaded ancient eras. Furthermore, I narrowed down on how to write an academic essay with strong evidence.",
                "How to more critically evaluate government structures and politics through a historical lens.",
                "I vastly improved my ability to analyze and understand the meaning behind many of the seminal works of historical and political thought in antiquity. While I had read some of the texts before, considering them as components in a greater whole significantly helped my ability to understand how different time periods and backgrounds led to significantly biased and nuanced depictions of contemporary or historical events by ancient historians. Moreover, I learned much about how to write a well thought-out and well-researched paper on the viewpoints of such authors in their historical and political writings."

                "It could connect texts better.",
                "Our class discussions with Professor Robinson were always very interesting and I have taken a lot of life lessons from our time together. However I do feel that I would have benefited from a bit more structure in the course, most significantly regarding what concepts \/ ideas \/ key points to take away from the literature as we went along. For example, I did not understand how some of the texts were supposed to relate to the subject Historical and Political Thought until I studied for the finals, which gave rise to some stress during the semester. I would have benefited from receiving more guidance regarding how to read and consider the literature from the point of view of this new discipline in particular which I, like most of my peers, had never taken before.  Our section did not have any homework or assignments besides the 3 papers. In one way this was nice, because it made balancing my time easier regarding my other classes. However I do feel that as a result a lot of students in the class ended up not prioritizing the H&P readings, which led to a vicious circle where we were unable to have productive discussions on the class material because only a few people had actually done the reading. Many students benefit academically from the element of accountability that comes with regular assignments and I believe that this would have helped me learn and interact more actively with the course material.",
                "Strengths: breadth of study, content of course.\r\nWeaknesses: certain non sequitur or incoherent works.\r\nImprovements: I think certain works (e.g., \"The Clouds\") were unnecessary for our greater understanding of the course as a whole, and a greater emphasis could have been placed on the HISTORICAL thought aspect of the course. Though we examined historical works, the understanding of HISTORY felt slightly lost within them; conversations almost always devolved into POLITICAL debates, which I believe should be reserved for the works of political thought (e.g., \"The Republic,\" \"Politics,\" \"Treatise on Law\"). There is a lot more to explore about the way historians (e.g., Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy) view history in each of the historical works than we actually discussed in class.",
                "The discussions that arise from seminar are particularly engaging but the amount of reading can be overwhelming.",
                "This course is very interesting, but very fast -paced with lengthy readings that tend to focus on branches of law or a political understanding of law and justice (especially towards the end of the course). However, this course enables you to build a timeline through history that connects ancient understandings to the modern political sphere and better understand cycles throughout history.",
                "We went a little too fast, but we were able to get a good overview of many different texts.",
                "The strengths of this course is its comprehensive overlook of the historical and political works which shaped much of antiquity and the course's ability to allow us to better appreciate the interconnections between what may seem at first glance to be almost irreconcilably different texts. Another strength is that we cover a variety of texts from different perspectives on the ancient world, yet most if not all are still relevant to modern history and especially modern politics. However, as with the other Directed Studies courses, we go through too many texts to delve into each other with enough time to fully understand its meaning. This is even more exacerbated in Historical and Political Thought, which includes a lot of passages from valuable texts such as Polybius' Histories and Plutarch's Life of Caesar that we only have a day to discuss, leading to what may seem to be only surface-level discussion."

                "I would recommend that any freshman interested in a well-rounded view of the Humanities participate in the DS program. The program as a whole provides a space and a community for those to explore the works that are foundational to our society. The beauty of the course comes not at the beginning, but at the end, when students are able to look back from the vantage point of understanding and enlightenment they have received over the course of their two semesters of enrollment. Beyond the knowledge the course provides, it is a great way to make friends in your first year, a time when securing relationships is incredibly important. DS builds in relationships from Day one with its shared classes and lectures, both of which are taught by world-class professors with incredibly deep knowledge of their subjects. Taking DS was definitely the best academic decision I made my freshman year.",
                "Yes, to anyone who wants to improve their ability to do close reading and write strong analytical papers, this class is for you",
                "Yes, if you are interested in classics or in analyzing historical mindsets throughout time. It is a fascinating course, but by no means a necessary one- if you are looking to learn about a specific region's political nuances in depth too, this course does not enable the breadth of understanding necessary because of its quick pacing.",
                "I would because its a great intro into classical approaches to political science.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student, especially one interested in Greco-Roman history and politics. We cover so many fascinating books, and of the three Directed Studies sections, Historical and Political Thought had the most interesting and engaging texts to read in my opinion. Professor Robinson also did an excellent job connecting these texts to our turbulent political present and their still-relevant messages and reception. However, I would advise the student to prepare for the hard reading load and paper work load, although for those interested in directed studies this should not be a significant deterrent."
