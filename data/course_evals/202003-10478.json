                "Professor Lee always started our seminar with a mini-lecture, which really helped to contextualize the art movement or artists about which or whom we were speaking. The student presentations were also very helpful and informative--it seemed like everyone was really engaged in their topic, and opened up very interesting conversations for the remainder of the class period. We also had asynchronous Canvas discussions which were probably my least favorite part of the course, but I appreciated that Professor Lee incorporated them to make sure that we had some time away from Zoom, and some time to think through our thoughts relative to the discussion in order to formulate further responses to the texts and class themes.",
                "Overall, this course was really strong. It was organized, thorough, but not too overwhelming (the workload). I felt that there were high expectations for my papers, presentations, participation in virtual discussion, and discussion threads, but that it was an expectation I could feasibly meet. The readings were so well curated, and Professor Lee's presentations were succinct yet thorough. One weakness was that the discussions sometimes fell flat, but I credit this to the awkwardness of the Zoom format--it was neither Professor Lee's fault nor the students'.",
                "Provides a really great overview\/foundation in the art and history of the 60s, how to analyze art, and how to connect art to broader social movements. Loved how we also spent time outside of the US."

                "Professor Lee had us do a slightly abbreviated virtual class, followed by asynchronous Canvas posts to be written one to two days after our virtual discussion.  I didn't love the Canvas posts, but I appreciated the ways in which they gave us some time to think through the class and formulate our thoughts, as well as Professor Lee making sure we weren't spending too much time on Zoom.",
                "I think the course was as well-adapted to the virtual format as an art history course can be. Inevitably, it is unfortunate that we couldn't see the works in person at these museums, but Professor Lee's passion and strength as a lecturer brought them to life.",

                "Absolutely yes! I would recommend this to both art history majors and non-art history majors who have an interest in 1960s visual culture. Professor Lee is absolutely brilliant, and it was a joy and a privilege to learn from her.",
