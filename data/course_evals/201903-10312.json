    "Don't know if it's a strength or a weakness, but there's absolutely no hand-holding in this course: you're expected to practice everything on your own and sometimes be able to figure out patterns and new vocab on your own as well. While resourcefulness is a useful skill to know, sometimes it was a bit much, like when we're quizzed on something that we've only seen on a powerpoint slide from the week before. But if enough students complained about something he was usually willing to accommodate us so that was nice.",
    "Strength: lots of emphasis on speaking\r\n\r\nWeakness: assignments and due dates were quite disorganized. Made it easy to lose track of assignments and I was often unsure or unaware of which assignments I needed to do and when."
