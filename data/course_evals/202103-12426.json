Before the midterm, we covered preferences, utilities, Marshallian and Hicksian demand, duality, nonlinear programming, and choice under uncertainty for consumers. After, we did firms and production, general equilibrium, partial equilibrium, and then mechanism design.",

                "Strengths: Topics were really interesting and rigorously presented and proven. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the lectures were a bit fast and confusing",
                "Strengths: very rigorous. The professor was very kind and helpful during office hours. He had not taught the class before, so he didn't have any practice exams, but for the midterm and final, he gave us a ton of questions and solutions. Also, during class, if not interrupted, he would mix rigorous proof with economic intuition pretty well. Weaknesses: the syllabus is way too ambitious. Absolutely no one had any idea what was going on when we did mechanism design. I think it would be better for us to go more carefully through general and partial equilibrium and save mechanism design for a game theory class. In that regard, although I enjoyed the mathematical rigor, I kind of wished there was more economics to this class. At times, it just felt like we were solving some messy math problem. Also, more class organization would be better. For example, making sure psets were released at consistent times would make the class run much mroe smoothly. Also, I think this class should really have weekly psets. I don't think I got enough practice. Finally, this might be an economics thing, but the notation defies logic (example: the cost function labeled c(x) included a constant c).",
                "This course is terribly designed. The only listed prerequisite is Math 120. However, knowledge of real analysis (boundedness of sets) and linear algebra (hessian matrices, negative semi-definiteness) is frequently an important part of both the conceptual knowledge and the problem sets. The course lacks clear goals and fails to explain the importance of any concepts in microeconomic theory. Furthermore, both the professor and the teaching fellow lacked a strong understanding of the material and were unable to answer simple student questions. The pacing of this course is also way to quick. The vast majority of students felt like they were being left behind and didn't appreciate any of the concepts learned. Lectures in class were an exercise in trying to pick through hand-waving for any sensible statement.",
                "Material in class was not explained super clearly, sometimes it went too fast, other times it went to slow; overall just hard to follow",
                "The course at times just felt like doing math for maths sake. Often the economic motivations were not explored in the detail that I would have enjoyed. I think that the treatment of topics was satisfactory, but I wish that problem sets and lectures were slightly more focused on the \"why do we care\" questions.",
                "The lectures at times were pretty good but could also be hard to follow at times. The textbook was also hard to digest.",
                "Material was very difficult, especially towards the end, and not always explained very well. Though the topics were interesting, they were not made particularly accessible.",
                "This course was very interesting and valuable but I felt that it was more difficult than it needed to be, and we were assumed to have a level of previous knowledge that didn't align with the listed prerequisites. Obviously micro theory is going to be very theoretical, but I think this course could be stronger if some more motivation was given for why we were proving or learning the things we were."

For me, that meant reading from three textbooks to understand what was going on in lecture (Jehle and Reny, MWG, and Varian). Further, the listed prereqs are a bit misleading: some understanding of real analysis is quite important for this class.",
