                "Strengths: Didac is very knowledgeable, and does his best to bring the voices of every student into weekly discussions. I also didn't think the amount of readings was as overwhelming as reviews on past iterations of the course seem to indicate.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There's probably a better way to handle the Eurocentrism of the state formation literature than making each of Latin America, Africa, and Asia one-week topics after nine weeks of Europe-only theory building.",
                "Strengths: Engaging course with interesting readings and a fantastic professor.  The course gave me great insight the foundations of state formation and how to critically analyze research papers (understanding the faults and limitations of research as well as how to better understand state formaiton moving forward).",
                "Strengths: Awesome material and professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Online format definitely hurt the course; almost spent too much time critiquing the readings and not enough discussing their implications"

                "It's hard to say. The experience I had (as did many other peers I spoke to) largely involved some disappointment with the state formation literature - you read some really bad papers as part of the course, and after a certain point seeing another questionable empirical/identification strategy just gets depressing.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I did enjoy the course overall, and wouldn't recommend against taking it if you have a genuine interest in the subject.",
