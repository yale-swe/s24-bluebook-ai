                "This course places a lot of emphasis on the drafting process in writing; consequently, you have a long time to complete each essay. This is incredibly helpful, and gives you a lot of time to utilize the new methods you're learning and to receive feedback on your drafts. There weren't any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: very engaging material and in class activities, very relevant to the topic of the course, explored a variety of styles of writing, all reading materials were very relevant",
                "Some of the classes can seem monotonous but overall I think it was very helpful! These practices ultimately work.",
                "Strengths - very strong sense of community and collaboration. I loved the discussions and methods used to improve the classes the writing in a seminar format. Great feedback and focus on personal growth as a writer.",
                "There were not any weaknesses that stood out to me. Professor Coleman herself demonstrated how organized and balanced the course was: the way she facilitated class time contributed to a perfect combination of efficient learning, group discussion, and peer review. Another strength of the course was Professor Coleman's requirement of us to participate in using external resources like peer tutors and our personal librarians. These resources not only helped my work in the class, but also gave me comfort going forward throughout the course.",
                "The professor gave great feedback and was really invested in our development as writers. The seminars were also well-planned.",
                "The small class format would have been much more intimate and energizing if we had met in person, but online class was not the same (obviously out of control of Professor Coleman)\r\nThe pace of the class was perfect: plenty of time to work on papers but still with hard deadlines. The extra time to workshop\/revise the papers in class with the help of classmates\/instructor helped me to settle in to writing college papers.",
                "Strengths: Professor Coleman focused on the development of each student as individual writers, pushing us to strive toward our respective writing goals continually. She gave great feedback. I thought the prompts for each paper made me think critically and were extremely fun to respond to.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None"

We all kept our mics muted when we weren't speaking, and when we went to speak we would unmute ourselves, which let everyone else know we were about to speak (to avoid those awkward moments of two people speaking at the same time.) Professor Coleman also utilized screen sharing regularly which allowed for a lot of engagement.",

Plus, the topic of discussion was super interesting and allows for more self driven involement.",

                "Definitely! Coming into this course, I didn't feel confident in my writing at all. However, Professor Coleman was amazing and helped me grow as a writer tremendously."
