                "I wish that there were more opportunities to practiceI really liked the little video quizzes we had in math 120, and I feel like adding those to 222 would help!",
                "The class is taught thoroughly at the beginning, but it felt like we rushed towards the finish which was especially harmful because the topics at the end were more difficult. The exams also did not mimic the problem sets or the material we learned very closely at all.",
                "strength: Abinand was a strong teacher\r\n\r\nweaknesses: did not record lectures & had a patronizing attitude",
                "Lectures move pretty fast",
                "I wish it was better organized and there were more resources to help students. For example, I'd love if my section had access to recorded lectures given that other ones did. And it would be really nice if instructors hosted review session instead of having a poor TF have to deal with all sorts of questions about a bit inconsistently defined terminology.",
                "The teaching was not effective. We didn't really cover any examples in class so that made it harder to do the homework assignments. A lot of the tutoring hours were cancelled with no notice. Professor Gopal tried to be helpful at office hours but it was difficult to get clear answers to questions.",
                "Its fine overall, but a bit dry in general. The applications portion of this course was very brief and not very in depth.",
                "Strength: Linear is important\r\n\r\nWeakness: Instructors could not have been less helpful. God bless the peer tutors.",
                "One way this course could be improved is providing optional supplementary videos and/or recording lectures. I am not the strongest math student by any means, so if I missed a lecture or even just missed a sentence while attending the lecture, this sometimes led to confusion after class. Without anywhere else to turn, I was essentially required to attend office hours for aid, which isn't the worst. However, a varied source of explanations and methods of teaching would have been greatly beneficial to me, especially considering that I often used other sources when studying and sometimes found them more useful than lectures/office hours. I am not saying that it is impossible to find resources on our own, but it would be great to have some listed in the syllabus or course, so we know which sources the professors themselves believe are good resources.",
                "The release of assignments wasn't always timely and files on canvas were unorganized for some time.",
                "I think the few times we looked at applications of the course material were very helpful in cementing my understanding of the class. I also appreciated the occasional recap of the class, its goals, and the logic we applied as we went through the semester so that I could stay on track. I wish my section was recorded, as it would have been helpful to hear responses to questions in class (that came up again while I reviewed) reiterated.",
                "strengths: problem sets did not ask more than what was reasonable from students, grading structure was good\r\n\r\nweaknesses: lecture was not very engaging, not much visual description or as the course title implies \"application\"",
                "It basically covers every fundamental aspect of Linear Algebra and by taking this course I gained a comprehensive understanding of this subject. However, the intensity of the course is a little bit high, especially near the end of the term, when the materials became increasingly harder. If the course could be designed in a way that makes the progression of difficulty more gradual, that would be great.",
                "The course was generally disorganized: it wasn't clear when psets were out, practice problem solutions were occasionally not thorough enough for someone to follow along and catch their mistakes, and half of the peer tutors hours were cancelled weekly. A lot of these issues could be improved by adding more work to solutions and keeping up to date with organization."
