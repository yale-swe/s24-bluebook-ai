                "This course taught me a lot about the history of mental health in New Haven specifically, but also how these patterns are reflected across the country. Some of the best skills I picked up were learning how to interact with and analyze primary sources through archival work - super, super useful.",
                "I learnt an incredible amount about deinstitutionalization and the community mental health movement. I also think this is a great course to learn how to work with archival materials and analyze them.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of Yale-New Haven relations, community mental health, and the history of psychiatry.",
                "This course is truly incredible. Being able to think deeply about and ground ourselves in local histories and politics of mental health, specifically \"community mental health\" as it has developed, has been such a powerful opportunity. In thinking about these broad topics, we have been able to critically examine the way race and class have become so entangled in questions of mental health and illness. The course allows students to reckon with broader historical phenomenon and the ways they impact the local, particularly deinstitutionalization and eugenics. The course also invites students to think about broader issues of care, survival, self-determination, and abolition that are incredibly relevant to this work. As much as the course explores the past, it is also deeply rooted in the present and future, inviting us to consider alternative ways to show up for one another, meet people's needs, and imagine our relationships to our communities. \r\n\r\nOn a more practical level, you will also develop skills in archival research and analysis, as well as engaging with historical methodology!"

            "comments": [
                "Because the content of the course is very new, as a class we work through the materials we find together, and the instructors of the course can give us more context about how modern psychiatry practices play into the histories we are uncovering. It's actually so cool.",
                "For this course being offered for the first time, it was fantastic! Being able to interact with the archive was definitely the best part, and it was so useful to take this prior to embarking on a thesis in HSHM. I think in terms of the readings, a little restructuring could be useful. We spent a lot of time looking at deinstitutionalization, which though important, could have maybe been shortened.",
                "more clear rubrics to understand how assignments will be graded",
                "This course was amazing. It had a reasonable workload with flexible deadlines, and there was prompt grading and feedback given. Professor Ramos was always willing to take feedback or adjust the course as we went along.",
                "Strengths: Sharing community and being in conversation with all the incredible students in the course, in addition to the teaching team (including Professor Ramos, Nientara and Lucille) was one of the most memorable parts of this course. The course is very intentionally constructed, following a sort of intellectual\/and historical logic that allows you to trace the develop of carceral systems \/ modes of social control from the slave trade through the present realities of mass incarceration. In the process, you are able to think critically about the history and role of psychiatry in the west, the history and politics of \"community mental health,\" possibilities and challenges of liberatory psychiatry, and so much more. Truly an incredible course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Looking back, I think it would have been helpful to have more time and space at the end of the course to debrief on our conversations with speakers in the \"community visit\" as well as have time devoted to overall reflections on the course and our takeaways from it. I think it would also have been helpful to have at least one class specifically devoted to substance use in New Haven, tracing it from the mid-20th century to now. So much of what we discussed is impacted by substance use, yet it felt somewhat tangential in our readings and especially toward the end of the course, it felt important to incorporate these discussions to frame the current landscape of mental health in the city. Perhaps we could replace one of the earlier classes contextualizing contextualizing deinstutionalization with a course specifically on this."

Also, if you are interested in mental health and its evolution in comparison with colonial systems, this course is perfect.",
                "Yes! Anyone who is interested in critical psychiatry should take this class! Or, if you are looking to get experience in working with an archive, this is the course to take. You really get to engage deeply with niche material that gives you a good insight into what doing a thesis in history\/HSHM would look like.",

                "yes, good class environment",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Each seminar was so intellectually fulfilling, and I walked out of each seminar thinking so much more deeply about core ideas of our class. The seminar truly felt like a puzzle that we were collaboratively trying to solve, piecing together pieces of history, archival research, and discussions to problematize understandings of \"community mental health\" and the narratives we have been considering all semester. I am leaving the class with even more questions than I had before, but also so much more nuance, vocabulary, and framing for understanding them."
