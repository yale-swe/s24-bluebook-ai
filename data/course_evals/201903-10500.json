    "Review of concepts from thermodynamics and transport. Learned about various separation techniques: distillation, extraction, adsorption, membrane separation. Learned why they work and how to design them.",

    "survey of chemical engineering separation and purification processes; liquid liquid extraction, adsorption, distillation, etc.",
    "Learned about various chemical separation processes including distillation, adsorption, liquid-liquid extraction",
    "This course was a compilation of many topics that I had previously seen in a number of my other classes but it helped solidify concepts while introducing me to a few new extensions of ideas."

   "comments": [
    "Great class! Perhaps the psets could have been split up and spread out over several weeks.",
    "This course is great!  The expectations are reasonable. The workload is not overwhelming. The exams do not have surprises, and the professor is great at what he does.",
    "This class is awesome! The lectures were clear without going too far in detail and I loved the field trip.",
    "Professor Van Tassel was really good, his lectures were very clear and organized and he posts them on canvas which is helpful. He is very calm which makes it a chill class. Hw was hard and sometimes not really on what we had been focusing on in class. He did give 2 weeks to complete hw, which was nice. \r\nThe solutions to hw problems (or practice exams) was not really clear. if you only read the solutions you could not understand anything.",
    "homework assignments were often excel\/graphing intensive and did not align very well with the class material. This is one of the less painful ChemE classes, and Professor Van Tassel is very nice.",
    "Overall a solid class. There were some times where the lectures did not always match up with the book which could be confusing. However, Professor Van Tassel was always willing to explain anything.",
    "Strengths: manageable workload, slow and methodical teaching from professor, homework due every 2 weeks, and not very difficult math",
    "The exams were very fair and were representative of what we covered in class and the class pace was very reasonable and content was well organized. My only real complaint was the organization of the problem sets and the fact that they were not very representative of what we covered in class nor what would be on the test. Professor VanTassel writes great questions but the book really does not so this problem would be immediately solved if Professor VanTassel would write his own problem sets that are more relevant to the course material.",
    "Doctor Van Tassel is an incredible man.",
    "Good pace, except it sped up a lot at the end. \r\nProfessor Van Tassel is good at explaining. \r\nThe homework was not always very reflective of what we focused on in class."

   "comments": [
    "If Van Tassel is teaching then yes! If not, then you still need to take it anyways for ChemE. But with Van Tassel, definitely one of the better ChemE classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "Yes, it is required for ChemE majors.",
    "Yeah, I would. Especially if taught by Van Tassel. It really depends on the professor more than on the class per se. If you are chem E major, it is mandatory to take it. If you are shopping it as another major, pay attention to who is teaching it.",
    "Definitely one of the better courses in the department. You apply a lot of the information you have learned previously which is cool.",
    "Would recommend. Workload is medium and homeworks\/exams aren't too bad. Lots of excel\/Matlab work on the homeworks but it is definitely manageable. Professor Van Tassel is very helpful and approachable and does his best to make sure everyone understands the material well. Not a bad course in the ChemE curriculum, especially compared to Process Control \/ Transport.",
    "It's required but unlike many of our other required ChemE classes, this is not one that I would actively warn people to mentally prepare for. The class is reasonable and the Professor is one of the kinder we have had."
