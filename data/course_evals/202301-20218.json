            "comments": [
                "Strengths:\r\n- Prof. Drixler is absolutely fantastic. Lectures are consistently engaging with slides that highlight the art, stories, maps, and culture of Tokugawa Japan. He'll often be so engrossed in the material and it is infectious. I also loved the stories he would tell in class of Tokugawa Japan, which would symbolize broader historical themes. I can still recall the story of the German doctor Philipp Franz von Siebold visiting Japan and having a child there before being kicked out and eventually making his way later in his life, seeing his adult daughter who'd followed in his footsteps as a physician. \r\n- Notes for each lecture were a great touch. \r\n- The sheer breadth of material is incredibly impressive. You come in knowing nothing and leave with a broad view of what Tokugawa society was like, all the way down to their values, their traditions, their stories, their art, and much more.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The pset took longer than was estimated. It was supposed to take around 3 hours when realistically me and other students in the class took over double that. However, there was also only one pset, so it was a minor detriment on the course.\r\n- Readings were usually only marginally relevant to lecture and were mainly for section. It felt like we could've done without them, and on the exams, there wasn't much incentive to read them since most of the content tested was from lectures. However, readings were usually less than 50 pages per week, so not a big concern.\r\n- It was stated in the syllabus that lectures would often end early but this only happened a few times throughout the whole semester. I'm totally fine with lectures being 75 minutes, but I think it should be communicated that they'll more often than not last the whole time.",
                "Strengths: Drixler's lecture style is engaging, and his handouts are great for note taking\/review; reading load is manageable\r\nWeaknesses: the final was a bit excessive in terms of amount of writing, and the lack of choices on the ID list for the midterm\/final seems unnecessarily restrictive; some of the material is more interesting than other parts",
                "Very strong course. Professor Drixler knows an incredible amount about the subject and his passion for the history comes through. The course also approaches the history of Tokugawa Japan from more angles than most introductory history courses.",
                "The content was extremely engaging and Prof. Drixler was excellent with the lectures and the slides. The readings were sometimes difficult but the section leaders made it easier.",
                "I found this course super interesting and the professor Drixler was super passionate. I was surprised by how much I learned by the end.",
                "The lecture guides were a great way to keep straight what were sometimes seemingly disorganized lectures. They were also awesome study tools.",
                "The strengths of the course are the professor and his lectures. I was never bored during the 75 minute lectures, as Professor Drixler is very eloquent and engaging, The readings for the course are also relevant and interesting. A weakness of the course is that some of the assignments seemed to be irrelevant to truly learning the material. In my opinion, a detailed map quiz is a pointless exercise in rote memorization one would expect in a typical American high school. The essay prompts were excessively unique (i.e. writing captions for period artwork). I think that traditional papers and exams have stood the test of time because they best facilitate and reflect learning at a high level. Quirky essays and rote memorization seem more appropriate for a ninth grader than for a Yale University student.",
                "I felt like the midterm and final ID questions were a little unreasonably difficult.",
                "The lectures were excellent but there weren't many assignments to contribute to the grade.",
                "Professor Drixler is so passionate and kind. Very engaging lecturer even when the content itself initially feels less interesting. Readings arent too heavy which allows you to actually engage with them.",
                "I thought the pset was a little hard to find the information for.",
                "Very well organized course and Professor Drixler is an incredible lecturer. The content of the course alone is super fascinating.",
                "The problem set was unreasonably hard.",
                "Professor Drixler's attitude towards his lectures is perfect. He speaks with engaging delivery, a variety of visual content, and helpful\/unintrusive tangents that almost never distract or drag. He includes breaks in lectures, which is thoughtful. His promise to keep lectures closer to 50 than 75 minutes was good in spirit, but didn't usually come true in practice--which is fine, because the lectures almost never felt like 75 minutes anyway. Handouts were a useful supplement for my own notes, particularly for anticipating ID terms on exams.\r\n\r\nThe problem set was fun and unique; a good blend between (1) the know-when-you've-answered-the-question feeling you get in STEM and (2) the archival exploration you get for history research papers. The problem set could use clearer guidelines on acceptable sources--I spent a lot of time trying to find academic sources (e.g., journal articles and books) for facts that were visible on the first page of Google and I'm not sure whether that level of research was necessary.\r\n\r\nThe readings were useful, interesting, and a good length; manageable.",
                "No weaknesses, content was amazing",
                "There are only strengths to this course! No weaknesses at all! The syllabus was so well-structured, especially with all of the printed handouts that Professor Drixler made for us. I loved all of the visuals that Professor Drixler used in his slides - they made lectures very engaging. The readings were really interesting as well. I also thought the problem set assignment was a huge strength because it was unlike anything I had done in other history courses, but it led me to conduct really interesting research and learn a lot more about Tokugawa Japan.",
                "Prof. Drixler definitely knows his stuff when it comes to Edo period and his researches are the most exciting parts of the course. The introductory section, though, felt too long and dragged out until almost midterm.",
                "One point of improvement could be the structure and organization of the course's canvas page, as some links on the page were not properly updated or fixed until some time had passed in the course. Besides that, the overall structure and pacing of the lectures were pretty straightforward. The discussion sections also served as a great space to digest the various readings, as well as connecting it to information from lecture."

                "Absolutely, this is my favorite class I've taken at Yale. If you're just looking for a humanities credit or are a history major, this course is absolutely worth putting on your registration worksheet whenever it appears. Workload is relatively low, which lets you dig into the material without much stress. The course mainly consists of 50 pages of reading per week (with one notable exception for a book after Spring Break), one pset, and two exams. There was also supposed to be an essay, but this was made optional in exchange for the final being worth more.",
                "Absolutely! I think this was my favorite course that I've ever taken at Yale. Drixler is an incredibly engaging lecturer. 75 minutes goes by without even noticing because you're so invested in what he has to say.",
                "I would. A good survey course for this period of Japanese history. If you're looking for a basic history lecture with an average workload and a knowledgeable\/passionate professor, this is a good option",
                "Absolutely. I've found myself citing class topics in conversations with friends at least every week, if not more often.",
                "Yes",
                "Absolutely, especially if they're interested in pre-modern history. The course touches on all aspects of Edo Period Japan so you can get a holistic view of the period.",
                "yES",
                "Yes! The time period it teaches was very interesting and Drixler's knowledge of art and culture enriched his lectures. I enjoyed coming to lecture everyday and the readings were interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course to students interested in pre-colonial Asian development of countries, because of the extensive cover of knowledge. I would also recommend for anyone interested in Japanese history.",
                "I would, with the caveat to study a lot for the map quiz. For someone such as myself who knew little to nothing about Japanese history before taking the course, Professor Drixler made the history of Japan fascinating and engaging, and contextualized it in broader patterns of world history up to our present day. One should take this course for Professor Drixler's lectures, if anything, as he is one of the most eloquent lecturers at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in Japan or history in general. Professor Drixler is an excellent lecturer and the content is fascinating.",
                "Yes! Especially for History majors, really interesting deep dive into another countrys history and culture. What a good history lecture should be. The 75 minute time slot was a bit long\/unnecessary sometimes, and the exams require A LOT of studying if you dont have foundation in the content (like I didnt), but worth it.",
                "Yes! The class and the discussion section were the best i ever took at yale! Prof Drixler is amazing!",
                "Would highly recommend to any student as a credit for their major or if they want to learn about Tokugawa Japan and the way its society was structured. The professor and TAs are all incredible, and the history is so fascinating. Outside of this class, it would be difficult for an English speaker to otherwise gain a holistic view of Tokugawa Japan. The readings are carefully selected, and super interesting in themselves. Lecture handouts help students grasp the general history, while it is highly recommended that students go to lectures to do well on the exams, as the lectures themselves go in-depth.",
                "Yes!  This class was a great first history lecture.  It was relatively low workload with readings, and I found it enjoyable to study for the midterms and finals.",
                "Yes, absolutely. I was drawn to this course because of a mix between genuine curiosity and a need to fulfill the pre-industrial\/geographic distribution requirements for the history major. Japanese history is full of interesting people and dramatic events, Professor Drixler presents them very well. Lots of fun, low stress, and room to enjoy learning for its own sake--sometimes rare at Yale.",
                "Yes!",
                "YES!!! 100% take this class. On the first day of lecture, I was a bit unsure if I wanted to continue with this course, but sticking with it was the best decision I could have made. This class quickly became my favorite of the semester, maybe of the entire year. I'm a history major, and I had never taken an East Asian history class before, so it was all very new to me and so fascinating. Professor Drixler is an amazing professor and keeps each lecture captivating. Even though lectures are long (75 minutes), they feel as though they fly by. Due to this class, I'm now considering taking L1 Japanese, and I'm also taking other history and anthropology classes that focus on Japan.",
                "Anyone interested in Asian history, diplomacy, demographics, and Japanese culture should take this course! Truly amazing.",
                "Absolutely! I loved the lectures and the readings were very well designed to fit the course themes and lectures.",
                "For anyone who is interested in Japanese history, or East Asian history as a whole, this course should definitely be on your radar. The course covers a really unique time period leading up to the Great Peace, as well as some of the fallout from it, while also questioning how certain themes and practices of the time period we are studying relate to other occurrences in various parts of the world. You don't need a background in Japanese history or Japanese to be able to gain insight from this course, making it a great gateway course into East Asian Studies for someone at any level."
