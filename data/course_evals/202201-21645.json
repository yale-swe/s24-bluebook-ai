                "Only strengths. Pablo is the best, first of all. Take any class from him. He is a genius, very clear in his explanations, AND has great handwriting! So easy to learn from him. During class and his office hours, to help us learn better, he would start by asking very simple questions that we could answer. Then, he would keep asking us questions on the right path, and all of a sudden, we would have proved some theorem or a question on the problem set! He is so great at guiding us and knowing where students might have trouble. I was never so motivated to attend a 9am class. PSets took time, but were doable.",
                "well-paced, gave thorough intro in abstract algebra",
                "This was an excellent class. The material is fundamental to higher mathematics, and anyone who wants to go into the field should take it! You can also take it for fun but it's quite a bit of work. Pablo was a good instructor, and his tests were fair.",
                "Strengths: well-organized course with based on a good textbook. Weaknesses: lectures should be recorded",
                "Strengths: Fascinating material, and clearly taught! Introduced concepts with brief, concrete examples before moving to generalizations, which aided understanding and helped motivate each new topic. Engaging, interactive lecturesthere were many opportunities to answer questions during lecture, and we would occasionally work in small groups on an instructive problem during class time. Very well-organizedpromptly returned problem sets and exams with feedback, and stayed on pace.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "Strengths: great, highly interesting material that is really essential. Clear and concise lectures.\r\nweaknesses: some of the homework problems were unreasonably long/tedious and didn't necessarily offer much added conceptual understanding. Also, I think we could have done more problem solving in class.",
                "I know this class depends a lot on who the professor is so a major strength of this class was Professor Boxeda Alvarez. He had very engaging lectures and kept students engaged by asking questions that weren't too intense so students could participate without stressing about answers being correct. Another strength is the textbook that followed closely with the class and contained a lot of helpful information. The practice exams and sample solutions posted by Professor Boixeda Alvarez were also a major strength. They provided good information about how to approach problems that were more difficult than the things we covered in class. I think a weakness of this class was some of the problem sets. Most of the problems were okay but some weeks had some ridiculous questions which took much longer than homework questions really should. Even though these problem sets ended up being very challenging they ended up being graded quite easily so the issues with the problem sets weren't terrible.",
                "The psets were really hard, and I struggled a lot with them. There also wasn't much flexibility forthe psets; the professor didn't give extensions without a Dean's Extension. \r\nIn contrast, the midterms and finals seemed fair. The professor gave us practice material beforehand, and the tests were similar in material, which was nice.",
                "The class is extremely organized and follow the textbook, meaning that even if you missed a class you can catch up. The problems sets are interesting and challenging.",
                "The course is definitely pretty good at getting a lot of information about the subject out quickly, but I often felt that the problem sets were frustrating, as the textbook is not always the most helpful on the problems and it was very easy to just get totally stuck for hours on one problem. While I enjoy proofs, I felt like there was not much recourse if I got stuck on one of them in this textbook. The exams felt difficult but very fair.",
                "Strengths- The professor this semester was very patient, all of the exams had practice tests that would help prepare you for the test, lectures were clear and we had time to ask questions, ULA and professor office hours were helpful\r\nWeaknesses- there was only one ULA for this semester and the office hours were at kind of a weird time where I usually hadn't started the PSET before going to office hours, the final was much harder than any of the other tests",
                "Strengths: Very thorough and rigorous treatment of group and ring theory. INCREDIBLE professor -- I think the skills he brings to the table (organization, clarity, and PATIENCE) and extremely underrated. Grading is tough, but very fair and clear throughout. Lectures are dense in the sense that there is a lot of material, but they are extremely well-explained and Pablo is a master of answering questions so *make sure to ask questions in class!!* The only weakness of this iteration of the course was lack of enough office hours; there were 4 per week, which may seem like a lot, but this is the kind of course where you highkey need to go to office hours as much as possible to make sure you understand the material.",
                "I think take home exams would be more appropiate.",
                "The content in class follows the DF book, which was helpful since the reading was assigned for homework and a good review. Lectures were also structured, which was helpful for understanding. Examples during lectures instead of only theorems was also very helpful.",
                "The primary strength of this course was Professor Boixeda Alvarez (see question 10). Additionally, this course was well-paced. Because Professor Boixeda wrote the lecture notes out on the board, the course never felt too rushed. This was helpful because it allowed me to engage with the course more deeply. \r\n\r\nAnother strength of the class was the problem sets. The homework assignments contained a combination of textbook problems and problems written by Professor Boixeda Alvarez. These problems were challenging, but in a productive way. In particular, I felt that the problems were well-aligned with the course material, and it was always interesting to see the results of homework problems reappear in propositions proved in later lectures. Additionally, solutions to selected problems from the assignments were posted on Canvas, which was a very helpful resource. I was somewhat surprised that homework assignments were also assigned on the weeks of midterms, as this has not been the case in any of my previous courses. That being said, I also understand that MATH 350 covers many topics and that the problem sets are an essential way to practice these concepts.  \r\n\r\nThere are only two primary ways in which I think the course could be improved. The first would be to have more peer tutor office hours. Throughout the semester, there was only one peer tutor office hours session throughout the week, and this conflicted with another one of my courses. Secondly, the final exam felt quite rushed, and I think it might be better suited to a three-hour exam.",
                "This course moves at a very fast pace, particularly in the beginning, which could be good or bad depending on the student. A major drawback was the workload, which was very consuming and sometimes unnecessarily so. For example, we had psets due two days before each of our midterms, which is exceedingly non-standard and made studying very difficult.",
                "This course was a mostly enjoyable meat grinder. The problem sets were very challenging (although well-designed, they would take me 20+ hours per week). I wish lecture hadn't been at 9AM, but it tended to be well-structured and interesting. The exams were very challenging but not impossibly so, and the scaffolding of the practice exam and review sessions was excellent. Finally, office hours with both the ULA and the professor were excellent. I think this course could very much be improved if it were split into two courses; one on group theory, and one on ring theory. I think the pacing of the split course would be much more humane. Structurally, this course is kind of destined to be hilariously difficult, and it would be nice to learn this math in a less insane format."

                "Yes, but with reservations. You have to love math and be willing to let this class dominate your semester. Algebra is different than analysis; while analysis might rely on some magical delta-epsilon manipulation, algebra builds slowly with basic building blocks until you reach mid-semester where you have a dense toolkit in your arsenal. Also, you won't have much intuition when it comes to algebra because all of the definitions and techniques are new. Therefore, you really need to keep up with the class throughout the semester and not fall behind to understand lectures and do psets.",
                "very good class",
                "Yes, if you're a math major, you should definitely take it! Pablo is also a great instructor, so I would recommend taking it with him!",
                "Absolutely! This was the best STEM course I've taken at Yale. You certainly need comfort with proofs (like the prerequisites say) but if you have that and are at all interested, don't hesitate to give it a try! It'll open up a whole new way of thinking: You'll see all the math you knew before taking the class in a new light, and it'll give context and familiarity to all the mathematical ideas you'll encounter for the rest of your life. You don't need to be a math major to enjoy it.",
                "Yes absolutely. This course is really interesting, and it almost certainly made me a better problem solver.",
                "Yes, it's an extremely useful course for most people. It also teaches you to think differently.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student in a quantitative field who is interested in writing math proofs and learning about algebraic structures. For the correct type of student who can handle the time commitment this is an extremely rewarding class.",
                "Yes. The material is incredibly fascinating, and Pablo is an engaging lecturer. It's a lot of work though, and the exams (the final in particular) were hard.",
                "Group theory is really fun! If you like pure math and want to think abstractly, you should take this class! It'll be hard, but the math is cool.",
                "Yes, it is essential to understand structures of some of the fundamentals of mathematics. It allows you to form a basic understanding of algebra and sets you up for other more advanced topics.",
                "Yes, this course is very useful for learning abstract algebra if you want to go further in that direction in math. I might not recommend taking it in your first year as it felt a little above the challenge level of the other math courses I've taken so far (I just happened to meet both prerequisites from my first semester), but it's definitely doable. If you're not interested in pure math and heavy proofs, don't take this class, but if you are you probably should.",
                "As long as they made sure they had time in their schedule for this class because the PSETs took 15-20 hours every week. The professor this semester was really good though and listened to student feedback. Abstract Algebra is a pretty cool subject too and if you get a good professor for this class it is well worth taking.",
                "Yes, granted that they have friends taking the course to work with, and have ample time in their schedule (you really shouldn't take this class in a schedule with 5 courses -- you will be missing out on giving this course your all)",
                "I would. However, I must say, this is one of the hardest classes I have taken at Yale.  I have taken really hard classes (math 305, 310, CPSC 323)  but none have challenged me like this one has. I would say take it because it is interesting and very cool, but be careful with workload. The exams were very difficult, and the homework picked up really quickly.",
                "I would recommend taking this course. I think that taking this course with Professor Alvarez, the workload was more reasonable than in past semesters. Once things got going, Psets could be expected to take around 10 hours give or take. Professor Alvarez has a rather clear and organized lecture style and it's easy to take clear notes; he also takes time to carefully go through proofs in class so that you actually understand them rather than just nodding your head in agreement. The actual course material? Well if your considering taking this course you probably already have enough of an interest in math such that you'll find things interesting. Some of the content can be a bit dry and seem to lack practicality, but the raw difficulty of things should keep you engaged intellectually. I also think that experience with set theory is great along with this class; you spend a lot of time working with bijections, and notions of cardinality come up as well.",
                "Yes, Pablo is a fantastic professor and will make sure that you understand the content. If you have proof experience, then you should take this class since it is based on the fundamentals and doesn't require prerequisite abstract algebra knowledge. Although admittedly not having much use besides in math, Abstract Algebra is still something cool to learn.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, particularly with Professor Boixeda Alvarez. As mentioned above, this course was challenging, but always productively so. For example, if the homework problems were hard, it was not because the relevant material had not been sufficiently covered in class; rather, it was due to the intellectual rigor of the problems themselves. Furthermore, the course was well-structured, and the professor would often comment on the connections between various topics, which was very helpful.",
                "Yes, if they are prepared for it to be the main work of their semester.",
                "Yes, if you really love math. MATH 350 is extremely challenging, but the math covered is truly beautiful if you're willing to put in the work."
