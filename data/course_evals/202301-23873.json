I felt I gained a working knowledge of key points of many philosophers I've heard about for a long time but never read. This was a great chance to read difficult writers alongside professors who have studied them for years.",

This course definitely provided me with great insight into the evolution of Western thought and challenged my understanding. It was one of the tracks I enjoyed the most.",

                "Generally, I really enjoyed the variety of readings we looked at, and I felt that, for the most part, the arc of the course felt coherent. However, I did feel that there were certain gaps in the curriculum. In particular, I think that it would have been useful to include Hegel, since he was referred to so often, and I also feel like Anscombe was an odd person to end with, since there are lots of other modern philosophers whose work I'm interested in.",
                "The reading is relatively more manageable compared to other DS tracks, especially lit. Also, more time is spent on each thinker, especially with Kant. The only downside is that there are inevitably very important thinkers that are not included in the syllabus.",
                "The course was an incredible survey of philosophical texts with great breadth over ideas. I am not sure if Nietzsches Genealogy of Morals had to be repeatedalso Hegel was a notable omission that was referenced throughout the semester."

                "Yes. The directed studies program is terrific. The small seminar experience -- I had 7 students to one highly qualified professor in my philosophy class -- is unparalleled at a school like Yale.",
                "Yes. I liked this semester even better than the first semester of DS philosophy. If you are interested in taking survey course of several well-known philosophers, don't pass this course up.",
                "I'd definitely recommend DS philosophy in the spring, especially with Professor Schettini. It was one of the tracks I enjoyed the most.",
                "I would recommend that any freshman interested in a well-rounded view of the Humanities participate in the DS program. The program as a whole provides a space and a community for those to explore the works that are foundational to our society. The beauty of the course comes not at the beginning, but at the end, when students are able to look back from the vantage point of understanding and enlightenment they have received over the course of their two semesters of enrollment. Beyond the knowledge the course provides, it is a great way to make friends in your first year, a time when securing relationships is incredibly important. DS builds in relationships from Day one with its shared classes and lectures, both of which are taught by world-class professors with incredibly deep knowledge of their subjects. Taking DS was definitely the best academic decision I made my freshman year."
