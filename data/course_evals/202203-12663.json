                "I really enjoyed the writing assignments in this course--I feel like Professor Barkin put so much thought into each one and that I grew with each piece of work I turned in. Also, the readings that he assigned were very diverse and honestly just a lot of fun to read. In terms of suggestions, I feel that the course could have benefitted from a bit more organization in the classroom in terms of our discussions.",
                "i think the course covered an extensive range of authors and styles, so the conversations were always engaging. professor barkin always has something interesting or engaging to add. i think we could have spent more time reading each other's pieces and offering advice",
                "Strength: the class exposes you to a different kinds of poetry, old and modern, and pushes you to write poetry in different forms and meters. Don gives great detailed feedback and really encourages you to write out of your comfort zone. Weakness: sometimes class discussion can fall a bit short because there isn't much of a structure.",
                "Strengths: Don! Don is such an awesome guy. He provides incredibly detailed and thoughtful feedback on your writing. Office hours with him are so lovely. It was great to come into class and listen to his insights on the reading. I also love the emphasis on writing in the class. Every week you write a poem or prose. It forced me to write frequently and search for inspiration in unlikely places.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had a bit more time to share and workshop our writing. There was a little time at the end of the class to share our writing, but there wasn't much discussion. I would have also appreciated some short lessons or chances to ask Don about writing craft and technique.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Barkin is captivating. His commentary breaths air to each piece. The assignment prompts are fun and push you to think. Barkin's edits are incredibly insightful, working both thematically as well as on editorially.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class format. It's challenging to exclusively discuss texts for 2 hours. I wish there were more diverse opportunities to connect with course content, such as through pastiche-like writing exercises and creative activities. I also wish it was made more clear what the piece can teach us about writing portraits of places. Finally, I would have appreciated designated opportunities to do revisions throughout the semester instead of writing new pieces.",
                "I always felt welcome to write anything that I wanted, and share it with the class. However, I felt that the atmosphere in the class dampened the spirit and sometimes made me feel shy to participate in class."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Barkin is kind, patient, and responsive, and the readings he selected for this course made me a better writer.  His feedback is sharp and thought-provoking, and he is always willing to meet outside of class to discuss writing (or life in general).",
                "Yes, I would. I think that this course is what you make it--if you are willing to dive into the readings and writing assignments and to engage in the discussion, you will gain immensely from this course.",
                "absolutely, i loved this course. i learned so much and think my writing greatly improved. the classroom atmosphere was safe and engaging and i will miss it",
                "Yes, it's a great way for you to do creative writing in a low stress, low stakes environment. I improved my craft a lot just after one semester of writing one poem per week and came out with quite a few pieces that I truly am proud of.",
                "100% It's a great chance to read some great short stories and poems and write weekly. It's very low stakes and learning from Don is a joy. If you are passionate about writing and looking for a chill environment to explore different types of writing, this is a great class for that.",
                "Yes!!",
                "I highly recommend this course to students who can commit to writing.",
                "Yes, I would. I appreciated the weekly writing assignments that kept me writing even when I felt like I was struggling to be creative. These pushed me to keep coming up with new pieces no matter what, and at the end of the day I think that helped me develop as a writer."
