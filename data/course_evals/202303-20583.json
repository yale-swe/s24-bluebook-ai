While the focus is music, we talked through many socio-political factors of both throughout history and we also discussed other places in the world as Cubans or Jamaicans moved there and made music (like NYC or the UK).",
                "I learned a lot about the intersections of music, culture, history, and politics. We really grasped how Cuban and Jamaican music reflected and produced new national identities. As someone who had limited technical knowledge of music, this course also offered a great introduction to that vocabulary.",

I think its a cool subject they Professor Veal is passionate about but I didnt really engage with the content. If we did things like dance to the music one day or watch a live band perform another it would have helped make this class memorable.",

                "I would! Professor Veal brings a candidness and knowledge to his classroom that allows any class to really make what they want of it. If you lack historical or musical background, there is space to ask- the TFs even facilitated extra content sessions to help level the knowledge base of the class. This class helps place Carribbean history, music, and blackness in conversation, so if you already have a grasp one piece, the class is a great way to expand more into learning about the others.",
                "Absolutely. You dont need any prior knowledge of Cuba or Jamaica to take or do well in this course. I think especially for students of Caribbean descent, this class has special significance.",
                "Absolutely. One of my favorites at Yale.",
                "YES!!! 1000% yes! Professor Veal is incredible and makes you want to come to class every day prepared for another great discussion"
