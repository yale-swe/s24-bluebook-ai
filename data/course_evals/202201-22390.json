                "I believe the course readings/videos/materials covered in this class were very interesting and applicable to the real world. However, it was fairly unorganized. Still, many of my assignments for the semester have not yet been graded, and there was often a lack of clarity about assignments in general.",
                "it was fine",
                "I felt like it had a very warm, welcoming atmosphere which made it easy to take risks and feel comfortable speaking out. (this is something I had struggled with in previous non-Yale Spanish classes, so I really appreciated it) I also appreciated the diversity of texts and films that we looked at. I didn't know any of the people in the class before I got there, and as a result I found it hard to coordinate with other people and make group projects that actually felt like a collaboration. I think this might be an inherent problem in a course like this, so I would suggest avoiding group projects, especially ones that need to be done at home.",
                "I think language classes will always be a little bit of a drag when they meet everyday, but I think a way to improve this course is a greater emphasis on speaking in Spanish. My classmates did not participate in class discussions and to progress in speaking a language it is necessary to engage in constant conversation in the new language. I don't know whether that can be achieved by a really strict participation grade or by creating a more exciting atmosphere to talk but I think there needs to be less emphasis on written assignments or filling out handouts but just speaking constantly.",
                "The strengths are the diverse topics we were shown. A weakness may be the lack of grammar we cover, which i feel would help me more.",
                "Great class, just too early in the day.",
                "Tends to have a lot of busy work, but thats expected in language classes since its all about consistent practice. Strengths are the frequent in class speaking practice you get with your peers. Super low stakes speaking practice with your friends is so helpful!",
                "There was a lot of busy work. Too fast paced.",
                "Strengths was Baffi! she rocks!",
                "Class had too many students! it was hard for the prof to keep everyone engaged in lessons designed for a smaller class. Also, it would be better if everyone was not on their laptop (distracting)."
