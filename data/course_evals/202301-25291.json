Additionally, I had never really learned about Afro-Luso-Brazilian history, so this course helped me learn about historical trends and colonial implications. I also got to improve my filmmaking skills in terms of production.",
                "Learned so much about the development of the Afro-luso-brazilian film scene and how it relates to race class and gender",
                "We learned about Afro-Luso-Brazilian Cinema through an anti-colonial lens. The films and discussions were super interesting and eye opening! I feel like I really gained a lot from this course.",
                "I learned about the history of film in Portugal, Brazil, and even a little bit about Angola, and how it connected to queer histories and government/colonial resistance. Also learned several film techniques which we put into practice in creating our own short films.",
                "A deep knowledge of film analysis in relation to afro luso brazilian concepts and themes",
                "I learned a lot about Brazilian, Portuguese, and Angolan films and got to learn about important concepts like anthropofagia. I also learned about film techniques and learned how to create a short film in a small group.",
                "Watched many films I'd never heard of before, learned about Brazilian art movements like cinema novo, tropicalia, antropofagia. A sense of post colonialism and brazilian political history in the 20th century. Technical filmmaking skills & collaboration through a group film project.",
                "During Professor Lino's class this semester I picked up so many new, useful skills. This was my first ever introduction to any sort of film class, which gave me a whole new scope into the analysis and criticisms of forms of art. While taking her class I learned how to follow and understand creative choices and elements creators choose to convey/tell their story or certain themes, I learned how to create work with tools and techniques I was unfamiliar to that taught me the important of lesson of being hands on to learn new skills and teachings, and I learned how to be collaborative with projects and assignments that each member had a different level of knowledge in.",
                "- Portuguese/Brazilian films since the 1900s, many of which covered oppressed groups (i.e. the Black and the trans/gay communities)\r\n- I appreciate how we got to watch both mainstream and more radical films\r\n- Vague understanding of Portugal and Brazil's political scenes\r\n- How to analyze films (but I feel like this happened naturally because we had a lot of reflection papers; there wasn't much in-class instruction about this)"

            "comments": [
                "The curriculum is great and Professor Lino is incredible! The class could have been better organized/ structured to facilitate discussion but overall it was very successful.",
                "The strengths were the enthusiasm of the teacher and the practical work of making short films, and the abundance of feedback. A weakness was the causal format of submitting papers and some disorganization on the syllabus.",
                "One of the strengths of this course was the variety of films that we watched. I liked the division of films based on geographical regions and themes that they covered. I think the course load could be improved since we had only two days to watch two films and write a two page response very. At times, this was very undoable, so it would be nice to have more time to write these responses. Alternatively, the responses could be shorter. I wish the short film we made weighed more in our final grade.",
                "Strengths were the time dedicated to in-class film screenings and discussions. It took the load off of spending so much time outside the classroom and ensured students at least watched some of the films. The discussion was always constructive and productive.",
                "Professor Lino did a really good job explaining the history and context behind each film. Trigger warnings for some of the films would have been helpful to know, as most of the films dealt with violent topics like colonialism. Overall, this was an excellent course, and I really appreciated that we had 1 screening day and 1 discussion day each week - it was a nice balance.",
                "Strengths of the course are definitely the wide scope of fims watched. Professor Lino knows the fimscape very well and every film was worth watching. We watched two films a week, the first one in class and the second on your own time. You really get a deep dive into movies connected by the history of colonization, even if you have little to no background on the history. I don't think there were any weaknesses.",
                "The course was very engaging and its strength lay in the quality of the professors teaching",
                "I think it would've been more productive for classroom conversations if we had been assigned to watch one movie a week, instead of two. Two movies a week was just overwhelming sometimes, and sometimes in our discussions we wouldn't have enough time to get into both movies. Also, I think the short film project should be the final assignment, instead of the midterm. It should be flipped, where the midterm would be a paper. That would allow the students to get to know each other better first and have more time to plan out the film. I also wish there was more emphasis on filming techniques and more film exercises.",
                "Strengths - the lecture/seminar style of the class was a big strength as it allowed us to learn a lot from Professor Lino and ourselves. I also think a strength of the course was watching movies as a class. Weaknesses - one of the weaknesses of the course was the lack of trigger warnings for some works that I feel required trigger warnings.",
                "Strengths: A teamwork/collaboration building environment, a very personable and understanding professor and TF, an engaging and excitable approach to learning. many self-independent approaches to assignments, great line of communication to get feedback/help \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Time frame for some assignments was very short compared to the work they called for",
                "Strengths: The primary strength of this course is professor Lino. She is extremely passionate about her work and explains the complex topics we discuss in an understandable way. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wasnt a big fan of the films we watched. I recommend watching the trailers for the films from the syllabus before you take the class. The next major weakness is the feedback on response papers. The feedback is not that helpful so I recommend coming into this course with strong film writing because this class wont help you become a better writer.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Interesting films\r\n- I liked the mid-term (we worked on short films in groups)\r\n- Professor Lino is really nice and cares a lot about her students' wellbeing. \r\n- I loved our occasional potlucks\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Professor Lino is a good lecturer, but it would've been more engaging to have more seminar-based discussions. Mostly every class was taken up by lecture\r\n- Lectures felt stagnant at times. I didn't feel like I was learning anything new near the end of the semester. I would've liked reading critical reviews of the films in class/learning more about their historical contexts.\r\n- We had two films and a reflection paper due every week, which wouldn't have been a problem for me if we didn't have two days to write/watch them (we watched part of a film in class on Monday and the paper would be due that Wednesday). It would've been nicer if we had Wednesday-Monday instead to write the reflections.\r\n- More time to write the 10-page final paper. It would've been nice to stop having reflection papers due earlier on so we had more time to focus on the final.\r\n- More clarity on grades. We got some feedback on the reflection papers, but it would've been helpful to know what specifically Prof Lino/Daniela were looking for/how they should be structured (should they have been like formal analytical papers or informal write-ups?). I also never knew what my grade was the entire semester."

                "I would definitely recommend this course if Professor Lino comes back to teach it again! She is a great professor, and you will learn a lot about Portuguese and Brazilian history in an engaging way that centers Black, Indigenous, and queer histories. It is also a film course where you get to be creative and and create your own short pieces in a supportive environment. Film pieces are graded on effort/completion so is very beginner friendly.",
                "Yes!! It is a fantastic course, one of the best I have taken at Yale",
                "I would definitely. I learned a lot and Professor Lino was a great instructor. The class was fun while also being intellectually challenging.",
                "YES! I think this is a course that offers both the elements of academic challenge and thinking and a fun, exciting topic of study and inquiry. Taking this class allows us to look at concepts we are familiar with but in a whole other culture/countries that one might not be so familiar to. It shapes ones thinking globally and allows a student to grow such useful skills in field such as analysis and the shaping/sharing of ones original idea, which can prove helpful in many instances in the future.",
                "Yes, I recommend this course if you would like to take a relatively easy film class with an amazing and cool professor. However, only if you have a good background in film writing and would like to watch the films on the syllabus.",
                "Yes, if you really want to watch a well-curated set of films and are fine with not knowing your grade/a heavy workload. But I think there are other film classes that are more structured/conducive to learning than this one."
