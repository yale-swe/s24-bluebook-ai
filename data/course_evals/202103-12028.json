Moreover, I was able to learn about the various ideologies and justifications undergirding the Japanese government's sidelining of indigenous and minority groups, while gaining valuable insight into the history of other minoritised groups in Japan along the lines of gender, sexuality, and disability. I was also able to sharpen my skills in film analysis through more precise terminology and robust feedback from Professor Gerow as well as through the wide array of films that were screened during class.",

I enjoyed the vast array of films he introduced to the class and his lectures, assigned reading, and films that he screened were rich and complex. However, the course may prove challenging for those without much background knowledge in Japanese or East Asian Studies.",
