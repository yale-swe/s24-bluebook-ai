    "A solid class for getting regular practice and frequent feedback. I cleaned out some of my more persistent mistakes by having them corrected so frequently.",
    "My Spanish speaking, writing, and reading improved a lot over the duration of the course. I became more confident in speaking and more knowledgeable about Spanish literature and culture generally.",
    "I improved my Spanish speaking, reading, and writing skills.",
    "I greatly enhanced my speaking abilities - I now speak more fluidly and with more confidence. I also gained exposure to Gabriel Garcia Marquez's writings, along with excerpts from other eminent Spanish writers.",
    "I was a native Spanish speaker before taking this course, but always lacked fluidity when speaking and a greater vocabulary to extend my conversations beyond the colloquial. I have never spoken Spanish as well as I do now after taking this course. Speaking Spanish came naturally after the long and deep conversations we shared in class. I gained a greater vocabulary and learned how to properly share more formal conversations in Spanish with others.",
    "Really learned how to write at a college level in Spanish."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Too much work at times, leaving less time to do quality work on fewer assignments. Generally, the strength was in the regularity and getting exposed to actual (not educational) content--- stories, movies, etc.",
    "It's a little formulaic and dry at times, but definitely gets the job done in improving our communication. The readings could be more relevant to Spanish and Spanish \/ Latin-American culture and less random. Also, grammar could be taught in a more engaging and effective way than powerpoint slides and random book exercises.",
    "Well... I had dreamed of a course to focus improving on my spanish conversation for a while, but this did not help..  Way too much homework, way too much petty grading!",
    "I think the amount of work was a bit high for a 1-credit language course. We had both an oral practice and online discussion every week and I think it should be decreased so they alternate instead.",
    "This course forces you to step outside of your comfort zone and speak regardless of whether you feel prepared. That this class demands extemporaneous speaking is one of its greatest attributes, for this is really the only way to learn\/practice a language. If you are looking for grammar review, this is not the class for you. I find this to be unfortunate, for many of the students in this course stood to benefit from more extensive review.",
    "Would have liked to engage in conversation with my classmates more. It was more question and answer between student and teacher daily. I valued listening to my classmates and what they had to say but would have loved the opportunity to speak to them during class as well."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, be ready for a bit more work than you'd like, but also expect to have a better handle on nuanced and useful Spanish by the end.",
    "I definitely would recommend it to students as their first L5 course. It's not a fascinating course, but is a great way to improve spanish skills in preparation for other literature or culture classes.",
    "No. You don't learn very much more, instead will get fed up and beaten down by having to do too much work and getting judged in class over the annoying lectures.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this course, for class discussion were lively, readings were interesting, and it will surely improving your speaking.",
    "If you find that you can speak Spanish and can get your message across, but not without trouble in finding the words and the embarrassment that comes with it - then this course is for you.",
    "If you are looking to further challenge yourself in basic Spanish (reading, writing, speech, grammar) I recommend this class."
