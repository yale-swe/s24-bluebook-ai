                "Instructor + readings were huge strengths of the course. Reading questions when posed ahead of time were good. Emphasis on close reading gave me a greater appreciation for the readings",
                "I mean zoom makes it difficult but I dont see a ton of room for improvement. Perhaps more conversation about the common threads and broad significance of the texts would be useful, rather than reconstructing the texts arguments themselves.",
                "The course is quite well-structured. The works of various readers are presented in relation to one another and to ethics, politics and economics.",
                "Strengths - very in depth, Professor Kapustin is amazing and offers great feedback on papers\r\nWeaknesses - seminars are mostly lecture format which is hard in the online form",
                "S: Prof. Kapustin does a great job of explaining the philosophies assigned for reading. The readings chosen are interesting and relevant.\r\n\r\nW: Discussion could benefit from more room for questions rather than summarizing readings amongst students. This would help avoid repetitive responses by students to Prof. Kapustin's questions.",
                "Great course taught by a great professor. I think it definitely suffered with the Zoom format and would have been much more engaging in person. Professor Kapustin is a fantastic teacher but his style didn't translate super well to Zoom. Additionally student's participation definitely suffered as a result of the Zoom format.",
                "I loved the lecture-based approach to the seminar. With intimidating texts like these, it was helpful to have a grounding perspective to base other opinions on seeing as the abstract concepts are often interpreted in different ways.",
                "The course could be improved a bit with better time management of discussions or a readjustment of the syllabus. It's a lot of material to cover and we frequently fell behind the schedule on the syllabus which made knowing what exactly we were going to be actually discussing in class on a given week difficult. Oftentimes, I would find myself doing the reading but not discussing most of it until the following week, though by then my thoughts weren't as fresh, and my mind was not in the same headspace, so talking about the readings became difficult."
