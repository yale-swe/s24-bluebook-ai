   "comments": [
    "In this class, I learned about the essential trends in architecture in the past century. I also learned much about the philosophy behind architecture, including general strains of thought behind WHY architecture is important and HOW architects should act based on their conclusions to that question. Thinking about architecture in this manner helped me focus on the trajectory of my life and contemplate how I could best make it meaningful.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about architecture in this course. It served as an excellent introduction to the field of architecture and Yale's architecture. The course really piqued my interest in architecture and has confirmed my pursuit of the major.",
    "Learned about key modern architects and the work, as well as an overview of the origins and focus of modernism. Also developed a critical approach to Architecture and learned how to evaluate buildings and other structures from several different viewpoints.",
    "I gained a foundational knowledge about many architects and their different philosophies, especially those who have built at Yale. The course broadened my knowledge and appreciation for different building on campus. I also, through the course, became more comfortable discussing different architecture topics and philosophies with others.",
    "I develop a strong knowledge of how to write and think about architecture within a more traditional, canonical, framework.",
    "Learned about Yale's architecture and different famous architects. We learned about the role of architecture and how it affects the environment, society, politics, religion, etc.",
    "I learned what the study of architecture and urbanism looks like. I became comfortable in an art\/architecture place; I learned the terminology, history, and perspectives that make me fit to critique and analyze not only buildings, but entire cities and complex ideas as well. I learned so much history (more than I expected) but it was truly the greatest class. I am so thankful to have a firm foundation in the study of architecture, urbanism, and history from this one class!",
    "I developed a clear historical and analytical background to the study of architecture as well as skills useful for discussing topics of the built environment. In this seminar I developed a more fervent interest in the topics as the weeks progressed and hope to continue to fall in love with architecture.",
    "This class gave me a fantastic introduction into the language of architecture  and a deep appreciation of those who practice the artform."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I feel this course could be improved by discussing more often how the architects we study relate to each other. Class discussions were excellent. I think this class does very well in teaching students to interact with and critique architectural thinkers; knowledge of architectural history falls out of the class's focus on critique, but  doesn't necessarily seem to be the priority.",
    "The course is very successful in opening one's eyes to the world of architecture that is rich with great literature and ideas. I thoroughly enjoyed reading and discussing the texts provided that introduced me to some of the great figures of architecture. However, there could definitely be more feedback provided to students, especially when it came to the midterm paper. I was basically given some vague suggestions on additional topics to explore, but nothing about how to strengthen my argument.",
    "Strengths of this course include the broad scope, use of local resources, and the seminar approach--largely student driven and takes advantage of everyone's input. Largest weakness is lack of feedback on work.",
    "I absolutely loved this class!! Each week, we were introduced to a new architect and new buildings and had amazing discussions in class about different architecture philosophies. The second half of the course is spent pursuing a research topic of your choice and presentations on those topics; not only do you get to explore an architecture topic of interest yourself, but you get to learn about all the amazing topics that everyone else in your class is pursuing as well.",
    "The discussions in this class were excellent. Karla did a great job of facilitating debate and conversation, and the field trips we took were great supplements to our in-class discussions. More feedback on the weekly writing assignments would be nice, since they became fairly time intensive and often reached 2-3 single-spaced pages.",
    "The in class discussions were so fun and were possible because of the student engagement. The field trip was also very fun.",
    "Perhaps feed back could be a little more specific so our weekly arguments were more polished. I learned how to argue my thoughts in the class, but wish I could present them in a professional context. (like a publication or journal, how to write a scully piece, how to write a goldberger piece, etc)\r\n\r\neverything else was great! especially the readings and class discussion (thanks to Karla!)",
    "Strengths: Variegated topics and inclusive dialogue. Fun classroom atmosphere; did not feel like speaking was a competition. Guest lectures and the field trip broke up the class well. I really enjoyed the way the course was segmented between professor-led classes and student-led classes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of reading assigned late, or for a short amount of time. Simply not enough time during class to hear and engage with everyone's thoughts.",
    "The topics covered in this class were all extremely strong. The only issue I had with the class were the lessons taught by fellow students, which differed in quality."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this class was a great introduction to the study of architecture that was interesting for everyone (regardless of plans to be an architecture major or not).",
    "I would recommend this course to any first-year with an interest in architecture. There is no drawing involved, but it will introduce you to fascinating ideas and people who will spur your interest in the topic.",
    "I definitely would. Great freshman course, whether or not you are an architecture major.",
    "Definitely an engaging and fun courselearned a lot about architecture, modernism, New Haven, and Yale. And Professor Britton along with her TA is nice and obviously cares about this. If you want to become more cultured, take this!",
    "This class was amazing!! The course gives students a wonderful foundation on many influential architects and their different philosophies. In addition, it provides a great introduction to the architecture major at Yale and the architecture building and provides a great background on many of the various buildings on the Yale campus.",
    "Yes. It's a great introduction to architecture and you get exposure to such an interesting variety of people and ideas. Rudolph Hall is a fun building to take classes in, as well, and you get to see what the upper level architecture students are doing.",
    "YES. Even if you don't want to major in architecture or anything related, the theory of it is so interesting.",
    "yes take it regardless your academic interests you will look that the world (and Yale's campus) much differently",
    "ARCH 005 gives a great, in-depth beginning to the creative and analytical processes involved with the study of architecture. Karla makes the class fun and engaging with provocative readings and a slightly more informal class environment. The course requires an involved research project component that occupies the second half of the semester, which I found very valuable in that I got to understand what piqued the interests of my classmates while also gaining experience doing proper research and architectural analysis. This course is a perfect stepping stone into the world of architecture, or just a fun exploration of aesthetics and the architectural canon.",
    "I would absolutly recommend this to another student. The course allowed me to view the world through a lens that I had not previously experienced."
