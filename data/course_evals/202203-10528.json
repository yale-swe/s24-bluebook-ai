                "I honed my songwriting craft, both generally and specifically for musical theatre. Most specifically, I became a more precise harmonizer and lyricist.",
                "So many skills!! I learned that writing a musical theater song is different than writing a pop song because songs have to be character-specific and really have to convey their lyrics through the music. I improved my lyric-writing overall and gained a newfound love for musical theater composition. I learned that shifting the tonal center/the key/the chords is very important. I learned about a lot of classic musical theater songs/shows that I didn't already know about. And finally I learned how to compose songs effectively on a tight deadline. I loved this class!",
                "One of the most important skills I learned in this course was the ability to compose music that fits the lyrics of a song. Whether I was writing the lyrics myself or working with a lyricist, I learned how to craft melodies and chord progressions that complement and enhance the meaning and emotion of the words. Professor Rosenblum emphasized key changes, and I learned a ton of techniques on how to do this effectively. I also improved my lyric writing and rhyming skills, as we wrote the lyrics to most of our compositions in class. \r\n\r\nWorking with performers was also a key aspect of the last few weeks of the course. I learned how to communicate my musical ideas and collaborate with singers and musicians in order to bring my compositions to life. This required me to be open to feedback and willing to make adjustments to my compositions as needed.",

            "comments": [
                "I thought this course was just the right blend of structure and creative freedom; there were just enough guidelines to make my work useful and feasible. I personally would have liked more by way of in-depth harmonic analysis or greater show structure craft, as well as maybe 1 or 2 more weeks where we don't have a songwriting assignment, so I know that when we do have one, I have the time to bring my best to class instead of what I had the creative space to make during the busy week.",
                "There is nothing I would take out of the course. There are a couple things I would potentially add, though. \r\n\r\nI would love to have done a class focused on learning some handy harmonic progressions or just chords in general that are good to have in your back pocket. A couple of these did come up naturally (like the major-->augmented-->minor--> augmented ascending/descending line thing) but I think a chunk of a class period dedicated to this would have been beneficial. Personally, I do technically have an advanced music theory background, but it was often hard to put this to use in practical ways. Like--maybe I know what a sharp 9 chord is, but I don't know how to use it well in a chord progression. (I actually think Josh did say we would have a class dedicated to chords, but I guess it never happened.)\r\n\r\nAlong these lines, I would've loved to learn more concretely about writing for piano. I have piano-writing experience, but I would often default to pop-song tresillo rhythms in the piano when I didn't know what to do. Having a list to reference, maybe, of examples of different piano grooves would have been helpful.\r\n\r\nFinally, I know this isn't a music history class, but it would have been cool to go over some of the most important musicals in the canon--obviously we sort of did this by way of song examples in class, but I would have loved to have a \"here are 10 great musicals you should totally get to know in your free time\" type of list.",
                "Strengths is access to Professor Rosenblum who works on Broadway, is very nice, and gives very in-depth feedback. A weakness, which is also a strength, is the wide range of students' abilities. I found myself on the less experienced side, and that had an effect on how I perceived myself in the class and how much I enjoyed it. At times I felt very out of place, but I wouldn't have seen some really amazing people doing amazing things w/ music if i hadn't taken it.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- High expectations for students, which pushed us to produce work we were really proud of \r\n- Excellent class dynamic\r\n- Extremely knowledgeable professor with very clear and helpful feedback\r\n- Fun assignments, especially the collaboration between classes\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Sometimes, it was difficult to hear the vision of students' pieces because of the short turnaround in preparing for performances. If someone couldn't play their piano part, or wasn't able to sing the notes they wrote on the page, it was hard to respond to their piece. Josh seemed to always be able to provide feedback even if this was the case, but I wonder if more of an emphasis on recording (or only playing piano/singing, not both) could help with this? Overall, this was a minor thing, though, and the course was excellent overall!",
                "I didn't encounter any particular weaknesses, during this term. \r\nThe course is engaging and rigorous, but it is not exhausting or draining, although it requires an assignment every week. I would take it again if I could.\r\n\r\nI would suggest, depending on the theme of the music that is being discussed each time, to include some trigger warnings and for the curriculum to be more inclusive of composers of color."

                "YES YES YES YES!!! This has been one of my favorite courses I've ever taken at Yale. It truly pushes you out of your comfort zone, and it is a REAL time commitment (think about lyric-writing, composing, notating, performing every week), but it is so worth it. Josh is EXCELLENT, so supportive but also not afraid to give you constructive criticism, and a very knowledgable and kind person all around. I honestly wish the other composition courses at Yale were modeled after this, with fast turnarounds and clear feedback; this is a breath of fresh air if you have been frustrated with the regular composition series. You also get to collaborate with other amazing musicians and lyric writers, and the end-of-semester performance is so fullfilling. \r\n\r\nOverall, this college course was an incredibly enriching and rewarding experience. The assignments have tight turnarounds (especially when we were expected to have complete sheet music in addition to a performance/recording every week), but I feel much more confident and capable as a composer thanks to the skills I learned in this class.",
                "Yes. \r\n\r\nThe class is very informative and the instructor gives spot on and clear feedback- it is obvious that he likes teaching, he knows how to do it, and is invested in his students' growth."
