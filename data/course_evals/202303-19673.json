                "By taking this course I developed my chinese language ability and cultural understanding of China.",
                "Strengths: This class has significantly improved my Chinese vocabulary and grammar, and I learned a lot about Chinese history along the way, such as how Chinese immigrants assimilated in the US and how gentrification is still a relevant problem faced by many Chinatowns in the US.",
                "I developed a greater sense of cultural knowledge, vocabulary knowledge (both in understanding, reading, and writing), and speaking practice by taking this course.",
                "By taking this course, I was able to further develop my Chinese grammar skills and increase the words in my vocabulary. I was also able to practice speaking in both conversational and formal settings."

                "A strength of this course is the meeting times that allow students to constantly meet with the professor but still have time between classes to review the material and finish larger homework assignments. I also really enjoyed using the textbook as a foundation and supplementing it with outside resources, such as movies.",
                "Strengths- interesting topics, relevant vocab\r\nWeaknesses- second exam was a lot harder than the first, sometimes pacing of class was too fast",
                "I liked how the course was organized, as each lesson was relatable and talked about relevant issues, while also delving into high-leveled vocabulary, grammar, and discussion. However, I feel like a weakness is in the course's jump up from L4. It felt like we were learning at the same pace, if not faster, than L4 with the same amount of work, but with a half credit less, and less class meetings, which made it difficult to become comfortable with the material at the same pace, and for the students who place directly into L5, they are already at that level, which made it difficult for the other students who came up from L4. I think this could be improved by making the class a 1.5 credit class with more meetings, or to bring back tutorials, which were really helpful for getting more comfortable with the new terms and practicing using them in my own speech.",
                "Strengths: The class felt very organized, and every lesson from Xu Laoshi was very comprehensive and engaging.",
                "I think a strength of this course is that it is a very fast-paced, yet thorough overview of higher level chinese. Coming from a background where I used to only take one chinese class every saturday in gradeschool, I felt like I learned a lot more from a shorter period time from this well developed course.\r\n\r\nOne weakness however is the vocabulary tests\/ting xie. I wish for the exams the scope of the potential ting xie vocabulary covered was narrowed down more, so then I could've spent a bit more time on better understanding the cultural knowledge or semantically understanding the vocabulary & cheng yu instead of just trying to memorize Chinese characters.",
                "This course was able to cover a significant amount of material that really helped me learn and practice my Chinese skills. At the same time, the course pacing was adjusted based on how students felt, which helped keep the course engaging without being too overwhelming or stressful."

                "I would recommend this course to another student because you truly learn so much about Chinese culture and language. Although the material gets significantly harder throughout the semester, the professor provides a lot of support and encourages you to learn.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course, because I developed my language skills and also learned about more serious and relevant topics like immigration, love, and education.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to  heritage chinese speakers who have a grasp of the language and want to expirience the quality of the chinese language program at yale.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are a heritage Chinese speaker looking to maintain or improve your Chinese skills. There is a good amount of work needed to do well in the class, but the grading is very lenient if an effort is made, and you can learn a lot."
