                "This course completely revolutionized the way I grapple with texts, made me much more confident in my ability to analyze texts, and instilled me with a newfound appreciation for political philosophy. Coming into the course, although I already had a semester of Directed Studies under my belt, I did not yet feel completely confident with tackling the great books unaided. Throughout first semester, I often relied on reading the introductions of the texts we read to help guide my interpretation of the texts, and felt that I was incapable of forming my own unique interpretation of the great books. In H&P class last semester, I would often allow the lecturer to inform my view of the text -- in my mind, they were always correct, and I deferred to their intellectual authority. But right from the get go, Professor Schillinger encouraged every student in the class to read actively and engage with these works in such a manner that would allow us to arrive at our own unique understandings. For example, in my first paper, I allowed an insight made by the writer of our book's introduction to serve as the basis of my argument because I did not feel confident that I could come up with my own unique idea. In his feedback on that paper, Professor Schillinger said that he felt that my own voice was missing from the paper and encouraged me to bring more of my own unique thoughts and ideas into the next one. This encouragement really made a big difference for me confidence-wise. After that, I felt capable of confronting these books head-on and forming my own interpretations of these difficult texts prior to listening to the lecture. Professor Schillinger also encouraged individuals to confidently grapple with these texts by having every student in the class lead a class discussion and come up with questions beforehand. \r\n\r\nI became a much better reader in this course than in any of my DS courses so far, and I think that's partly because Professor Schillinger reads the texts so closely that I was inspired to do the same. Professor Schillinger was constantly bringing the text back into the conversation -- at times he would say in response to a person's comment, \"that reminds me of a quote on pg xxx\", and sure enough we would flip to that page and there would be relevant information there (he truly knows these texts like the back of his hand). The questions that he would send out prior to our seminar discussions would really help guide my annotations and allow me to develop a nuanced understanding of each author's central questions that I wouldn't have had otherwise. For example, prior to our Marx reading, Prof. Schillinger sent us out a list of questions to keep in mind as we read, including something along the lines of \"what's the difference between ideology and philosophy?\". This was a nuanced distinction that I may have never caught without being prompted to look for it, and it ended up being central to my analysis of the text. In this class, I analyzed central ideas from the semester like, what is the best regime? How should people be organized into states? Is there/what is human nature, and how does that inform our understanding of how to form states? What does it mean to be free? What are the crises plaguing modern history? Has there been progress over history? I also learned how to pay attention to key passages and details such as the camera obscura metaphor in Marx, or the metaphor about beauty and ugliness (and how it relates to Nietzsche's \"Yes!\") in Genealogy of Morals.",
                "I learned to read deeply, to write concisely, and to think clearly. I learned to think critically about the social and political structures that make up our lives. These are some of the most brilliant writers, thinking about some of the most pressing issues of their times, and of ours.",
                "Content: early modern to 21st century political theory, how to write interpretive papers, how to effectively draw on primary texts to participate in seminar discussions. Spring H&P is absolutely incredibleyou will see how these thinkers shape the world (and country) we live in.",
                "I learnt how to read a large range of political thinkers' writings, compare them, write about them, and evaluate concepts of human nature and modernity with their help!",
                "I developed sharper reading, writing, and thinking skills. I was able to explore and analyze many texts that are pertinent in understanding history and politics.",
                "Gained an incredible foundation in political philosophy",
                "This was a fantastic course on political thought. One learns to handle on a weekly basis thinkers that appear fixtures in every library but nonetheless mysterious. This course will reveal the mysteries within.",
                "Further developing my close reading abilities, meaningfully contributing to discussions, and evaluating ideas beyond the purpose of understanding them for class.",
                "I learned so much about the history of political theory! In the fall, some of the books blended together, but this semester every writer was so distinct from the other and offered something completely novel. I could see how each built on the other. I also learned a lot about how to write in a more descriptive, analytical manner.",
                "I gained many deep insights into the development of various forms of political theory and ideology. The course is well structured to provide a great survey of most relevant thought from the Renaissance to the modern day, and always feels coherent despite the pace. My ability to see large trends and patterns across convoluted texts was certainly improved.",
                "This course developed my understanding of the foundational approaches to human nature and the resulting theories about how societies should or should not be governed. Because of this course, I was able to identify through-lines across centuries, and the impacts that these thinkers had on the way governments are structured today. I also really appreciated how my interpretational skills improved through the reading of these texts in the context of historical events I have been familiar with, such as the American and French Revolutions, and World War II.",
                "I learned how to read and discuss texts like I never had before, how to draw connections, and how to get inside the mind of a thinker while also appreciating the context in which they were writing."

            "comments": [
                "In general, I think Directed Studies should slightly change the H&P syllabus next semester. I would recommend taking out Sieyes' The Third Estate -- I just didn't feel that it added that much to my understanding of the semester's themes and it didn't feel that related to the other texts on the syllabus. Perhaps it could be replaced with either Frederick Douglass's Narrative (since then it could be put in conversation with Hegel's slave dialectic) or with Franz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth. Also, retrospectively, I think DS finals are actually really helpful. Especially for H&P, re-reading all my annotations and studying with friends helped me really understand how these books work in conversation with each other. \r\n\r\nIn terms of this particular course's strengths and weaknesses, I can really only think of strengths. I am not being hyperbolic when I say this -- this was the best DS section I was in all year. Partly, this is because class discussions were amazing! All of my peers were so enthusiastic and engaged in the discussions. I think part of the reason why is because Prof. Schillinger makes the classroom feel like a safe space where people feel comfortable to participate and contribute. Professor Schillinger is also really incredible at leading discussions and keeping the momentum going. He strikes the right balance between letting students take the lead in discussion but also interjecting with his own thoughts and ideas (either building off student ideas, adding nuance to ideas being discussed, asking clarifying questions, and contributing his own ideas prior to discussion to help introduce the text). \r\n\r\nI thought another strength of the course was Professor Schillinger's essay feedback. He gave really detailed comments and would annotate our papers so that we could see feedback regarding specific lines. I also found office hours to be quite helpful. Professor Schillinger always made himself available to meet with students to discuss papers, and also would ask me my opinions on that week's text in office hour meetings. These questions would always push me and encourage me to develop my understanding of the themes further.",
                "Strengths - Everything. The syllabus is carefully crafted. The rigorous structure of writing three essays gives an opportunity to deepen your understanding of a particular passage and text. I loved the intensity of the reading.\r\nWeaknesses - I thought that the conversations based on the starter questions (which each student has to do at some point in the semester) sometimes fell flat. I wondered whether it would have been rendered more effective if the starter question, or relevant passages for the starter question, were sent out ahead of time? This would orient the other students to the themes, allowing for more effective preparation and perhaps a deeper conversation. I generally liked the starter question model, though, as I think it increases the engagement and agency of each student in the class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Schillinger's insight and knowledge of the texts, amazing lectures, great paper feedback, the books. \r\nWeaknesses: DS-wide problem of too much reading for the amount we actually cover; some odd choices in the syllabus (like doing Hegel in a day, when the master-slave dialectic ended up being one of the most important topics this spring); the DS syllabus should do a more thorough job centering colonialism and racism as themes in the texts rather than adding on a 20 page PDF of the author's views on colonialism to \"supplement\" their other topics.",
                "It gives you a really solid foundation in the history of IDEAS, as does all of DS, but for H&P it would be great if we could get some more background about the actual history of EVENTS surrounding these ideas so we know better how they came to be.",
                "Professor Schillinger was an amazing facilities during section discussion! He continuously pushed us to explore questions and interpretations beyond what was understood at first blush. Since the workload is already very heavy with lots of texts/author, perhaps the DS faculty can alter the syllabus by cutting a few texts that the majority of students felt were unnecessary.",
                "At times reading was too muchsometimes the books seemed a bit random \r\n\r\nHowever, Professor Schillinger was incredible and so helpful. An amazing professor who was always willing to meet.",
                "None in particular. Possibly the final exam should be an interview as opposed to a written final.",
                "Strengths: Open discussion, passionate instructor, and wide breadth of texts\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The quantity of texts you need to read takes away from their individual significance, discussions can get monotonous, and paper feedback is often directed towards the specific ideas discussed in the text rather than more fundamental advice for improvement.",
                "In most respects, this course is very strong. All the authors we read are very interesting and offer something important. The discussions are engaging and the essays contribute to our understanding. One weakness is that I think some of the readings are too long or dont contain the most important portions of the text.",
                "There is too much reading - this makes it difficult to every really get into detail with one text, which can be a shame if you find yourself really enthralled by a particular author. On the other hand, this can also be a strength - as a survey course, you are never anywhere near being bored!",
                "Strengths: Schillinger is awesome, the discussion was engaging, the lectures were very interesting, the books are incredible and very fundamental.\r\nWeaknesses: Certain readings assigned weren't as important and the course skipped over parts that covered slavery."

You get to read so many wonderful texts and put them in conversation with one another; your writing (and the pace at which you can write) improves so much; and you meet a cohort of enthusiastic and wonderful bookworms who become your family on this campus. I am so grateful to the Directed Studies program for being so formative for me during my first year at Yale, and also to Professor Schillinger for supporting/encouraging my studies.",
                "Yes. This course has been a transformative experience for me, easily one of my favorite courses that I've taken at Yale. The thinkers with whom we've gotten acquainted have entered into my mind, and will remain there for my life. I have a new sense of myself as a member of a society, and what it means to be a citizen. Not only has this course improved my ability to think, it has improved my ability to live.",
                "Absolutely! This course, I think, is crucial for anyone who wants to understand modern politics. It will help you find out where our modern conceptions of \"natural rights\" come from, and you will read about how previous generations had tackled with the crises of their respective times. There are so many moments in the course where you discover that something you've taken for granted your entire life (like the idea that freedom can only exist with equality, or that every human is born equal) are ultimately based on theories that can and should be interrogated.",

                "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course to another student. DS H&P is the perfect introduction to political theory. The seminar style and essay feedback helps improve your skill as a speaker and writer immensely.",
                "Yes! Great professor, and my understanding of the modern world is infinitely improved.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if they are interested in the field of history, or humanities more broadly. I think the texts we covered really laid an excellent foundation for the world of Western humanities, and without them, I am not sure that I would get as much out of future studies in history, and especially politics, given the extensive material on foundational political thought, like Locke, Rousseau, and Tocqueville.",
                "YES YES 100% YES! It does not get better than DS H&P. I truly have never learned so much in a year!"
