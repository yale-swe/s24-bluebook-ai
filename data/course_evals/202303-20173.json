I also gained an understanding of what rituals are and how ceramics fit into many different cultures. Discussions of the history of ceramics, their different roles, and how they are created broadened my understanding of the art form, as well as provided inspiration.",

                "This course is incredible. We had dedicated studio time to practice, ample time in class to get help from Penelope, knowledgeable peers to provide some guidance, plenty of examples, and fun discussions. Penelope met us all where we were at and helped us all grow as potters and artists. The time to work in the studio forced me to practice and provided a forced respite from the sometimes very busy existence at Yale. Discussions drew from relevant and interesting readings. I felt like I really got an understanding of the idea of ritual and ceremony, and how that can be applied to modern contexts. Class discussions helped me get a good understanding of the material, and we as a group built shared knowledge about what rituals can be.\r\nAlso the people were wonderful. This was such a kind and supportive class, and everyone was so friendly. It was such a wonderful and positive environment to walk into twice a week. I am going to miss having this time so much next semester.",
                "I greatly appreciated the class and the opportunities it gave me to bond with classmates, more than I have in any other class, and make pottery. I found it a bit difficult to get all the assignments done in a timely manner because pottery can be incredibly intensive in the number of steps involved in creating a piece, so much so that three hours in the studio is not nearly sufficient enough to get everything done. However, Penelope was incredibly supportive and made it clear that whatever we could accomplish was more than enough. In the future, it would be amazing to have more class devoted to demos from the professor followed by our immediate practice of those taught techniques so we could have more time directly working with clay. I particularly appreciated working off the hump because it allowed us to try what we had been taught, making it easy to do again next time, as opposed to other techniques that were harder to replicate many days later without the immediate support of the instructor. Overall though, it was a phenomenal class that I greatly appreciated.",
                "The only weakness of this class is that it's only one semester! From the readings and discussions to the practice pieces and final project, this class was incredible! Penelope chose interesting and relevant readings and videos for us to watch, and incorporated engaging projects throughout the semester like the \"pots in action\" and the \"dear data\" project. We all learned a lot about using and making ceramics and formed a lovely community in the process. This class was top to bottom a delightful experience.",
                "Penelope is such a dedicated, skilled, and wonderful teacher the organization of the class was incredible and the overall environment was such a blast!",
                "Strengths are Penelope! It could be improved with more 1-1 studio time and less readings/class time discussion."

This class taught me a lot, and really made it easy to throw myself into ceramics. While it is work, it is work that is incredibly fun. Ceramics is difficult, and I am so glad that this class forced me to practice. I also feel like I made new friends from this class. In a semester where I was constantly busy and stressed, I always looked forward to studio time.",
