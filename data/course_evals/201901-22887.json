    "weaving connections btwn different texts, how to read quickly and closely",
    "I learned how to not only pick up themes and symbolism in a more nuanced manner but also how the form compounds the meaning in a literary way. Furthermore, I learned about connectivity between the works of the Western Canon, how each author is the inheritor of a centuries-old tradition, and the methods in which they alter it for their own artistic ends.",
    "Analysis and structure while writing essays.",
    "Professor Levin is incredible. She pushed me to be a better thinker and writer over the course of the semester. She is encouraging, yet tough at appropriate times. She is so passionate about the books we read that I was eager to learn the skill of close reading and analysis. In addition, she really helped me to improve the structural component of my papers.",
    "How to read in a way that allows me to discuss the book and how to write more insightful literary analysis"

    "maybe more time on each book, but always the DS struggle :(",
    "The assigned works of literature are amazing and thought-provoking, and it's a wonderful experience to be able to read and discuss them. But as with any DS course, there is an emphasis on breadth over depth and there is certainly much that gets left out in section and lectures in the interest of time.",
    "It is difficult fitting in so many works in little stretches fo time, yet the sheer knowledge that I have learned as well as the engaging discussions more than made up for it.",
    "Jane Levin is AMAZING",
    "Honestly, I loved this course. The only way in which I felt it could be improved is just what I wish for all Directed Studies courses - that we could spend more time on each text. However, this is nearly impossible given the nature of the program.",
    "It was kinda perfect. Omeros was controversial, especially the jump in time from 1920s to 90s, but ultimately I understand why it's on the syllabus and I enjoyed discussing and reading it"

    "yes! any class w professor levin!",
    "What can I say? DS is something special. Literature was definitely my favorite class both semesters. I enjoyed almost every book on the syllabus, and seeing the influence of earlier works play out in later ones is such a unique and important experience that you cant really get without a program like this.\r\nDont pass up DS because most of its works are by dead white men. The books are infinitely beautiful and complex, the voices in the classrooms are incredibly diverse, and whether we like it or not the influence of this tradition is far resounding. After complaining about DS so much throughout the course of this year, I am still so glad to have taken it. \r\nMost important piece of advice: If you decide to take DS, please do try to do all the reading.",
    "Yes! Literature in the second semester of DS is a great time, and you get to read a more diverse array of works than in first semester.",
    "Yes, but only if they are really interested in literature. There is a lot of reading and a lot of thought required.",
    "Absolutely - I looked forward to the discussion in this class every day.",
    "Yes, wholeheartedly. For literature, you want Professor Levin.",
    "Yes. This is what made me decide to major in English."
