                "This is a very enjoyable course. However, the fact that one paper makes up 50% of the grade makes that one assignment too high pressure compared to other ones.",
                "the handouts were very well structured, both Prof. Winkler and Prof. Szabo are experts in the field and it was a pleasure learning from them. However, discussion was sometimes derailed and too much time spent on minutiae compromised the discussion time for the more crucial topics that could have been discussed, which was a pity since we only had 1 or 2 classes on each philosopher",
                "Strengths: Both professors were great discussion leaders and very thorough in their answers.\r\nWeakness: The readings and materials covered in a single seminar were sometimes ambitious which made it hard for me digest the material and wrap my mind around the topic."

                "Yes, the topic is interesting and the Professor are both fascinating. There is a lot of reading, some of it a bit dry, but it is all very valuable. The lectures really tie everything together and show why the readings matter.",
