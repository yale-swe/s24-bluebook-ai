We also learned different psychological tendencies, which was meant to help us create better decision making processes. However, it ended up being that we needed machine learning for the PSETs, which was never really taught, and it was assumed that we already knew. I think you need a lot of logic when coming into this course, but it's interesting to see how Slade turned a program into an English-generating decision process."

                "I do like the way the professor engages the student with polls and interactions in class. I think his preparations for this course is thorough. On the other hand, there are times when he spend considerable amount of time in things that are rather straight-forward or materials that are already in the reading.",
                "Strength is that there are many guest speakers and we got the chance to have dinner with them",
                "The lectures had a lot of interesting content (especially with the guest lectures) and the homeworks posed intriguing questions as well but some of the lectures could have been a bit more engaging.",

Had i been engaged earlier, it would have been a much better experience, especially since Prof. Slade is a deeply knowledgeable and hilarious lecturer and he very clearly cares about everything he presents in this course.",
                "Strengths: Lots of guest speakers + opportunities to interact with people in industry. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Unengaging, not particularly structured (partially because since there are so many days with guest speakers),",

                "The lectures were always interesting and Professor Slade is a fun lecturer. The guest speakers that he brought in also gave introductions to a wide range of fields where lecture topics could be applied. One area for improvement in this course is with regards to the coding assignments. Although it was nice to have flexibility in what we could code, some guidance and more direct application of course material in the assignments would have been helpful.",

                "The course really teaches the concept related to automated decisions. However, the course content is not that relevant to the assignments. The more serious question is the description of the assignment is very unclear and many of us misunderstood the assignment requirement and get a very low grade. But the grading of that misunderstood assignment is released after the final assignment's deadline. So even when I know I did not meet the requirement for the following assignment, I cannot change it. For graduate papers, there is the same issue.",

                "I think the main strength of this course is the guest lectures - Slade is very well connected, and it certainly shows in the class. It's insane - we had Citadel high-ups, ex-editors of US News, and so much more, along with the ability to enter a lottery to have dinner with them. The homeworks were fun and they were very open ended, though I would have appreciated more structure and detail in the specification. Many students had issues because of this, though I would argue the spec was clear enough in the areas they had issues and the students simply lack decent English comprehension, or had not watched a single lecture the entire semester.",
                "The course brought in amazing speakers and gave a good overview of the various options for decision-making models. I also really liked that the assignments forced the student to come up with their own models with little guidance. I do wish that the assignments were better defined in terms of what the desired end result was.",

                "This class is great if you want to learn almost nothing and then get a CS credit for it. This class had a lot of grad students and second-term seniors for that reason. There are 3 psets, a paper, and final project, a lot of which do not use much material from lecture, and can essentially be hard-coded with some simple heuristics. The work for this class was back loaded with before spring break being a 1.0 and after spring break being a 3.0. The work is not intellectually challenging and no exams are nice, but it can take some time to properly do the assignments (up to 10 hours each) so there are classes with less work (but the content of this class is probably easier). There is an abundance of guest speakers for this class though (we had 5 this semester) who are Slades acquaintances and typically, a handful of students will get to dinner with them. Among the likes are high ranking officials from Citadel, Accenture, ex-Google, Yale SOM, and journalists. One last note is that the grading is done by hand (almost no autograder) so expect to be in the dark about your grade for most of the semester since the spec is not particularly detailed (which is a feature not a bug!)",

                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are looking for a more lowkey computer science elective, as the assignments tend to be relaxed and you get the most of the course by just listening to Professor Slade talk.",

                "yes, it is a decent class that was great and fun to take!",
                "Yes. This class is fairly easy and interesting - despite what others might say, Slade isn't trying to catch you out. Just watch the lectures, go to OHs if you need to and do the homeworks, and you'll be fine. The open-endedness and flexibility in the final project means that it can form a decent section in your portfolio too. The lectures themselves are very \"Slade\" (you will know what I mean if you have took 201), but the guest lectures are very interesting and Slade is slightly more animated, likely because he is more interested in the content. Anyway, the homeworks are fun and open-ended whilst not being too difficult, the final project was interesting, and Slade was very flexible with deadlines and meeting any student needs. All in all, a lot better than 201.",
                "I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. It forces you to think about the mental \/ decision-making models you use in daily life and gives options for new models you have not thought of before.",
                "Yes - the subject matter and potential applications of the techniques learnt and ideas explored are fascinating. The workload is not too heavy."
