                "I learned the different skills needed to approach writing an essay and analyze text. We focused a lot on identifying and practicing skills and applying it to our writing and the writing we read.",
                "This class was amazing. Professor Kibbe is excellent at creating a joyful, collaborative learning environment. She has designed this course to empower her students to intimately examine not only the worlds relationship with food, but also our own. As a result, every assignment or paper she assigns feels immensely intrinsically rewarding. Her feedback and peer review systems were also very helpful in improving my writing. It was a privilege to be Professor Kibbes student. Please take this class if you get the chance!",
                "I learned so much about the history of food stories and really improved my writing skills.",

                "I thought this course was organized very well. The only suggestion I have for this course is to perhaps change it from a twice a week 75 minute seminar to a 1 time a week 110 minute seminar. Having two 75 minute classes a week especially for a seminar sometimes felt like too much.",
                "Strengths are wide variety of topics covered and personalized feedback from professor",
                "Strengths: great professor, very interesting class content and readings, a lot of dedicated time to workshop and review our writing. We did a lot of peer review so it was really great to be able to get feedback from our peers and Professor Kibbe, and hearing the feedback others received was helpful to apply to our own writing\r\nWeakness: there were a few occasions when we would get assigned a bunch of reading last minute, which was often difficult to complete in the short time since we have other classes and obligations before we meet",
                "Strengths: pretty much everything about the course. The materials, the structure, the paper, the grading, and the freedom given to students to design their own paths of exploration and research in food studies are aspects seldom found in other writing classes. Plus, we COOK in this class twice a semester!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the readings were extremely lengthy and dense, but it wasnt impossible to get through.",
                "I think this course was organized extremely well, with interesting topics and readings.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kibbe is extremely knowledgeable on food studies!! This is such a low-stakes class where you not only learn to improve your writing but also about a subject that is not often discussed in academia. We covered so much from black studies to fat studies to health as a social construct. The class was a little unorganized at times but Professor Kibbe was learning, growing, and evolving the course with us so it all worked out. WE ALSO COOKED IN CLASS WHICH WAS REALLY FUN!!!",

The course material is very interesting and engaging and you truly learn a lot about food including about its production, cultural impacts and consumption.",
                "Yes!! This is the best course I've taken at Yale and professor Kibbe teaches you so much as a class and individually!",
                "Yes!! Such an amazing class if you're interested in anything food related. Professor Kibbe facilitated the class really well, and we were able to have really interesting and engaging group discussions. We also did a lot of peer review and group work that really helped our learning. Probably the best seminar I've taken!!",
                "Yes!! A million times yes!",
                "Definitely! It's a great class no matter what your major is.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student!! We learned so much how food in a low-stakes environment. We also had peer review workshops throughout the semester which also helped us improve our writing.  I cant emphasize how much cooking meals as a class took this class to the next level! Overall, excellent course and sure it may be slow at times but trust me this class is worth it."
