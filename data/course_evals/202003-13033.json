We were taught how to critically analyze research publications, how to improve research designs, and how to create our own research proposal. Other techniques like literature review and meta-analyses were taught and used.",
                "I loved this course! We learned about how to conduct research-- specifically neuroscientific research-- through hands-on experience and through lecture discussions, so the whole course was very engaging. We were able to conduct our own experiments, which was a cool opportunity. We often learned about the different stages of conducting research with a different given theme for lecture, so the material was always new and engaging.",

The lectures were very clear despite having complicated concepts. \r\nI think that because this was the first time the course was taught and because of the online format, it felt like there was no clear set schedule, but this was not a problem because the professor and TA were always there to help and guide us through the assignments.",

The lectures deal with complicated concepts but are presented in a very clear way. There are very few assignments in this class but you will still learn a lot.  If you are interested in research designs or neuroanatomy at all I definitely recommend this course if you're able to get in.",
