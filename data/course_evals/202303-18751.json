                "I learned about the history of journalism and key questions journalists and editors weigh when writing and publishing.",
                "I learned about journalistic practices, standards, and ethics. I also became a much better storyteller.",
                "I learned how to critically analyze media coverage, about the history and evolution of journalism over time, and about the present state of trust in media. The guest speakers Prof. Lipman brought into class were phenomenal and shared incredible insights about what it is like to work in journalism with the class.",
                "I think even more critically about the news than I did before, and I'm also less pessimistic about the state of the American news media. Because of lively class discussions, interesting readings, and Professor Lipman's wealth of expertise, I'm leaving the class with an improved understanding about both historic and current challenges in journalism.",
                "I developed an increased understanding of the media's role in maintaining American democracy, contemporary challenges to reporting, and the journalistic practices behind memorable stories. The course also provided plenty of opportunities for lower-level reflections with short assignments, as well as opportunities to practice journalism in the extended writing assignments.",
                "Insight into the challenges and opportunities of journalism as a field, particularly in the advent of AI. Conversations around how to combat misinformation, bias."

                "1. Strengths: unique and challenging assignments, high-in class participation\r\n2. Weaknesses: course requires a relatively high engagement with current events and journalism generally \r\nto the disadvantage of less knowledgable and experienced students",
                "Professor Lipman clearly put great thought into organizing this course. The strengths are the interesting topics, the engaging assignments, the guest speakers, the lively class environment, and Prof Lipman's detailed feedback and high expectations for students.",
                "This class was incredible.",
                "The best thing about this course was the guest speakers and expertise that Prof. Lipman brought to the topic. One weakness of the course is that our class discussions became a bit repetitive toward the end of the semester.",
                "Strengths: Some of the guest speakers are phenomenal. Class discussions can be interesting. Really great insight into how media business works. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class discussions sometimes feel very pop-politics. Lots of little assignments that kinda catch you by surprise.",
                "Professor Lipman's experience in journalism is unparalleled. Connecting our readings to her real-life experiences underscored the gravity of many of the situations we read about.",
                "The course is highly engaging, organized, and designed to encourage student participation and reflection. Each week's material built off the previous week's in a very logical and thoughtful way, and the guest speakers and Professor Lipman herself provided so much insights into journalistic practices and challenges. The assignments (presentations, reading reflections, essays, and more) were highly creative and unlike other typical analytical papers I have done in other courses while still prompting deep reflection. This course is one of the most interesting I have taken at Yale.",

                "1000%. Easily the best course I've taken at Yale. I felt compelled to go above and beyond with all assignments because I thought that I'd get a lot out of putting a lot of effort in, and I was proven right. It's a very rewarding course that I'm taking a lot away from.",
                "This course was the best class I have ever taken. It literally changed my life trajectory. My career goals. My everything. Professor Lipman is brilliant -- she knows journalism as a practice and as a business. The guests, the lectures, and the discussions were of an incredibly high caliber. \r\n\r\nThe class was a lot of work. Professor Lipman started the class by telling us she had high expectations. And I am so glad she did. I worked really hard--not for the grade, but because I felt like I was really learning something. I have never done journalistic writing before, and now I want to make it my career. The class is accessible to anyone who has a love for writing and stories.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in journalism and analyzing the media. The readings and discussions are interesting and the opportunity to meet accomplished guest speakers was very unique.",
                "Eh probably not. It's a fun way to interact with some cool journalists but IDK if you learn so much that couldn't be found in a non-class setting.",
                "Absolutely! If you're interested in journalism, politics, and the First Amendment, this is a really interesting and engaging course.",
                "Yes, every student should take the opportunity to learn from Professor Lipman! The course is very engaging and considers challenges in the media with great nuance and depth, and I walked away with the ability to be much more critical of the news.",
                "I would certainly recommend this class to anyone interested in journalism as a career but don't necessarily count on it to develop your writing."
