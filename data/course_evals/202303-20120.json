I also appreciated the semester-long group investigations into a city, as it helped put into perspective spaces and cities that we knew intimately within the framework of the course. The biggest weakness was that the lectures often felt as if they did not align with the assignments, and the combined graduate and undergraduate nature of the course made it so that there were many times in which readings and prerequisite knowledge for graduate students were referenced that undergrads did not know what to make sense of. That being said, the lectures themselves were very informative, entertaining, and a great learning opportunity."
