                "Strengths: I think this course really benefited from its small size (even for a seminar). We were able to have more direct and interesting conversations that I think would be lost even at a class size of 18. I also greatly enjoyed the guest lecturers we had. Their lessons were enjoyable, inspiring, and insightful. The weekly readings were also a great starting point for the week's discussion and helped me with structuring my final essay for the course. Professor Hecht was also an easily accessible, eternally encouraging, extremely knowledgeable resource. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, I felt that the course bordered on too much lecturing. Professor Hecht presented many figures we had seen in the readings, which helped provide more context to them, but I wonder if we could have gained more from discussions by glancing over these figures a little more. I also think that the seminar could be a little longer. I always felt like we were rushed for time at the end of class, but another twenty or thirty minutes would have allowed to us to completely flesh our ideas out.",
                "Professor Hecht is phenomenal! He would bring in amazing guest lectures and made sure to make the class fun and lively even when talking about difficult health issues",
                "strengths: light reading, entertaining and dynamic 2 hour class \r\nweaknesses: not very many, could have prompted\/facilitated more class discussion",
                "The course was an environment of academic growth and a welcoming environment. The course touched on many different topics."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student with even the slightest interest in global health care policy. I came in with close to no background, and I still found the class extremely rewarding. It took a bit more effort on my part to understand the dense economic analysis of some of the readings, but it was well worth it! Professor Hecht's professional background contributes greatly to class discussions, and I always felt like our conversations could have gone on for another twenty to thirty minutes at least. I think that the workload is, until the final paper, fairly light and prioritizes understanding material over arbitrary number and letter grades through many assignments.",
                "Yes! This was one of my favorite classes because having never taken a global health class I know feel I have the necessary skills to take many others",
                "If you are interested in economics\/program implementation, or if you want a survey course on global health organizations",
                "yes, if you want to learn more about what the global health field looks like definitely take this class, interesting people working in the field also come visit the class and present their current work in the field",
                "Yes, the course was unlike any I have ever taken and a great opportunity to expand ones knowledge in the field"
