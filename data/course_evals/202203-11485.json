                "A fantastic course with a syllabus that you won't find anywhere else -- we talked about early recording techniques, experimental labels, sound art and more, with an emphasis on DIY approaches. Learned how to cut vinyls and dub cassettes. I appreciated the focus on the record as a wholistic product: we made not just the music, but also the packaging. The projects were great. I finished the course having made two conceptually interesting EPs - there's no other class at Yale where the output feels so ready for the real world.",

The lectures were highly engaging and through class projects I felt like I had a chance to work in all the media we discussed and see first hand how it shaped the history of recorded sound.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of sound and analog technology, and a bunch of stuff about conspiracy and other randomness that I didn't really care to learn. \r\nMy engagement really varied by class. Some classes were very interesting and introduced me to a world that I knew nothing about, and other classes were rather painful with little awareness from the prof (never a single break during class of almost 2 hours) that he was just talking at us. \r\nUltimately, you do cool projects and there is not another class like this at Yale, so I do recommend if sound is your cup of tea.",

                "This class was a great way to advance as an artist, as well as collaborate with and learn from other students/professor. I've never been more inspired to create art than when I took this class.",

The stuff you do in this course is super unique and I walked away with such a greater appreciation of sound as a medium and sound as an art form. This is one of the first \"creative\" classes I've taken at Yale and now I'm itching to take more.\r\n\r\nI mean... you get to put music/sound on \"vinyl\" using Ross's lathe cutter... how cool is that?!??",

If you want to learn about the origins and reasons for the current experimental music and multimedia art scene as it relates to recorded sound, this is a great opportunity. It's also great write pieces and create physical versions of them that you'll get to keep forever.",
                "Yes, definitely. The professor is very helpful, so even if you're not that familiar with a particular subject, he will help you. I was exposed to a lot of cool things that I'm not sure I would've known about if I hadn't taken this class.",
