    "How to write a convincing essay, how to critically analyze farm bill policies and propose practical solutions",
    "I learned how to write a paper at a high college level.",
    "I learned much about the United States food system, and the flaws of our current system and how they relate to many economic, environmental, and health issues in today's society.  This course was very relatable to other courses such as economics, public health, bioethics, and even corporate finance.",
    "I didn't have a much of writing background coming into this course, so I think this class helped me developed a stronger writing foundation.",
    "I could improve my reasoning skills and how to improve my writing by using those skills.",
    "learning how to write longer essays",
    "I learned a lot about the American Food System, and discovered many surprising injustices in the way corporations treat our food choices, the environment, and crop growers. I also learned how to better combine evidence from scientific literature into an argumentative essay. This course also introduced me to a wide variety of tools I could use outside of class, like the CTL, writing tutors, and Orbis.",
    "I expanded my knowledge on writing and improved my writing techniques."

   "comments": [
    "The course does a good job giving people practice for writing essays and making sure they get feedback before turning in final drafts but there is way too much work in this class and way too many overlapping deadlines",
    "Strengths: great topic (food)\r\nWeaknesses: the classes were irrelevant to the course",
    "I thought the course as a whole was very well put together - however, I think that the presentation deadlines should be pushed back about a week in order to give enough sole focus on the big research paper.",
    "I really like how this class was organized with 3 essays and a TED talk. I also really enjoyed being able to edit other students' essay and have other students edit my essays. For most of the  in-class time, we would discuss readings which I found pretty engaging. However, I felt that most of class wasn't very useful in terms of helping me be a better writer. I think I learned the most about writing with the helped of the residential college tutors that helped me with my essays.",
    "I hope that the class would include more materials about writing itself rather than the topic or theme.",
    "This course was a lot of reading and not a lot of instruction",
    "I liked the peer review part of this course, which allowed every student to pitch their thoughts to each other and create a more interesting dialogue on ideas from class. I wished there was more consistency and transparency on how we were graded, had more access to examples of prior outstanding essays, and got more one-on-one time to work on essays.",
    "The course does a good job reinforcing techniques taught in class with strong support behind it."

   "comments": [
    "This class has less essays due than the other english 114 sections which is nice but overall this is a high workload so just be prepared for that. Otherwise id recommend",
    "I would recommend this course for someone looking to take an interesting ENGL 114 class.",
    "Yes, it helps people develop insights into how big of a role our food system and food policies play in the life of each citizen as well as in the global sphere.",
    "This was a great intro writing class that is good for someone who doesn't have much a writing background. The workload isn't too bad (readings before class, 3 essays, and a TED talk assignment) and the topic of food and food policy was interesting.",
    "Yes, I would. It is a very good class to improve writing skills and learn about agriculture policies in the U.S.",
    "yes it helps you learn how to write better",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in issues involving food and environmental justice. The strong point of this course was the variety of different sources we got to read, and it really introduced me to a lot of surprising information which made  in-class discussions interesting."
