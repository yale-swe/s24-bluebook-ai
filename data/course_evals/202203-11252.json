                "Strengths: Prof. BMac is awesome! Very chill/friendly, but also super helpful on case studies and the final project as someone to bounce ideas off of, debug random R issues, or refresh on statistical concepts. He checks in on cases and projects once every two weeks during a scheduled group meeting. I really enjoyed the NBA case study since we had to design the model matrix ourselves and understand how to interpret the results. It was fascinating since I had never seen linear models used this way before.\r\n\r\nWeakness: We (basically) did three cases over the course of the semester: housing, NBA, and (briefly) sleep. I wish that we could have done more, but slightly shorter, cases. In particular, I really did not enjoy the housing case study. It was extremely tedious with data scraping/cleaning. And by the time we finally got to build a model to predict house prices, I was ready to move on since I was no longer interested. Additionally, since this case study had assigned groups, intergroup dynamics were also frustrating at times.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it also felt like we were completely on our own with little guidance. It would have been helpful to have learned some small concepts, ideas, or R tools to use before starting the cases. For example, in the sleep case study, it would have been helpful to have learned a bit about different graphical packages we could explore.",
                "No weaknesses that I can think of! Such a great course.",
                "strengths: professor is great, generally nice to work on projects with other students and case studies are interesting. weaknesses: first case study took too long and made it hard to focus on other ones. more content-based deadlines for final project prob also would've been good",
                "The freedom given to students is a great strength of this class. By allowing us to find the questions we found most captivating, I was very engaged with my final project throughout the semester. Even when we were given datasets and questions, we had a great degree of liberty when it came to the approach, we took to answer these questions. A weakness I found was one common to many Yale courses: that many times I was guessing what was expected of me. Perhaps this is by design, since in the real world we will need to be responsible for our own quality of work without stringent guidelines from others. I would have also appreciated longer office hour blocks. 15 minutes felt far too short.",
                "I liked that we were exposed to the gritty and practical aspects of obtaining, preparing and cleaning the data ourselves rather than be given a cleaned dataset with variables pre-selected for us. It introduced me to an important stage of real-world statistical projects I had not been given a chance to learn in previous classes. However, I think it can also be more structured by designing more requirements in case-study assignments and questions to answer, as well as going through after each case study, a sample of what a good, comprehensively done analysis can, although not necessarily need, look like. Each case study would thus be used to teach key functions, models, or techniques in programming and data analysis (i.e. concepts / principles) aside from just the practical coding work, which ideally would build upon earlier concepts in a cohesive syllabus.",
                "The main strength of the course is that it gives you hands-on data science experience. The weaknesses are how your experience in the course is entirely dependent on the group you're working with and you don't get a lot of feedback."

                "Yes",
                "Certainly. This class was a welcome change to the overly-theoretical courses in the statistics department. This class forces you to take your understanding and apply it to real-world scenarios, revealing the broader scope of what was covered in other classes. I would say that if you take this class please go and seek help if you need it since it's very easy to dig yourself into holes while coding by yourself.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to someone looking to gain more practical hands-on data science experience. I don't know if I would recommend it over a thesis though only because of how much work you end up putting into the case studies and then your capstone project. Also you don't get much feedback on how you are doing."
