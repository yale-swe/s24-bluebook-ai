                "I learned how to push my essays beyond basic essay writing technique and structures. I knew how to write a solid essay, but I feel like this class pushed me more than any I'd taken before to write a compelling one. I learned to find nuance in texts and analysis and to push myself in my thinking.",
                "A very deep understanding of the foundations of political thought, exposure to authors I'd have never read on my own, the confidence to continue engaging with these issues, and the desire to learn as much as I can about them!",
                "I learned how to think more analytically and form more sophisticated and organized arguments. My papers in the course had an upward trend, and I greatly improved my writing skills.",
                "I learned how to closely analyze and interpret historical and political documents at a level I had not previously. I also learned how to write fairly nuanced papers in less than a week, which is something I had never done before.",
                "For DS Historical and Political Thought, I was able to read both large and small in the early histories and political philosophies in the West. In papers and discussion posts, any particular student was asked to enter into any particular text with real depth (e.g. a paper on the place of memory and character-association in history prompted by a small passage in Thucydides, or a discussion post raising questions pertaining to Aquinas's conception of the Natural Law). And yet the truly grand scale of the course (leaping through time and place) also required the student to step back from the texts and see them in relation to each other and to the western politico-historical tradition. I was introduced to the seminal political and historical texts of the West (and also their relations to one another in an established tradition), yet was also encouraged and pushed to interact with them, to bring myself and my ideas to whatever they themselves had to offer. So this was knowledge gained and skills applied, with deep insights achieved as a result.",
                "Taking this course not only deepened my knowledge of historical and political thought, but also helped me develop my interpretations and express my thoughts (in both speech and writing) more succinctly and impactfully than I could at the beginning of the semester.",
                "I learned about the common themes and problems that historians and political thinkers have to contend with, and how to synthesise and compare their views. I also learned to engage more critically with what I read, ignoring the aura of the authors and focusing on the ideas in the texts.",
                "This course pushed me out of my comfort zone to practice argumentation and refutation, synthesis of personal knowledge and new content, and effective note-taking\/listening and considering the responses of my peers. I had done these things in the past, but never at such a fast-paced and consistently thought-provoking level. I had to pick and choose which comments to respond to and how to most effectively do so, without talking over my peers. I was also unfamiliar with most of the content and had not known the order of many historical events.",
                "I learned the importance of not always taking things at face value. Weather by talking with the teacher were discussing with classmates theyre always wait if somebody could improve their initial understandings of a reading.",
                "I developed the ability to critically think about historical texts. I also learned how to write argumentatively about a multitude of various authors."

            "comments": [
                "I thought discussion could be a little more guided\/organized, but I think this got a lot better throughout the term. I think this courses' greatest strength was the liberty of the discussions and the vigor that everyone brought. I appreciated the passion and different perspectives.",
                "I loved the intensity of the workload. DS consciously goes for breadth over depth, and while that's great for exposure to tons of authors and different styles of political thought, the cost is a lesser understanding of any single author.",
                "Strengths: strong sense of camaraderie with fellow students and Professor Barasch. Classroom climate was relaxed, warm, and engaging. I learn a lot in every single class. No class is ever boring. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of.",
                "The strength of this course is the amount of material we cover and the professors that cover it. Directed Studies H&P essentially goes from The Bible and to Aquinas, which is a truly amazing amount of texts. We also covered a lot of ground textually, with religious texts like Aquinas' Summa Theologiae sharing a spot on the syllabus with classic history texts like Polybius' \"Rise of the Roman Empire\". Another strength of the course are the lecturers. With a new lecturer every week, each a leading scholar in their field, the amount of detail they go into is truly incredible. That being said, an issue with the course is that it might cover too much in too short a time. There were some texts that definitely deserved more attention than we were allowed to give them, and I left many of the classes disappointed that we couldn't keep talking about texts like the Bible after spending only one class (essentially an hour) on the entire book of Genesis.",
                "This course had myriad strengths. As a seminar, the class learned how to keep a thread of discussion going, to listen to disparate ideas, and to also celebrate disagreement. Specifically in the context of Historical and Political thought, we also learned how to apply large, overarching questions pertaining to human political organization and historical currents to contemporary political and historical questions, which was thrilling. The course could move quite rapidly, and it was difficult at first to both delineate and relate the texts when we read them so quickly; yet such a rapid pacing of the syllabus was also a great strength of the course---excitement never waned.",
                "This course excelled at conveying its subject matter effectively and memorablyI felt that the weekly discussion posts were a great element that encouraged me to do the reading carefully even when the temptation to skim was strong. The class's discussion format was another strength, as it allowed us all to engage constructively with each other's perspectives on and interpretations of the material.\r\n\r\nI felt that class discussion, whose centrality was one of the course's strengths, could have benefited at times from more direction from the professor. This did occur to some degree, but I think a bit more leadership \/ directing of the conversation toward relevant subjects could be helpful in the future.",
                "The strength of DS in general of course lies largely in the texts. There are some surprising and fascinating texts in this curriculum, which combine to give you a good idea of how the ancients thought about history and politics. That said, I sometimes felt that the reading was a little too much. The theoretical bits of the texts were usually interesting, but it was often hard to focus on the historical details, because I knew I could never learn enough about the particulars to form any kind of informed perspective on a subject. I feel like any serious discussion of history requires time to familiarise yourself with the details, and time is not something that DS allows you in abundance. The only thing that gives you an opportunity to delve into a decent amount of depth into the texts is writing essays, so even though they add to an already considerable workload, I think the essays are a strength of the programme. Then, of course, the seminars are a precious opportunity to compare your ideas on the texts with others', and look at them from a range of new angles.",
                "This course solidified a timeline from ancient Greece to imperial Rome for me, but medieval history was definitely overshadowed by the political thought during that era.",
                "I really could have used more historical context.",
                "I feel this course could be improved by a bit more top down teacher influence or consultation of secondary sources. Often times students left discussions with perhaps even more confusion and they started with do the complicated nature of these texts. I feel this course could be improved by a bit more top down teacher influence or consultation of secondary sources. Often times students left discussions with perhaps even more confusion and they started with due the complicated nature of these texts. While its to be expected by course dealing with the complicated texts of the humanities,  given that this course also styles itself as an introduction, I believe it would be productive to receive more concrete interpretations the students should aim for. I think having such as a baseline would actually allow for further intellectual development by giving students something concrete to interact with and jump off of.",
                "Weaknesses:\r\nNot enough discussion posts\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\nOpen classroom discussions\r\nExcellent guiding questions\r\nRespectful \r\nProgressive"

                "I would! I think it expanded my thinking and my approach to writing. Although I think I would only recommend this course to students who are truly passionate about the humanities and who would bring their energy and effort to discussions because I think you have a lot of freedom in the discussions and therefore you really get what you put into it.",
                "Yes!",
                "110% YES! I honestly don't know what I would've done if I didn't take DS this semester. The intensity of the scholarship and workload is made more fun with the sheer talent and sense of community fostered in the DS cohort. The books, the discussions, the lectures, the essays, the exams, the learning -- all were amazing.",
                "I would, but with the caveat that there is a lot of work and that many of the texts will not be read to completion. Directed Studies is a challenging and intellectually engaging program, but sometimes the work can feel unsatisfying because of how little attention we give to extremely important individual texts.",
                "Yes yes! DS as a course of three courses was wonderfully interesting and exciting. Specifically with regard to H&P, any particular student interested in political or historical, or politico-historical questions has an opportunity to go back to the beginning political philosophies and histories of the West, to dive into them in themselves and to relate them to one another in a spanning tradition. This course asks a student to ask real questions pertaining to their lives and the lives of others, and this is always invaluable.",
                "I would. I felt that this class gave me as deep an understanding of the many texts we read as it is possible to gain in one semester, and I enjoyed the discourse that it fostered. I would recommend this and the other DS courses to incoming students interested in the subject matter.",
                "Yes, I would, if youre prepared to put time and effort into the reading. DS as a whole is a course in which what you get out is what you put in. If youre willing to commit to it, and you think youll enjoy it, then by all means go for it, youll constantly be stimulated and engaged, if a little bogged down with reading.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to put their beliefs about history, politics, religion, and ideal social structures through the proverbial fire. That's what I most enjoyed about H&P, and that was the uphill battle I faced to grow through this course.",
                "It's an ok class, just know what to expect. \"Historical and political thought\" does not mean history or political science. You're studying historians, not history, and philosophers, not political science, so you might not necessarily love the class just because you like ancient history.",
                "Yes very much so.  I think this course uniquely more than the other two DS tracks helps to complement our understanding of the world around us and before us. Especially as a hopeful student of history\/political science, the text we consulted are in every sense the forefathers of these modern fields; engagement with them is a must.",
                "I most certainly would recommend this course to another student. The course was extremely engaging. The amount of knowledge one acquires is immense."
