                "Asynchronous components were often lengthy and seemingly-redundant. Besides that, the course was great.",
                "Strengths: synchronous\/asynchronous format, Frau Sippel and Herr Pal were really helpful and nice instructors. Weaknesses: Sometimes the assignments we had to do were a little tedious, or didn't seem super helpful for our learning. But mostly was pretty straightforward.",
                "The format of the course (3 synchronous days and 2 asynchronous days) works very well in my opinion as it gives a good balance of new material and time to practice. It is also helpful because it allows for some asynchronous days to be test days, and allows students to take the tests at a time and place that works for them. I think a little bit more time could be spent on pronunciation especially given the online format as it is much more difficult to pick up on pronunciation over a zoom call.",
                "This class was extremely well-taught and organized.  Its biggest strength is the pace - because it is so quick, you learn so much.",
                "The course was excellent and there's little room for improvement.",
                "This is an excellent class taught by excellent professors. The strengths lie in its frequency, meeting three times a week with work set for the two other days, and in its manageable class length (50 mins). The asynchronous days also allowed a lot of flexibility which was very helpful particularly for different time zones. The material covered was varied and interesting, and built upon itself through the semester. I felt a little bit like we learnt a lot more material in the last 3 weeks relative to earlier in the course, especially on the vocabulary side, which perhaps could have been spread through the semester a little bit more. Overall, the structure of the assessments was great and the teaching was phenomenal.",
                "The strengths were definitely the professors and their helpful feedback and corrections on all homework, asynchronous classwork, projects, and tests. However, the commitment to immersing students by only speaking German in class easily led to confusion at times. When new vocabulary was being introduced or German instructions for exercises were hard to understand, my participation and understanding in the course was much less had it been introduced in English."

                "I think the asynchronous\/ synchronous split was a huge strength. The extra flexibility it allowed made a huge difference. In addition, the online and virtual activities were generally well thought-out and executed. It was nice to end with an online video project that used all of the skills we had learnt over the semester!",
                "One of the course modifications because of COVID-19 was asynchronous classwork replacing traditional synchronous lectures on Tuesday and Thursday. However, at times, the asynchronous work was quite demanding and longer than the assigned 50 minutes of class. A better gauge as to how to create asynchronous lessons that would last approximately 50 minutes would've been very worthwhile."

I learnt a huge amount but didn't feel at any point like the workload was unmanageable, or that I didn't understand what we were learning \/ couldn't ask questions.",
