The course did start-off on a broader level, which helped me contextualize how all the arthropod groups relate to each other, where they are in the phylogeny, and how new research is helping us further understand their evolutionary histories. Then, we focused on various physiological traits of insects and spiders on a surface-level; no overwhelming biology. I think a major theme was the relationships between arthropods, like courtship, parenting, sociality, predation, parasitism, and everyday I learned something completely unbelievable!",

                "There were few assignments for this course - only three midterms (and the lowest could be dropped) and a final. Although it was nice having little work for this class, it might have been better if there was a little bit more opportunity to engage with the material.",
                "You get to learn about bugs! It is all super cool.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- interesting content\r\n- Professor Wells was always available and implemented feedback\r\n- interesting tests and fair grading\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- some of the readings didn't seem especially helpful (usually review)",
                "The strengths are that this course was extremely adaptable to students' needs throughout COVID. The lectures were offered in every possible format, and the grading of the course was structured in a way that benefited students. It was incredibly interesting, and the lectures were well structured.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the class is that maybe there could have been smaller assignments to gauge the learning of students more progressively. Because the only grading came from exams, students had to be motivated to learn the material on their own and set the pace for themselves. It was still very possible to do well this way, but smaller assignments could have helped set more clear checkpoints for learning.",
                "Aside from a few technical issues and a very dense few weeks of anatomical study, this course had no weaknesses. The exams were interesting and comprehensive, the lectures were energetic and captivating, and the readings were informative and supplemental: that is to say that they were useful to me as a bio major but not fully necessary for non-majors due to the wealth of information provided in the lectures.",
                "Strengths: manageable workload, recorded lectures, manageable exams\r\nWeaknesses: not the most interesting content for non-E&EB students",
                "Material is interesting and fun and Professor Wells is clearly passionate about the material. The tests are very well adapted to remote learning, and not too stressful. Highly recommend this course for people wanting to learn cool facts about creatures that are all around us but often escape our notice. One possible improvement: Prof. Wells does this for some lectures, but would be helpful to get a clearer outline of the information at the beginning of each lecture.",
                "Overall I thought it was a good course. I appreciated that the exams were open book in the pandemic because it made it far less stressful and stopped me from route memorization.",
                "Professor Wells is a huge draw to this course! She always includes multiple clips into the lectures to supplement the slides, and they're very interesting to watch, often comedic too. While she may get into fine details at times (because she is so passionate about the topic), she always emphasizes the big picture and makes sure that we understand the big points.",
                "Superb course; thank you for fighting to hold it in-person. What a treat during this virtual term! No weaknesses. The exams were very fair and open-note, so if you went to class and studied a little the day before, you'd be golden.",
                "Great course. AWESOME professor. No improvement necessary.",
                "Marta is wonderful!!! No weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Professor Wells is an excellent lecturer, she is very enthusiastic and knowledgable. Her slides are very well done and I really enjoyed the incorporation of videos. The lectures were very engaging and there is an excellent balance between the drier, baseline content, and fun and interesting examples and clips. I think the tests were fair, as was the grading.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: My only (minor) complaint is that sometimes Prof Wells goes through the slides really quickly, but overall I think it was my favorite science course at Yale.",
                "Its a gut, a great gut, just study at least a day before the tests!",

                "I loved this course. Marta is absolutely amazing. She did a wonderful job translating the course to an online format and her in person lectures were engaging. She allowed for open note exams which I believe is the biggest strength of the course. She really emphasized learning over grades and I feel like I learned so much- not only about arthropods, but also about key biological processes.",

                "Sometimes the lectures seemed a bit scattered in teaching, but in reviewing the lectures for exams they made more sense. In the lecture, it seemed like we jumped from topic to topic a lot at the beginning."

                "The way this course was formatted in response to the pandemic should serve as an example to any other lecture. Marta and the TA's were so incredibly understanding and adaptable to feedback from students. The lectures, slideshows, and readings were all available on Canvas in a prerecorded format, or you could watch them live. (both in person on campus or live on Canvas)\r\n\r\nExams were open book and open note, and students could pick 3 out of four questions to answer for the exams. Although these exams were open book and note, the questions were short essay responses, so you still had to incorporate your learning and not just write a simple book definition.",
                "I found the format's flexibility refreshing, as well as the exam process: having a droppable midterm as well as a midterm system more dependent on broad ideas and less on rote memorization was perfect for the pandemic and the fatigue it came with. As a virtual student, I found it still possible to interact with Dr. Wells, thanks to the helpful TFs, and genuinely looked forward to exams (as much as one can) because their contents were interesting yet comprehensive. The one downside was that the requested reading occasionally did not line up with the lecture, but that is a minor complaint. Overall, Dr. Wells did a great job in altering the expectations of this course to fit zoom fatigue, and I would wholeheartedly encourage learning from her in any circumstance.",
                "I loved the variety of options of learning that we could choose from. We could go in person, stay in our dorms, or watched them later if we had other preoccupations. It was extremely flexible and accessible for all students, and I'm glad that I was able to take advantages of these options.",
                "Prof. Wells adjusted the course to allow in person attendance as well as virtual learning. Recording the lectures was very helpful, and I appreciated that the in person component allowed students to retain some semblance of a normal school year. The only point of improvement is that though the audio in recorded lectures was mostly clear, the audio in person was a bit muffled\/quiet.",
                "Doing the mixed in-person and virtual was a good idea. I also liked the open book exams which were better suited to online learning and much more practical and feasible.",
                "The combination of a live virtual lecture that is recorded was a great format in the event that I could not make the usual lecture time. I also thought the open-book format to the midterms and finals were very helpful adjustments and made sense with the learning adjustment.",
                "I really appreciated the in-person lecture component; I truly looked forward to each class because of that. Though the cap for the lectures was 25, there were far fewer students than that all spread across a 200+ person lecture hall, so I felt very safe and was able to engage much more than if I were to have attended the Zoom sessions.",
                "Prof. Marta got the class as close to normal as she could. She taught lecture in-person (and recorded as well), and I appreciate her dedication to teaching because we understand that there could be no \"learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, which succeeded.\"",
                "The professor made sure to accommodate everyone.",
                "The online lectures were a little disengaging at times because it was hard to hear the professor, but there was nothing she could have done. It was just technological difficulties.",

Compared to other organismal courses in the EEB major, I would wager that this is likely one of the best. Don't let the ick factor of bugs push you away: there is so much complexity and beauty in their behavior and design that you will emerge with a deeper understanding and respect for arthropods.",
                "Yes I definitely would! I'm not a STEM major, so the content was very easy to understand and was quite interesting! The exams were manageable as well, and I overall had fun with the content. If you're looking for a science class that is not too overwhelming but is pretty interesting, I recommend this course!",
                "Absolutely. This is a great chill course (5th credit) that is as much as you want to make of it. Prof. Wells provides enough resources (papers, etc.) for people to really dive into the material if you want, but you certainly dont have to in order to succeed in this course.",
                "I would. The professor and the teaching staff were very nice, and I learned a lot of interesting things.",
                "This was a great SC credit! Professor Wells is a great instructor and really helpful when it comes to answering any questions and providing feedback. The workload was extremely manageable (especially with pandemic stress) and you really gain a lot of insight in a short period of time.",
                "Yes! It's a very \"Yale\" course in how niche it is. The workload is not bad at all (3 midterms + lowest score midterm dropped + final exam) and is one of those classes where the Professor's main goal is that you enjoy learning the content. The content was presented well and enjoyable, even when it came to studying.",
                "Yes, absolutely. I was blown-away everyday in class. The exams are fair and straight-forward if you take notes in class.",
                "Yes. So interesting. Will probably not get another chance to take a class like this.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in arthropods and want to learn more about them.",
                "If you need a science credit and\/or a gut thats also interesting, this is the class.",
                "Yes, definitely.",
                "Yes, take it as ur science gut! I dropped two science classes because I couldnt get an A but this one saved me!",
                "Absolutely take this class! It was so fun and the content is fascinating!",
                "YES YES YES. Marta is amazing and you will learn so much, even if you are not a STEM person.",
                "Yes!!!",
                "This was a very fun and informative science credit.",
                "Yes, the professor is very engaging in lectures and it is a great way to learn about something new in the world while also getting a science credit.",
                "Yes! It is interesting to engage in a new field of study, especially one about bugs, and Professor Wells is an expert on the topic."
