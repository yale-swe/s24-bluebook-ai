            "comments": [
                "The professor did not make the material accessible to all students. The nature of the class was extremely competitive, which was emphasized by the professor, which did not create a comfortable learning environment for students of all backgrounds. There was a lack of discussion on critical societal factors relating to cancer. The professor was not very accessible herself. Did not have much time to meet with students, even if you expressed that you were struggling mentally/academically. I was very disappointed by the lack of support for students with a fgli background. The final paper is graded in comparison to all students, which also highlights inequalities among students that are attending this school. Usually, Yale is a place that really emphasizes creating a safe space for learning for all types of students, but this class really only rewarded students that had very sophisticated etiquette and a lot of experience in the stem world, which is not the case for many fgli students.",
                "Strengths: The content is interesting, and we covered a lot. Lectures are generally engaging and well organized. I really enjoyed the structure of having three non-cumulative exams. Discussion sections felt relevant and helpful. Weaknesses: The course organization is very odd- there are two midterms until the last two weeks of the semester, when you have a presentation, paper, and exam due within days of each other. The final paper felt like an afterthought, we weren't given a rubric or expectations and were not allowed to discuss it with the TAs, which felt unnecessary.",
                "strengths - super organized, each week had an insightful & relevant topic to cancer biology. discussion section papers were great, learned a lot!\r\nweaknesses - i thought that the final requirements consisting of a presentation, paper, and an exam was a bit excessive / a lot of workload for the end of the semester. perhaps it would have been better to stagger them over time.",
                "Strengths: Amazing lectures and TAs. Nadya is an excellent professor that answers questions and explains concepts thoroughly.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Probably more practice problems would be helpful for students. Additionally, nearing the end of the term, it was quite a lot to have a third midterm, final presentation, and final paper. Perhaps one of those three could be removed in the future as it was quite stressful to complete all three of those.",
                "The lectures are very clear and the content is very interesting.",
                "strength: very broad and comprehensive overview of cancer biology and current treatment options\r\n\r\nweakness: sometimes concepts were not explained very clearly or the powerpoint slides were not great at representing the concept. The amount of work was very unbalanced and loaded at the end instead of throughout the semester.",
                "The course overall was organized well. I enjoyed reading a paper a week for section and thought my TA did a great job leading discussion of these papers. The exams were a bit confusing. Before the first exam, we had no preparation for the type of questions that would be asked on the exam except the practice exam. We gradually got more used to the type of questions asked on midterms as we had three of them.",
                "Weaknesses: very back-loaded class in terms of assignments, but during the year it was very manageable, feedback on assignments was not always great \r\n\r\nStrengths: very manageable, interesting material",
                "Strengths include interesting lecture topics, a final project, and weekly section.",
                "Overall, this was a well-paced course in terms of content. The workload was very manageable the tests were fair. I would have liked a bit more example/practice problems in preparation for the exams, especially for the last exam. Additionally, most of the workload felt like it was placed towards the end of the term and could potentially be spread out a little more.",
                "The strength is the focus on aspects over minute details. Cancer knowledge changes at a rapid pace, so rather than learning details that may not apply in the future, the course focuses on understanding the basic building blocks.",
                "Great discussion, lots of good questions and student participation. Lectures were very well put together. Readings were well selected to coincide with topics we discussed in lecture and go beyond the scope of some of the in class material.",
                "Strength- engaging content \r\nWeaknesses - very little detail",
                "The course material was presented very clearly, and the papers selected for discussion were helpful in solidifying lecture material. The course didn't have any kind of weekly assignments, though, so it was important to study material independently before and after lectures. Also, although practice exams were made available, the difficulty and grading of exam questions was sometimes unexpected.",
                "Professor is amazing!",
                "This course had very little work outside of exams, which could be both a pro or a con, dependent on the student. I really struggled to perform on the exams, which, since there was no cushion from homework, there was put a lot of pressure on the final project, just to get an A- or a B+.\r\n\r\nFeedback was also quite vague, as no grades were posted to Canvas throughout the semester and corrected answers were not usually written on the exams when they were returned to us. I really had no idea how I was doing in the course until about a week before the Credit/D deadline.",
                "Strengths - small lecture/leminar format (could ask questions in class), exams emphasized critical thinking over rote memorization, final project consisted of group presentation and grant proposal which were a lot of fun (and you learn a lot!!), lecture slides were more visual/focused on graphics and images over wordiness (which to me can be distracting in class) \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - it was often assumed that we would understand how to interpret images of tissue sections despite having limited knowledge of pathology; sections, while low-stress, could have been better structured to facilitate student participation",
                "The workload is very manageable during the semester but then everything really piles up at the end when you have a presentation, a paper and an exam. The exams were quite frustrating as they questions were very vague but the responses theyre looking for are super specific so even if you explain something correctly but its not exactly what they want, youre wrong. This is very frustrating as the exams dont seem to accurately represent what you know. \r\nThe class size is relatively small which is nice and the TAs are very approachable and helpful.",
                "I really like how this course is taught. It's not quite a leminar (lecture/seminar), but Professor Dimitrova does encourage student participation throughout each class which I appreciate. This format definitely helps to encourage engagement in the class and also is very beneficial to students' learning and understanding of the material.",
                "Strength: I really liked the lectures  Nadya presents content clearly and stops for questions when they arise. I also liked the exam format: they emphasized logic and critical thinking (I.e: application of course material) over memorization. Weaknesses: Nadya gave us very little information about the final project and then refused to answer any questions about it. I found this to be stressful and unprofessional. Also lectures were not recorded :(",
                "the test questions were not that great and the grading was weird. but the professor is very sweet, TFs and discussion sections were engaging and the final project is fun",
                "Strengths: interesting, engaging lectures; well-organized and engaging discussion sections; fair exams that emphasize scientific thinking over rote memorization. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: honestly none.",
                "Strengths: professor and TAs were very thoughtful and informative, lectures were interesting yet challenging. Weaknesses: some questions on the exams seemed a bit weird given what we had learned in the lectures, but nothing was too crazy.",
                "A strength of the course is the material; cancer biology is a hot topic that is advancing extremely quickly, making this a really amazing course to take in college. One weakness of the class was the lectures; they often felt disjointed, and it was hard to know what Professor Dimitrova thought was most important (aka what would show up on an exam). It often felt a little unorganized and the final project was a large time commitment, including a presentation, six page single-spaced report, and an exam."

                "I recommend taking this course only if you are extremely well-versed in cancer biology. There is not much support for students who may be new to the cancer biology world. If you want to be in a high cutthroat competitive class, then go ahead.",
                "Yes, this is a rare MCDB gut. If you have taken the prerequisites, you will very easily pick up the course content because you already know the underlying concepts and just have to apply them to cancer. If you haven't, you'll have a harder time.",
                "yes! this class is a great introduction to cancer biology & fleshes out ideas that you may already have about cancer. it really is \"clinic-focused\" in the sense that you will constantly think about how treatments and cancer processes take place in real life & what the best way to treat it is (e.g. keeping in mind side effects)",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The class is very well taught and the material is at the advanced undergraduate level.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student.",
                "Overall, this is a pretty chill class so if you are an MCDB major, this class functions well as an elective. However, the amount of work that cumulates at the end of the year makes this class challenging. There is a final presentation, paper, and exam, which is a bit excessive just for a single class. But if this doesn't bother you, or if you have other classes that have pretty light finals, this could be an overall light courseload mcdb elective.",
                "I would, especially if you're interested in cancer biology. Just note that this course is more a broad overview of the mechanisms of cancer rather than diving very deep into specific mechanisms.",
                "Yes, Professor Dimitrova is very knowledgeable about the material and the final presentation and paper allow you to dive into a topic of interest.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I thought that the material was well-presented such that you only needed a very basic understanding of cellular mechanisms to understand most of the content. If you have any interest at all in cancer, I would say go ahead and take this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in cancer, or even medicine in general since it is so ubiquitous and prevalent.",
                "Yes, it was a great lecture course, not too big. I learned a lot and really enjoyed the material. Lectures were very engaging.",
                "Its a solid elective class for those interested in cancer, though I wish wed gone into more detail in every unit we did.",
                "Yes",
                "Heres the deal with this course: if you have actual experience with cancer biology (i.e. took Dean Changs Cancer course or do cancer research) this course will be a BREEZE. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, if youre an amazing test taker, youll probably also find this class an incredibly easy A.\r\n\r\nIf you dont, get ready for a bumpy ride. 60% of the grade is exams, which doesnt seem like a lot, but if you botch one, theres really no way to recover, especially because so many people do so well, setting the curve very high. While Im glad I took this course because I did learn a lot and it was helpful understanding the new research I started this semester, I definitely felt at an obvious disadvantage to a lot of my classmates.\r\n\r\nMoral of the story: be honest with yourself when you enroll in this course which of these students you are. If youre not confident in your ability to succeed, consider waiting until your senior year to take it.",
                "Definitely! You learn how to critically engage with patient outcomes on exams and come up with solutions in cancer prevention and therapy! The course overall emphasizes how to think like an oncologist or cancer researcher rather than just memorizing facts about cancer which was great!",
                "Its interesting to learn about the hallmarks of cancer but the vagueness of the exams is really demoralizing when you study so much and actually know your stuff but get marked off for not having specific enough responses to vague questions. The primary literature is interesting and overall its a decent low workload course for MCDB.",
                "Yes! I loved this course. The material of the class is very interesting and it makes a great addition to any course schedule. I wouldn't say the course is a gut, as you do need to definitely put effort into studying, but it isn't a super time-intensive class. There is no homework outside of textbook readings for each lecture and a peer-reviewed article for section which is held weekly. The exams require studying, but they are fair and not designed to be incredibly difficult. In addition to all of that, the class material truly is incredibly interesting and allows you to further study the dynamics of cancer from a molecular standpoint.",
                "Yes! If you have any interest in cancer biology, this class gives you a very helpful survey of the most foundational topics. I had previous cancer research experience going in  so I thought I would know most course content  but I learned so much every class (with the exception of lectures 1-4). Nadya is a great lecturer and a kind person. Do be warned: I found this class tough grade-wise. As I write this course evaluation, I dont know what grade to expect",
                "yes, pretty light and engaging class. def take if you are even tangentially interested in cancer biology",
                "Absolutely! This is my favorite class in the MCDB major and at Yale. Professor Dimitrova is a wonderful, engaging professor who is extremely knowledgeable on the subject but also not afraid to admit when she doesn't know something. Her teaching style facilitates student-led discussions and answers, which promotes learning for everyone. Her exams are unlike most science courses in that they require essentially no memorization and instead require you to think critically about the material. It will take some getting used to but everyone in my class adjusted once we knew what to expect. Discussion sections are mandatory but actually great, my TA (Jonathan) was amazing and they supplemented the lecture material quite nicely while giving you a weekly opportunity to improve on journal article literacy.",
                "Yes. It was a great MCDB course.",
                "Yes, I would. I took it as a fun course, but it could also be used to fulfill major requirements for MCDB. I think it is a helpful class for all pre-med/healthcare students as it is something that we will have experience with at some point in life, whether personally or professionally, and it is important to be prepared."
