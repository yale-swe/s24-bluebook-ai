    "I came into this class knowing absolutely nothing about film or film techniques, or even about Hollywood, and to be honest, I took this class because there were different modes of writing that I'd be able to learn (long form essays, representational analyses, and interviews). This class improved my writing skills, but more importantly sparked an interest in the film industry and entertainment.",
    "I learned a survey of information about the Classical Hollywood era and about outstanding films, actors, directors, and writers during the time, and how films influence the world.",
    "I learned about the history of the classical Hollywood era.",
    "This was my first ever time taking a film course, and I am so glad that I did. I learnt so much about film which I had previously been completely oblivious to. Every movie is an art of careful and agonizing labour. The costumes, the lighting, the props, the music, the setting, and the words the characters speak. My moviegoing experience has completely changed thanks to this course. I am a lot more appreciative of every little detail in the film, and even more appreciative of those who work behind the scenes. The writers who craft clever and distinct dialogue and the directors who leads the movie are the real stars of the movie and it took taking this course for me to realize it.",
    "This course has forever changed the way I think about film. Instead of being a passive observer, I'm now fully engaged in films, analyzing them for more than basic plot points.",
    "So much knowledge about the making of movies and the movie industry.",
    "This class taught me a great deal about the classical era of Hollywood, and broadened my understanding of film as a medium for storytelling. I was able to improve my writing by practicing it in a variety of styles over the course of the semester.",
    "I gained a new found love for film from this class! Tbh, I wasn't that big of a movie guy prior to taking this class but I shopped it anyways because I heard that Camille is phenomenal. After taking this class, my outlook on movies has completely changed! This semester, I learned so much about the different film genres including westerns, noirs, thrillers, and silent film comedies and about the history and controversies surrounding them.",
    "Garnered a new appreciation to films from a perspective of art and business",
    "I learned about the history of Hollywood films, the writers, decades, and actors that made them and the historical context.",
    "Learned a lot more about classical Hollywood films from 1920-1960, and definitely developed a greater appreciation from them - they are pretty entertaining",
    "A deeper appreciation for film tropes and themes",
    "This class transformed my relationship with cinema and invigorated a fascination with classical Hollywood film, imbuing me with an appreciation for craft, screenwriting, and visual storytelling. My experience with films -- especially classical era films, but newer ones as well -- has been greatly enhanced through this course.",
    "New appreciation for movies in general, especially old movies which I didn't enjoy much before.",
    "New appreciation for movies in general, especially old movies which I didn't enjoy much before.",
    "learned to be a more active and critical film watcher. also learned about early film \/ studio \/ actor history",
    "We watched 13 films from the Classical Hollywood era and discussed them in terms of their narrative as well as their production, their historical situation, and the social implications of each film. I learned so much not only about film, but about American history and how the past influences the present. I feel like I can look at art through a more critical lens and appreciate movies not just as entertainment, but as art.",
    "I had never seen a film from before 1960 before this course.  Through this course, I learned not only about films from the classical period of Hollywood, but even more about the history of the film industry as it tied to events in the US and the world.",
    "I gained an insight into and level of engagement with film that I had never experienced before. The classical Hollywood narrative is one of the most interesting topics that I've ever learned about and my love for film has increased tenfold.",
    "I have learned so much about the history of filmmaking, how to pick apart a scene, and the importance of each and every person involved (will always look for the screenwriter from now on!)",
    "This class was not what I expected at first, I never imagined taking a film class in college. But this course opened my eyes to the techniques used in films and also the importance behind every cast member producing the film. In addition, the historical background behind the Classical Hollywood Era proves to  be useful knowledge for the production of modern films today. This is a perfect class for anyone interested in film and media studies.",
    "I learned how to appreciate material for what it offers rather than what I want to gain from it.",
    "Learned about the history of Hollywood film and a bunch of really good (and pretty bad) movies. My writing didn't really improve, I wrote two papers and the feedback was fine but it didn't change my life. If you're interested in understanding a bit more about the power structures and struggles of early Hollywood (and watch some classic movies along the way) then this is the class for you.",
    "I developed a good understanding of broad patterns and themes observed in Hollywood films from 1920 to 1960. I also learnt the basics of film analysis.",

    "I learned how to critically analyze film, and I learned about Hollywood film history.",
    "I've always loved films but did not know how to study them academically. This course taught me to look closer at scenes and how to put these insights into coherent writing.",
    "This class taught me how to see and watch filmbefore the class I had absolutely no experience with critical film viewing, but the lectures and weekly film diaries helped me develop this skill.",
    "I learned about American culture and how it was both reflected in and influenced by movies.",
    "How to better write analysis papers on movies. Understanding how film was evolved through the begging to the end of the classical era.",
    "Everything from analyzing film to writing skills to just finding a new appreciation for not just film but also amazing teaching.",
    "Professor Thomasson takes you through the entire history of classical film and you learn how to be a film analyst. Writing for film is very different but this course helps you develop that skill pretty well.",
    "Knowledge of the beginnings of the American film system, how to analyze and think deeply about films",
    "I learned so much about the history of Hollywood cinema, about specific artists, composers, actors, studio heads, etc. that built, sustained, and often threatened to destroy the industry, and of course I watched some of the greatest old Hollywood films of all time. I deepened my understanding of how to write a film analysis\/research paper, as well as how to engage with film through discussion and creative projects.",
    "I learned how to critically analyze films from this class",
    "learned a lot about Hollywood in the 1900s and the film industry",
    "Great lectures, changed the way I see movies and Hollywood and honestly the way I see the world. Seriously great class!",
    "This is a fantastic course that covers everything from the classical Hollywood era and offers insight into the life behind the scenes of the actors, directors, screenwriters, and studios of the period as well as the politics that surrounded them.",

    "I learned about many famous actors, writers, directors, etc. of the Hollywood era and how Hollywood films developed through the 20th century.",
    "The class provided such a brilliant survey of the classical Hollywood era. I learned about so many key figures, events, and other facets. Because of the guidance and the support of Professor Thomasson and my teaching fellow, I now feel so much more comfortable reading and dissecting a film. I also learned to appreciate all those that have a hand in creating a film, not just the director and main actors. I really came out of the course with so much knowledge!",
    "This course was one of the most engaging courses I have taken at Yale. Camille's lectures were incredibly informative and enjoyable, and I looked forward to going to lecture each week. I learned so much about Classical Hollywood, and I had fun. I learned how to truly watch films, and I learned to always appreciate the writer.",
    "I learned to watch film critically, as well as how to consider it in the context of film history.",
    "Complete knowledge of the Classical Era. Ability to write a complex film analysis.",
    "A newfound appreciation for the Classical era of Hollywood and a new way to watch a movie. I loved each and every movie we watched. I believe my writing improved and I felt like my voice in my writing was able to develop.",
    "I got a broad survey of classical Hollywood and learned how to watch, think about, and write about films critically and analytically.",
    "You will learn so much about the classical era in this course.  The choice of films is amazing and even if you are not super engaged you passively will learn so much from attending lecture.  You will also learn what it means to have a professor who actually knows how to deliver an engaging lecture.  Everything is incredibly organized and you will gain new insights into film as a medium for expression.",
    "I learned about the history of Hollywood, how events and happenings of the time influenced the films developed in the classical era, and how every aspect of that era permeates the industry even today.",
    "We learned about the history of Classical Hollywood and looked deeply into some great films",
    "FILM 232 exposes you to a great collection of seminal works from the Classical Hollywood Era. The class also informs you on the context in which these films were produced. The course lectures are primarily focused on history, rather than any technical aspects of film criticism.",
    "Lots about classic films and how to write about films",
    "I learned how to critically analyze films from the classical Hollywood era and better appreciate how historical and societal context affects films of all types. Furthermore, I was able to effectively develop essay arguments taking a stance about films whether it was regarding the significance of their themes or their use of cinematic techniques to emphasize certain ideas.",
    "I learned to appreciate the work that goes into making films and the many layers of politics within the film industry.",
    "Comprehensive overview of Hollywood history and all the drama and grandeur that came with it. Film analysis, critique",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "No weaknesses at all. The strengths? Everything! :) Watching films was something I looked forward to every Tuesday evening, and I received clear and constructive feedback on my writing.",
    "Professor Thomasson is an excellent lecturer and the contents she teaches are very engaging and informative.",
    "Strengths:\r\nExpectations for writing assignments are clearly communicated\r\nCourse is structured in a logical, well thought out format\r\nLectures are extremely entertaining and engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nLecture information does not directly match that of what the essays are on.",
    "Strengths: The lecture setting  allows for in depth learning about Hollywood during its classical era and the weekly section then provides space for a more detailed observations of the movies we watched every Tuesday. Having weekly mandatory screenings was wonderful. Never before have I seen a movie with such an animated and engaged crowd. The course is structured in a way that welcome and teachers beginners and veterans with the same passion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none - so far the course I have take at Yale for which I would say this.",
    "Honestly there aren't any weaknesses to this course. It was so engaging and fun, but at the same time one of the courses that has taught me the most. The workload seems obsolete because assignments are so enjoyable.",
    "It's honestly perfect as is. The workload is 'just right', and I love the straightforward expectations for every assignment.",
    "The strength of this course lies completely in Professor Thomasson. Her passion in teaching the course radiated through every student. The weekly screenings and sections were also very enriching.",
    "The lectures are FANTASTIC. Camille is one of those professors who thoughtfully writes out a script and as a result, the lectures flow so naturally. The movies themselves are also a huge strength. I liked 12\/13 of them and because of that, I always looked forward to the weekly screenings.\r\nBut honestly, Camille is the biggest strength herself. She holds so many office hours and always has coffee and cake ready for you. She's also extremely accommodate and willing to help you if you're stuck on one of the papers.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that could be improved are the sections. While I enjoyed mine, I wish we had spent more time earlier on discussing the finer details of the movies.",
    "Strengths: interesting topics discussed\r\nWeaknesses: not much feedback on works",
    "Strengths - the films are great, Prof. Thomasson is very nice and seems to really care about her students\r\nWeaknesses - having to write a single spaced one page diary response to each movie every week can start to get a little tedious",
    "The course could use a little more film analysis - right now, it feels more like a history course.",
    "Camille's voice was blessed by the angels",
    "This is one of the best courses I have ever taken, and I feel so grateful to have been a part of Classical Hollywood Narrative and to have learned from Camille Thomasson. Every single Camille Thomasson lecture is absolutely flawless and perfectly crafted. She sparked an ongoing, genuine interest in the subject matter, which is exactly what I hoped for in a just-for-fun-and-intellectual-growth class completely unrelated to my major. The writing assignments allow you to forge your own connection with the material, and I thoroughly enjoyed the mandatory film screenings -- I thought that the selection of films was quite good, especially in the latter half of the semester. I can't think of any ways this course could be improved.",
    "Strengths: professor is passionate and kind \r\nWeaknesses: section",
    "Strengths: professor is passionate and kind \r\nWeaknesses: section",
    "Outstanding course. Truly one of the most magical, wonderful, interesting, educational, and valuable courses I've taken at Yale. Camille is wonderful (go to her office hours, she makes you tea in her apartment) and inspiring. all of the assignments were meaningful !!!!",
    "Strengths: All of it was amazing!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None, except I would have enjoyed more free and open discussion in section (this isn't a problem with the class, more an issue with conflicting interests of the students in my section).",
    "The lecture for the course is the most engaging of all the courses I've taken thus far at Yale.  Through the lectures, we delved into film studies through a historical lens, which allowed us to draw connections between the films we studied.  The written assignments for the course supplemented the material covered in lecture, as we got to ponder our own questions and ideas about the films seen in class.  In the case of the midterm and final papers, we could even select a film outside the syllabus if we had any special interest.\r\n\r\nI greatly enjoyed the creative writing bonus assignment for Sunset Boulevard.  Sometimes I had difficulty writing the film diaries, and I wonder if, in addition to providing prompt ideas for the latter half of films in the class, we could also have the option to do similar creative fanfiction stories rather than writing the traditional film diary.",
    "this class is low pressure (no exams, not a lot of work outside of class) which makes it actually enjoyable",
    "There are no weaknesses. The professors, TFs, and course design are phenomenal. If you like watching movies, then you're gonna love this class that's it.",
    "Strengths: highly engaging, Professor Thomasson cares so much about her students. Covered lots of material over a relatively short period of time. Learned through writing rather than rote memorization.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
    "This course was amazing. It was one of my favorites I've ever taken at Yale. The course's greatest strengths are that the material taught is incredibly interesting and the professor is extremely dedicated to her students. Students will walk away with a greater appreciation of America's first great films and the experience of learning from a talented professor. No complaints.",
    "The strength of this class was the amazing lectures that Professor Thomasson gave! They were excellent and very good for participation purposes, in addition to the Tuesday screenings of amazing films. She allowed us to send in drafts of our papers for feedback, which helped a lot, and there are no weaknesses to this course.",
    "Strength is that the class is centered around watching classic movies. I think that it's weak in that the papers kind of ask you to write about film theory and analyze the films you've watched, and I think it should be made clear that this class does not give you the tools to do that. It totally gives you the tools to write a film history paper, but too many of the examples encourage the students to analyze the films even though they haven't been taught how. Would be better if the assignments were more linked to lecture and you were encouraged more to write film history papers (what the class is about) rather than film theory papers. If you have the skills to write a film analysis paper already, then good for you, but this course asks you to do so without teaching you how.",
    "I thought it was very well structured and each lecture was engaging. I don't think it had any weaknesses.",
    "This course had no weaknesses, and I thought that Professor Thomasson was absolutely the best professor to teach it.  I only wish that she posted the slides online (or at least a document that provided the same facts as in class) because it was impossible to capture all of the facts live.",
    "Great course! Of course, the greatest strength is Professor Thomasson, who can call on people by name and truly values student engagement and improvement.",
    "The strengths of this film start and end with Camille. She is such an incredible woman: the amount of thought, care, and knowledge she imparts to this class and to her students is unmatched.",
    "The professors and TFs are fantastic in this course. There are a lot of class hours since there is lecture, a section, and a weekly movie screening. It never felt like these hours were wasted. The course could be improved by allowing more alternate screening times for the Tuesday night movies.",
    "This course was perfect. I would have liked to see a sample paper to understand what a film paper should look like and how analysis on a film should look. We were given articles on how to write them but I wanted more than those because I feel that I didn't get enough out of those. I understand that it is a concern to give a paper out because then all the submissions may mirror that paper entirely but then just more explanation on how to analyze films and write about it. More example thesis statements and topics would be good too. As for the class, it was great. Fun lectures and screenings. Helpful sections.",
    "It's perfect. It is what every course should be like.",
    "Professor Thomasson's engagement with her class surpasses every single expectation. I hope that more professors taught like her. She's amazing.",
    "The only weakness was that there was so much to talk about that we often ran out of or went over time in section. Otherwise this is an amazing course, with an amazing teacher and teaching staff where you will learn so much (especially if you do not have much experience with old films).",
    "Strengths: This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale, hands down. The class is immensely accessible yet rigorous enough that you feel constantly engaged in the material. The projects are some of the most engaging and enjoyable assignments I have ever taken part of in a class, ever. Moreover, the lectures are so fun yet interesting, and you always leave feeling like you have learned quite a bit. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
    "No weaknesses. Only strengths.",
    "Strengths were the films and discussion of the films. I would have liked a bit more feedback and clarity about the papers for the class",
    "I looked forward to attending this course every lecture. It is fun, well taught, and has made me far more engaged with films I watch. Professor Thomasson is the best professor, and truly cares about her students. She made the course truly exceptional.",
    "This class was amazing, especially lectures, the Movie Memory project is really great and the film journals were a good way to engage with what we were doing. I think we could have gotten some more help with the midterm and final papers. Maybe it would be a good idea to make a first draft mandatory for both. Also, because the journal entries pile up, maybe it would be good to have them due four at a time throughout the course of the semester, instead of all at once at the end. I also think that sections could have been better, as they sometimes felt like time fillers or that they were irrelevant to lectures.",
    "The lectures are super interesting, and Professor Thomasson chose some of the best movies from each decade for the class to watch.",
    "The Canvas website was harder to navigate than most of my other classes.\r\n\r\nGood TFs and kind teacher",
    "The class was very well taught, and every lecture was engaging and insightful.",
    "This course is my favorite class I've ever taken. A big strength is how much feedback I was able to get from the teacher and my TF.",
    "This course is just so wonderful. Its  like a warm hug. I learned a lot and got to watch a lot of great films. My only critique is that having the slides available to students would help in being able to review important Hollywood figures for jeopardy etc. Im not one who is able to remember a name the first time I see it so I need a list to study in order to absorb.",
    "There were so many strengths including the high level of engagement that Professor Thomasson has with every one of her students. I am so grateful to have crossed paths with her! In every lecture, her passion was so clear and she cared\/cares so deeply about our development as writers and thinkers. The lectures were all so riveting and I never lost interest. The selection of movies was absolutely incredible and Professor Thomasson and my teaching fellow brilliantly walked us through each one. I honestly can't think of a weakness.",
    "Camille's lectures were wonderful, engaging, and theatrical. Sometimes, the level of engagement in section didn't match that of lecture. Perhaps there could be more continuity across TFs during section, but overall a wonderful course.",
    "Strengths: Amazing professor, amazing TFs, amazing content. Great feedback, effective learning strategies, and flexible essay topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
    "Very interesting material, great professor and TFs, work is made approachable and interesting.",
    "The professor makes this class. Her love for the material is contagious.",
    "The film selection is wonderful and the lectures are engaging and interesting. I would not change anything about the course.",
    "No weaknesses, this course is absolutely phenomenal.",
    "This is an incredible class. Professor Thomasson is an amazing lecturer, the close analysis of films was entertaining as well.",
    "Strengths: Camille is an incredibly engaging lecturer, the topic of the course is super interesting, all of the films are amazing, the lecture + section complement each other very well, lots of feedback on writing\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
    "Honestly, there are no weaknesses. This class was the best taught class I have ever taken in my life and it should be required to graduate--or at least it should be required to have a class with Professor Thomasson before you graduate.",
    "The main weakness of the course was that there seemed to be a lack in focus about techniques when approaching writing about films. In our papers we were meant to mainly discuss films through the lens of narrative, characters, and themes. These are all important aspects of a film, but I wish that the course had also equipped us better with the language and technique through which we could better analyze the technical aspects of these films.",
    "strengths are the screenings and diaries weaknesses are lack of focus on how to do film writing",
    "This course excelled in providing a foundation for developing meaningful film criticism and simply enhancing the students appreciation of film as a medium of art. A weakness of this course was that some times the required film journals felt a bit tedious as a means of recording our response tO every film presented during class. Perhaps a greater diversity in weekly assignments would help the course stay as engaging as possible.",
    "The class was well organized. Lectures were engaging and section was always on-topic and interesting.",
    "The best course I've taken at Yale. I learned so much from the professor and the TF's. Such an educational and enjoyable course."

    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course to another student. Professor Thomasson is a master lecturer. The films are engaging, both on an intellectual level, and on the level of entertainment. This was the only class where I looked forward to every lecture. I enjoyed myself throughout the whole course, and I left having learned a lot along the way.",
    "100% please take this class. This is one of the gems here at Yale, and although the first film might seem rather tedious\/long, you won't regret it at all. I came into this class without a film background (or a humanities background, to be honest) and left this class with such a larger appreciation for learning about the film\/entertainment space.",
    "Yes, it is a very entertaining course and you get to watch outstanding 13 Hollywood Classical films over the course of the semester.",
    "Absolutely. No matter what your major or previous engagement with Film, everyone who has an interest in film - whether watching movies or wanting to be part of the creative process - should take this course. It is a fun and enlightening experience that will increase your love for cinema.",
    "Absolutely. If I had to recommend one course out of the 15 I've taken at Yale so far, this would be it.",
    "Would definitely recommend this class. One of the best I've taken at Yale, and while the work is never really 'difficult', there is sometimes a lot of it. Not really a gut if that's what you're looking for.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to another student -- it is one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale so far! Professor Thomasson is an incredible lecturer and she is deeply passionate about the course material. I came to look forward to each class just to be able to hear Professor Thomasson speak about film and storytelling. Her passion is inspiring! If you can get into this class, don't hesitate in taking it. I will miss you Professor Thomasson!",
    "Absolutely. This class has been one of the best I've ever taken at Yale. It could be partially because I'm a STEM major and am low key jaded towards the bulk of my classes, BUT this class was such a refreshing thing. The lectures and movies are generally engaging and the two papers are manageable. Because we have the freedom to write about films\/directors\/actors\/etc. that appeal to us, I honestly had fun writing the midterm and final paper. \r\nI would urge everyone to shop this class and sit through the first movie because this class really is a gem and IMO, one of the better options one can pursue for the WR credit. If anything, shop it to meet Camille because she is fantastic.",
    "Yes, very interesting, teaches you to see films differently",
    "This is honestly the BEST class that I have ever taken at Yale. Professor Thomasson is so engaging, knowledgable, dedicated, and kind, and she really makes the class feel like a seminar (she knows everyone's name and reads everyone's essays) even though it's 100+ kids. The films we watched in class were all very enjoyable, and coming from someone with no background in Hollywood film, I came out of this class feeling so much more #cultured and with a newfound love for films. Take this class plz it I'm not even doing it justice.",
    "Yes, this class was one of my favorites at Yale. Professor Thomasson is absolutely incredible she cares deeply about every single one of her students and the class is so engaging. There is a good amount of writing, but it is interesting to write about movies and changed the way I watch movies.",
    "I would recommend, especially if you don't know much about classical hollywood films, because it is a whole huge thing, and you are missing out if you don't have any of this cultural knowledge",
    "It's a great class if you're interested in watching classical films and learning more about the history of Hollywood. Prof. Thomasson is engaging and really cares about the class. If you're looking to closely analyze and engage critically with films, however, this probably isn't the right course for you.",
    "Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh",
    "Yes, wholeheartedly! I would recommend this course to absolutely anyone. This should be on any Yale student's course bucket list. One of my favorite classes I've ever taken and I'm genuinely sad that it is over. Camille Thomasson is a wonderful professor (and a fantastic person as well), and I can't imagine taking a class with her and not being totally sold on the material.",
    "Yes absolutely",
    "Yes absolutely",
    "Absolutely. Outstanding course that taught me to look at elements of film-making I had never known to consider before.",
    "YES, YES, and YES. This is my favorite class I have ever taken at Yale. Going to lecture felt less like going to class, and more like going to a TED talk about film. In other words, this class is legitimately fun. This isn't to say the course isn't challenging-- it is challenging, in the best way. If you lean into it as much as I did, you will feel inspired to think deep about themes, narrative structure, as well as important historical and social implications certain films and the film industry. The weekly film screenings are honestly a treat. Sitting down to watch a film in a movie theater style auditorium every Tuesday night was a wonderful break from the rest of Yale. Also, we are encouraged to write about whatever we want for our papers, making for a joyous writing experience. I cannot praise Professor Thomasson enough. She cares more about her students than any other Yale professor I've ever encountered. She is extremely knowledgable and each of her lectures are performed like a beautifully crafted yet personal essay.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to all others students who enjoy writing!  It was a very valuable part of my Yale education as a STEM student to take a humanities course with content that was very accessible to me.",
    "yes !!! watching movies every week is really great, and although it might seem like this class is a lot of time commitment (class, section, and screenings), the lack of homework or exams balances out, the essays are enjoyable because they are about any film topic you are interested in, its really nice to just enjoy a lecture without pressure of taking intense notes",
    "Absolutely. Like, 100000%. This has been the best course I've taken at Yale in 3 years. Everything is geared towards helping you explore the world of film in the classical Hollywood age, and you have the most inspiring and interesting guides in the world. It's a moderate amount of writing, so just be ready to do the work, but its worth it.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, absolutely. The class is genuinely enjoyable and Professor Thomasson is fantastic. She cares more about her students than any other professor I've ever had. She was always available to help whenever I had questions or concerns about my work, and her office hours felt like a reprieve from the stress of day-to-day life. I would take the class for her alone.",
    "Definitely take this course if you have the chance. She is an absolutely amazing professor and I hope she teaches it again. Every lecture is engaging and fun, especially the film clips from different movies. The movies are really good, even if you don't like old films from 1930-1960.",
    "This is a super fun class; the films were amazing and a great break from other more tedious work. Camille is a wonderful professor and cares a ton about her students.",
    "If you want to watch good movies and get a decent grade, then yes! But if you want to really learn about how films are made and how to analyze them, no. This is a film history class, and so expect a fairly easy history class on an interesting subject, but you're not going to come out a film maker, or any closer to being one. Fine for a Credit\/D or as a GUT.",
    "Yes definitely, you will learn some interesting topics that are not usually discussed, and the class is really fun.",
    "Best course I've taken.",
    "I would highly recommend this course because of the sheer amount of knowledge that Professor Thomasson was able to teach the class.",
    "Yes! A great course taught by one of, if not, ~the~ best professor I have had at Yale. I thought the Tuesday night screenings would be a huge burden on my studying schedule, but they turned out to be one of my favorite times of the week. You are forced to do something fun for two hours and you can still feel productive because it's for a class. The final paper allows you to explore anything related to the course that you find fascinating, which made it an enjoyable process. Loved it!",
    "Yes!!",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because it teaches you how to evaluate art, specifically film, very effectively.",
    "This is a must take class at Yale. I categorize classes into 5 categories. Must take, should take, indifferent take, don't take, and Nah fam not a chance. This class is definitely a must if not its own better than must category. The class is so much fun. You watch amazing movies and learn about the era in which they were created. The professor and TFs really care about you and want you to learn. After getting back my first essay, I thought I bombed it because there were so many comments on the paper critiquing a ton of things. But my grade actually turned out to be much much better than I thought. There were just so many critiquing comments because they actually want you to improve your writing and analysis, and want to see you develop as a writer. Great movies. Great classes. Preregister if they have it. Sign up early. Many people want to take the class, so sign up early and if you don't get in, try again another year.",
    "Yes. Absolutely. everyone with even an inkling of interest in classical films should take this course.",
    "This will be one of your favorite classes at Yale. Hands down. Do yourself a favor and try to get into this class.",
    "Lectures are so engaging that you sometimes forget to take notes. You will learn a lot about the origins of film in America, the backstories of popular classical Hollywood actors, and how to write about and look at film critically.",
    "YES! I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Take it to have one of the most enjoyable learning experiences you will probably have in your life. The professor is amazing, the TFs are wonderful, and you get to watch some amazing films.",
    "If you get in, take this class. Wow. The movies were amazing and Camille is just a star. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Just dont fall behind on the film diaries or you will find yourself writing 20 pages in 3 days.",
    "Yes if you have any interest in film at all",
    "I would reccommend this course to another student because it was very interesting but it was a big time commitment",
    "YES. Professor Thomasson is outstanding, you watch movies that are must-sees, it is fun, and a lovely class.",
    "Yes. Even if the classical Hollywood era doesn't interest you, Professor Thomasson's lectures and supplemental materials will make the class an enjoyable and rewarding experience. The movies are great, the TFs are engaged, and there are periodical snacks to accompany the screenings.",
    "Definitely take this class! The lectures were always engaging, the films were great and Camille was really what made this class exceptional. Maybe the best class I've taken at Yale so far. Going to class was actually super exciting and I always wanted to go.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student whether they're looking for a good film class in the classical Hollywood era, a interesting class to fulfil their writing credit, or a good fifth class.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes!! I loved this class. Everyone must take it!",
    "I would highly recommend this class to people who enjoy films.",

    "Absolutely!!! One of the best courses I have taken.",
    "Absolutely! If you are interested in film at all, please take this course! You won't regret it!",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!!!!! It not only was informative, but brought me so much joy. I left with a smile after each lecture, and I always looked forward to the Tuesday movie screenings. This course was not a gut, but the broad paper prompts made it so that I was able to always choose topics that I enjoyed. A wonderful course!",
    "Absolutely. Take this course as soon as you can!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! It is one of the most interesting and meaningful courses I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "Yes. The films are excellent and you get the freedom to write about what you're passionate about. I feel lucky to have interacted with this professor. The writing is mostly diary-style entries which feels much more fluid than writing paper after paper for a WR credit.",
    "Yes, especially if you are new to approaching cinema from an academic perspective. Prof. Thomasson is knowledgeable, engaging, and kind.",
    "YES. Take this course. Just do it. It is amazing.",
    "Yes. Favorite class at Yale. It does take a bit of time, with lecture twice a week, section once, and movie screenings once a week, plus all the readings, but it's really worth it.",
    "Yes absolutely! All of the assignments are very interesting, you'll learn a lot about writing, and the films\/lectures are truly incredible",
    "Absolutely. In fact, if there was only one class I could recommend to another student, it would be this one. This is the best class I have taken at Yale thus far.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend FILM 232 to any student who loves films or wishes that they had more exposure to old Hollywood films.",
    "yes for the classic films",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student looking to enhance their appreciation of the film medium in general or those looking to pursue further education in film studies and who want to build a solid foundation in university level media criticism.",
    "Yes. This is one of my favorite classes at Yale thus far. Professor Thomasson is incredibly knowledgable and the material will stay with me for much after this semester.",
    "Wholeheartedly. Camille is an engaging lecturer and a wonderful person. She has a true passion for film and for helping students succeed. The course expectations could not have been clearer or more consistent, and the very reasonable workload made it so I always looked forward to class and usually even enjoyed assignments.",
    "Absolutely. Take this course! It is phenomenal."
