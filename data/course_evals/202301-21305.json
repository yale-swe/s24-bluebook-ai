I was fascinated by the role that language played in each of the works we read, and how every novel we read connected to the others, showcasing Colonialism's universal impact on so many different cultures and regions of the world.",

                "I got a broad survey of postcolonial literature (and one or two colonial pieces) and developed my skills in close reading, discussion, and essay writing. I also did archival research at the Beinecke, which I had never tried before and which was actually quite fun.",
                "This is a pretty standard English class, but the  focus on non-European/American English language literature is really interesting. You get to read really great literature that is often overlooked in the English major.",

Reading a book a week strengthened me as a reader, and kept me on my toes.

                "Everyone should take at least one class on world literature, and this is a fabulous one to start with! No weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Professor Mukhopadhyay is amazing. During every seminar, she struck the perfect balance between guiding the discussion with her own insights and tying in student input, and it made every class very enriching. I also appreciated the diversity of the books we read. While I didn't like all of them, there was enough diversity that it kept me very interested. The session in Beinecke and the assignment of finding archival sources was also very exciting. Even though the assignment was difficult, I had a lot of fun digging through primary sources.\r\nWeaknesses: I'm sure this is a comment every year, but I think the biggest weakness is that we only have two days to discuss these books. I thought this was fine for a few of the novels, but there were some that I felt we did not fully flesh out or discuss in detail due to the confined 150 minutes that we had with them. I don't know that this can be easily resolved, but I left seminar at the end of the week at times dissatisfied that we had only closely read a few passages and hadn't fully appreciated the book in its entirety. I also would have liked a bit more time with the midterm essay: the incredibly tight turnaround made it difficult to find the best archival source, especially since Spring Break limited access to Beinecke.",
                "This course was outstanding. The novels and works we read were terrific and the in-class discussions were full of life and insightful contributions that enabled me to reread the works in new ways.",
                "We engaged with a really good wide range of texts however I think that reading a book a week meant that we had less time to properly engage with a text.",
                "It was very well-organized.",
                "Strengths: PM is amazing. She organized each seminar with a good balance of discussion, her own background, expertise, and insights, and reading of particular passages. She also gave good feedback on essay ideas and after the fact. (I probably should have taken more advantage of this.) \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: With such a heavy reading load, it gets difficult to keep up and contribute consistently. Seeing as we tended to discuss very specific passages each class, it would be great if we could be given which passages are key to focus on before each class!",
                "INCREDIBLE syllabus. Every text was so engaging. I wished the final paper allowed more room to discuss / synthesize MULTIPLE texts",
                "Strengths: Prof. Mukhopadhyay was the highlight of this course, providing insight into and connections across the texts. She provided helpful feedback on our essays and made herself readily available. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There were times I wish we spent a bit more in-depth time with each text, but I also understand that we had a lot of material to cover.",
                "Strengths  my favorite of the foundational English courses, simply because the novels we read like Exploding Mangoes and A Grain of Wheat were so interesting. if you can take it with prof Mukhopadhyay definitely go for it!",
                "Although I appreciated this course, there were a few frustrations I had with it as a whole. For one, although the class is WORLD English Literatures we focus on only a fraction of the world  South Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean islands - and all of these place in post-colonial contexts. Virtually all the books we read are post-colonial, with the focus on colonialism. I've had several conversations with classmates about how this makes this course  despite it being the token course for diversity  about white people. By the books we read focusing on colonialism, there is always a focus on white people/colonizers/the British  instead of texts where we can hear stories from the world, and about the people of these places in the world, with the focus on them. The latter would be the thing to shift the control away from the colonizers in the classroom. Of course it is difficult that the class is constrained to English - so all writers would have had to be assimilated enough to the colonizer's culture to choose that to be the language in which they write in, but I wonder if we could read more texts that are translations of texts written in indigenous languages - so may have been written more for the people of their country? It feels like the texts chosen by this course work inside the confines of the structures put in place by colonialism. All these stories are about people's oppressions  but when can the people be let free? I think something that was hard for me is that many of the texts were about pain and suffering, but none were about joy. I think the most powerful and radical thing for this class would be if we read world wide joyful stories. This would rebel against the narrative, that these places, different from our own in America, are only of hardship. There is a lack of stories universally about Black joy, and joy in the lives of people of color. Another thing I noticed is that discussions mostly focused on the historical post-colonial context instead of close reading/the literary merit of the texts. All of the other English classes I have taken have been focused intimately on the use and craft of words and dissecting their meaning with care. It felt like we were seeing these texts as valuable in that they said something about the historical/sociopolitical context, but not valuable because they were literary works in themselves. I wished to, like with all the classes with most (or all) texts by white people, focus on the beauty of the words, detached from the postcolonial history. As much as this can be important context. If this class was titled \"Post-Colonial Stories\" or something of that sort, and there were other offerings to read texts from the world not with this lens, then I would have enjoyed the course more - and I DID enjoy the course a lot - but titling it Comp WORLD Lit, feels misleading."

Some weeks were definitely a little difficult, but this course taught me how to read books with a purpose, and also provided me with a nice break from the rest of my STEM-heavy schedule. I would also encourage people to take this course if Professor Mukhopadhyay is teaching it. I specifically enrolled in this course because she was teaching it, and I have not been disappointed.",
