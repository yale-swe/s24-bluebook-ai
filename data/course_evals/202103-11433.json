The course speakers were amazing and I gained an appreciation for what local organizing really looks like in the city. The readings were great, but there were too many of them. It was unrealistic to have us read so much because we really didn't have the time to understand and sit with the content. I would rather deeply understanding a few readings rather than having a superficial understanding of a lot of different ones. That being said, they were largely interesting readings, despite being overwhelming at times.",
