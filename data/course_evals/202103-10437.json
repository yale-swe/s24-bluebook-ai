                "I learned a lot about nearly every country in the Middle East, and their complicated histories and interactions. The class was also a good opportunity to practice public speaking as each of the students gave a lengthy oral presentation.",
                "I came into the course with a very introductory knowledge of the Middle East and North Africa, but now know significantly more about the region. Moreover, Professor Sky really focuses on introducing students to key debates on different topics rather than just recounting facts.",
                "Background in the Middle East, basic historical knowledge",
                "I learned more about the politics and international relations of the Middle East. Read lots of literature but learned the most from listening to the perspectives of the people in the class.",
                "I learned a huge amount about Middle East politics, at both the micro and the macro level.",
                "This course gave me a very deep insight into the dynamics of Middle East politics. Prof Sky is extremely knowledgeable and invested in the topic, so our class discussions were always interesting. There were also a bunch of guest experts whose presence enhanced our learning experience.",
                "An in-depth overview of Middle East politics. We learned about topics such as the refugee crisis, regional power dynamics, economic challenges, conflict, etc.",
                "I learned a lot of lessons about the Middle East and the politics of the region.",
                "I learned a lot about different regions of the middle east and various relevant themes. I learned how to think more critically about the region, its policies, and its history. I liked assigning each student a presentation because it provided me an opportunity to dive deeper into one topic."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths are the breadth. There are so many topics covered within the course and so many diverse opinions and perspectives shared by both the professor and the students. The main weakness was the amount of time in the course. Because it was a survey course that covered so many different countries, our conversations were often cut off about specific issues meaning we had less time to engage deeply with certain topics.",
                "Strengths: Professor Sky is absolutely awesome her experience is unparalleled and she was always willing to meet to discuss paper topics/course content. The course was also organized quite well to discuss a broad array of topics. The reading was not too intense and was usually quite fascinating. Staying up to date with news on a single country throughout the semester was also pretty neat.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class relies heavily on student participation, so when people weren't super involved it got a bit dry (though this did not happen often).",
                "Too much student presentation, not enough professor lecturing",
                "I really liked how the course had people from so many different backgrounds. I personally learned the most from hearing what others had to say. I liked how the class wasn't overwhelming or stressful. It was the right amount of work and I felt that I learned a lot from the assignments (essays and presentation). I also loved how one of the midterm essays was to write about a cultural or artistic or musical figure from the country. I think it is very important to celebrate the culture of this region.",
                "Strengths -- Prof Sky is a wonderful professor and clearly very knowledgeable, class discussion was lively and, unlike most once-per-week seminars, I feel like class time was used to the fullest and readings were entertaining and manageable\r\nWeaknesses -- basically all of the teaching that is done during class time is from students who are tasked to give presentations each week, and then Prof Sky mostly just facilitates class discussion. I sometimes wished that she would do more in-class teaching because she clearly has much more expertise than all of us (that's why we're in her class!)",
                "Emma Sky is the main strength of the course. It's truly an honor to learn from her! The only thing is that I wish she'd engage more in our mostly student-led discussions because she clearly has a lot to say on the topic.",
                "Emma Sky does not teach anything. Just makes he students talk and monitors discussion and thats it. o",
                "Strengths: the professor was great, the discussions and readings were very interesting, you have a lot of flexibility with assignments, and I liked how each person in the class followed a country for the semester. Weaknesses: I felt like sometimes the daily student presentations could be too long and not leave enough time for discussion.",
                "This course was great in providing me with crucial insights about the politics of the Middle East. Each presentation and class discussion was very intriguing.",
                "The class discussions were lively and I felt like I learned a lot from my peers. That said, Professor Sky was great at providing guidance and input to steer the conversation. I wish i got more constructive feedback on my essays. I also wish we received intermediate grades on assignments to better gauge how we were performing in the class."

                "Absolutely! I learned a lot from the readings, the professor, and my peers. It really gives any student, even one with zero exposure to the topic, a great foundation in the histories of all the countries of the middle east.",
                "Yes! If you can get into it, I would definitely recommend taking this course. Professor Sky is great to take a class with and the course encouraged really fascinating discussions among students from around the world.",
                "Yes. I think also that this class is best for someone who already has a background in the Middle East, whether that's from taking a class before or if you just already know a good bit about the Middle East. That way you will be able to actively engage with the material well. Also I would recommend this class for someone who is truly interested in the Middle East and has a strong desire to take it. It's a hard class to get into so make sure you really want to engage with the topic!",
                "Yes!! Be aware going in that this is not quite an introductory course; if you have never learned about the Middle East at all you might be a bit lost. But if you have some familiarity with the region and are looking to really delve into the problems and conflicts facing each country, this is your class. I learned so much  -- regardless of viewpoint you will at least come away with an impeccable understanding of the region, even if you didn't necessarily agree with everything that is said in class.",
                "Absolutely. Discussion in seminar was consistently engaging and having Professor Sky (and the occasional guest) there to share insights was really valuable. Professor Sky clearly cares for her students and made class very welcoming. Assignments are pretty open-ended and fun to write as a result. The course and its students let me view and discuss the vast complexities of the Middle East from a variety of perspectives. Definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Yale and would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the region, no matter their level of familiarity.",
                "YES! Even if you are not very knowledgeable on the topic yet, you will learn so much from the course. The content is fascinating and the professor is top-notch.",
                "Not the best course I took at Yale and not the worst. Take it to meet cool people on campus and thats it.",
                "Yes! i think this is an amazing course. The make-up of the class tends to be quite interesting and the discussions are very illuminating.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it provides one with knowledge about the politics of the Middle East.",
                "Yes, I would recommend. You learn a lot about the middle east from a professor who really understands it and knows its history. Additionally, the other students taking the class generally came from very interesting and relevant backgrounds."
