                "I gained a deeper understanding of Japanese, Arabic, and early modal theory, and a greater appreciation for the historical and cultural factors behind many parts of music theory. I learned to appreciate music that might sound unconventional to Western ears and the complexity of theory behind it.",
                "I learned how to analyze and perceive music through different theoretical systems (Renaissance\/modal, Japanese\/Chinese, Arabic, etc.).",
                "I learned about modal theory, Japanese theory, and some basic elements of Arabic maqam theory. It was really cool to see how elements of all these theories combine.",
                "I learned a lot about the musical cultures of various regions outside of Western Europe as well as the theoretical ways these traditions are analyzed. I also learned how to analyze pieces of music from multiple music theoretical perspectives."

                "Strengths: not too much homework, great for a theory and writing credit, kind professor, lots of room for exploration of personal interests\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This theory class was a male-dominated space and this impacted my experience and learning greatly in class. Gender seems like an extremely important aspect of the topics discussed and I was a little disappointed that this was not discussed. I also wish there was a bit more guidance and background materials to explain the concepts discussed in class with more concrete learning objectives for each unit.",
                "Well organized, workload small, though sometimes discussion pacing was a bit slow",
                "The materials of the course were all very well researched and the class discussions were a forte. I particularly enjoyed the freedom in assignments which encouraged composition as well as essay-writing. However, I wish the coverage of various units was a bit more balanced and felt as thought the last (on arabic music theory) was slightly rushed.",
                "Strengths: lots of hands-on experiential learning, listening, and analytical thinking, as well as focused discussion.",
                "I liked the structure of the class. I think it would be cool to delve further into different genres that use one theory to see how combinations occur.",
                "The material is super interesting, and I loved seeing examples of when the music theories we discussed actually collided. Liam is also a wonderful professor, and his lectures were well-planned and interesting."

                "YES!",
                "Most definitely. The course explored an area of music not covered in any other course at Yale and that I had never seen previously, with an accessible format that prioritized discussion and wonder.",
                "Absolutely! This is a wonderful course taught by a wonderful professor. There are not many courses like it, and it is a gem within the music course offerings, particularly as it explores non-Western theoretical systems. It is possible to go through the music major sequence without taking a class like this, which I find an absolute shame, because I have found it to be invaluable in the way I think, interpret, and write as an amateur music theorist.",
                "Yes! I truly had not really known about the Japanese and Maqam theories so the class opened up a whole other world of thought.",
                "Absolutely! It's not a ton of work, and it taught me a lot about non-Western European musical cultures."
