                "I learned a great deal about racial capitalism and the carceral state.  Beginning with the origins of the concept of race, chattel slavery, and the current model of incarceration then going to Reconstruction and the race and the formation of the ghetto at the turn of the 20th Century, and finally ending with the creation of the current carceral state.  I learned how all of these institutions were formed and interact with one another, as well as how they interact with other power hierarchies like heteronormativity, the gender binary, and class society.",

I also gained an understanding of how systems of subordination are harnessed and (re)produced across space and time, specifically analyzing the the ways that slavery, ghettoization, and the prison industrial complex have rest on and reify racial typographies and unequal relations of power."

My only gripe was that we didn't have much time to delve more into community-based solutions to the problems we discussed like mutual aid.",

Whether they are just learning about the carceral state and race in the US, or if they're a major theory nerd who runs 15 book clubs and can quote Marcuse backwards, I think that anybody (but especially social science majors) will get a lot out of this class.  This is exactly the class anybody who wants to better understand inequality and exploitation in the US needs to take.",

This class has given me a strong enough grasp on the theory that I feel comfortable calling myself an abolitionist ready to engage in the praxis needed to make those ideas a reality.  I am also much more able to engage in discourse surrounding racial capitalism as well and I believe that I will be a better advocate/organizer for it.",

I will also use this knowledge to guide and inform my social justice commitments, including abolitionism, mutual aid, and public interest law."
