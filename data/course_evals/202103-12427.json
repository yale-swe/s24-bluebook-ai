                "Strengths: Lecture slides and textbook material meshed really well together! I found that, together, these materials made for a really solid foundation. The sections were also phenomenal. I would have no idea how to do the problems if not for Viraj. Weaknesses: I felt like there was always so much on the slides that I could never write down everything fast enough, and concepts sometimes didn't click until right before the exams. I feel like this is partially on me; I would strongly suggest future students review each week's concepts after class so that there's no cramming in pre-midterm\/finals.",
                "The overall content of the course is useful, but I felt like the lectures weren't very helpful in seeing the theory applied to practice problems. It was mostly talking about the concepts without seeing how they can be used or applied. The TA sections were the only opportunity to see any practice problems. It would probably be more beneficial to have them inserted into the lectures, too.",
                "I think this is a course where the material is extremely important and useful, but the content is at times difficult to understand and not necessarily well taught. For someone without a strong STEM background, this is an extremely difficult class, and there's clearly a selection bias in who takes the class. That said, I think it's a worthwhile experience for someone who wants a strong understanding of how probability and statistics work.",
                "I actually thought this course was really excellent at what it tried to do. I feel like I came away with an ability to  productively approach problems in a variety of areas (see knowledge\/skills question for more details). It provided proofs of results so it didn't feel too hand-wavy, but those proofs didn't take over the class and instead it still felt grounded in the actual methods and how to use them to answer questions. I also think that the use of Economic papers applying ideas was a nice extension of the course material, and that the PSETS did reinforce the topics covered in class. The only qualm I had was that the lectures occasionally felt just like a hose of information being pointed at you for 75 minutes: The professor would start lecturing, would talk about topics which although not impossibly complex take some time to digest, but then the professor just keeps on going for the whole time. Although this does mean that we are able to cover a fair amount in each lecture, it also means that you need to make sure you go over lectures afterwards occasionally to make sure you can follow the thread and track what was happening at each step. If this effect could be limited by the professor occasionally slowing down when covering a topic for the first time that would be ideal, though I understand that this might not be possible given how much this course tries to cover.",
                "Great course",
                "The course was well-taught overall. Lectures were clear and enjoyable. I felt like I learned quite a bit, mostly from spending an immense amount of time with the textbook outside of class given the density of the material. It could potentially be improved by having a bit more communication with students; the professor could outline the expectations for the midterm exam a bit more clearly, and additional practice exams would have been appreciated.",
                "The class could be more interactive.",
                "I think the course moves at a blisteringly fast pace, but overall it is possible to keep up. I think this course has too few large problem sets. This meant that I often felt like I had forgotten how to do previous problems by the time I got to the next problem set. Having a few more problem sets and making each one smaller would lead to more continual reinforcement of the content, improving overall understanding. The open book format of the exams makes sense given the material, but I think students would be less reliant on the open book if they had better recall of the concepts through more frequent but smaller problem sets. This course also demanded coding skills on the syllabus; I did not end up improving my knowledge of Stata or R through this course.",
                "Prof. Narita is one of the best professors Ive ever had. Incredibly well-spoken, and truly cares about his students. Content was very well presented and the course was well organized via slides. In regard to weaknesses, I wish there were more shorter, frequent problem sets rather than 5 long ones. For some problem sets I was doing problems on content we covered a month ago. Also, personally, some problem sets took an hour while others took 10. I think balancing the assignments would be a great next direction for the course.",
                "The course went into detail on topics that I had some familiarity with, but not at that level, and there was a good amount of work, with longer problem sets every two weeks. I find, however, that learning off of slides with minimal writing on the board is a hard way for me to stay engaged.",

                "Maybe? I feel like a lot of people took it for their major\/elective requirements, but every person who took it was willing to dedicate extra time to the material relative to ECON 117. If you're really interested in the math and statistics of it all, I would recommend it. But I would suggest that you put in the work on weeks that you don't have a pset due.",

                "Yes. A reasonable but quick introduction to a number of important ideas and methods which, although giving proofs\/motivations for the results, doesn't focus on the proofs too much and instead is interested in using the methods to answer question. I think this course was able to transfer a surprisingly large amount of information from the professor\/textbook to me, and makes me appreciative of how much material can be covered (if not at incredible depth). The PSETS and exams were fair, though not necessarily easy, and I did think they served their purpose of making me review and internalize the material while also accurately assessing my knowledge. See the other questions for more detailed answers.",
                "Yes. Good class",
                "Yes, overall, I think the course is worth taking, if you are willing to put in the time. The lectures were relatively enjoyable, and while I had to do quite a bit of self-teaching given the dense nature of the material, I feel like I've come out of the course with an understanding of probability and stats that is grounded in math. Definitely worth taking if you're interested in seeing the math behind empirical research techniques, etc. -- this is not something you'll find in ECON 117 or other courses.",

                "Don't take it if you don't have to. It's quite challenging and graded on a curve. Most students in the class are Econ and Math majors and it could be hard to get a good grade. The intro stats classes are a better alternative if you just wanna learn the stats concepts.",
                "If youre an Econ Math major, theres not much to say since this is required. Otherwise, if youre looking for a more mathematically rigorous treatment of introductory econometrics, this is a great way to get that.",
                "I would recommend this to students who are in the Econ and Math major.",
