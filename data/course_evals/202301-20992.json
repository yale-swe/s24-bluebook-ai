I also learned about how trees are used by humans and the different landscape changes that have occurred in New England over the past 15,000 years.",

                "No weaknesses at all. Work back in a prompt manner. Tons of opportunities for review. Lectures genuinely engaging and course content very cross-disciplinary.  The prof and teaching team are excellent. Lots of in class demonstrations and class outings. Exams were manageable and allowed for students to demonstrate knowledge that they had rather than trying to \"catch you\". The only bummer about this class is how few people get to take it compared to how many people want to take it.",
                "Strengths: clear expectations, realistic learning objectives, interesting material, very structured, interesting field trips\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: discussion section sometimes didn't have enough time for the activities we were expected to complete.",
                "Such exciting material!!\r\n\r\nLectures were sometimes a little dry, but overall the enthusiasm Craig had really shined through and made this class a worthwhile experience.\r\n\r\nThe organization and instructions around exams could be improved. It was unclear how to study and what expectations were for how exams would be graded.",
                "Broderson is an amazing instructor! This course was engaging and the sections were always new and unexpected!",
                "This is the best class Ive taken at Yale. Extremely engaging lectures and fun, doable assignments. The only change Id ask for is a later Thursday discussion section (9:25 was too early for me).",
                "Strengths are the information and Professor, fun section activities too, weakness is slides could be a little more organized",
                "Lectures can sometimes be a bit disengaging and unorganized. It would be helpful to have stronger course organization and clearer info on what will be tested and expected to know",
                "Strengths: I liked how interactive discussion sections were and how we went on different field trips.\r\nWeaknesses: an hour and 15 minute lecture on top of discussion section is a lot. Maybe 50 minute lectures would allow me to keep focus.",
                "I wish lectures were shorter but other than that most of the course was strong.",
                "Strengths: Professor Brodersen is a very passionate lecturer. Some topics are very interesting. The homework is very light with only 6 assignments throughout the semester. \r\nWeaknesses: Some lectures could get long and tedious.",

Second, Professor Broderson is an amazing lecturer who is clearly invested in what he teaches. He is also very supportive and understanding of students and wants nothing more than for them to succeed and learn.",
                "THIS IS A MUST TAKE CLASS AT YALE. I came in to this class with ZERO science knowledge. I mean really zero. I am humanities major and the only Yale QR\/SC classes I took up to this point was econ 115. I also haven't taken bio since freshman year of high school, and not only was I able to handle all of the material, but I loved learning it. The knowledge I learned in this class will genuinely enhance my studies in the humanities.  I was actually almost sad the day that class ended knowing that I wouldn't be able to come back. The teaching team was also stellar- they were very approachable and used section time very well. The class took lots of interesting field trips and outings that coincided with class content. I cannot say enough great things about this class- really its only problem was the sad reality that so many of my peers won't get the opportunity to take this class. Calling it a gut would be a disservice, you will genuinely enjoy this class, and as long as you go to lecture and engage with the course material, you will do well.",
                "YES. This is one of the only Yale courses I have taken in which I have felt like the learning expectations were clear. The material is interesting and the instructor takes great care to apply the material to current world issues. Exams are comprehensible and I felt very prepared for all exams and assignments we were expected to complete. This is the only time where I have genuinely enjoyed STEM and has lead me to become more involved in other courses. TAKE THIS CLASS",
                "Yes!!! Awesome course for non-EVST majors and non-STEM people looking for a science credit. I have a deep love of trees, so the course was perfect for me.",
                "Yes! I found it to be super informative and interesting. I wondered how there would be enough information on trees to fill a semester, but I found the information was always new and built on the previous material. Professor Brodersen is a great lecturer and he made class informative and fun with his demonstrations and slides.",
                "BEST CLASS EVER. I love trees and I wish I would have taken this class freshman year so I would have had time to change my major.",
                "I would say although it is an interesting course, prepare for a high workload and exams with lots of details necessary. It went much further into the science (down to the inter-cellular level) than I thought!",
                "Yes, so fun to learn about trees",
                "Yes if they have some background in plant biology - I think the material would be too complex for a complete beginner.",
                "Yes, it is really interesting and the grading is fair.",
                "Yes, especially if you're interested in an environmental science major and are curious of what the EVST classes are like. Not all classes are as fun as engaging as this one, but it will get you excited for the major nonetheless.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to others. Going into the class, I was unsure of my major, and was largely looking at other things. This course ignited in me an interest in plant science, and I am now planning on majoring in environmental science, possibly in this realm of study. Even beyond that, I feel that it is a class that is important and interesting for both science and non science majors alike.",
                "Yes! All the assignments and field trip opportunities were so fun and exciting. As a first-year, I feel like this course helped me learn more about Yale as a whole, which is very exciting."
