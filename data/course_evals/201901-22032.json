    "I gained a much deeper understanding of calculus, areas, and volumes.",

I gained insight into the connection between rate and amount of change and how that relationship enables incredible calculations.",

    "Absolutely nothing",

    "hardcore calculus.",
    "I reinforced my understanding calculus concepts and gained valuable study skills.",
    "A better understanding of integration and its uses.",
    "This course gave me a deeper understanding of not only calculus but also of the ways calculus helps the world around us. This course is essentially a Calculus II curriculum, with math 112 being Calculus I. I learned about more complicated subjects in calculus, including how to solve more complicated integrals, sums and series, and polar coordinates."

   "comments": [
    "A strength of this course is the order in which the material is taught.",
    "This course equipped me with many techniques for integration and series evaluation. The explorations helped me to understand the proofs\/basis for many concepts we learned. However, I think they should be optional, as many explorations were redundant to the course text. Also, polar coordinates and parametric equations should be discussed much more thoroughly and much earlier in the course. It is a huge shift from thinking in cartesian, unparameterized coordinates to thinking in polar and parameterized coordinates. When studying for the final exam, I discovered so much more depth to polars and parametrics than what was discussed in lecture and on psets.",
    "make it more engaging",
    "I wish it was taught better",
    "Erik Rosenthal's teaching style was the main weakness of this course. It would be nice to actually have a structure to the lesson plans. In contrast, Abbythe peer tutorwas literally the only good part of MATH 115. I learned a lot more from her during peer tutoring hours than I ever did from going to class.",
    "Strength: good resource access\r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes we get lied to about the content on the test.",
    "Some of the explorations were occasionally helpful, but a some of them also did not do much to reinforce the material being taught the next class.",
    "I think the course could be improved by spending more class time on the theory behind the concepts, instead of simply focusing on practice questions. I do not necessarily think a flipped classroom is a great way to teach calculus, and I would have enjoyed going over both concepts and doing practice questions. Dr. Rosenthal did a good job of trying to do both, but I still would have enjoyed more explanation before the practice instead of explanation during the problems."

    "I would only recommend this course if you need it for a major requirement. If not, and you simply like calculus, this will do the job for you; however, it is not just an easy class."
