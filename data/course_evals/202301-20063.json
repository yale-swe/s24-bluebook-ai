                "The course can focus a bit more on specific policy recommendations. Would be interesting to dig deeper into how existing policies have failed to help people who believe they were being hurt by globalization, and how we can help support these people specifically.",
                "Strengths: The course covers a broad variety of topics in a short period of time and gives a strong overview of the successes and challenges of economic globalization.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course is NOT structured as a debate and is NOT structured to encourage seminar-style participation. Each week, a group of 2-5 students makes a presentation on the readings assigned for that class and spends the entire class presenting their presentation. The presentation is totally useless if you have done the reading, because you already know all of the content. Professor Zedillo interrupts almost every slide (in some cases multiple times per slide) to provide his feedback, which is something that should be done privately via email or in office hours, not in class. The students then respond to the feedback/professor's questions as if they were defending a thesis, which is fine at first but gets annoying after the first dozen interruptions. Students are sometimes able to sneak questions in if they are particularly persistent.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the course involves only two days of presentations from Professor Zedillo: the very first day of class, and one class on the Doha Development Round. To be fair, Professor Zedillo's presentations are informative and he has some fun anecdotes about his experience as a Mexican minister and later president. The problem is that 90% of the course involves students presenting and the professor debating them, while the whole class watches as if it were a play in a theatre.\r\n\r\nEveryone is already required to do the readings, because you have to write weekly reflections (which, by the way, the professor refuses to provide feedback on, and it is unclear if he ever even reads them). So having to write the reflections and then watch other people present on the exact same readings for each class, for the entire class session, is a waste of time. I will admit that making the presentations is a good learning experience. But there is no need to present them to a class full of students that has already done the readings and is obviously bored.\r\n\r\nLastly: There are hundreds of pages of reading each week, much of which is very \"in the weeds\" (i.e. extremely detailed economic analysis of specific countries or time periods).",
                "The topic of this course is fascinating and Professor Zedillo is knowledgable and clear during his lectures. He includes personal anecdotes from his experience as President that bring to life many of the topics that we discuss in class. At times, his expectations on reading responses and papers was unclear, and we did not receive much feedback. For a few of the classes, the reading load was unmanagable, and I would have appreciated a more streamlined reading list that would allow us to focus our class discussion and come more prepared.",
                "Very little feedback. Next to none, actually. Had no idea how I was doing in the course the entire semester - my grade could have ranged anywhere from an A to a fail. Professor didn't really communicate anything about deadlines, and engagement was overall just really low.",
                "The readings were pretty well selected. However you learn most of the content from the readings rather than directly from Professor Zedillo. You also don't get any instructions on or feedback for the presentations. Professor Zedillo is a very kind person tho.",
                "Prof wouldnt give any feedback and dont even reply to emails. Wrong syllabus, confusing class schedule."

            "comments": [
                "Yes, the professor is amazing.",
                "Yes. Yale students should be global citizens and should understand fully the benefits of globalization while being sympathetic to those that push back against globalization. We should let the world understand how win-win cooperation and make everyone better off vs zero-sum mentality.",
                "I would STRONGLY advise against taking this course for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n(1) Professor Zedillo is a highly accomplished economist and statesman. No question about it. However, he only teaches in two of the ~12 sessions of the course. During all the other sessions, your peers present on the readings and the professor interrupts them every two minutes or so to provide feedback or criticism. I would not call this \"teaching.\"\r\n\r\n(2) Professor Zedillo refuses to provide feedback on assignments. He explicitly said at the beginning of the course that he could not provide feedback on weekly reflections because \"there are too many and I don't have time.\" Fine. But he also refused to provide feedback on the in-class midterm exam. When he returned the exams, his only written feedback was a number grade circled at the top of each essay booklet. One student asked how he could get feedback, and Professor Zedillo said, verbatim, \"your feedback is in the grade.\" Then he said, \"imagine that your exam were open-book. Go into your notes and readings and see what you would have written that you did not in fact write.\" This is a cop-out answer. I have never had any other Yale professor refuse to provide feedback (verbal or written) on a midterm exam. Now, you might say \"ok, go to office hours.\" see point (3) below.\r\n\r\n(3) Professor Zedillo frequently ignores emails and refuses to provide office hours. When asked in class, he says, \"please email me\"; when emailed, he simply ignores the email until the student asks in class the following week, and this charade continues until the end of the course. I spoke with about half my classmates and did not meet a single one who managed to talk to Professor Zedillo outside of class, either for more than five minutes before/after class or in anything that could be perceived as office hours, in person or on Zoom. All of this makes it virtually impossible to gauge how you are doing in the class. He does not tell you your presentation grade, your reflections grade (all of this is under \"participation - 30%\") and does not justify the midterm grade in any way, shape, or form. For all I know, the midterm grades are randomly generated.\r\n\r\n(4) Professor Zedillo gaslit students about the final paper deadline, writing in an email on 2 May that it would be due \"mid-night on May 3\" even though he said in class that it would be due 10 May. Conveniently, he never put the deadline nor the final paper requirements in writing. Only after the entire class emailed him and their deans did Zedillo \"compromise\" by moving the deadline to 7 May. This is consistent with a pattern of generally poor communication and unclear requirements. I've never had a professor maliciously (as that is the only way of describing it) moving the final paper deadline to an earlier date. This behavior should obviously be prohibited by Yale regulations, but somehow it is not. \r\n\r\nIf you do take this class against my recommendations, and the advice of most of the other evaluations, make sure to get everything in writing. I can tell that Zedillo was a fantastic politician because it is hard to pin him down on anything, which is why you need to get everything in writing.\r\n\r\nBy the way, none of this is a personal attack on Professor Zedillo. He is incredibly accomplished, very intelligent and qualified, and produces great research. He is regarded as one of the best presidents in Mexico's recent history, and I agree with most or all of his views on trade and international economics. It is just that some people are good teachers, and some are not good teachers. Unfortunately, Zedillo is not a good teacher.",
                "Yes, but I would recommend this course only if you are interested in international economics and globalization.",
                "Probably not. Truly didn't enjoy the class, didn't learn much, and regretted taking the class somewhat. Still, I'm sure it'll make a really great story for the grandkids. I would be cautious unless you plan on credit-D-failing this class.",
                "If you're interested in globalization and want to be able to explore any topic in this area (final paper topic is anything related to globalization) you should take it, but also know that you'll pretty much receive no instructions for feedback the entire semester. Workload is not bad: weekly reading response.",
                "I dont recommend it. Choose anything else than this."
