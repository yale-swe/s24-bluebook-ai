                "I now know a lot more about the debate surrounding the origins of Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus, and can refute Putin's \"shared nationhood/roots and brotherhood of nations\" rhetoric through historical contextualization. I also know a looooot about Magnitogorsk, which is some crazy city that was planned really poorly by Soviet authorities. I've learned quite a bit about nuclear developments by the Soviet state, in tandem with American fears. I learned how to write a critical academic review of a film. I honed my researching/research paper writing skills. I learned about \"Master and the Margarita\" and how it ties into urban development contemporaneous to its publishing. I learned about Kharkiv - in particular how Soviet officials borrowed American tractor plans and failed to implement them effectively, believing that they could replicate American building techniques without the necessary tools to do so; a similar trajectory having occurred in many areas of urban and infrastructural development.",
                "A survey of cities from all different angles: historical, anthropological, sociological, urban studies, literature/literary, among other disciplines. We were supposed to cover Kyiv, Kharkiv, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Semey, Magnitogorsk, Odessa, Tashkent, Baku, and Astana, but we really spent much much longer on Kyiv, Moscow, and St. Petersburg, with a very brief aside into Magnitogorsk. Not sure if we ever even talked about Odessa! We covered principles of modernism, poetic devices, deconstructing an argument, and Stalinist architecture - it was quite all over the place, to be frank."

            "comments": [
                "This course to be frank had few strengths that I can think of which is natural considering that it is a brand new course. \r\nBut as for weaknesses the following were very concerning aspects of the course:\r\n1. Grades were returned very very late for the classroom participation and the weekly discussion posts aspects of our grade. To be exact they were sent out in late December which essentially did not give students the chance to improve early on in the course. Students were not informed about the grades they were receiving on individual discussion posts which worked to the detriment of many students in the course. \r\n\r\n2. The professor had a tendency to become upset during the course which often made the classroom environment uncomfortable. \r\n\r\n3. During seminar for the first 2-4 weeks the professor taught the class as a lecture with prepared slides which did not allow students to discuss the literature that we were assigned to read.\r\n\r\n4. Feedback was not given on any of the essays we submitted nor was classwork ever returned to students.",
                "Weaknesses: could be a little more specific with the focus and the area it covers\r\n\r\nStrengths: really interesting class and engaging content, I was learning a lot",
                "Strengths: I think the readings and supplemental material were all extremely interesting; I especially liked the weeks where we read excerpts of literature from various periods--poetry and books--that helped complement that week's topic. Some of the readings were rather controversial, like \"If Mayors Ruled the World,\" which provided a great springboard for debate in class, especially given our very small class size.\r\nWeaknesses: I must preface that I did enjoy this class, and any of the following weaknesses should not detract from my admiration for Nari or for the conceptualization of the course. I think primarily, the class didn't seem to know what it wanted to be or how it wanted to be run. Some weeks, Nari would do presentations to help contextualize some of the historical developments, whereas other weeks class was run rather freeform; I think a healthy balance between the two would have been more fruitful: some sort of instructor-led presentation, followed by a discussion. The discussion board didn't really serve as a very useful tool for classroom discourse, as some of the comments were very cursory-level, whereas others were incredibly detailed. And most of the time, the majority of what would have been stated in class, was already stated on Canvas--but these are my personal qualms with discussion boards in general, too. The map quiz seemed kind of like a moot point, as the geography of the cities we discussed never seemed to be particularly useful. The midterm paper was a very interesting assignment, but I think it would have been even more interesting had we been invited to discuss the films/books about which we wrote among our peers in the classroom setting; otherwise it's simply a writing exercise, a creative one, I'll give it that! \r\nLastly, my major, major qualm with the course is that it is titled \"Ten\" Eurasian Cities, but it should more appropriately be coined \"Kyiv/St. Petersburg/Moscow + a little Kazakhstan and maybe a little Azerbaijan if you read that part of the reading.\" A course like this could be an amazing opportunity to discuss parts of Eurasia that aren't often discussed in the Western-academic space -- I think of Tbilisi or Batumi, Yerevan, Minsk, Chisinau, literally any city in Central Asia -- in a time when Russia and Russia-adjacent discourse is dominating public consciousness, these other cities merit discussion, too. The week we were meant to discuss Kharkiv and Baku, only some students learned about the former, while others studied the latter. I'm not sure we ever discussed Odessa, and our discussion of Semey wasn't really about Semey, but rather \"closed cities\" in a general sense. Magnitogork, however, got its due diligence. And the one week intended for Astana didn't even really cover Astana, save for its name change. \r\nI think overall, the course is solid with its readings and its thematic structure, but strongly lacking in its organization. A more solid framework for discussing the readings, for starters, would improve classroom discussion. In all of my courses, I often mention that a reading guide/reading questions would be very helpful. Making the assignments more meaningfully connect to the things we discuss in class would be of benefit, as well. And structuring the class time more productively, too might make the classroom environment a more productive space. We went from traditional lecture, to traditional seminar, to open debate, to urban studies class, to book club, to book lecture, to history conference, back again -- Nari and the course need to materialize into something more concrete for it to work better in its future form.",
                "STRONG: very enthusiastic professor, interesting readings and topic, pretty simple assignments, positive reinforcement in class, lots of opportunities for help, extremely accessible, fascinating library visit, small class size with students from all different backgrounds, and on some days, class was structured very well. WEAK: when a PPT was not prepared, class sorta went all over the place. Discussion was \"what do you want to talk about\" instead of directing class in a certain direction. Nari would oftentimes expect us, none of whom have studied the Western canon in-depth, to know Socrates and Plato, and conversely also know Walter Benjamin, Hannah Arendt, and Michel Foucault - there's no way a first-year student, let alone students of other disciplines would, should, or could know any of these thinkers' major arguments, especially since there was no prerequisite. At times, it seemed that Nari would get frustrated by this, and get irritated when we didn't immediately know something that was obvious to him, but not to us. About halfway through the semester, he stopped giving contextual lectures (i.e., with Kyiv, he supplemented the readings with quite a bit of additional material during class, with visuals and supplemental historical background). With the other cities, especially those not immediately in modern Russia, it felt like we were doing them a disservice. The week for Baku, Magnitogorsk, and Tashkent was \"pick the city you want to read about\" and then we discussed them in groups. But that was it - the next week we were back on Moscow. This is to say, the course really should have been called Three Eurasian Cities, and marketed as a multidisciplinary approach to urban geography. One day we'd read Bulgakov, another day Svetlana Boym, yet another the ancient chronicles of the Kievan Rus' formation, and another the premier historian of Magnitogorsk. It was hard to see the point with some of the assignments as well - why write a film or book review for the midterm, and what were the criteria for grading? We didn't talk about them in class; it felt like busy work. Why write the discussion posts if we never actually got feedback on them, and they only became relevant for questions in free-form discussion? And why do a map quiz, if we never really talked about the actual geographical location of the cities - it's simply unnecessary to check our understanding of the geography if we aren't going to talk about something like trade, travel, or tourism. Sure, reading a chapter of Master and the Margarita was a fun break in the semester, but why did we do it? I found myself asking \"why?\" for a lot of assignments, and for other things, \"what else?\" Specifically, the latter with the cities that none of us were familiar with - it was unclear why \"Semipalatinsk-10\" was on the syllabus, since the one reading for that city wasn't.. even.. about.. that city... And then we didn't even talk about it! Should Nari reteach this class, I would suggest the following: convert it to a leminar format. Get rid of the discussion post requirement, and instead replace it with active in-class participation (perhaps ask students to come in with prepared comments). Precirculate discussion questions. Provide contextual information about the cities before discussion. Make the midterm relevant, or scrap it - and the same for the map quiz. If knowledge of theorists is expected, provide the readings or say so on the syllabus beforehand. And please, give each city the same amount of time so it doesn't come across as just two Russian cities and one Ukrainian, with bits and pieces about others thrown in. Nari is a scholar of cities, and we never actually talked about his own research, which I found super strange (I wish profs talked more about what they do, and provided more visuals for class engagement. No student likes to stare at paper for the whole class, and discussion is enriched with personal experience and anecdotes)."

                "I would not recommend this course as it stands right now. The professor was verbally combative with students during seminar, large parts of the grade are left ungraded until the last moment, and the instructor seemed to struggle with stimulating the class with interesting topics to discuss during our meetings.",
                "Yeah, I think the class was really interesting and Nari has really great insights.",
                "Yes, with reservations. I'm not sure this is a great course for someone who is fresh into Yale college and doesn't have a necessary discussion-based seminar course experience under their belt. A course like this benefits from a group of students who are adequately equipped with the tools to conduct homework readings, extrapolate points, pose interesting questions, and then entertain them in class. Similarly, I think some experience or general knowledge about some period of Soviet or Russian history might prove useful; otherwise, some of the historical developments that we discussed come off as uncontextualized and therefore confusing. This class would be a great complement to another Russia/Eurasia history course. I think Nari also had expectations that many of us, if not all, had an extensive Western-canon background - name dropping theorists, philosophers, etc., expecting us to know them, although none of us had that supposedly requisite educational background. Perhaps a DS student might find some of these themes interesting, in that respect.",
                "It really depends. No if you don't have at least somewhat of an understanding of Soviet culture - it isn't required that you understand the Soviet system, but it helps to have a grasp of the Soviet way of life, and maybe to know what the urban terrain and Stalinist architectural legacy looks like on the ground today in post-Soviet spaces. Yes if you can deal with some disorganization but a highly enthusiastic professor who really does want to get to know his students. The class is fun, it was a hoot, I looked forward to going to it, but that's because my personality matched with Nari's, and this is not always going to be the case for everyone. But really, the workload is very light and Nari is very lenient, it just would have been nice to have some more feedback."
