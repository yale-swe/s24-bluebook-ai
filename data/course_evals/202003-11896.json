                "Overall, this course was good. The lectures were clear and interesting, and I liked the style of the course a lot. There were daily required but ungraded homework problems, which were helpful in making sure everyone kept up with the course. The midterms were pretty fair, although the major caveat is that the midterms were open note (see below) -- I imagine this course would feel a lot different otherwise. There weren't a lot of weaknesses in my opinion -- with the exception of a couple things about how the midterms were written (see below).",
                "The class itself was difficult to follow, but that was mainly due to the difficulty of the information being taught. It did require out of lecture or textbook sources, though.",
                "Strengths: Parr is super nice, approachable, and available to answer questions. There are short reading questions before every class, which count as participation and are helpful to redo before the exams. \r\nImprovements: The class textbook isn't very helpful for solving practice problems. The exams' time frame was too short; 55 minutes felt insufficient.",
                "Instructor taught material in a very clear way. Provided many opportunities for one-on-one help. However, I felt that expectations on homework assignments were sometimes unclear.",
                "Very good course overall, loved professor Parr and it was very well structured and organized. The only thing that could be improved is that the tests contain too many multiple choice questions where you cannot get partial credit for therefore easy mistakes can lower your grade significantly and is therefore not representative of your actual understanding of the material. For example the final exam was made of  8\/11 mc questions!",
                "The lectures were very much based on the textbook, and section reinforced both those things so that you really got the information more than once. I do wish that in the feedback we were given that the professor would give us a little bit more detail into what wasn't right about our answer, but I know that the goal is also to make us figure it out too instead of being spoonfed the answers. On psets however, I wish they were a little clearer about what exactly needed to be included in the answers because I would get points taken off for things that I didn't know were supposed to be included. I also think that the practice exams were not a good representation of what the actual midterm was going to be like.",
                "extremely hard class even for someone who loves the material and was fairly comfortable with it. Tests were extremely challenging and unforgiving. getting two questions wrong on a given test was the difference between an A and a B-. Questions were all very abstract.",
                "The course is hard but that is a given. I think that the live lectures could have been more informative if the powerpoints including sample questions within, rather than the professor coming up with them so that they were only accessible through the recorded zoom videos. However, the powerpoints were still helpful to study from and the upset problems provided great practice from applying concepts."

                "I appreciated the lectures being recorded. Although I often attended the live lectures, having the option to go back and review material I found challenging was very helpful for me.",
                "The recorded lectures were great. I got to review them when I studied.",
                "I cannot emphasize enough how much having the midterms be open note improved my learning in this course. In ochem I, I spent most of my studying time trying to memorize reaction conditions and mechanisms. Of course, I don't remember any of that now, and I left the course with a remarkably poor understanding of organic chemistry. In this course, I spent my study time thinking about chemistry, doing practice problems, and writing up reference sheets for use during the midterm. Although I have no illusions that in a year I will remember enamine chemistry, I feel that I'll be able to look at chemistry I see in other classes\/in research and have a chance of understanding what is going on, at least in general terms; in other words, I feel like I can think about chemistry now, and I'll be able to do even once I forget the details of what I learned in this course. I feel extremely grateful for that, and there is no chance that would have happened with closed note midterms. \r\n\r\nI understand the downsides of having open note midterms -- for example, many students will not accordingly not study at all. I wonder if a compromise strategy would be to allow a one-page \"cheat sheet\" in person. That way students would be forced to make a cheat sheet, which is in it of itself studying. More importantly, the cheat sheet would not be large enough for all the material being tested, so students would have to actively choose what is important to put on that. Once classes are back in person, I think this strategy would help people learn chemistry so much better. \r\n\r\nDuring COVID, I think it's critical to have open note midterms. Otherwise, despite professors' hopes, students WILL cheat. In other courses this semester and last semester, I have observed, in case after case, \"closed note midterms\" on which a significant fraction of students cheat, which is incredibly unfair to those who do not. I am grateful this class had open note midterms, because that's the only fair solution.\r\n\r\nOverall, this course adapted very, very well to COVID. The one thing is that I know an effort was made on the midterms to have primarily multiple choice questions (and fewer questions that required drawing and uploading a picture). That said, these multiple choice questions were very stressful because each question was ~10% of the grade on the midterm, so getting one wrong meant instantly a 10% drop in the grade. I'd prefer more writing questions, because there is an opportunity to show what you know and get some partial credit. Additionally, this is a tiny thing, but the multiple choice questers were often out of order (the first answer choice was often not, the second answer choice ws generally not B). This was extremely confusing.",
