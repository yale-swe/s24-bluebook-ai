I also discovered how the overarching themes of Aeneid Book 6 pertained to the Roman Empire and the lasting influence the epic poem had on the world.",
                "A stronger fundamental understanding of Latin from core constructions to grammar.",

                "Strengths: Prof. Valdivieso was quite knowledgeable/enthusiastic about the subject and incredibly nice; quizzes and exams were well designed \r\nWeaknesses: outside readings were often incredibly lengthy, dense, and convoluted, and thus hardly enhanced my the reading of the text; written assignments felt largely pointless; the number of lines assigned for translation each day felt excessive and made for an unpleasant experience",
                "The seminar format and regular assignments enforced a sense of regularity and responsibility in the course that encouraged me to keep up with the material.",
                "Strengths- Provides a useful review of grammar concepts through the class, a good introduction to not only reading a text to practice translation skills but also to discuss consistent themes that are seen in the poem. Weaknesses- Its around 50 lines per class which, unless you can quickly and easily translate Latin poetry, are incredibly time consuming. The sheer amount of work to be done emphasized working quickly rather than taking time with the text to understand how the translation is put together.",
                "Strengths: I wish I'd been taught some of these things we learned much earlier in my Latin career. Professor Valdivieso did a really great job of developing a framework through which we could look at Latin.\r\nWeaknesses: The workload is pretty high, but I don't think it could be easily lowered.",
                "Strengths: Professor Valdivieso did a great job incorporating literary analysis of the Aeneid and history relevant to the text. Unlike Aeneid classes in high school, this class is wonderful if you really want to understand the text and its global impact. Learned a ton.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this class is a lot of work. Expect 1/2 hours a night of assigned translation (especially if you're rusty at the beginning of the semester, it can be very time consuming).",
                "I learned a lot in the course, and Professor Valdivieso was always eager to help. She kept in touch with her students and met with them whenever necessary. She also went over difficult concepts that people were missing. One detail I noticed is that it proved difficult to prepare translations for class in advance when we also had a quiz to study for or a written exercise to write."

                "For anyone who is interested in Latin poetry, I think this course is an excellent introduction or for those who have seen poetry, a great review of concepts. The topics and reading are interesting and ask you to think beyond the standard interpretations of latin poetry.",
                "Yes, it has allowed me to see Latin in a new way, but that might just be because of Professor Valdivieso (in other words, not sure if this will be true in future  LATN 141 classes).",
                "If you need it for a language credit, yes. It's a lot of memorization, but especially if you did the Aeneid in high school, it's not bad. You will learn a lot.",
                "Yes, if someone is looking for an L3/L4 Latin class, I think this is a great one. The Aeneid is quite tame and similar to the AP syllabus. AlSo, Professor Valdivieso is a great professor who is always there to answer questions."
