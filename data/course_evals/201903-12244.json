   "comments": [
    "I have a really great foundational understanding of the main critical approaches to art history, which has certainly shed new light on other art historical\/theoretical readings I've done.",
    "In this course I learned about art history as a discipline more broadly. We discussed a different theme each week - some of which were definitely more challenging than others! After taking this class I am better able to understand art history as a discipline.",
    "I learned about the different methodologies in studying art history.",
    "Oh my my. I don't think anyone should feel comfortable calling themself an art historian without taking this class. In fact, you should probably only feel marginally more comfortable after taking this class. Truly stunning. You get to see how the discipline has evolved, where the critical frontier is, and how much needs to be done.",
    "In this course I learned about how to think critically about art history, how it is presented, and how it has been created or contrived. I learned about the flaws in the way that it has been taught and understood.",
    "I developed a thorough understanding of various theories of art history and learned to both apply them to how I look at and analyze art as well as critique them in a contemporary context.",
    "During this class I felt that I was able to really hone the skills and thoughts I had developed in prior art history classes. It helped me develop more of an ease during discussions and really draw from all areas of study to apply to ways of thinking. The readings were extremely interesting.",
    "A comprehensive history of art history as a subject. It was extremely useful as I developed insights on the various schools of thought within the discipline, and was able to view artworks in manifold ways and critically.",
    "I learned a lot about the foundations of the discipline of art history. As someone interested in non-western art I thought it was useful to learn about the history of art history and in doings so better understand the way that it is formulated and the way in which non-western art has traditionally been understood. This class also showed me new methods of analyzing\/understanding art.",
    "Different art history theories",
    "This course was designed so that each week focused on a different topic and we wrote short responses analyzing these readings before each class. This structure taught me to succinctly read and understand 100+ pages of text each week and synthesize the important theories \/ implications in my own words. Each class also began with a presentation and was followed by a long class discussion, the conversation especially taught me how to follow evolving ideas and contribute my own perspectives.",
    "HSAR 401 offers a solid framework for thinking through issues of racism, colonialism, sexism, etc. within the art historical canon, museum institutions, and larger academic discipline."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Sometimes the discussions took haphazard trajectories, which was certainly not always bad, but perhaps there could've been a more streamlined way to facilitate discussion. The course was well-designed, the readings very well curated, and the workload very manageable. I do think some sort of final paper\/project would've provided a bit more closure. The class ended on a bit of an unsatisfying note.",
    "Professor Rizvi is amazing!! She lead class discussion each week so well, and everyone was always really engaged. I also found the content of this class really interesting - especially the second half of the course.",
    "Honestly, it's a slog and that's kind of how it is.",
    "Strength: the content is fascinating, but can we just recognize how STUNNING Prof. Rizvi is? I will rant about how much we all loved her later, but she truly made this class amazing.\r\n\r\nWeakness: a lot of work. Also at times a bit depressing but hey that's what keeps some of us going.",
    "I think that the strengths are the presentation-discussion structure of the course. I think it works well as is.",
    "This course was highly engaging. The material was interesting, challenging, and diverse in source. The weekly presentations were also enjoyable and stimulated conversation.",
    "The strengths of this course were the extensive discussions that we had about the readings as well as current events in the art world. The discussions began with the readings but became more broad in ways that we could apply to real institutions and events. The weakness would the organization of the course. Sometimes the expectations were uneven week to week.",
    "I really like the short presentations (of weekly assignments), but feel like the time management of it could be better as we often run overtime and not everyone gets to say what they want. Maybe timing the presentations would be nice.",
    "I think 14 students was slightly too many. It was hard to have discussions",
    "Great class!",
    "This course starts with traditional readings \/ philosophers about art history (Hegel, Wolfflin, etc) and then introduces topics that are not often discussed in traditional art history theory (colonization, globalization, empires, feminism, queer art theory, ecology, environmentalism, intersectionality). These courses interact with each other as students bring in topics from previous weeks in following discussions.",
    "Strengths: Powerful breadth of subject matter (each week covers a different area of art history) and good class camaraderie (enrollment is limited to 14 students). In terms of coursework, Rizvis readings are definitely on the lighter side, and the class is structured so that work is well-distributed over the course of the semester and the pressure is off during finals period. Readings and discussions were engaging, as they dealt with high-stakes issues and covered a more diverse array of cultures and nationalities than many other art history courses. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, it felt like this class was taking on too much. Discussions would often digress from the topic at hand to subjects like whether or not states should exist, and Professor Rizvi would sometimes look for students to confirm her views rather than encouraging divergent perspectives. This means that we often neglected the readings and discussions were not grounded in visual analysis. Feedback on writing assignments was also extremely limited."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this to a student who has art historical background or an interest in art criticism!",
    "If you are an art history major this class is a requirement. It is a lot of work each week - so I would only recommend it to someone really interested in art history. Nonetheless, it was a great class!",
    "Only if you're a major, otherwise you'd be a bit crazy to take it. If you have to take it, take it with Professor Rizvi.",
    "Yes. Also take any class with Prof. Rizvi she is suuuuuuch a great professor.",
    "Yes and I have recommended it to other students.",
    "Yes, absolutely. It's a mandatory course for art history majors and it was very helpful in structuring my understanding of art history.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class to another student, even one that isn't in the major. I think its really informative and has helped with my way of approaching a piece of art.",
    "Yes - it is a requirement and it's absolutely eye-opening for art history majors. Take it with Kishwar as she really tries to engage with multiple genres of sources!",
    "Yes! esp with prof rizvi",
    "I guess yes, but if youre not a major, theres not really a point in taking it",
    "Yes!!! I would highly recommend HSAR 401 as taught by Professor Kishwar Rizvi. Honestly one of the best art history seminars I've taken. :)",
    "Absolutely! If youre an art history major, this class will shed light on the problematic history of the discipline and help you to be a more thoughtful consumer\/producer of art historical knowledge. Reasonable workload and good opportunity to connect with other students in the major."
