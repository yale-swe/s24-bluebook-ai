                "This was always a very interactive class, but I think that that is very professor-dependent. It was very fun to get to know my classmates and work closely with them on a daily basis. \r\n\r\nThe only real weakness with the way that Chinese is taught at Yale is the pacing at times: sometimes, we will take extra time to review certain grammar topics, potentially to the detriment of solidifying knowledge in other areas. However, this seemed to rarely happen.",
                "This course has a pretty high workload, which makes it difficult to enjoy at times. Additionally, not all TFs are equally helpful, so students may or may not receive the extra support during section. I also think there is not enough instruction on writing characters (I.e. stroke by stroke instruction) The strength is that students finish this course with a much higher level of Chinese skills.",
                "Each class is very engaging with student participation in speaking, homework, and presentations.\r\nWe could replace oral presentations and memorization to more consistent writing practice and application of grammar into practical speaking practice. Tutoring sessions are not very helpful, which can be replaced with speaking\/listening practice rather than reviewing grammar.",
                "I believe that the emphasis on writing characters has derailed from other aspects of learning Chinese. I understand that it is important in order to learn the characters and I think daily dictation is important, but I feel that dictations on the tests make it so I spend so much time learning to write the characters, a skill I will likely not need in the real world, that I can't spend as much time on the rest of the material. I also think tutorials should be structured differently; I find that I don't learn anything during tutorials. It just feels like doing an extra piece of homework, when I think it would be much more useful to spend the time speaking with our TAs, practicing oral questions and that kind of thing."
