The guest speakers also gave insights and exciting research findings.",
                "Greater integrated understanding of energy sources and production technologies, plus an in-depth understanding of my final presentation topic, electric cars. A great review of useful high school physics and math, plus an introduction (to me) to climate physics."

                "The strength of this course is that it encompasses different perspectives regarding energy use from scientific technology to policy-making.\r\nIn parts that consist of some physics concepts, professor could slow a bit for everyone to catch up.",
                "Strengths: Prof Prober is super kind and knowledgeable, and he brings in a variety of really special guest lecturers. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not exactly a weakness, but most of the lectures are devoted to qualitative content (don't think we did a single numbers related problem) but the homework is almost entirely quantitative.  I personally didn't mind because I learned a lot from lectures but some students I'd imagine would have more trouble with this.",

                "I couldn't find any weakness during the course.\r\n\r\nProfessor was so passionate and kind with all questions students had. TA system was also great.",
                "Strengths were the guest speakers and the group presentation. Weakness was the exam time which was not enough, in my opinion, but most people finished it.",
                "Strengths: The PSETs were quite helpful in having us synthesize \"hard\" and \"soft\" concepts from the class. Weren't too hard as long as you allowed yourself substantial time for them. Dr. Prober is a kind and caring man who tried to make our classroom an open environment for questions. \r\nWeaknesses: 3.25 hours of a STEM lecture is rather brutal, especially online. Would have liked to have some alternative ways of engaging during our class time, like talking through concepts/problems in small groups or watching more videos. Prober's slides were not always clear or organized and we ended up speeding over some things and rehashing others multiple times. Lectures didn't always prepare us for the PSETs, so a lot of self-teaching was necessary in my case."

If you learn best through in-class engagement, this course is not necessarily organized for active participation and you might not love the disorganized slides. All in all, it was not a bad class."
