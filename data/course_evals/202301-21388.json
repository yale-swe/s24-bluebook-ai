Weakness: This is somewhat of a strength in difficult times, but a big weakness is lack of structure. There is not a lot of clarity on assignments or expectations and it can make the class feel a little disjointed."

                "As an Economics student, I found the introduction to law fascinating. I went from having no idea what was going on in the legal cases we were reading to being able to spot the key points being made at the end. It almost feels like learning a new language--each case is in conversation with a wider legal context that you can't get just from reading it. For that reason alone, I would recommend the course!\r\n\r\nThat said, I think the course runs into some trouble by combining law students and econ undergrads. I found some (but not all) of the economic models less engaging because I had seen them before, and I imagine the same would be true for law students during the law section. Pay attention to whether law or economics will come first on the syllabus, because that will probably take up a majority of the time.",
