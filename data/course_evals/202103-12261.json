                "Latin grammar, etymology, and literature analysis skills were all built upon this semester. We read selections of poetry and prose spanning several centuries of Latin literature, all centered around the theme of Roman dining, an activity that often involved complex etiquette, elaborate displays of wealth, and vying for attention of social elites. We were introduced to many different authors (Horace, Catullus, Pliny, Petronius, Juvenal, Seneca) and became accustomed to the telltale signs of each author's individual style. We wrote two interpretive essays (one on poetry and one on prose), and also composed two short polished translations (again, one on poetry and one on prose), so the assignments in this course were quite balanced and built a nice breadth of skills. I was initially worried that a course under this theme would be too restrictive or too focused on a historical reconstruction of the details of a Roman meal, however neither of these worries came true whatsoever. We explored a diverse set of themes: wealth and social status, friendship, and philosophy, and our aims were mostly literary.",
                "I became a more efficient translator and read a wide variety of Latin texts, including Juvenals Satires and Plinys Epistulae. I also gained some experience in writing analytical essays that incorporated Latin sources and in forming readable and engaging English translations of Latin texts.",
                "Review of Latin grammar and reading skills, and survey of many works of Latin literature. Also learned about Roman culture, history, and the etymological basis for several modern day words in the Romance languages.",
                "Translation and literary analysis",
                "How to study better for midterms, how to engage in a class discussion",
                "This course strengthened my latin skills so much! It was very fast paced, and we jumped from various different authors and time periods, and although that was difficult, the hard work definitely payed off, as I am now much more comfortable with translating a variety of latin texts. I also developed my close reading skills in this course; in high school, we never focused so intensely on commentaries, and I enjoyed pouring over both the commentaries and various academic articles. I appreciated how class was a balance between translating/grammar help and interpreting the text.",
                "Most of my past Latin courses have been translation based, but this course definitely was more of a comprehension course which was interesting. Also, I've never had to do euphemistic translations before, and this is something the course requires you do twice during the term. Professor Solodow is also personally really interested in etymology, so that was fun to get a taste of.",
                "Food culture in Rome, poetry, satire, social critique",
                "I didnt realize how meaningful dining was not just to Roman society but to society in general. It has certainly made me more thoughtful about the culture of dining even in my own life. I also think I became better at translating and improved my understanding of grammar constructions.",
                "I learned much about the idiosyncrasies of Roman dining and the gastronomical practices and perspectives thereof. Though Roman dining was certainly a focus of the class, I think that the Latin itself stood at the forefront. There was a good balance between time spent on Latin translation and literary interpretation. My Latin reading and grammar skills improved throughout the course, and I believe I have a fairly good picture of how the Romans themselves conceptualized the acts of eating and dining.",
                "Latin reading. Discussion.",
                "I definitely think that this course improved my understanding of Roman culture, and I really liked how we learned about that culture through the specific lens of the dinner party. Moreover, I think my latin translating skills improved greatly, and I liked how we read a lot of different authors so we had experiences with many different types of Latin.",
                "Before taking this class, I felt confident in my translation abilities across a range of authors and genres. But I didn't realize how much I was missing in all the texts I'd read until I took this class. Professor Solodow has taught me how to find meaning beyond literal translation and to put everything I read into context. Now, I enjoy reading Latin much more than I did before taking this class because I can present viable interpretations and connections between texts beyond the satisfaction of puzzling out the Latin of a tricky passage. I'm excited to carry into future Classics courses the many skills I developed in this class.",
                "Learned how to read at a higher level/faster pace, learned how to write analytical essays about Latin, learned about some interesting linguistic concepts/etymology, learned about what foods Romans liked to cook.",
                "Roman dining practices, literary interpretation of prose and satire, faster and more accurate translation of latin. Personally learnt a lot about Roman cultural analysis by means of consolidating various, opposing point of views on dining. Essay writing.",
                "I learned a lot about dining culture in the Roman times and was able to explore a lot of famous texts as they originally were in Latin, being able to provide my own spin on it as the translator.",
                "I gained a knowledge of themes like simple living and moderation, and was also able to read an array of ancient texts.",

                "I gained appreciable insight into the human experiences behind the texts we read, learning about political relations, issues of free speech, and societal norms all through food-related readings!"

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: an interesting set of primary readings (buttressed by secondary scholarly readings and supplemental English reading for the passages that we didn't cover in Latin). No readings were overwhelming, and there was a great balance of prose and poetry, Golden and Silver age Latin, etc. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some classes had a bit too much time translating and not enough on interpretation; granted, it was hard to balance giving everyone a turn to translate while still having class time leftover given how large the class was. \r\n\r\nAlso, we were planning on having a genuine Roman dinner at the end of the semester, but COVID unfortunately tanked those plans.",
                "Strengths: Professor Solodow had a great working knowledge of the texts we read and a deep appreciation for Latin etymology. I enjoyed most of the works we read, especially the lavish descriptions of food in the Cena Trimalchionis, and the in-class discussions we had regarding the English translations were often engaging. The midterm, I thought, was fair. Weaknesses: The pop quizzes kept me on edge and sometimes tested tiny details in the commentary. In addition, during most classes, students were randomly called onto translate lines, and though this was a bridge course, I felt that there could be a more engaging way to spend class time. The lectures Professor Solodow gave were sometimes a bit dry, and I think we could have talked more about the historical context behind works, especially with how race and gender tied into the texts we read. Especially near the end of the semester, we rushed through texts without thinking too deeply about them, and the workload got significantly heavier later on, which I was not prepared for (Juvenal and Horace are difficult to translate, and we were not given much warning or guidance). For the first essay, we were not given a lot of detailed instructions on how to write a paper that incorporated Latin texts; we were just told that it would be like writing an English essay. Giving the class a sample essay on a different topic would have been helpful.",
                "The class was a bit large for the seminar format, and I think that since this is an L5 language course it should have a placement exam, as some classmates did not seem sufficiently prepared for the reading difficulty. If the Latin department does not want to do this, then perhaps some time in the beginning of the semester should be dedicated to grammar and strategies for difficult readings like poetry. However, I enjoyed the class and diversity of readings, and it was a great bridge course to college Latin.",
                "Solodow is a very caring and engaging professor. He likes to vary the course material so the class doesnt get dull.",
                "Very knowledgeable professor, hard to keep track of handouts though",
                "I loved this course, and I did not find many weaknesses. I think class time had a perfect mixture of of grammar and interpretation, and all of the texts were made very interesting by the professor's comments. \r\n\r\nI would personally have preferred if we limited the number of texts we looked at, and instead of looking at small sections of a lot of different texts, really read longer texts in their entirety. Though I definitely felt like all of the texts were in conversation.",
                "One big thing that has little to do with the syllabus is the type of classroom/seating arrangement. The course is listed as a lecture, but is more like a too-large seminar. Because of the great amount of people, the style of the course (some lecture but also going around and translating), and the fact that we sat in columns facing the front of the classroom, I never even knew the faces of most of my classmates. One time we came into class and the desks were arranged in a circle and just for the five minutes we were seated that way I felt I got a ton closer to the class as a whole. I think the camaraderie is really important to foster because the course content itself is not all that interesting. (Most people, from what I could gather, were taking the course to get rid of their language requirement, not because they were so interested in the subject of Roman Dining, and maybe things would be better if we could all admit that to ourselves a bit more.) \r\n\r\nIn terms of content, I found the way the course was run and the examinations of the material to be slightly disjointed. The midterm and exams were most straightforward, but especially on the first essay, we were given no prep for how to write literary criticism and lengthy literary criticism at that. That feedback may be less valid for the euphemistic translations, but still, it would have been nice to mirror/practice what we would have to do for the largest percentages of our grade at least once or twice in class as a group before being expected to do it to a high level on our own.",
                "I thought the discussions were very interesting, but I didnt find class time as valuable when we were just going over translations. Since I did the translation homework every night, I felt like I was spending a long time on homework and then was so prepared for the translating in class that class time wasnt very useful. I almost felt like I didnt need to be there sometimes since Id done the Latin reading. Also, I thought that the midterm and final requires a lot of rather tedious review of Latin that wed already read that didnt necessarily test my translating skills. Perhaps it would be more effective to have a sight passage rather than Latin weve already read? Im not sure though.",
                "The greatest strength of this course was its thematic consistency. The course's theme of dining was never lost even though we spent a great deal of time on translation. I think that for a bridge course of this nature, where translation is necessarily a focus, this thematic consistency made the course feel like something more than simply translating various pieces of Roman literature. The interpretational and cultural conversations flowed with continuity and nuance even as we switched between different authors and texts. A weakness of this course was the length of its translation assignmentsat times, it felt rushed to go over the assigned translations in class. Additionally, it sometimes felt as though not enough attention was given to certain Latin passages (though, as an upper level course, this might be by design). I believe I might have profited from a slower, more deliberate review of the Latin.",
                "I think the clarity of the syllabus and the quality of the teaching were two strengths of the course. I always loved the professor's digressions in class about everything from Roman culture to the etymologies of different words. We always had really good class discussions, and I didn't think that the workload was too high. The only weakness I would say was the difficulty in determining one's grade in the course since no grades were posted to canvas. That being said, I think the grading was fair.",
                "The greatest strength of the course is Professor Solodow. I would be hard pressed to name a better teacher of mine, whether in my Yale career or previously. He has a unique ability to elucidate deeper/hidden meanings from the texts in such a clear and approachable way that it felt class discussions could have gone on without end because of all the supplemental or individual thoughts students contributed to the conversation. Even more importantly, he found (and encouraged us to find) connections between the texts in ways that have made me consider the ways past works I've read could be connected and compared. From a practical point of view, the class has a reasonable, consistent workload and Solodow is a fair, quick, and detailed grader. I do wish I could have had a clearer picture of my standing in the class since no grades were posted on Canvas all semester and it can be difficult to estimate how well you're doing in the class based on individual grades handed back on paper assessments/assignments.",
                "Strengths: I like that there were a variety of assignments (quizzes, midterms, essays, translations), and overall I enjoyed the readings we did and felt that they truly fully covered the topic of Roman dining, and I learned a lot about Roman culture. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- handouts (too many): I often did not look at the handouts ever again after receiving them in class. Some of them were helpful but others were not. I wish, at least, that they were posted on canvas so that I didn't have to have so many pieces of paper.\r\n- class was soporific: I wish we had done more of a variety of engaging activities because sometimes the class periods went by so slowly\r\n- inconsistency with cold-calling: sometimes people would be called on two classes in a row and others would not be called on for weeks\r\n- quizzes: I wish the grading on the quizzes had been a bit nicer, considering we hadn't gone over the text in class yet\r\n- readings for homework: they were often too long and I wish we had just saved some of it to do at sight during class",
                "Strengths: the breadth of the course. The different perspectives on Roman dining and the different literary mediums they were presented in. Professor Solodow made sure that we were all on the same page translation-wise and devoted a lot of time to helping us. Weakness: Sometimes, towards the end, the class got a little tedious with translations.",
                "strengths: content was engaging, professor solodow is very sweet\r\nweaknesses: the cold-calling and surprise quizzes gave me (at least for me) a lot of unnecessary anxiety, I understand it's to help maintain engagement but for someone who's pretty much always engaged but often has trouble speaking on the spot it becomes very frightening",
                "There is no clear or helpful feedback from the professor, the large class size was a hindrance in students' ability to get the most out of discussions, the class is done in a bland and boring fashion (translate a bunch of lines for homework each night and spend all of class just going over those translations), etc.",
                "The class was strong in its emphasis on translations. My translation skills improved. \r\n\r\nHowever, I take much issue with how the content/course was taught. In almost every text we were assigned, slavery played a central role (e.g. enslaved people who were preparing the food/serving the guests made the Roman dinner parties possible in the first place, some passages were spectacles of violence against enslaved people, etc.) but the class had very little mention of how slavery was the underpinning of not only Roman dining, but also the Roman empire. The only time we had a formal, focused discussion on slavery was when someone brought it up to the professor, and even then it only happened in the last month of the semester. Themes of equality at the Roman dinner table are discussed throughout the semester, but the professor rarely mentions how slavery factors into this. Similarly, there was little discussion of ancient conceptions of race/ethnicity. Many texts had racial subtext (e.g. Roman poets favoring lighter skin) or had overt racist tropes, but our review of the material in class often missed that. Slavery and understandings of race/ethnicity in the ancient world were core topics in our class, yet they were overwhelmingly left out. There should have been more care and attention towards them.\r\n\r\n*Note for trans and non-binary students: Professor Solodow uses \"he\" or \"she\" pronouns when referring to students and does so frequently/unprompted. As a trans student, this made me feel uncomfortable at times. Personally, I did not say anything/correct him, but if you are concerned about pronouns, it might be a good idea to tell him at the start of semester."

                "I would not recommend this course. For personal reasons, I found this course to be really anxiety inducing. It wasn't a very comfortable atmosphere to translate it, and because of the lack of camaraderie and the great number of students, I never felt emotionally invested in the course or the other people I was taking it with, which personally I find really important when studying the Classics.",

                "Yes, regardless of whether you're considering a Classics major. The professor is amazing, the content is entertaining, and the workload is definitely manageable as long as you have a strong grip on Latin grammar. It's been by far my favorite class this semester and I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to take a fun, stimulating Latin class.",
                "Yes -- it was the right level for me as someone who took Latin for several years before college and wanted to fulfill the language requirement.",
                "The course was fun! I would definitely recommend taking the course if the topic interests you. Especially because the subject is welcome relief to the highbrow, more serious Latin that is often taught in classes. Yet beyond the superficially amusing, there are still very serious topics being discussed by various authors and by us in the class. Professor Solodow is so knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the subject so in-class discussions were very rewarding. I came away with a lot more than I would have through pure translation alone.",
                "yes if you're good at learning languages and interested in the subject",
                "No! There will definitely be another Latin course that has a greater amount of payoff for the amount of time and work that you will have to put into this course. Professor Solodow is a great person, just not the best teacher. You will be given no clear or helpful feedback, only notes on your assignments saying all the things you did wrong. When you ask the professor how you can improve, the response will be something along the lines as \"There's not much I can say\". Classes are also unnecessarily boring. You will be given a large amount of text to translate, and if you don't offer a perfect translation during class, the professor will make that clear by his reaction. Almost every class, save for maybe 4 or 5, was entirely spent going over the translation for homework, which made the classes tedious and stressful, considering the fact that people get randomly called on. If this isn't warning enough, many people came in as prospective Classics majors, and after taking this class say that they've changed their mind.",
                "This class primarily focuses on translating Latin (both for homework and assessments). As an L5 class, that makes sense, but I was disappointed by how the content behind the Latin passages was taught. We did learn about Roman dining customs, but discussions on how Roman slavery played a central role in those dinner parties were noticeably absent  almost every text discussed Roman slavery as well as ancient conceptions of race/ethnicity, but the professor overwhelmingly left that out (and when it was discussed, it was more of a superficial acknowledgement that enslaved people were there and a literal description of what they were doing in those passages, without any further thoughtful examination). We only had a focused discussion on slavery and race/ethnicity in the Roman empire when someone brought it up, but even then it was in the last month of the semester. \r\n\r\nWhiteness pervades the Classics and studies of Roman history/literature. This was the case at my high school, and as a first-year curious about Classics at the college level, I was hoping for something different. Unfortunately, this class was very much the same as my high school experiences. Our class did have some moments where we discussed slavery and race/ethnicity, though these discussions were limited. I wish that the class had engaged more thoughtfully and more rigorously with anti-racist scholarship. \r\n\r\n*Note for trans and non-binary students: Professor Solodow uses \"he\" or \"she\" pronouns when referring to students and does so frequently/unprompted.
