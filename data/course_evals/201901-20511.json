   "comments": [
    "A great engagement with the fundamentals of architectural design, without explicitly designing structures in the \"traditional\" sense",
    "This studio teaches you more about traditional methods of architecture and approaches to design. It will also force you to become more familiar with materials and construction methods.",
    "I learned how to take a conceptual idea and make it into a physical form. I also learned many modeling and drawing techniques.",
    "I learned how to think critically about space and develop my own method of working. I learned how to question myself and to justify my work and processes.",
    "I learned a lot! Mostly added to my portfolio but also leaned a lot about design.",
    "This course helped us strengthen our technique and sharpen our visual perspectives. We learned to present our ideas in a coherent way and to strive for a finished result, whether that would translate in our drawings or models.",
    "Throughout the majority of the course we never received any formal education on things such as how to draw a plan or section, how to use photoshop or illustrator, how to use rhino, how to make a mold for a cast.... Yet by some miracle, I found that all these things I was unable to do in January, I was able to do come the final review. At times I felt it would be really helpful for some more explicit instruction when it came to drawing and model making techniques, but as with all studio courses so far, the vast majority of learning is done through experimentation and dialogue with peers who are also experimenting. As noted, this method has proved effective, if not particularly efficient."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I loved that we began with food",
    "This course is designed with the assumption that the incoming class has had prior training in technical drawings. Our class never received that training, so it would have been helpful if we could have learned it early in the semester or during a prior semester. We ended up resorting to Google to figure out how to make accurate plans and sections.",
    "The obvious weakness is that the course is all consuming in a way thats devastating to personal health and wellness as well as to the coursework of other classes. The strengths are numerous, and I wouldnt want to be in any other major.",
    "I think this was a great course. I think that there's a large leap between exploring food and creating inhabitable space, which wasn't really addressed. Our year in the major has been way more exploratory and we haven't really been asked to design a \"building\" in the most conventional definition of the word until the second half of this semester. So I think it would have been helpful to have a conversation about the basics of structures (doors\/windows\/stairs\/etc), when and how they might be used, and how they can be shown in drawings. Jumping in scale is difficult to do, especially when we've never been really asked to design a room before, so in the future it'd be great to acknowledge this jump and what challenges come with designing bigger and bigger spaces.",
    "The feedback was helpful but felt too prescriptive at times and I had trouble finding my own voice within their words.",
    "I would like the funding to be changed so that we get funding at the beginning of the semester rather than the end but besides that it's ok.",
    "This course only has strengths. It taught us a tremendous amount.",
    "Definitely one of our most well-run studios - assignment deliverables were relatively clear, we received feedback 2-3x \/ week on our progress, and pin-ups seemed appropriately spaced out. The work, as always, is tremendous, but you develop your skills a lot by the end of the semester.",
    "Overall a really strong studio. The worst part was the way we rotated through tfs for desk crits. I think it would have been highly beneficial to assign one tf to each student and have them be the go-to, rather than having to rexplain thinking every class and waste valuable time going back and forth. I also think it would be helpful if the teaching staff was more on the same page in terms of the goals of the studio. Often there was a struggle between broad clarity and highly specific technical detail and as undergrads we don't have time to perfect both."
