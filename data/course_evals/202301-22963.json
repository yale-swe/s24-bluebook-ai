                "Prof Bergemann only teaches for the first half of the class, and the rest is taught by Phillip. Class is very open-ended and students present for half of the sections.",
                "Strengths: Course materials, such as lecture slides and readings, were extremely well-developed and thought out. Low workload.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This was not a seminar; it was a series of highly technical, two-hour long lectures with few windows for student participation and meaningful contributions (although participation is supposed to be part of our grade). Content was not well-adapted for an economics seminar (more appropriate for CS). Engagement fell off after the first few sessions, with deviations from the syllabus in all regards. Most students were on their laptops doing other things, while the instructors droned on at the front of the classroom. There was absolutely zero feedback given at any point in the semester, including none for the two presentations and final paper draft; this means no student had any idea what their grade might be. Having one professor for the first half of the semester and another professor for the second half is strange; unclear expectations for presentations, final paper, and the course as a whole due to this (instructors could have communicated with each other better). The best part of the course was Prof. Aleh Tsyvinskis surprise guest lecture (unmentioned on the syllabus), as he learned everyones names and engaged each student carefully.",
                "The strengths of this course is definitely the two wonderful professors who are very passionate about blockchains. They are both receptive to feedbacks and very willing to spend time with students. The guest lectures were also engaging. The only weakness is that I wish we had more students taking the course to make the discussions more lively!"

                "Yes! I think with all the hype surrounding bitcoin and crypto in general, it is important to understand the underlying technology and design through a course like this.",
