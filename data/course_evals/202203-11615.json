                "I appreciated the structure of this course, and enjoyed the lectures. I think one way that it could be improved would be by slowing the course down (spending more time on certain topics such as game theory).",
                "I think it would be helpful for the OH for this class to occur more often. I also think it would be helpful for sections to be longer than 50 minutes because my group often did not complete the section questions. I also wish this class took the PSETs more into account.",
                "I think the professor and lectures are excellent. The material is very well organized and expectations are made clear. I don't think there were any weaknesses. I wish problem sets had comments about why points were taken off and for what questions.",
                "Strengths: lots of real-life application and examples; put together in a way that maximized my learning; wonderful that the lectures were recorded so that I could rewatch if I missed something.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:",
                "This course is very well structured and organized to give students without any experience a solid introduction to economics.",
                "I wish there was more discussion of social, environmental, and political impacts of economic systems, but perhaps that is included in a future class. The class was well structured and there was a clear line from lectures, to p-sets, to exams.",
                "This course was insanely well designed overall. Great teaching by Cormac. A ton of office hours throughout the week. Consistent due dates. Multiple review sessions for exams. Great discussion section leaders. No complaints.",
                "The strengths of this class are that there are a lot of resources available for our success. There are many office hours and lots of practice exams.",
                "Strengths - organized, help available to students\r\nWeaknesses - can be fast-paced at points",
                "The course was very fast-paced, which means that it was sometimes difficult to keep up with the material. However, the course directors made external resources incredibly and fantastically accessible  peer tutoring sessions, TA office hours, and professor appointments were my lifelong throughout the course. If I was struggling with the material, pace, or class as a whole, I felt as though I almost always had somewhere to turn to.",
                "Strengths: Cormac is an amazing professor who truly cares about his students, even in such a large lecture class. \r\nWeaknesses: Lectures sometimes started to become a bit boring towards the end. Perhaps more engaging activities or videos to break up the lecture could make it easier for students to stay actively engaged the whole class. Also, the TFs pretty much do not provide feedback on psets, and then all of sudden on the exams, they take off points for things that were never pointed out earlier.",
                "strengths: encourages us to reflect on and understand the things we learn, rather than memorize them. concepts are intuitively explained in multiple ways. the workload is light but selective, and i feel that the homework actually helped me learn. learning in a large lecture room was fun and definitely an important experience. useful and interesting material. massive team involved in teaching, so you can easily get support.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the sections weren't always useful. lots of people got the answers to psets sort of given to them there, such that they were screwed for the exams. don't do that - make sure you understand the material taught in class and can do the questions independently. though you don't need to understand calculus at all, you need a SOLID understanding of graphs and quadratic algebra, so make sure your non-calculus maths is on point.",
                "It was accessible since there were online recordings of the lectures that I could rewatch. The slides uploaded before class also helped a lot. The TFs were also available for help most of the week with lots of office hours. Overall, an introductory course with lots of resources.",

                "Strengths: Pretty well taught, an amazing professor, a generous curve if you're just trying to coast (Although it is quite difficult to get an A), and an abundance of office hours. The PSets also only take an hour or two to complete.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Often felt disorganized when it came to examinations, section often felt like it confused me more than it helped me",
                "I found that this course had no weaknesses.\r\n\r\nIt was incredibly well structured and well taught, in a way that encouraged engagement of students. I also found that the discussion sections were incredibly helpful and allowed me to learn much more than without them.",

                "I really enjoyed this class! Cormac was a wonderful and engaging professor, and his lectures were super fun to attend in-person, but it was possible to take this course asynchronously as well (lectures were posted online). Sections and office hours were very accessible, available, and helpful, and the availability of practice materials on canvas made reviewing for exams easy. Sometimes, psets were graded harshly/unclearly, and I felt as if I had to attend office hours just to know HOW to word my answers for full points, but otherwise, this course was great.",

There are lots of office hours and help sessions. Weaknesses: the exams were slightly too hard and are most of your grade",

                "STRENGTHS: Good professor. If Professor Cormac O'Dea is teaching, TAKE this class. He's a pretty funny guy and made otherwise dry concepts fun to think about. And things also make sense. Also, the content is important to learn, the syllabus builds on incrementally which is always great, and tests are graded fairly. WEAKNESSES: the only thing is you'll have to be able to adjust to a large lecture format. Otherwise, I'm happy with this experience.",
                "I loved the course material covered, but I feel that the course could move just a tad faster in the beginning and slower near the middle and end.",
                "Some strengths of this course are that the lecture slides were relatively easy to follow and the brief review at the beginning of each lecture was incredibly helpful. There were also plentiful office hours and communication was clear. \r\nA weakness is that the problems sets do not really affect your grade and in my opinion they should.",
                "Strengths: professor ODea creates a supportive and encouraging classroom environment, lecture slides are easily accessible, use of surveys + student responses with tech in lecture is engaging, lots of additional support through office hours + peer tutoring\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: application of lecture concepts to PSETs is largely independent, wish this was facilitated more though Discussion Sections. DS should focus more on solving old midterm + final problems together or questions similar to PSETs, because DS questions sometimes seemed unecessarily more difficult than actual homework problems",
                "Strengths are that the professor is really good. A weakness is that the level of student engagement and motivation for a large lecture course is naturally low.",
                "I believe the exams are weighted disproportionately highly and the PSets are weighted very little. Furthermore the feedback for the PSets is not condusive to learning from your mistakes - my comments included a total of \"minor issues -1 point\" which is not very clear. \r\n\r\nThe course is explained very intuitively and sections help with general understanding.",
                "A strength was the abundance of resources, including office hours, peer tutor hours, discussion section, review sessions, and many, many practice problems available. The p-set workload was reasonable. The course is excellently organized given the huge class size. An improvement  is that the pace in class oftentimes feels a bit slow and sometimes I wish that Prof. O'Dea would answer some of the more niche/advanced questions because they are interesting and encourage further investigation into economics.",
                "Strengths: The lecture was organized, well-paced, and easy to understand.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish our individual problem sets had been marked with incorrect answers, and not just the solutions posted.",
                "I think that sections could be more engaging and material based (rather than practice problems).",
                "I think there are many examples brought up in class that were emphasized equally to foundational concepts. If the instructors could have made it more clear which topics were core to the class and which others were more explanatory tools that would have been helpful. I also think an outline of all the testable topics would have been helpful (such as a list on canvas to refer back to). I also feel that subtle nods to the calculus of the topics we are talking about every so often would certainly have helped with my understanding. Instead, this course ignored the existence of calculus and forced us to use a less comprehensive algebraic approach. While I understand that this course does not require calculus and focuses on high school level math, it would be very helpful to those who do understand calculus to see the relationship. This would only require the instructor to say a few words every so often explaining the relationship.",
                "The course provided a solid foundation to economics. However, the course felt disengaging due to not being able to apply the material to larger problems and current issues.",
                "I loved how the lectures were structured - they were very organized and well-explained. The strengths are that the problem sets helped to reinforce the topics and the TA's office hours helped a lot whenever you needed it.",
                "The course was pretty well designed and the lectures were effective and sections allowed for more in-depth instruction.",
                "The biggest strength are the amount of office hours and peer tutors. Another strength are how good the class recordings are. There are no major weaknesses.",
                "Although most introductory courses aren't the most interesting, I thought the course covered most things we need to know.",
                "having recorded lectures is so so so helpful. would be great to spread OH out more so theres at least one per day. cormacs generally a great teacher but he gets super confusing at times bc he changes the words he uses n that messes up my flow",
                "I don't believe this course has any major weaknesses. One strength of this course is that there are a ton of resources available to students who are struggling with the material.",
                "Strengths: very well organized, lots of resources\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the usefulness of discussion sections greatly varied depending on the TA",
                "The course would be better if there were more established links between the course and the textbook. The textbook was rarely referenced, so it would be better if each lecture could provide pages in the textbook that accompany the lecture and maybe solutions to end-of-chapter problems in the textbook.",
                "the learning environment created was great so no complaints",
                "Organization of lectures, recordings are very well designed, TFs are very helpful",
                "It was a good course, potentially the use of more practice questions for the exam would be helpful.",

                "it was difficult to come to lecture in person as the semester went on, grateful for the video but then i feel bad for not experiencing it in person",
                "The instructor was very engaging and welcoming, and he also was humorous which helped as well. His slides were also extremely clear most of the time, so I didn't have issues when looking over the slides on my own time (the lectures were also recorded).",
                "I really liked my section teacher and thought that she helped clarify a lot of concepts very well. However, I realized from talking with my classmate that I got lucky with my teacher and that some of their teachers were not very helpful in explaining concepts to them--a possible weakness that could be addressed. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, some of the questions on the exams (particularly midterm 2) were very hard to solve or even grasp based on what we covered in sections and in lectures.",
                "I dont think the class is very engaging due to the fact that its such a big lecture. Professor Cormac tries to make it engaging as possible tho.",

                "Strengths: very supportive class with supportive and responsive professor, tons of office hours and peer tutor hours.\r\nWeaknesses: lectures sometimes became monotonous - the real world examples and in-class participation were nice though! \r\n\r\nClass could be improved by incorporating for real world examples and in-class participation, or even pauses in lecture for students to discuss what they think the answer will be",
                "Strengths included the clarity of lectures, the availability of peer tutoring and office hours, and the conceptual nature of the problem sets.",
                "I found most things pretty easy to understand and there were plenty of resources if I needed help, but I have a good bit of (non-formal) background in economics. Some friends of mine who did not found the course more challenging, but I think there is plenty of support available for students who are struggling  the impetus is on them to take advantage of it.",
                "Overall good course, professor could go in more depth on topics he knows hes going to test",
                "I believe that considering the class is so large it is hard to maintain engagement, but overall the course was well designed,",
                "The course was taught better than the rest of mine. Professor ODea teaches at a good speed with clarity.",
                "Professor Odea was very engaging and taught the course well.",
                "I think that this course moves really quickly. A benefit of that is that the students just learn a ton of material -- it is really amazing how much knowledge I've come away with this semester. But a drawback is that it can be hard to follow along, especially in long lectures that have a ton of people",
                "comprehensive overview of microeconomics and the slides were detailed and the professor offered plenty of practice to get to know the material better.",
                "Strengths: Cormac O'Dea, 100%! If you're thinking of taking ECON 115, definitely take it with Professor O'Dea. He makes a genuine effort to listen to (and act upon!) student feedback, and his lectures are clear and engaging, with interactive polls and real-world examples built in. He clearly cares about his students and wants to provide all students with a fundamental understanding of basic econ (not just for econ/finance bros, but for everyone even mildly interested in the subject). Psets don't take long at all (~2 hours) and help to build upon lecture concepts. Weaknesses: Not any that I can think of! Lectures can be a bit long, but that's just due to the nature of the class, and they're still engaging.",
                "The class was very well organized. Cormac is a nice guy and is always on top of his game. Not too much work.",
                "The course does cover a lot of content really fast, but I felt like everything was clearly explained by Professor O'Dea in the lectures. I wish more time was spent in class demonstrating Pset questions because I was really confused on how to apply what we learned in class on our Psets most of the time. Also, some of the peer tutors were also confused themselves so that was not helpful.",
                "Was unsatisfied that one midterm/final could make or break the grade. Would like some variation with assignments so that one bad day doesn't ruin it all.",
                "weakness: super hard class if you had no previous background in econ. unfair how many students took ap econ or econ at all in high school and did much better which lowers the curve. i feel like the things we learn are too theoretical and can't be very applied (ie: learning excel or certain skills) \r\n\r\nstrength: many students in class, so can work on psets",
                "Strengths: It's highly conceptual, which aids students in understanding their true interest, or lack thereof, in economics.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the lectures include interesting, but unnecessary information and I would prefer this time to be used reviewing the more important concepts that are often difficult to fully grasp.",
                "Strengths: Interesting lectures, teaches you to think like an economist. Lectures are recorded so you can always go back, psets are made shorter during exams to ease stress. \r\nWeaknesses: Section leaders can go fast at times making it hard to stay caught up during section.",
                "Strengths: the information was taught in a very concise and digestible way \r\n\r\nWeakness: I found it difficult to see how different topics connected to each other. There would be times where connections were assumed and I didn't know why they were assumed because topics are taught individually and not as a whole.",

                "I wish this course had been taught with calculus, since many of the graphs were derivatives of each other. Teaching fellows did not seem to care about student learning. During my discussion section, my teaching fellow wrote out the steps to each of the problems on the chalkboard as soon as we read the question without leaving any time for us to try the problem ourselves. I think the lecture should incorporate solving more problems, rather than simply discussing concepts, since the exams and problem sets are not conceptual, but problem focused.",
                "The size of the class sometimes hindered its efficiency. Maybe Econ 110 would have been q better fit for me.",
                "Strengths: Lots of resources for extra help (office hours, peer tutoring, study groups, etc.)\r\nCons: Discussion sections can often be very fast paced and hard to follow",
                "I think the strengths would definitely include the professor, teaching resources, and recorded online lectures. For this class, there were a lot of resources to help students succeed, and the professor always taught the material in a very presentable way---which was important since much of the material was dry. However, the curving of the class was a bit stressful, especially since most of the grade was based on exams (rather than the problem sets).",
                "A strength I found was that lectures were engaging and interesting so I never lost focus while in class. One of the negatives I found was that the class was really fast for note taking but I think that is a skill I learned and will help me.",

                "The strengths of this course include the fact that there is so many opportunities for help with office hours and peer tutoring. It is also a relatively interesting topic which helps a lot. A weakness is that it can be hard to know what thought process one should use when working on more complex questions that may not have been reviewed in class or section.",
                "A strength is the lecture recordings being accessible and easy to access. Another advantage was the level of the problem sets. They were not overly challenging, but they had some tougher questions at times.",
                "It was a very large class which was tough to learn however it was taught well",
                "I think the lectures could be streamlined, but the textbook was very informative.",

                "I don't see any weaknesses. The strengths are this course was very informative.",
                "Some weaknesses were with the help of teaching fellows. Often, after attending multiple office hours, teaching fellows gave a different responses on how to solve the same problem, sometimes using advanced mathematics and other methods than what was taught in class. Additionally, I found the PSETs to be quite difficult and sometimes very little related to the lectures, although, this is also a strength because it helped me develop intuition on the topics.",
                "The office hours were way too packed with students to have any questions answered",
                "Professor O'Dea made a great effort to make the class engaging. The course, though, seems to be weakly tied together. Problem sets and exam questions have varying errors and confusing language, oftentimes resulting in students making mistakes that could be avoided if the teaching team made an effort to check their assignments prior to uploading them for students to complete.",
                "The strengths are how in depth the course goes with the material. The weakness of the course is in what order the material is taught.",

                "Attending office hours more frequently was something I learned to do.",
                "I struggled with midterms and was pretty strong with problem sets. This could have been improved by me taking the time to review content more often.",
                "Lecture setting is difficult to focus on",
                "The strength is that there are tons of resources available for people who are struggling. The weakness was that the psets were not always graded on time so it was difficult to keep track of what you were understanding",
                "Very engaging lectures!",
                "I think this course teaches a lot of info but overall its very manageable and organized. I dont think there is possibility for leaps and bounds in improvement, the course was run well.",
                "Great lectures that were in depth and interesting. The course is very large.",
                "I think more tutor resources would be helpful.",
                "Since it is a big lecture course, it was run very smoothly with regular assignments and office hours. Having the lectures recorded was also useful.",
                "I think the lecture format was a bit difficult to stay engaged",
                "An immense strength of this class was the posting of lectures online. For economics specifically, this format was so helpful as I watched the online lectures many times: to take my original set of notes, but also to study for exams, or answer questions I had on specific segments that had been taught. A weakness of this class is, in my opinion, how the grades are calculated. As a first-year who took this class in my first semester, as many of my peers were as well, I was acclimating to the lecture environment, test format, and the consequence that the tests basically made up my whole grade. Based on the discussion I've heard surrounding this class, it is most discouraging for first-time economics takers or those who don't have much exposure to the field. Considering the demographic of the economics study as a whole, especially at an institution like Yale, I think this is one of the places where the potential for diversity in future economists is lost, as many students in their first semester and first year take a grade (based on three exams) as a message about whether or not they should pursue this field.",
                "The amount of resources this course provides in terms of office hours and past materials, complements the lectures and sections in a very helpful way. The only weak point for me personally was the format of review sessions before midterms and finals, in which I didn't find myself very focused and the engagement of the TA quite restricted. If there were maybe more review sessions organized with limited capacity, for which students would sign up for, maybe like exam focused section style sessions, this would help maintain the collaborative aspect but keeping it efficiently focused.",
                "Strengths: lectures are recorded, professor is flexible and interacts with the students during lectures, multiple teaching fellows and peer tutors, who are flexible\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "Strengths: Easy to learn",
                "Some strengths of this course are the resources that are provided and the ability to do as much practice as you want.",
                "Strength is that the lectures are recorded and are pretty attentive in-person. On days I was sick or just felt wrong, I could decide not to attend the lecture and just take notes off the recordings. But attending lectures in-person is much better than recordings, however, for both understanding and paying attention to the actual topic at hand. Weaknesses are that sometimes it's difficult to apply theory (lecture) to application (psets/tests). Because the lecture mostly focuses on theory and not really application, sections with TF is used to supplement application. However, there isn't a clear connection from theory to application even then, and I recommend reading the textbook to supplement learning. If one has only a bit of knowledge of economics or less, the textbook is more important than emphasized in the class. If you read the textbook, do the lectures, and attend the sections, you'll be set. Otherwise, you'll probably struggle even if you attend all the lectures and sections. I emphasize this.",
                "Strengths: support network from TAs/DS/ PTs and recorded lectures",
                "I think one weakness is that the lecture format can be a bit distracting, because not all students are focused at all times. I think Professor ODea did a good job trying to correct this in the back half of the semester, however.\r\n\r\nI think its strength is that is the course material is all very practical and applicable, which makes it extremely interesting, at least for me.",
                "a bit boring and theoretical honestly",
                "The primary strength was the teaching model. A glaring weakness, however, was the heavily theoretical nature of the course. It could be improved by increasing the amount of real world application.",
                "The strengths were due in part to Cormac, who was a fantastic teacher. One thing that could be added in following lectures is doing more practice problems in lecture, similar to the ones that appear on our problem sets. I also believe that the midterm's weight is rather heavy and could be reduced by 5% per each exam. The primary weakness was the lack of transparency with the TA grading for midterms. Though they adhered to a rubric that was made available for us to see, oftentimes they allocated points in a way that did nothing to acknowledge the working proficiency of the student and often would resort to providing a very low score on select questions.",
                "One of the strengths is the lecture being so big that most likely someone will ask a question you were thinking about. On top of that it seems as though The sheer number of office hours to support the students led to there being such access to knowledge that no concept will remain not understood.",
                "I personally struggle in large lecture formats but that cant be helped",
                "Strengths- sections were very helpful\r\nWeaknesses- problem set/exam material didnt match up with what was taught in class, slides were unreadable and Canvas (format was also off when I downloaded them), the way certain concepts were explained in lectures was extremely confusing, pace in lectures was generally very quick",
                "Strengths: intuitive, very accessible regardless of previous experience; weaknesses - more incentive to interact on smaller settings, i.e. discussion section attendance, more enforcement of the study groups, more intuitive TAs",
                "Strengths: lots of support for learning. A lot of working material to practice for exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class is taught as an introductory course, but I feel that much more could be done to properly introduce students into the subject. Some topics are very abstract and hard to follow, and could have been explained in more detail to promote understanding.",
                "I think section are very useful for this class. They give the student an opportunity to work on problems and ask questions in a smaller environment.",
                "I think sometimes the language of certain ideas is over explained and it makes it super confusing to keep track of.",
                "The strength of this course is that it is a great introduction for those who have never taken economics before. Its weakness is that at times it can be somewhat fast-paced and hard to follow.",
                "Great lectures and p-set problems.",
                "I think office hours and peer tutoring could be structured a bit better, as it was hard to find individual help a lot of the times.",
                "The way the content is organized is helpful to the learning because it flows well so that the concepts are intuitive and interlinked. The strengths of this course have to do with how the course is taught, which was very effective. The content was engaging and often related to real world examples to help us students think about economics beyond the classroom. I think some of the weaknesses stem from the fact that it is a large introductory course, leaving little room for individual questions to be answered all the time.",
                "Could have been more review/more intensive problem sets, and the sections could have been significantly more engaging",
                "Good course",

                "There could be more one-on-one opportunities with TA's for questions. The professor is great.",
                "I think the recorded lectures really helped. I think the class size being too big is a fundamental obstacle that makes lectures less engaging. Also the in person lectures feel too slow.",
                "solid knowlegetoo many people",
                "Professor O Dea is very engaging - the course is easy to follow.",
                "I think that since the course is so popular, there were always a lot of resources for the course, like well-made slides that were also posted to Canvas and peer tutoring and lots of office hours. A weakness may be that the class sometimes felt a little too large, and that somehow led me to care a little bit less about the class.",
                "The TFs and Professor O'Dea are exceptional clarifying voices and instructors, respectively. Also, the opportunities for help outside of the lecture were a great strength of the course.",

                "The course was a very large lecture, which in itself was a weakness because it was difficult to focus or get individual feedback. However, since it was so large, the resources were plentiful and the number of helpful teaching assistants and office hours was an advantage.",
                "The strengths of the course are the professor and all of the resources that are made available to the students in the course. The weakness of the course is that it is quite a large lecture which sometimes becomes distracting.",

                "The strengths of the course was the professor teaching it. He was really thorough and explained everything that was needed on the exam. However, one of the weaknesses of this course was the large lecture and support. For example, I think during the teaching discussion problem sets could be gone over because I struggled most with the problem sets.",
                "Strengths: both in person and virtual, easily followed organization of themes, great instructor and TAs, lots of help if you need it \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: When the basic supply and demand model is established in the course, it became difficult for me to understand when other economies were introduced. \r\n\r\nWays to improve: other than maybe a quick intro to economy types in the first lecture, nothing much! I loved this course.",
                "Strengths- ample office hours and support",
                "The lectures are recorded, so I can always look back on previous concepts to get a better understanding. In addition, this course has a ton of teacher assistants and peer tutors, which was an extremely valuable resource for me this semester. I think that the course could improve if it added more interactive surveys through each lecture.",
                "I think the strength that I found in this course was not only could you learn in class but then you could rewatch and learn again though the videos which in the end helped me a lot. I would say a weakness in this course was that it could be hard at times to find a group to study or work with since it was a such a big class it could make it difficult to connect.",
                "I think that a major strength of this course is the sheer amount of study resources that are provided to students. Practice tests and problem sets from previous years are a major help when studying.",
                "The strengths are the plethora of office hours and review sessions. Weaknesses are focusing on basic theory instead of complex evaluations in the lectures, giving too many problems for sections which often resulted in us not covering all the material, and lack of clear feedback in problem sets.",

The gulf between the material we cover in lectures and the problems on psets and for exams is quite large, and I still wish we had a better system for connecting these two aspects of the class together conceptually.",
                "Strengths: Great professor, engaging lectures\r\nWeaknesses: Problem sets sometimes ask for recall/recollection instead of interesting problems or applications. Since interesting applications require recall, I think it would be more efficient to focus on interesting problems that require more thinking.",
                "strengths: lots of practice problems and resources were posted for students. \r\nweaknesses: lots of concepts and lessons crammed together, a lot of information to retain for exams",

                "There were not any noticeable weaknesses of this course. I felt this course gave a lot of resources to accommodate everyone: many office hours, slides/lectures posted and recorded, discussion sections.",
                "There was a lot of fluff that could have been cut out. its an hour and fifteen minute long class, and it does not need to be this long to cover the important stuff. There should be cliff notes of main takeaways from each lecture so students can more efficiently learn without scrolling through the lecture vides for fifteen minutes of content.",
                "I think that there could have been more interactive activities in lecture.",
                "I think that the exams were too mathematically oriented. Thoughout the semester lectures were the theoretical componenets, but reallly it was only section that needed to be atteneded to succeed on exams and therefore in the class.",

                "The course is well taught and well structured. A weakness of the course is that grade cutoffs are unclear. For example , it is never stated what grade would be an A in the curve. Also no feedback is given to PSETs, which deters student learning.",
                "The strength of this course is the gradin criteria. For the tests to be on curves is a game changer for a lot of students. A weakness is the sheer size of the class, which makes it a little more difficult to learn.",
                "Strength: the fact that everyone takes it, so you can always consult friends or TAs, lots of office hours/review session opportunities to make sure you are learning. Finals and midterms reflect the practice materials. You only need basic algebra. Cormac is the sweetestjust take this course if its with Cormac!\r\nWeakness: not much really, is a large lecture so the pitfalls that come with that, but nothing really unexpected.",
                "I improved my critical thinking abilities and my ability to seek additional support through office hours.",
                "I think one of the great strengths of the course is that it moves at a very reasonable pace for a lecture, especially for those who have never experienced a lecture course before. I felt that I was able to transition my learning strategies for this course and that I was eased into it at the beginning as opposed to feeling completely overwhelmed. I think one of the weaknesses of the course is that because it is so large, you certainly can feel a little lost in the crowd at some points. However, I do think discussion sections do a great job of also providing a smaller learning environment, and with so many people taking the class, I never had any trouble finding people to collaborate with on the problem sets.",
                "The course is taught extremely well for how much material it covers. I gained an in depth understanding of a wide breadth of areas. A weakness of the course is that because so many people take it, it is often difficult to seek out individual help in office hours, etc. because so many people are looking for assistance.",
                "Weakness: sometimes class content is taught too fast and I have a difficult time taking notes (I am also a very thorough notetaker though, so if a large number of other people don't have this problem, then please disregard this note)\r\nStrengths: excellent use of graphs/exams to explain economic concepts taught in class\r\ntests balance previously taught content with new content that we must think critically to solve\r\nproblem sets don't take up too much time but cover most of class content",
                "The lectures were great at simplifying economic ideas for student understanding. However, I think there was too much of a dissonance between the lectures, the discussion sections, and the assignments. I know that's kind of the idea, but it was very difficult at times to connect the dots.",
                "The professor makes class engaging and fun. However the discussion sections could be more productive and useful.",
                "The fact that its a large lecture course made it a little hard to learn in the beginning. However, I really appreciate that the lectures are recorded so you can go back and look at certain lectures if you dont get it at first.",
                "The strengths of this course was the learning pace. I think the material was broken down by week nicely and flowed from week to week. I think one weakness of the course was the grading system. For me at least, the way in which the grades were broken down created an environment of high anxiety when exams were approaching. With such a high percentage of our grade being based on exams, there were moments when I felt like my priority was memorizing and regurgitating rather than understanding and applying. I wish that there were other opportunities for grades that go beyond exams and problem sets, especially since problem sets were such a small factor into our grades.",
                "The lectures were very informative, and I also really enjoyed the ability to review them online without losing any material. This made it so I never felt behind in the course or that there was material that was inaccessible to me throughout the difficulties of the semester. Something that I wish would be improved upon is the structure of the sections. I found my section to be rather drab in its instruction, with the teaching fellow walking through the section problems for us to just observe, really. We once had a substitute teaching fellow, who came in prepared with slides to review the topics the section material would cover. This TF also led the section by having us do parts of the question on our own then checking our work and walking through the questions themself. I found this model much more enriching and beneficial to my understanding of the material, and I would recommend some standardization of the sections so all of them are led in similar ways.",
                "The amount of TF's and office hours provide for amazing/exceptional resources and tools to use when struggling.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- I really loved the interactive aspects of the exercises we did in class. That really helped engage me. \r\nWeakness:\r\n- Obviously, because it is a lecture, it's hard to engage in the class all the time. However, I think discussion sections can be more like review sessions instead of just doing practice sessions. I also did not enjoy the amount of side chatter in the classroom, even though Professor O'Dea repeatedly told students not to do so.",
                "The course is probably well-designed for the majority of the student body, with ample resources for self-learning and reviewing. Peer tutors, teaching fellows, professors, etc. all work together to make sure no one is falling behind.\r\n\r\nHowever, after going to one section, I found that the section was too slow and only scratched the surface of the material in classit was 20% as useful as the lecture, if not less when factoring in the one-hour opportunity cost. I wish there can be \"streamed\" sections with more advanced topics, instead of going over mathematics basics over and over again.",
                "One strength of this course is that there is an abundance of resources including TAs, ULAs, old materials for review, office hours, and more to help facilitate learning.",
                "The lectures are a bit fast-paced, but the material is well organized.",
                "Cormac's explanations are really really goos, and I like that there is an online option in case you missed a class, it allows everyone to stay on track. Plus, psets are super helpful for learning.",
                "the lectures are super engaging and the professor does everything possible to make sure people have learned.",
                "I thought this class was great, there were ample resources and people to reach out to for help. Professor O'Dea was a great lecturer as well.",
                "Better organization of class materials.",
                "Some strengths is that the lecture is well prepared and matches the content on the exams. A weakness is the chaos in TA sessions, grading, etc because of how big this class is.",
                "It is a very large course. I understand that for the sheer amount of freshmen who take ECON 115, it is necessary to have a large lecture, but for many people who have not been in a class of that size, I think it is a bit hard to adjust.",
                "I felt that the main weakness of the course was the size, and I do not think the large lecture setting was the best way to learn a subject like economics. The course was improved by the large amount of available office hours and the accessibility of finding support from the instructors. I felt that another critical weakness of the course was the fact that we were not allowed to use calculators or have a formula sheet on exams, as I was then forced to spend more time trying to memorize formulas and mathematical equations than I did trying to actively understand concepts taught in the course.",
                "Great lectures, structured, clear. Cormac is great. Sections were very helpful, and course was great considering how large it is. Could be improved by offering more challenge options (not like pset extra-questions) but rather real-world insightful questions.",
                "Strengths: many office hours and peer tutoring\r\n\r\nWeakness: I cannot ask individual questions at peer tutoring/office hours, especially during midterms, since there are so many students. Usually it is review and my answers won't get answered (cannot attend my TA's office hours due to schedule conflict).",
                "well organized and well resourced.",
                "Enjoyed the problem sets as they provided good questions that were challenging and made me think. I believe the lectures could allude more toward the difficult questions present on exams.",
                "Strengths: good TAs and peer tutoring, lots of available help, interesting lectures, applicable problem sets.\r\nWeaknesses: could be more real-world applications in lecture",
                "The biggest strength of this course was definitely the huge amount of resources available to further understand the material. The psets were very good at filling in the holes of my understanding, the discussion sections were great practice for the more difficult questions of the course, and there was an enormous amount of office hours to ask questions. Also, with access to past psets and exams, there were limitless ways to prepare yourself for exams if you were willing to put in the work.\r\n\r\nA weakness in my opinion is the lack of office hours soley designated to going over the optional questions on the PSETs. I think that this resource would have been a great motivator for many to do the optional problems."

                "No, I would not recommend this class. I do not think this class is worth taking if not required for a major. The class is not as engaging or interesting as I had hoped.",
                "I would recommend this course because it provides useful basic knowledge, and I do not think it is overly stressful.",
                "Absolutely.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student without much experience with economics but wants to try it out.",
                "I would recommend this as a part of a well-rounded education. I most likely will only take one more economic class during my time at Yale but I think its important to have economic knowledge.",
                "Yes! It's a great way to see if you're interested in economics, and is very applicable to understanding real world economics.",
                "Yes, because the course was well organized but also challenged me.",
                "Yes, this class gives you a fundamental understanding of what economics is.",
                "YES! Even for non-economics majors, introductory microeconomics is a great opportunity to learn about real-world phenomena through while practicing unfamiliar, large lecture skills (p-sets, professor communication, notetaking and attendance, etc.). If you're nervous about jumping into economics because you've never before taken it, DON'T BE! I hadn't taken economics before this course, but after completing the semester, I'm so excited to take more classes in the department. Beyond learning so much content, I've also learned so much about how to be the best learner I can be in this incredibly unique setting.",
                "Yes, Cormac is amazing. Great intro class for those with no prior experience in economics.",
                "absolutely. interesting, incredibly useful, pertinent.",
                "I think this is a very solid introduction to microeconomics. It's a good Social Science credit for people who are math-oriented, but even then, the math is basic enough that it should be accessible to a wide range of students.",
                "Yes, if they wanted to get a starting feel for economics this class is great.",
                "I would recommend this course for anyone interested in learning about microeconomics.",
                "Yes! I decided to try out Econ in college (after not being the greatest fan of it in High School) and this class has made me interested in Econ! I am now taking an Econ class next semester as well!",

                "Yes! The skills taught in class are important.",
                "Yes. The concepts used in the class are versatile and the class is engaging enough. The recorder lectures also make it very easy to take the class at your own pace which especially nice for students with a heavier course load.",
                "Yes! Although it's a lecture, it's really how much time you want to put into it. Sections and office hours are optional, but they do really help! Professor Odea teaches very well.",
                "Yes! Especially if you go to the discussion sections those will help lots if you are feeling confused.",
                "Yes, I think it's a good intro class.",
                "yeah i think econ is good general knowledge to have in life no matter what your major is",
                "If you're taking this class you probably need to take it. I would suggest this class over ECON 110 just because the curve is more generous in lectures. Love Cormac.",
                "I would recommend this course to anybody interested in economics. \r\n\r\nAlthough I found it fascinating, I am aware that many people will not be as engaged in the topics, making it much more difficult to focus on the content. However, for anyone interested in economics, I would highly recommend this course.",
                "Yes if it is a requirement and if you want some basic econ knowledge",
                "Sure",
                "Yes! You're probably taking it for a major requirement, but I'd 100% recommend econ 115 due to the wonderful professor, large community (very easy to commiserate with other students and make friends because of the 500 person class size), and interesting subject material.",
                "I would if they are eager to learn about the basics of economics and how businesses really behave.",
                "Personally, I thought it was challenging and difficult to lear. However, the professor was extremely kind and tried his best to help! The peer tutors are also fantastic so even though its hard you get through it with them.",
                "Absolutely, I didn't take this for any requirement but I still feel like I got a lot out of it. As Cormac said, I learned how to think like an economist. I love learning different ways of thinking about the world and this was one of them. Also the course is very well formatted and there is lots of help!",
                "Yes definitely. It is very interesting, and it gives you a new economic lens through which to view the world.",
                "Only if youre interested in microeconomics.  Sure the workload is low but it is NOT the gut some people make it out to be.  You have to put in work to get an A-.",
                "Yes! I think everyone should take ECON 115. It's a great introduction to a whole new (to me, at least) way of thinking about the world, and not too quantitative for people who don't consider themselves strong in math or science. It really is a logic/thinking class and will make you better able to understand the news and think seriously about current issues.",
                "Yes, the things you learn are useful to know in life!",
                "Yes. It serves as a great introduction to microeconomics.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it was a very good introduction to microeconomics and as long as students study and review enough, the content of the course makes a lot of sense and is easy to study. The exams are very fair given the study materials and the office hours provided.",
                "Yes, for the prereq and those who want an introduction to economics at Yale. If you have no prior experience in microeconomics, then you may struggle a bit more in this course. It is very math heavy. You need to be able to do more advanced algebra than what is advertised.",
                "Yes, Cormac is a great professor, and intro micro is a good class to take for any major/student.",
                "Yes. Good foundational class.",
                "Yes. The course was engaging, the professor was great, and the work was minimal.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it is a great first class at Yale. You learn a lot about economics in low stress environment.",
                "I would recommend it because it is important to understand the basic concepts of Microeconomics.",
                "I would recommend this course because it allows you to determine if you have economic interests. It also allows you to understand basic economic issues and discussions.",
                "Yes, I really think its important to understand the economy and the actions that go into economic decisions.",
                "Yes, if you like economics and are planning to take macroeconomics you should take this course",
                "I would because it provides a good foundational knowledge.",
                "Yes. The course provided a great foundation for economics, and was extremely informative, generally speaking.",
                "Yes! I took this course as a sophomore intending for it to be an interesting 5th class since Id never taken econ before, and I really enjoyed everything I learned. I believe it is important to have a basic understanding of economics and this class will give you that. Cormac is a great instructor who is very understanding of our undergraduate experience and he is always willing to help in any way he can. The psets are the perfect level of work/challenge to help you develop your understanding of the topics introduced in class without overdoing it. I really recommend you take econ 115 over the seminar and definitely take it on sequence. I wish I took this class my first year fall since it is the perfect intro to Yale academia since Cormac is so understanding of the first-year experience especially.",
                "I would recommend anyone to learn a little bit of economics. It introduces a lot of new ideas that everyone should understand. I would definitely recommend this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I believe it is a great introductory class for someone who is curious about microeconomics.",
                "Yes this class set up a great foundation for interest in more economics classes at Yale",
                "Yes, I think it's a good way to see whether you enjoy economics, since it's such a large part of many majors here. Even if you don't end up majoring in anything econ-related, it's still good to know some basic concepts.",
                "Yes! Take this course, very important for whatever field you're interested in. However, note that if you're looking for an A, the curve might make that very hard to doonly around 15% of ppl in the class will get an A bc of the curve.",
                "youre probably taking it as a prereq or requirement",
                "I think its important as a foundation for other economics courses",
                "No, Unless you really enjoy Micro and or you need it for your major.",
                "Yes, it was very engaging and I found the subject matter interesting.",
                "Only if you need this course to fulfill a major requirement (for a major you're certain you want to major in) or if you're interested in economics, but otherwise, I wouldn't.",
                "Absolutely. It's awesome",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. It gives you a solid foundation in microeconomics and also isn't too heavy of a workload. As long as you keep up with lectures and homework, studying for the midterms and final will not be super stressful.",
                "Yes! It is a very good course if you have no prior experience in economics. It can be a bit hard to grasp the concepts at first though because the lectures go very quickly.",
                "I would only recommend it if you can go to lecture or at least make sure youre caught up with watching the lecture recordings because one could really get behind on that. Optional sections also make it a lot more difficult to engage in class.",
                "Yes, even though I already took micro in high school, I still learned a lot in this class like indifference curves and Pareto dominance, plus the class has a little bit more math than in high school.",
                "Yes, it is a great way to introduce one to the field of economics in general.",
                "Yes; covered a lot of material in a manageable way",
                "yes! i think everyone should take this at least once. some may find it boring. some may find it too big of a class. but it is ultimately a good experience.",
                "Yes, especially for those not considering the economics major but are interested in getting a better understanding of how the economy and our society works! Economics is such a huge real-world topic, so it's great to have a formal understanding of what is going on.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class whether you have knowledge of economics or if this is your first economics class! Professor O'dea laid everything out really clearly in lectures and discussion sections were great opportunities for practice.",
                "Absolutely. Even if you don't pursue economics further, it's a great introduction to the basics while still going beyond \"Econ 101-ism.\"",
                "Yes, it is important if you want to go further in economics (unless you already know the material)",
                "I would as its a great introductory course to Economics.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in pursuing economics or need to take the course as a requirement",
                "Yes. One of the best lectures I've taken at Yale. So interesting and fascinating.",
                "This course is a great introductory economics course for those who are interested in the field but do not have prior experience.",
                "Yes, good basis of general economics knowledge while not being too stressful or hard.",
                "Yes! Professor Odea did a great job teaching it and it's a great way to explore economics.",
                "Yes, gives you the basic fundamentals of economics",
                "Yes, I think it serves as a concrete background for economic thinking. I found the material to be really interesting, and it has shaped how I view the world",
                "Yeah, tbh I liked it. Thought it was interesting and useful to the real world.",
                "Yes, if you want to gain a basic understanding of microeconomics. Taking this course doesn't mean you're selling outin fact, it's really important to try out everything that Yale offers and see what floats your boat. Would definitely take this if you do not have prior economics experience.",
                "I would recommend the course to anyone at all interested in economics. I came in with zero economics knowledge, and the course gave me a pretty good idea of what economics is all about.",
                "Yes, it's useful even if you don't plan on majoring in Econ. A lot of the knowledge is useful for just being an informed person in general, so I highly recommend everyone to take it.",
                "I would for the reason that the lecture allows you to find more people to work with and more office hours to understand the material.",
                "no if you have no understanding of econ. so many students have taken econ in high school so i felt very behind since this was my first time taking it.",
                "Absolutely! Whether you're interested in pursuing economics as a major or not, it's a worthwhile course that teaches the fundamentals of producer and consumer theory, which are valuable regardless of the career path(s) you take.",
                "Yes, the economics department at Yale is strong. The course is a good introduction to those who have no economics experience like myself.",
                "Yes, especially if Cormac is teaching. Even if you're not interested in economics it is a great class to take since we are all consumers in this economy and it is good to understand how firms and consumers make decisions and its impacts. Low pset workload but you'll have to study a lot for the exams.",
                "Yes if you need a QR, this is a major requirement or if you are just interested in economics. Don't allow this course to define your view of economics as a discipline, remember this is an introductory class.",
                "Yes because it is a great intro to how economics work in broad sense. Also facilitated interest in the major and subjects like game theory.",
                "Absolutely. It is facilitated so that even if you don't know anything about microeconomics you can learn but you also have to be willing to put in the effort as everything builds. Teaches you to think individually but also work collaboratively",
                "yes to get a basic knowledge of the economy",
                "Yes. Even if the student does not want to be an Econ major this course is excellent because it teaches you how to be a better consumer.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student because I felt that it was anti-intellectual and promoted rote memorization. We were taught to memorize formulas and graphs without understanding why they work or why they made sense. We often did problems that we were told would never show up in the real world, but the entire point of economics is to measure and assess the world.",
                "Yes, I would, as I believe micro can be applied to many other areas of life.",
                "Yes. This course covers a lot of important foundational topics and gives students a chance to explore economics if that is a field of interest.",
                "Yes if you're interested in economics. No if you want an easy QR credit.",
                "Yes I would just because economics is a fundamental skill, which I think will prove important for a number of different fields, and since it is a prerequisite for many high level classes in the social sciences/economics department.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student because economics is everywhere in our daily lives and just the one class amount I have learned really opened my eyes to the world of economics.",
                "Yes; requirement for Economics major, changes way of viewing world, useful for any field",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course regardless of if you must take it as I think it's important.",
                "Definitely, just purely based on how well its structured and how many resources are provided.",
                "This is a good QR credit and though it may be frustrating at first, there is so much more to be gained from this class than a grade.",
                "I would because the foundations of economics reach into other stuff.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes  to all those interested in economics.",
                "Yes, Cormac is great! Gonzalo (TF) is also great!",
                "Yes as I believe it allows you to think in a different way then used to.",
                "Yes, it was very interesting and I learned an incredible amount.",
                "Yes, overall I think this was a great introductory course!",
                "No. The course is too large and the teaching team, aside from Professor O'Dea, is not that supportive. The teaching fellows are not very effective and the course content is not really designed to be engaging.",
                "Yes, it is a fundamental course for the Econ major.",
                "Yes as it is essential to learning the basics of economics",
                "I would recommend it if anyone were debating majoring in economics.",
                "Yes I would recommend. If the mistakes that I made arent made, the course it most likely pretty easy to navigate and operate. It will help greatly for future Econ courses at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because its a great way to get into economics or just have a class that introduces you to yale.",
                "Yes, a great course to take in your first semester.",
                "Definitely! It is very helpful for everyone to understand basic economics, and this course is organized and thoughtful.",
                "I would recommend the course to anyone with an interest in learning about general economic principles.",
                "Yes I would because it is challenging but it is very helpful for economics.",
                "It is a great course to introduce economics to students who have not taken the subject before",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any first year student willing to begin exploring Economics.",
                "Somewhat I think it is good if you need micro for your major, but otherwise the topics were not completely necessary to learn",
                "I would certainly recommend this course for a student like me who is interested in economics, and has never studied any before. Additionally, this course was an excellent balance in terms of format and content with my other courses which were more seminar style and writing oriented.",
                "Yes, the course is a very good introductory course that allows a student to think about how everyday decisions are made and how that affects the economy",
                "Yes if want basic knowledge about economics.",
                "Yea, its a nice way of entering Econ with the lovely Professor ODea",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because you learn so much and it is also intellectually challenging.",
                "Yes. I would recommend it as an introductory course of microeconomics and quantitative reasoning at Yale. I learned fundamental concepts of economics in this class, and for that reason alone, I recommend it.",
                "It's a very good introductory course. Even though I struggled a bit, I learned a lot about economics and myself. The constant pset workload is also very good to help acclimate to the college workload.\r\nI also think every student at Yale should experience a course taught by Professor Cormac O'Dea.",
                "a good intro to a college lecture class format + economic concepts",
                "I would definitely recommend the course. I think its valuable for students of all majors to understand economics to some extent.",
                "yes if they want to major in any humanities or social sciences course",
                "I would recommend it only to get on the economics major track.",
                "I would. Being in a lecture was refreshing and I believe I garnered the equivalent information then I would have in a seminar. If you are genuinely curious about economic concepts/principles and the functions within society, this is the class for you. It would be a tad more challenging for an individual who is indifferent about microeconomics because lack of passion may correlate to lack of attention or care which would subsequently make the class more difficult.",
                "Good foundational course",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I feel that if students stay on top of the class and keep up with content, it is very doable.",
                "No since I was unclear about a lot of concepts at the end of the course.",
                "Yes definitely - regardless of academic major - because student not only learn very important concepts that can be applied everywhere in life, but also a systematic and inquiring way of thinking through problems and settings that breaks down what seemingly may be a convoluted situation into fundamental principles and trends, but also with the caution of avoiding Econ 101ism.",
                "Yes, if they want to fulfill requirements or are looking to get in touch with economic analysis. They should be ready to invest time away from class to fully understand the concepts though.",
                "Yes. Great introduction class and gives you the fundamental skills that you want out of a microeconomics class.",
                "I would, as prior to this course I had never taken economics, however, after taking this course, I feel that I have a very good understanding of the basics of the subject.",
                "I would recommend this course to all students to further their understanding of the world around them, through learning about economic principles via a great professor.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I would recommend this to anyone interested in exploring Econ.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it does a great job of teaching the foundations of microeconomics. The course is a great introduction to economics that can help kickstart the educational track in economics or give just enough of the basics for a person to learn for life.",
                "Yes, for an introduction to economics it does its job",
                "Yes, whether you do economics or not as a major a lot of the information is useful and applicable.",
                "Yes, this course is designed to teach fundamental knowledge and skills related to economics to those who are new to the subject.",
                "Yes. I think it is a nice introduction to microeconomics.",
                "yes",
                "Yes. Good intro to Econ, easy to follow, and well organized.",
                "Yes, any student (even if you have taken highschool econ) should become acquainted with econ through this course. It is fun !",
                "Yes, I would, because the workload was neither too much nor too little, and since so many first years take it, it could be a good way to meet new people in your own class. Also, the class content itself seems very useful to know for many different professions.",
                "yes. If you are interested in economics you should take this course. It gives you a great basic understanding of microeconomics.",
                "Yes if you are taking economics as a major.",
                "I would recommend this class to any business interested people.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! Relevant knowledge for any- and everyone, very well organized.",
                "Yes, it was a great introduction to microeconomics for anyone who is curious about the field.",
                "yes -- even if you're not an econ major, I think this is probably a class that is good for most students to take. note that if you want an A you will have to study very hard",
                "Yes. I really enjoyed this course and believe it offers an excellent introduction to the field of economics. I also believe it is a great class to take during your first semester of college.",
                "Yes, ECON 115 covers the basics of microeconomics which is essential (or just helpful) for almost every interest and major.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It is a very good intro class if you do not mind the lecture setting and the workload is not too heavy. The p-sets that are given as homework really help you understand the material you learn in class and the exams are fair.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes!",
                "If you are interested in econ, then yes.",
                "100%. Great Professor, well-structured, interesting, and informative. Take this class because it helps you understand the world.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I think this is a really good introductory course, as it allows for large lecture hall while not being too challenging. I also think many study habits are developed in this course.",
                "Yes, I think its a great intro course and very clear to follow. Theres also so much help between office hours and section that if you feel lost, its easy to ask for clarifications.",
                "Yes because it gave a strong foundation",
                "Of course! This course really helped me to think in different ways, which I have used in real life. I think this course is important to expand your knowledge, get a little out of your comfort zone, and take away key concepts that you can apply for the rest of your life.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone that was interested in economics or wants to major in that field other than that I can not really speak to if you will like it or not.",
                "I would recommend this course. I think that regardless of whether you plan on choosing economics as a potential major, Econ 115 is a great intro course for learning about todays economy.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in economics as it is required for the major.",
                "The course is very informative and not terribly time consuming, and is a fantastic intro to a broad academic field.",
                "Yes, it is a good introduction to microeconomics and even though it is a large lecture, there are many opportunities for extra help and improvement.",
                "Im not really sure. I personally found this course to be harder than some of the others I took, including organic chemistry, because of the unclear explanations. I wish we focused more on understanding concepts rather than memorizing them.",
                "Yes, if one wants a good introduction to economics, I strongly recommend!",
                "yes only if you're interested in pursuing economics.",
                "Even though the class is big, Professor Cormac always tries to get answers to engage all interested students. Moreover, in contrast to other courses, this class has dozens of OH, and even though you're bad at the econ, you will have a lot of support. Recommend.",
                "yes, it is a good introduction for anyone interested in economics",
                "Yes, a good introduction to economic concepts, manageable workload, and great instructors.",
                "Yes, the workload isn't too high and the concepts are interesting.",
                "Yes. It was engaging and curious even if you don't continue into economics",
                "Yes, definitely. Cormac is wonderful.",
                "Yes definitely! It was very interesting and is a useful topic to learn about even if you are not thinking of pursuing the major.",
                "Yes I think it is very valuable to think like an economist.",
                "I would recommend this course as it was a phenomenal introduction to economics.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in economics.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. I especially enjoyed Professor O'dea's lectures and liked his lecturing style a lot. I liked that he encouraged students to participate and raise their hands in class.",
                "I think leaning basic economic theory is important, so I would recommend that other students should generally take entry level economics",
                "Yes, even if you don't need it as a requirement it's a good class to take to get the basics of micro if you're interested.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student! The content was very engaging and the course moved at a manageable pace with a manageable workload. There were also so many resources available to aid our learning.",
                "Yes, because it helps develop a basic and necessary understanding in economics.",
                "I think everyone sees this course as a feshman classicsomething that most take to see if they want to continue down the econ path. It did a good job of giving insight into the major.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student with a interest in pursing economics.",
                "Yeah sure if they wanna learn more about economics and are actually interested in it",
                "This course would be a very useful Knowles base for every student.",
                "Yes, this course is a good course to fill the Social Sciences distributional requirement or to pursue an interest in economics.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It is applicable information that you can use for the rest of your life.",
                "Yesespecially if Cormac is teaching it. Definitely doable even if you havent taken Econ before! A solid intro course if you want to learn some Econ without getting into the intense math.",
                "Yes, this course is incredibly well organized. Professor ODeas lectures are clear and concise and there are so many resources outside of lecture to receive additional support.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I had a great experience with it as my first big lecture course. I also think that Cormac did a phenomenal job as the instructor and that anyone would be able to learn a lot from him. I also feel that even for those who have no intention of pursuing economics past the introductory level, some of the skills and ways of thinking that this course teaches are useful for everyone.",
                "Yes, I would. Even if the student is not going into an economics, business or finance field I would recommend this course. It gives insight into how American society works, as well as gives each student tools to make the optimal decisions when it comes to fiscal decisions.",
                "Absolutely! Even if a student isn't interested in majoring in economics, Econ 115 provides a foundational understanding of how people interact in the market, which everybody should have as a tool (i.e. might help students make wiser decisions/save money).",
                "I would recommend to anyone who needs this for a major requirement.",
                "I would recommend to a student seeking to learn the basics of economics.",
                "Yes! It allows a basic understanding of the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I feel as though the workload was not extremely high and there were a lot of resources available, like office hours,  if you were struggling with course concepts.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in starting economics or just curious about the subject as I was. I found the course to be as accessible as challenging, and despite taking no other economic classes prior to 115, I never felt disadvantaged or behind in my understanding. The material was presented in a very digestible and understandable manner, and I think it is a great course for anyone.",
                "Yes. It is a good introductory course to help build your foundations in economics.",
                "I would! I think the information we learn has great relevance to the world we live in. That's not to say that other classes aren't relevant outside of the classroom but I think this class makes such an effort to connect learning to real world events that it is definitely a worthwhile class.",
                "I would recommend it if you are entirely new to economics. However, if you already have a solid background in econ (e.g. high school class), I strongly recommend you skip this class, even if the department's placement tells you otherwise. I was placed here because I got a 6 in my IB econ HL, and I took the class out of fear of missing anything. The course turned out to be 85% already-learned material and 15% new (mostly mathematical models that were only explained conceptually in high school; no concept was entirely new), and you may be better off just reading the notes from your friend taking the class. (There's a close-to-100% chance that at least one of your friends is taking the class.) Your time would be better spent elsewhere, especially for your first year.",
                "I would recommend this course to others for a good basic introduction to economics.",
                "Maybe. It depends on the student. I found this course engaging, but my peers often found themselves lost in the course material.",
                "Yes, it's a great way to start learning econ. Cormac is a great professor and explains super well, the class isn't very hard, and if you do the psets, it's easy to get a good grade because you have plenty of practice.",
                "yes! the professor is the sweetest person ever",
                "Yes, I definitely would. The only thing I would say is that i have heard mixed reviews about the course depending on the professor and that might change others feelings about the class.",
                "Yes, its a good introductory QR class",
                "Yes, I think it is a great intro course, especially to freshmen, that teaches you useful knowledge regardless of your major.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who thinks they will be studying any kind of social science throughout college. Additionally, everyone should take a base-line level Economics class at some point in their life.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student only if they have an interest in economics. For students not predisposed to be engaged with the subject, a the large lecture style makes it hard to engage with the content in the same way a smaller lecture or seminar would.",
                "Would definitely recommend if interested in economics and need the basic intro. However, it didn't 'rock my world' as other courses at Yale have.",
                "Yes, only if they need to take the class. It is a challenging class.",
                "its a good starter to this topic, but might not be super interesting to some",
                "I would recommend this class as it gives a good introduction to microeconomics in a fairly engaging way.",
                "Yes! If you are prepared for the massive class size then I would recommend",
                "Yes. The background that this course provides would help anyone regardless of their chosen field of study. Economics is an essential part of daily life for all adults, and I'm adamant that even one semester has taught me so much about how our society works that used to always go over my head. It would help prepare everyone for their future."
