A decent amount of economic theory, particularly as it relates to international trade\r\nSkills: Memo writing. We learned this from first principles, and had multiple rounds to get better at it. This is a concrete skill that will prove immensely useful across a range of careers",

Skills - how to write a memo, how to synthesize and explain contemporary issues to policymakers. Insights - understanding European politics, the role of the EU in the world and the economic concepts relevant EU",
                "A basic understanding of the history, institutions, and major (economic) events related to the EU. We would've learned a lot more if the class were better organized and less full of tangents."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Very well organized, and even tangents are relevant in the sense that even if we don't strictly follow the syllabus, the discussions are always expounding on some part of the EU that is fulfilling some broader goal of the course. \r\nThis is one of very few (count-able on one hand) courses at Yale that focus specifically on the economics, politics, and/or history of the European Union. Even the European Studies classes are often hyper-focused on one country or on another subregion, like post-Soviet states. \r\nThe readings are not too heavy, and Marnix explains them thoroughly, so you'll be fine if you have to skip a couple of readings. (But don't make a habit out of it.)\r\nThe course is a very good mix of lecture and discussion. The students are also very much self-selecting. Everyone participates and asks really, really thoughtful questions -- not the kind of questions that you ask just for brownie points or to get a participation credit.\r\n\r\nNote that the goal of the course isn't to indoctrinate students into loving the EU or thinking it is some magical super-democratic, super-efficient utopia. Criticisms are very welcome, and Marnix is very upfront about legitimate reasons why someone might be pro-Brexit, for example. But the course helps you distinguish between economically sound anti-EU arguments and incoherent populist nonsense. That's a good skill to have.",
                "Strengths are that the professor is very engaging and that class discussions are very enriching.",
                "There is little assessable work so good grades really just favor those with preexisting knowledge",
                "The strengths of this course is allowing students the class time to engage with the material, although at times I thought the class lost structure and we were not able to finish everything. However, the class covers a lot about the EU and I now have a firm understanding of what happened during Brexit, why the EU formed, and the future of the euro.",
                "Strengths: Professor Amand is enthusiastic and incredibly knowledgeable. The material is relevant and presented in an engaging way. I appreciated Professor Amand's willingness to diverge from the initial syllabus to dedicate more time to material that students were particularly interested in. Receiving feedback on assignments through meetings also felt far more productive than traditional essay grading. Weaknesses: no major ones, though I'd maybe try to encourage broader student participation through slightly more structured in-class discussions.",
                "This course is extremely detailed and assumes a high level of economic background, but promises high rewards for those inclined to take it. The course demands high engagement from students and at times, I have found the lectures to be slightly too fast for my understanding, but the professor invites student questions and feedback and is very accessible to learn more about areas of interest.",
                "I really like this course. I like that it was a small group of students and we all really got close and established a good collegial environment together. What I love about Professor Amand is that he engages every question that is asked to him. This means that occasionally, the classes can wind a little bit from point to point, but I didnt view this is a weakness though, because I was always interested in what we were discussing.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-Prof Amand. is incredibly well informed on a range of topics\r\n-A good blend of econ theory, politics, and global affairs\r\n-Some fascinating readings that do a good job covering multiple perspectives\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Basically none. This is one of the best courses i've ever taken at yale",
                "Strengths - excellent class that covers all the politics, history and economics for the EU. The class covers everthing to political philosophy to trade economics. Fascinating class with a phenomenal professor. The grade for the class is based primarily on two memos and a final oral exam which is unusual for Yale but an excellent way to hone two improve your writing and public speaking skills. Prof Amand is truly an expert in his field and is very engaged and enthusiastic in every class. Weaknesses - a few knowledge check PSETs might be helpful."

            "comments": [
                "Yes! If you're interested in the econ, politics, and/or history of the EU, this course is perfect for you. Intro micro and macro are needed, but you don't need any intermediate or advanced econ knowledge. You don't need to be European or have lived in the EU at all. In fact, the students are a good mix of Americans, EU citizens, and other international students, which is really refreshing because you get a wide variety of perspectives, which Marnix does a great job of including in the discussion. \r\n\r\nThe workload is low, and much more focused on practical skills than busywork. You have to write two 2-page (single-spaced) policy memos, and Marnix gives you feedback, returns each one, and you get to revise it, with the original and final each counting for 50% of that memo's grade. Then there is a final oral exam for which you get 45 minutes to prepare (closed-book but you can write out talking points during your 45 minute prep time) and 45 minutes to speak, including a Q&A from Marnix and one other highly-rated professor or Jackson School Fellow. The assignments and exam are designed to simulate real-life policy situations. Or, I guess, McKinsey casing, if that's how you want to look at it. The syllabus says there might be problem sets but my class didn't get any.",
                "I would!",
                "Yeah if you already know about the EU",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to other students, but as a non-global major and non-European student with no European history background I struggled at times to understand everything and ask questions in real time.",
                "If you are interested in understanding the economics of the European Union at a very detailed level, I recommend this course.",
                "Absolutely! I really enjoyed this course. I think the modes of assessment are useful to improve your learning, and also different than what you experienced in most classes. I enjoyed writing the policy memos. I also think the oral exam at the end was really fun to prepare for, and ultimately a great way to realize how much you have learned during the semester. If you want gain not only an economic understanding of the EU, but also a political understanding of the institutions and the cultural and flows of the union, take this class.",
                "Very much so",
                "Yes! Great class with a great professor.",
                "Yes, yes, yes. Without reservation. This class has been one of the highlights of my Yale career.",
                "I highly recommend this course. Understanding the EU is incredibly important for anyone interested in global affairs, politics, IR etc. Amand is an excellent teacher and can explain complicated ideas in an easy-to-understand and interesting way. His anecdotes are often very etertaining. In summary, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
                "I was very disappointed by this class. I'm not sure if my semester was an anomaly, but I would not recommend this class in the version that I experienced. It was incredibly disorganized, with most classes becoming a free-for-all Q&A about random curiosities related to the EU that the class had, and we only covered maybe 2/3 of the content on the original schedule. Assignments (and how to do well on them) were unclear and very rushed. While it is true that every class was interesting because Marnix is an engaging and knowledge speaker, it was not what the class is described as."
