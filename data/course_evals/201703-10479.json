    "I learned how to use the telescopes at the observatory, and how to reduce and analyze data from them.",
    "I learned how to use telescopes to measure the brightness and distance of stars. I also learned about star temperatures and their distance. I also learned about spectroscopy.",
    "Gives a basic survey of the important things in astronomy- celestial coordinates, how telescopes work, the brightness of stars, etc. Pretty cool getting to use a several hundred thousand dollar telescope.",
    "Really cool to see how the basics of Astronomy work; I can point out stars now and make a starry picture on a software. Pretty cool but also, does not ever feel like a gut even though it is one because if you don't have the software on your computer, it's a lot of trips to the observatory.",
    "This course was very useful in learning to use the research telescope at the Leitner Observatory.  It was a great sample platter of different methods of looking at the universe. It was really helpful to learn how to write lab reports, which is not something I have done intensively.",
    "I gained insight into what astronomical observation consists of. I learned how to use telescopes at the observatory (mostly computerized) as well as how to turn data given from the telescopes into useful information about stellar properties.",
    "Learned about some methods of data analysis in astronomy and more on how to use a telescope system.",
    "Watching stars using telescope and edit photos",
    "I learned a ton about how to use the resources at Yale to take astronomical observations and render the data.",
    "Technical skills for astronomical observing and how to use different image processing software like MaxIm",
    "I learned how to observe the night sky and stellar objects in the galaxy. I learned how to use the telescope and to take pictures of the night sky, using the appropriate software to enhance and edit pictures. I also learned about basic astronomy and features of stars.",
    "I learned how to operate a telescope, take astronomical images and spectra, and analyze associated data.",
    "basic astronomic techniques like working a telescope as well as data analysis"

   "comments": [
    "This course was pretty good, but I felt as though the class periods were useless. They were used to explain the lab material, but it was pretty low level explanations (for the non-STEM majors), so as an astro major I was always bored. This time could definitely be better used, or gotten rid of entirely. I also felt as though my grade was dependent on the weather. I tried to sign up for multiple observing slots a week, but I often had other commitments, and if it was cloudy the days I was available to observe I was out of luck (although it always worked out in the end).",
    "The class was mostly filled with non-astronomy majors, and the course tried to make the subjects seem cool, which they mostly were, but sometimes the labs involved a lot of tedious data analysis. The labs aren't too much effort and and graded fairly leniently. The main issues with the course are honestly the timing and location. Not only does it have to be in the evening by nature, you have to sign up for 6 observing dates as well throughout the semester. While the labs are pretty short, the walk past science hill can take almost 20 minutes, and is painful especially towards the end of the semester.",
    "Lectures can be boring but pretty cool when you actually get to work with the telescopes.",
    "This course would be improved by replacing the lights around Yale with lights that don't shoot into the sky, but are covered in order to project the light downward instead of out and upwards. Light pollution will be the death of observational astronomy.",
    "Strengths include the clear lab instructions and the small workshops at the end of lectures that help with data analysis for the lab reports. The topics chosen to be covered were also very interesting. Weaknesses include the strict grading policy regarding insignificant things such as signing up for an observing slot on time. Weaknesses also include a lack of useful background information provided for those who have no astronomy background.",
    "Good hands on labs, but support was lacking and problems were not well received.",
    "Would be better if lecture and observation are together",
    "The lab reports often lacked necessary information but in general the labs were logically ordered and classes structured well.",
    "The course will be difficult for a student who is new to Astronomy. It could be improved by being geared more towards those who are interested in the field, but also limited in prior knowledge.",
    "One key weakness was the pacing of observing for the labs, particularly the final lab. This was the last lab of the semester, but also the most rushed, and probably the least facilitated. There was no accompanying video that demonstrated the technological skills needed to complete the lab, as there had been in previous labs. This was significant, especially because this was a lab that coincided with reading period and finals. During a time when students are working on multiple assignments, papers, and studying all at onceit was a trial to figure out how to do specific technological skills without a guiding video, especially when there are new skills we are using in this lab. \r\n\r\nAnother weakness was the locking of assignment submission on their deadline. There is an option to allow late submissions on Canvas, and they would be marked as late, but still that would relieve a lot of stress and tension students felt when they were unsure about whether their assignment would be graded or not.",
    "The observatory is a very cool place, but getting there is sometimes a pain, especially at night\/in the cold. Observations can get canceled last minute and often, so always be prepared for whatever the outcome may be.",
    "the observatory itself is a bit of a hike, and it was somewhat inconvenient to have to use its computers every time we needed to access the MaxIm DL program"

    "This is a nice half-credit course if you're looking for something easy to round out your schedule, and is definitely better than a second physics lab for astro majors. It was really cool to learn how to use the telescopes at the observatory, but it was tough to maneuver my schedule around the weather to be able to observe for all the labs, and the labs themselves were too simple to really allow for much learning.",
    "Yes! Even if you are not interested in astro this is a great course that teaches a lot yet is not too difficult. The content is also super interesting.",
    "A pretty easy science credit and not too much work for a half credit course. The syllabus explicitly says that every student should get an A in the class, which is mostly true, so if you're willing to walk up science hill, its a solid course thats occasionally pretty cool.",
    "Yeah, stars for stoners mood sometimes and other times, entertains your mild interest in telescopes and cool stuff.",
    "I think this course is great, as it provides a more rigorous way to observe the night sky.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone interested in working with telescopes and how to turn this data into useful information about stars. While astronomical observing isn't really the idealized looking out a telescope on the back porch, when information from a computer-controlled telescope spits out some data and you analyze this and turn it into some really cool figures and information, it's pretty neat! It is by no means a gut, as it is a good amount of work for half a credit actually. But if you do everything that is expected as the syllabus lays out, you will make a good grade.",
    "Yes, the course is intriguing",
    "Yes, I really enjoyed this course but one should expect to go up to the observatory more than just the class time and maybe more than just your observing times to use program available on the observatory computers.",
    "I would only recommend if strongly interested in astronomy or have prior background in the subject.",
    "If youre an Astro major take this instead of one semester of Physics lab!! Totally worth it. Take this if youre interested in learning the technical side of astronomy and observing but if youre not a major and not particularly interested then the time spent is not worth it. Its not a ton of time, but having to go up to the observatory is a hassle if you dont care about the material",
    "This is not a course designed for non-Astro majors; or rather, for non-Astro majors this course requires a great deal of work that other half-credit courses do not require. The lab reports seem to require a great deal of content, when the actual observations take a very small amount of time. The TAs as well as the professor do not always explain concepts in a way that is comprehensive to a non-Astro major. For a half-credit class, this definitely seems to have the rigor and workload of a full-credit class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to gain a basic knowledge of astronomical observing techniques. It is a relaxed and fun class with a great professor.",
    "Nice intro class to lab methods and astronomical topics in general. Lab topics are interesting and relevant to the field, and using the telescopes is cool.",
    "i would recommend this to physics \/ astro students",
    "This is a fantastic lab for those interested in astronomy. Professor Faison gives the relevant information to the lessons in the actual lab time and most of the work is out of class, late at night at the observatory."
