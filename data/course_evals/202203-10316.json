We worked a lot on pronunciation, which is quite difficult in the beginning, and best to do at the start of learning. We also did present and past tense grammar. Overall, a very enjoyable introduction to French, very well-taught with emphasis on immersion. A great way to start a path to fluency.",
                "In additional to conversational\/basic grammar of French, I learned to be consistent and practice what I learn beyond the classroom.",
                "A very good foundation of reading, listening and writing skils. We have learned present, imparfait and passe compose tenses, in addition to a lof of other grammar topics.",
                "This class helped to develop my French skills through real life conversations. The immersion of the course was challenging at first but definitely made me more comfortable and confident in my french skills as the semester continued. I learned to be a better listener and active learner as the class required my attention.",
                "Introduction to French, including basic vocabulary and expressions, basic present and past tenses, and common topics in daily conversations. Immersive learning  no English was allowed under normal circumstances and there were a lot of opportunities to practice speaking  artwork presentation, creative project, and final skit.",
                "I definitely did learn French, so I would call this a success. 10\/10 would recommend.",

                "Strength: professor Guan is absolutely incredible! She made the class very accessible, enjoyable and exciting. Daily homework assignments are very helpful to keep up with the fast-moving class. Weaknesses: weekly tests. A lot of the time it just felt like I was studying for a particular test instead of learning the material itself. I think it would be more helpful to have a test every other week, because it would allow for my gradual learning.",
                "This course is immersive and is totally in French which starts off difficult, but really helps to build your French listening and comprehension skills quickly. There is a significant amount of homework that this class requires which can be hard, but most of it does help with the grammatical skills that we review. The course work could be reduced or made a little more applicable for day-to-day French.",
                "This course was well-organized and very helpful for students to learn. \r\nFrench in Action is a lot of fun! I think I ended up growing emotionally attached to the characters and cant wait to take more French to see what happens to them. Sometimes the textbook and the workbook and the course packet and the weekly tests are a bit disjunct, but Xinyu does a great job helping us bridge the gap. I also appreciate the sense of community we had in class  I became great friends with almost all my classmates.",
                "Toward the end, there was a lot more lecturing and a lot less speaking and discussion between students. Then, the lessons just started cramming new information into us at an unfathomable pace. This made it slightly difficult for students to internalize imparfait and passe compose, among other things, all in the span of a few weeks. It almost felt like the department had procrastinated teaching us these things, and then decided to heavily focus on them in the final exam.",
                "I took four semesters of Japanese, and I feel that there are several things the French classes can learn from the Japanese classes which would make it more effective.\r\n\r\nFor example, the textbook was a much bigger part of the Japanese course. The teacher would constantly divide us into random groups: they would give everyone a number from 1 to 4 or so (eg pointing at everyone in turn and saying \"1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...\" until everyone got a number) and then we would find everyone with the same number as us. We would then go through one of the exercises in the textbook with the other people in our group (eg alternating stating the answers to the grammar exercises out loud). This had two consequences: we would constantly be speaking the language out loud (no matter our skill level), and we would constantly be interacting with the other people in our class. (We would also constantly be moving around, which was very fun.)\r\n\r\nIn the French course, the textbook was barely an entity, and we barely interacted with the other people in the room. I thought this was both less effective and less fun. Please view an average Japanese class (the two teachers I had the pleasure of learning from were Yamaguchi-sensei and Nakamura-sensei) and talk with the Japanese department and see what you can learn from them."

There is word that the French department is tough, but this was not my experience at all, the course was not easy, and was challenging, but the rigor was aimed at developing ones language abilities and not at lowering ones grade.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! Although it can be challenging, French is a fun language to learn.",
                "Yes! French is definitely one of the harder languages at Yale, but it is also a very rewarding experience. If you put in a good amount of work, you can walk out with a basic conversational level of French.",
                "Yes absolutely. This course has taught me French incredibly fast, which is something that I wouldn't have expected. I have learned lots of vocabulary and can understand and speak basic level French.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course (but only with Xinyu)! I think if I had a different instructor, I would still enjoy the class, but perhaps not as much. Regardless of the instructor, I like the way Yale teaches French and believe a student can get a lot out of it. A language class is also a wonderful place to make new friends.",
                "Very much so. There is a reason this school puts so much effort (...money and resources...) into this department. It has paid off and is essentially a fast-track to French fluency.",
                "If someone told me they were interested in either learning French or Japanese and had trouble deciding between the two, I would probably suggest they take Japanese purely from how the course was structured."
