For the most part, the readings were not to dense and were very digestible, which made the class more accessible to those who had never taken a philosophy class before. The discussions were very well conducted and I often left class with a different outlook on life/the topic at hand. I learned how to take the first read with a grain of salt, and developed close reading skills do to having to read and reread texts in order to fully understand them.",

            "comments": [
                "Honestly, the course was not engaging because you realize that you don't actually have to do the readings in order to succeed. Around 70-80% of your grade is writing, so you only need to participate minimally in order to get an A. However, take my words with a grain of salt - I discovered halfway through the semester I despised philosophy and thought experiments and other extremely theoretical humanities subjects, so if you know you're into that kind of thing then you could enjoy this course a lot (as I know many of my friends did). \r\n\r\nAbout the labs: they were not good. Not well organized, it felt like high school in terms of doing useless exercises without feedback. I honestly only improved writing through this class through the final research paper, but that was me pushing myself, not the lab helping me. Lab certainly needs to be more involved and (I hate to say this, but) contain more writing exercises that are graded with feedback.",
                "strengths: mikkelson is probably one of the compelling instructors i could imagine for a seminar. the syllabus spans quantum physics, arabic philosophy, and virtue ethics, each of which are explored in pretty significant depth. our class really felt like it built a collective friendship over the course of the semester, but i suppose that's true in most 1st year seminars.\r\nweaknesses: none .... maybe a general weakness of six pretty good is that writing lab is sometimes ridiculous",
                "Really engaging seminars! Each seminar is discussion based, readings are light, but discussions and Jane's explanation and insights are really thorough and thought-provoking. \r\nWeaknesses: you have numerous existential crises here and there.",
                "We read some super interesting texts, Unfortunately, we didn't do ANYTHING with the philosophical aspects of most of these texts. Instead we discussed their form, etc. It was a literature class. Do not take this course if you like philosophy.",
                "Strengths: Material was fascinating, made for a really engaging class if you did the readings. It was a great intro to philosophy, and it gave a purpose to studying philosophy as an academic and social discipline. The class itself was fun, engaging, and worthwhile. It could also be introspective if you sat with the material.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the class discussions didn't flow, but that could have been more so because people didn't know how to discuss the often difficult readings. The Lab portion also wasn't super useful other than for getting writing time in (which was nice).",
                "Strengths: Our discussions in class were always really engaging. Jane and Ivetty are both incredibly helpful and passionate. Each and everything we read in class had some thematic meaning or contribution. The assignments out of class were always enjoyable, and the workload was super manageable. The visits to the art museum and Beinecke, although entirely unrelated to the class material, were very enjoyable. Weaknesses: The Writing lab was a waste of time and did not make me a better writer. It was not well organized and regularly left me feeling frustrated, confused by expectations, and unsupported. It totally took away from the rest of the class. It was disconnected from seminar, and clearly not catered to the texts we were talking about in class. I did not enjoy it at all, nor did the rest of my peers.",
                "Lab was incredibly unstructured and confusing. But the teachers always had good intentions and were looking to help students. I cannot say that this class helped me much in terms of writing as I had hope since not much concrete writing instruction was provides. Labs were just 3 hour blocks to write, which seemed like a waste of time because few students could write productively with 60 other students in the room. Seemed like a waste of\r\ntime.",
                "Seminar with Jane Mikkelson is great. Excellent teacher and very intelligent and knowledgeable. Cannot say the same of the lab portion. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE FOR THE LAB. Came in expecting to improve my writing skills during lab and was thoroughly disappointed. Lab routinely wastes an hour to an hour and a half saying absolutely nothing. TAs were helpful, but lab is essentially glorified office hours. Also, since your entire class has to be there, the TA is barely available. Would much rather have just gone to a writing tutor during that time. Received almost no feedback during lab and was a solid waste of 3 hours a week.",
                "A big strength of this course was the variety of readings presented. The readings were all of different disciplines and written by authors from all over the world, providing a diverse philosophical foundation. A weakness of this course was the Friday Writing Labs. Although it was helpful to have blocked out time to work on our Midterm and Final papers with our TFs present, many labs were spent on assignments that did not exactly pertain to what we were learning in our regular Thought Experiments class, which is due to our grouping with the other Pretty Good sections, even though we were all learning different things. I feel that my time could've been better spent working on my own instead of dedicating three hours to sitting in LC 101.",
                "The weakness of this class is the lack of grades. I had no idea where I stood when it came to numbers. Another weakness is the entire lab portion. As helpful as all of the instructors were and as engaging as the Beinecke and YUAG visits were, it felt like a colossal waste of time and did not need to be three hours every week. If it was to take up 3 hours, it might as well be a 2 credit class. I missed out on a lot of activities because of that lab.",
                "The seminar portion? Absolutely. Professor Mikkelson was wonderful. The lab? Absolutely not. I can tell that they really tried working on teaching us new writing skills, but I don't think it was done effectively at all. I think the biggest problem was the fact that they tried to combine all the 6 Pretty Good sections into one lecture hall on Friday afternoons for three hours; since the material we were looking at was so vastly different, it didn't feel like putting all of us together was a productive thing to do. I would've much preferred to spend that time on my own working on my writing/just with my own 6PG section. I will say, the visits to the YUAG were very cool."

As a STEM student, it was hard for me to enjoy this course, but there are interesting STEM-centric thought experiments in this course too. It all depends on how you want to engage with the course, as you can get by through only writing the essays and not doing any of the readings. \r\n\r\nHowever: Dr. Mikkelson is quite a good instructor for seminar-style classes, and she is also very kind - would consider taking more classes with her.",
                "YES! take anything with mikkelson she is fascinating. i sincerely hope this class is offered again.",

                "Yes, the seminar portion. I really enjoyed the texts we talked about and the conversations that they sparked. I regularly left the class wondering about the world around me, my conscious experience, ethics, etc. It was awesome.",
                "Yes. Good way to earn a writing credit and read\r\nsome interesting texts",
                "Workload is fine and material is interesting. Attending lab is a waste of time. If this had been a standalone course I would probably have rated it full scores. 6 pretty good lab dramatically worsened the class and provided little help. If you want to improve your writing, take ENGL 114.",
                "Although I thoroughly enjoyed the course, I would caution another student to consider whether to take this class (which meets for three more hours than any other class) or just another philosophy course.",
                "I personally would not recommend this course to another student strictly because of the lab portion. I do not want to sound ungrateful, but for that lab to be half of the grade, I do not feel like it is worth giving up an additional 3 hours every week.",
