I had very limited prior knowledge but now have a good understanding of the basic concepts, discoveries, and methods used. I also learned how to use Zotero to create an annotated bibliography.",

                "The course felt all over the place at times. I wish the professor would have a more set lesson plan, because when almost every class started with a list of four or five activities that we \"could do\", the less enthusiastic members of class really just defaulted to whatever was the easiest (and often least interesting).",
                "I really liked that this course was structured in a more relaxed manner in terms of day to day seminars: we could spend an entire seminar just asking questions about the readings or what we had learned so far, or we could do a lecture about new material instead. I feel like this flexibility really maximized my learning for the course.",
                "I enjoyed how hands on the course was but it sometimes felt more like a lecture than a seminar.",
                "The strengths are the staged assignments, activities, and debates really help you dive into the material and learn independently. The weaknesses are besides these activities, classes were structured more like lectures whereas I would have hoped for more seminar based classes and discussions.",
                "The strengths were that the professor was an expert and had experience with a lot of the material we discussed in class. The weaknesses were how difficult it was to engage with such dense material that wasnt easily understood a lot of the time.",
                "I really enjoyed the structure of the class, the readings went well with the lectures. I do think one weakness of the course was how many of the classes were lecture style, and less seminar (this may have been due, however, to the lack of engagement from my peers). I absolutely loved the debates, and making our own stone tools to showcase how difficult it actually is was a great hands-on way to learn about the material."

If you're looking for a gut social science credit with a fair amount of biology, I'd also recommend it (with an asterisk). Elsewise, I wouldn't.",

If paleo anthropology is your interest then it could be for you. I just felt that for a seminar, it was heavy on lectures and the assignments didnt feel engaging with what we had talked about in class a lot.",
                "It is definitely a niche subject in terms of areas of study, so I would recommend with caution. I was not extremely interested in the study of human origins initially, but my interest grew over time. Overall, I would recommend it, but almost all students would be starting from scratch."
