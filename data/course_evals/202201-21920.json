                "I learned about the fundamental mechanisms driving climate change, and the different interactions and feedback loops that exist between them. I developed a deeper understanding of what scientists know about climate change, and what they still don't. I also gained valuable skills in reading and understanding scientific journal articles.",
                "Learned more about the physical science behind climate change.",
                "Great overview of the general concepts of climate change.",
                "I learned about the different components of the earth's climate and how it is affected  by both human and natural change.",
                "Learning about basic models of climate, both from a physical science standpoint and from a computer modeler's standpoint. Math was extremely simple but we covered a wide range of topics from radiative forcing to the natural vs. anthropogenic causes of climate change. It was kind of embarrassing how before this course I couldn't provide a solid rebuttal to climate deniers and this course gave me the facts and figures to do so. That being said, you don't need to take this course to learn all these topics, they're pretty simple to understand, but this course puts all that information in one place, which is nice.",
                "Understanding of the science behind key climate change variables and models",
                "This was a fantastic class. The first half of the course was really excellent at providing us an in-depth understanding of the climate system and all of its components, and the second half had a lot of interesting lectures on specific topics and advances within the climate change community.",
                "I learned about the processes and feedback loops behind climate change - some positive, some negative. In the beginning of the course, each lecture focused on a different topic of the climate system (clouds in the atmosphere, deep ocean, etc). In the second half of the course, lecture was driven by guest speakers, some of which were much more engaging than others. The course was valuable in that it helped me to understand the science behind climate change beyond the simplified explanations we often hear in the social sciences. Furthermore, it made narratives of climate change much more complicated - for example, due to the albedo effect, deforestation can have a cooling impact, as opposed to a warming impact. I sometimes wish I received a clearer answer as to whether deforestation was good or bad, but climate modelling is not a world of simple answers.",
                "I learned about scientific concepts in climate science and how they impact the world.",

                "I feel the first part of the course, which covers more of the math and science behind climate change, should be expanded. It was too much information to really grasp in such a short window of time.",
                "Strengths - the two instructors possess a really broad amount of knowledge between them, and the work in the class is known in advance with no surprises. \r\nWeaknesses - some of the lectures can feel like a lot of data simply being thrown at you with very little context, and most of the students are not particularly engaged with the class. Class attendance was thus rather low, particularly towards the end of the semester.",
                "I found that there was a lot of material covered for the midterm, and then less in the second half of the semester. Having this more dispersed would make it easier to really engage with all of the topics. Having guest speakers at the end of the semester was very interesting.",
                "I think the syllabus is solid. The content is never so rigorous as to be intimidating but it doesn't feel like a gut. You get a solid understanding of the topic and engage with it in a quantitative way.\r\n\r\nI wish there was more interaction between professors and students though.",
                "Strengths: strong support from teachers, guest lecturers to break up the material from class, easy but engaging assignments (I like the practice of writing short literature reviews) \r\nWeaknesses: after a while the material got a little dry and repetitive",
                "I thought the class was overall really strong. The only real flaw was that there were a few guest lecturers who were quite dry and harder to follow along, and some repeat of material across guest lecturers since they didn't know what we had already been taught by professors Lee and Raymond.",
                "I think the strength of the course was how it gave non-STEM people the change to learn important scientific processes. It didn't feel like a gut during the first half of the course. It had a manageable difficulty that a lot of other science guts don't have. This to me was a good thing! I felt engaged and interested in the lectures. Of course, some were more interesting than others, but overall I really loved the first half. \r\n\r\nI think the weakness of the course was the second half. The people who spoke to us were experts, but that didn't necessarily mean they knew how to communicate information effectively. Furthermore, there were no repercussions for missing class since the problem sets/literature critiques were unrelated to the lecture material. I feel like overall class engagement really dropped off, and more engaging speakers or more engagement with the students would have been valuable.",
                "The course was easily comprehensible and the guest lecturers were cool to listen to. It was a little bit annoying that lectures were recorded but you had to specifically request to view them.",
                "Strengths of this course include the speakers! I felt like they really added to the course and rounded out some of the content in a way that felt applicable and relevant to the real world. However, I think the lectures could have been more engaging -- it was easy to not come to class since the professors essentially just read off the slides.",
                "While the content of the course is interesting, it is very disorganized. Your success is dependent on who the TFs are. Without them, even passing the course is difficult, as the textbook, lectures, and ancillary readings are all out of sync.",
                "The course has lots of information but sometimes the assignments seem disconnected from the coursework. Better integration of the two could increase student engagement.",
                "course work was concentrated in the beginning, could have been more spread out to keep engagement up through the end of the course. some of the lectures were a bit dense and dry, could have covered more context mixed in with the science.",

As much as I feel like like it could have been more engaging, I still learned a lot of valuable information in a non-intimidating environment. Also, having a class with a very low workload is not inherently bad - I felt it was what I needed at the time, and the class never became a stressor for me.",
