                "The course was a good preparation for Intermediate and Upper Intermediate Levels of German (L3 and L4) after the Elementary Level course in the fall (L1). The importance of extensive reading and reflection on reading was highlighted, directing me towards higher levels of operating with the language. With Professor Rahmani, I have significantly improved my writing and speaking skills. I also know how to practice German with native speakers thanks to the Email Exchange program with a high school student in Germany.",

            "comments": [
                "A lot of homework that didn't help with learning",
                "Strengths- This course is very well structured and the work you need to do well each week is clearly stated on the syllabus. The instructors in this department are simply fantastic (Especially Shila! But I heard she is leaving...) I also love how creative the final is and the film we watched was very interesting (I liked Tschick more than the film we saw in L1!)\r\nWeaknesses- The workload is high and this course gets considerably more challenging as the semester progresses. L2 German is overall harder than L1 so just expect that and also forgive yourself with listening (it's a really hard skill to develop- I wish we were tested on it less because there is no real way to practice so it is simply disappointing to often get points off for a skill that is inherent to how good you are at comprehending fast, fluent German)",
                "The course is incredibly fast-paced and intensive which is great for continued familiarity of concepts but doesn't provide much time for practice. Additionally, the textbook being in German makes it difficult to know what is required and presents a substantial learning curve. lastly, the Unit assessments are great in place of a final exam but present listing tasks that are too advanced and fast.",
                "What I liked most in this course was how much it encouraged the students to interact with one another to practice what was covered in class. The final project for the course is one example where we got to apply what we learned over the entire semester. One thing I would recommend changing would be the presentations used by our Professor. Instead of limiting the topics in grammar and the discussions of cultural specialties of a country (Germany, in this case) to presentations prepared for the instructor by someone else in the faculty, the relevant instructor could have more freedom to customize the curriculum of the course.",
                "high workload. group projects mean you may end up with bad partners.",
                "The main strength is that the lessons are usually broken up in a way that makes a lot of sense, so learning grammar structures is usually not bad. The biggest weakness is that this class has a lot of busy work. This class meets every day, and, on top of that, you will have a lot of work outside of class. I felt that a lot of the work did not help my skills at all.",
                "The German department needs to take a long look at how they structure their curriculum. We are given lots of busy work that does not really help us learn the language (Ubungen). Furthermore, the textbook we use is not great. There are lots of mistakes in it, and there are not good vocabulary lists to study within the textbooks. Furthermore, the department does not tell us when or what will be on our assessments, which is rediculous."

                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning German at Yale. As long as you put in the work, you will get so much out of this class! Don't be afraid to get a tutor from CLS (I got one and he was great and it was good to supplement this class with more conversations in German). Overall, this course prepares you for higher-level German and gives a broad overview of the German language and culture. Grammar is hard and prepare to memorize a bunch of rules. But this course is designed for your success so the bottom line is that you should not be scared to take it! That being said, I do recommend working on your weekly homework in advance and not submitting it the night of the deadline:( It will get stressful if you do!",
                "Yes because my professor was incredible",
                "For a student interested in taking up German, I would definitely suggest taking German 120. The course allows the students to evaluate their future plans for advancing in learning the language further and possibly encourage them to consider Yale Summer Session in Berlin",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to learn German, but only if Shila were teaching it. She is wonderful and exceedingly supportive and helpful in every way."
