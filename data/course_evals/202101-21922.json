A definite strength was the flexibility and freedom students had over their work.  Our only commitments were to ourselves and our advisors --- as long as the two major assignments were turned in on time, we could structure and pace our knowledge accumulation and generation as we wished.  This is also a bit of a weakness, however.  It might have been nice to have at least *some* interaction throughout the semester with the instructor or other students, even if that interaction wouldn't have been essential to completing the work.",
