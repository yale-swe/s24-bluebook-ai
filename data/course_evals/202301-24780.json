It also taught me how to analyze primary and secondary sources and how to be a better writer.",

Topics included hair, reproduction, hygiene, and death. We developed skills in the analysis of primary historical sources along with secondary sources. We then wrote essays on this analysis while also making claims about the present day. Another component of the course was the book club. We formed small groups and deeply analyzed and presented a secondary source on the history of the body."

Prof. Eisenberg is very knowledgeable, did a great job curating the course, is very approachable, and truly wants his students to learn and succeed. The midterm and final papers teach you how to analyze primary sources and write effectively. Weaknesses: None!",

                "strengths: we get thorough feedback on writing assignments which means that many writing assignments are not necessary, not a lot of busy work, discussions are fairly guided and we aren't expected to make new and substantial claims but just expected to share ideas, more relaxed seminar, book club was a good way to get exposed to more writing\r\n\r\nweaknesses: we are given many readings but don't fully discuss them to the depth that they are written in, some classes were facilitated too much with little opportunity for us students to really bounce off of each other, sometimes too much new material (such as videos and clips) introduced in class so there is less time for discussion of the readings,"

The people in the class provide a very welcoming and open space to discuss the course topics, and the different perspectives that we discuss have made it so that I will never the human body the same ever again (in a good way).",

Although I wish we could've more thoroughly and productively discussed some things, it was fascinating to do the readings and hear classmates' perspectives. This course does require in-class participation but otherwise, it is not extremely challenging."
