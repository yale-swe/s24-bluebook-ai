We learned about specific figures that were overlooked by history as well as famous figures that we often do not discuss in the context of queerness, Blackness, or Jewishness (Michelangelo is an example that quickly comes to mind!).",

                "This is an extremely strong course. I thought all of the readings were relevant and engaging without being overwhelming. I also really enjoyed class discussion. The assignments, which consisted of a presentation, journal entries, and creative final project, were honestly some of the most enjoyable assignments I have ever had at Yale; I also feel that, even without being stressful, they assessed our learning well. I honestly cannot think of a way to improve this class--I didn't love all of the readings, but none stand out to me as something that should be removed from the course.",
                "Strengths: Such interesting prep materials that didn't make doing work for the class feel like work\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was too short! Felt like we need more time each class to discuss all the material we had in front of us",
                "This course is very organized, and the expectations of what needs to be completed and how to complete it were always very clear and transparent.",
                "The class allows for a lot of self-direction on the students' end, which can prove very empowering or make a good amount of self-motivation a prerequisite for students."

The material is interesting and engaging, Alessandro is knowledgeable and understanding, and the course is structured in a way that it is both captivating and manageable. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, regardless of academic background--it is a great way to learn about overlooked diverse voices throughout Italian history.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! Prof Giammei is so dynamic and puts so much heart and thought into crafting this syllabus and the class. It is definitely not a class you want to miss out on (even if you have never taken an Italian studies class before).",
                "Yes, I would totally recommend this course to another student. The class was always engaging and is a great course that will encourage you to rethink and examine your own views of identity, politics, sexuality, race, religion, etc., within the Italian landscape.",
