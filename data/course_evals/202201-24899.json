For the last few weeks of the course, I learned how to use the tools in the CEID to design and create a musical instrument. By the end of the course, I made my own musical instrument from scratch.",

                "Strengths: Very interesting content, work with your hands on creating instruments, lots of freedom in creating final project instrument, Professor Wilen will help you with anything and everything you need if you aren't comfortable with certain parts of making an instrument\r\nWeaknesses: Workload is very, very end-heavy",
                "The course is extremely interesting and unlike any theory course that I've taken before. Students get a lot of hands-on experience into soldering, laser cutting, and 3D printing, something I never had the opportunity to try before this course. I also went through the iterative design process to create a novel musical instrument. However, I wish that we were able to start our musical instrument earlier, perhaps by making some of the problem sets early on were shorter. A lot of the problem sets near the beginning of the course felt like busy work rather an investigation into new topics and concepts.",
                "Strengths: this is truly a one-of-a-kind Yale class, hands-on experience in building a musical instrument and Larry is an extremely dedicated professor who will work with you one-on-one to help you design and build your instrument \r\nBeware that this is a very very demanding class - it takes a lot of time and if you do not have the time for that, I would advise against it. However, it is truly worth it if you do have the time."

                "110% yes!!!! Larry is so knowledgeable, and you get to make a project you can really feel proud of. You get so much feedback, and the class becomes incredibly collaborative and close. You learn SO SO much, and you get to try your hand at lots of machines in the CEID. I've never learned so much in a class. It's also such an interdisciplinary class that there's something for everyone in it. Don't be dissuaded by the workload. It's not bad at the start. Most of the work just depends on what kind of project you decide to make, and Larry is there to help you along the way",
                "yes",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in creating musical instruments, using the tools in the CEID, or simply pushing themselves creatively to make something amazing. The first half of the class is pretty slow with lectures on how frequencies are created with different mediums (i.e percussion, wind, or string). The second half of the class is primarily focused on creating your own musical instrument, which is a ton of work but also a ton of fun. Expect to spend a LOT of time in the CEID in the last few weeks of the class and be prepared to be a little frustrated when things don't work perfectly. Despite the hard parts, Larry is a super hyperactive prof who will help you with anything you need. He also spends a ton of time in the CEID as the instruments come together and helps wherever he can. One nice side effect of all this CEID time is that you will likely get pretty close to some of your classmates, which is always great, and you will be so proud of whatever you create. :)",
                "Yes! This course is such a cool concept, and the final project is extremely rewarding. However, do keep in mind that the course does take a lot of time, but this process is time well spent.",
                "Yes, but only if you have the time later in the semester when you build your instrument \r\nI spent 10 hours a day in the CEID for the last two weeks of class"
