    "This was a great course to look at just how varied the roles of medieval women were in written material. We focused almost exclusively on little-known pieces, which gave us a great opportunity to make some of the first observations about a piece of literature.",
    "The number one thing I will take away from this class is a new appreciation for poetry. Throughout my academic career I had never really understood why poetry was so highly considered, now I've been converted. I have taken several classes about questions of womanhood and femininity, and this one made me question things that I took for granted in the other classes.",
    "I formed a deeper knowledge of and appreciation for medieval literature, and the diverse ways women were represented by different authors and different cultures. I practiced analyzing primary literature and putting aside my biases and preconceptions, and at times, shock and repulsion, in order to try to understand what the author is saying, and what conclusions we can and cannot draw from a text. The course was open-ended in all aspects, to the point of being very challenging (and at times distressing) when writing papers with no specific prompt, but ultimately I think the challenge was worth it, and it made me a better thinker and writer.",
    "This course develops a dynamic understanding of the Medieval world, deconstructing many modern assumptions about gender and sexuality in the past. Through the engaging class discussions we were challenged to engage with untraditional interpretations of texts which in turn developed our skills as writers."

   "comments": [
    "The primary sources in this class are great! So interesting and varied. Class discussions go on well too.\r\n\r\nI do wish that we had a little more context and structure for what we're reading. I often began class wishing I knew a bit more about the cultural context of a piece. Also, because this was the first time the class was taught, there was a small hiccup and we all ended up doing the wrong assignment and having to redo it. That was a bummer.",
    "One of the greatest strengths of the course is the wide variety of texts we read. I never knew what to expect from that week's reading, but they always proved to be interesting and thought-provoking. Professor Gruenbaum facilitates discussion excellently and was always prepared with a great deal of background information about the texts and insightful questions for us to discuss.",
    "I always thought the concept of the course was really cool. I liked how experimental it was; it wasn't supposed to go down a preordained path or reach certain conclusions about the texts. We looked at only primary literature, and were encouraged to reach our own conclusions about it under the theme of \"sexy, saintly and subdued.\"  Another strength was the small and intimate nature of the seminar, which made it less intimidating and easier for me to speak and connect with Professor Gruenbaum. Although the texts represented a lot of different cultures and locations, European texts still made up most of the texts we read, and I think the course could be even better if it had more non-European texts.",
    "The strength of this course is in the texts, which you won't read in any other course at Yale, the instruction, which is top-notch, and the students, who must be engaged to produce intellectually stimulating discussions. One aspect of the course is student run discussions. These can be a weak point because the students need to do quite a bit of research and deep reading to cultivate interesting discussions that go beyond basic questions like \"Is this a feminist narrative?\" or \"How is gender portrayed int his text?\""

    "This is a good class if you're interested in reading unusual sources and having great discussions. You have to be ok with a bit of a lack of structure. The materials we read come from all over the world during the medieval period, so there isn't really one takeaway and week by week you can end up doing something completely different.",
    "Yes! I looked forward to this class every week. I took it knowing very little about the medieval world and only a bit about literature, religion and womanhood. The class was accessible to people with little background in the material, but still probed deeply and transcended the basics.",
    "Yes! This class is really unique and it is probably hard to find a course like this at other colleges. The texts were sometimes funny and sometimes horrifying, and helped me challenge my own modern biases and preconceptions of the way women were treated in medieval times. The class discussions were always interesting and fun. Writing the papers was challenging but I learned a lot through trial and error.",
    "Absolutely!  This course is fantastic. It manages to cultivate niche knowledge and yet remains broadly applicable in understanding gender, literary themes, and medieval religion."
