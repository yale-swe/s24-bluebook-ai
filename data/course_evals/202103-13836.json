                "I believe my essay writing skills have improved a lot by taking this course. The course makes us practice close reading and analysis, as well as engage in discussion that would develop a lot of arguments for our essay. Having a written assignment at the end of each unit also helped me learn how to focus my argument.",
                "This class gave me the skills to be a better and stronger writer and, more importantly, thinker. The readings chosen throughout the class were insightful and interesting. More importantly, the way in which discussions were facilitated throughout the term was great for individual thought for each student. While in the beginning of the class Professor spoke a bit more and facilitated a bit more, throughout the course she would hand the reins to her students which allowed for our thinking to truly flourish. Professor was always there for us if we needed help. I believe the grading on essays were a bit harsh, but it was not unreasonable by any means. Overall, I had a good time in the course and it enhanced my thinking and thought processes.",
                "I learned a lot about my style or writing and reading and how I can improve upon both.",

                "Definitely a writing class, don't be deceived by the title. Significantly helped me improve my writing over the course of the semester.",
                "This course improved the clarity and sophistication of my writing while exposing me to the fascinating intersections between literature, quantum physics, and postmodern philosophy. While the reading material was always interesting and well-suited to the course, the individualized writing feedback on essays was by far the most valuable component of the class. I learned to organize and communicate my ideas in a more cogent manner, and the comments I received on my written work will certainly be useful as I think about my writing in future humanities-oriented courses at Yale.",
                "This class was very helpful in my understanding of how to take on writing in college and was a good first writing class to take at Yale. It was also very well taught and there was strong feedback for each essay through the use of essay meetings.",
                "I learnt so much about how to think about different ideas in relation to each other, and how to handle these ideas in a single essay."

            "comments": [
                "A strength of this course was the discussions. This isnt necessarily a controllable weakness, but I felt like many of the students in the course shared similar academic interests, which often skewed the discussions in one direction.",
                "A big strength of this course is its seminar format, and how the discussions we had each class were engaging and fun. I would also say that all the readings were interesting, although sometimes the amount of paged we had to read for the next class (which was in 2 days) was too much. Id also say this course could be improved by shifting its focus a bit: it was only Unit 1 that I thought had a philosophy focus with Jim Holts book (the assigned reading for that unit). Every other Unit of the course felt like it was focused on literature with sprinkles of physics and philosophy on the side, rather than having all 3 balanced. I just wish more of the primary readings were philosophical or physics analyses rather than literary works.",
                "The strengths of the course was its interdisciplinary nature and the ambition of even trying to connect physics, literature, and philosophy. It was extremely interesting to see the students thought processes change throughout the course. I have no comments on negatives; it was an awesome course.",
                "Maybe one too many books as it was a lot of required reading but overall the pace and information was very interesting.",
                "Strengths: really interesting connections and points made during engaging class discussions; intellectual freedom within essays; great feedback on essays\r\nWeaknesses: heavy reading; some of the science/quantum mechanics readings were difficult to understand and did not always feel relevant to the rest of the class content",
                "Honestly, I think the biggest weakness of the course is the fact that we don't get more of Prof. B's personal insights into the material. At times, the texts are incredibly difficult and complex (Heidegger, Woolf, and even Auster's could be difficult to parse through), and yet we were left to figure it out through lukewarm class discussions which often didn't do the text justice and left me often confused, despite asking questions in the discussion that attempted to get at the heart of my points of confusion.",
                "For the most part, the course is well-structured, engaging, and manageable. Although the amount of reading is fairly intense (five relatively challenging and somewhat technical books/novels interspersed with regular short readings on physics and philosophy), the rigor of written work assigned is fair, especially for a course that fulfills a writing credit. Each essay assignment becomes progressively more demanding; both the length of essays and the sophistication of the prompts step up in difficulty throughout the course. I felt like this structure enabled me to experiment more with ideas as I gained confidence in my writing. The writing feedback is incredibly clear, detailed, and specific, and I never left a conference with Prof. B feeling confused about my performance on an essay or without a clear plan to improve my next piece. It's incredible that Prof. B meets individually with each one of her students to provide feedback; she was also willing to meet with me outside of the official conferences to discuss ideas on a regular basis. \r\n\r\nThe content of the course itself feels like the somewhat weaker component of the class. I took this class because I've always gravitated toward literature, had taken a fair amount of physics in high school, and hardly had any technical exposure to real philosophy. While I thoroughly enjoyed the readings and discussions, I'm not sure my knowledge of any of the three disciplines truly coalesced in a revolutionary way. There's not a ton of emphasis on philosophy, and the discussions of physics felt somewhat superficial, but I did feel like these issues were counterbalanced by reading some thought-provoking literature. For this reason, the second half of the class was more enjoyable to me, as I was able to delve into literature in a way that felt more authentic.",
                "Strengths are the discussions we had in class, the essays, and the teaching. To improve the class, I think having some more multimedia sources would be interesting. For example, Holt mentions lectures given by certain people, I think it could be interesting to watch one of those for homework and make that a source as it would be a primary source and a good look into the actual thoughts of one of the people we talk about.",
                "I think this is a very good course to encourage you to think deeply about the intersections between different topics, though sometimes I felt like philosophical ideas could have been more explicitly explored and related to the other topics being discussed. Sometimes the syllabus also felt a little rushed, but with so many things to cover that is to be expected."

                "I would recommend this course to others, if they are interested in writing essays and engaging with a lot of difficult/weird physics and philosophical concepts and applying them to literary analysis in a very fun way. Overall the course is very fun and there was not a lot of pressure during each class.",
                "GPA wise? Perhaps not. If you are looking for an easy class to skate by on, this is not it. But it truly enhances your thinking and ability to see the world differently, so yes.",
                "Yes. I learned a lot about topics I have never learned before.",
                "Absolutely, this was my favorite course during the semester! The readings, especially the novels we read, were consistently interesting to analyze, and the class discussions were very engaging. Professor Bilsky also gives amazing feedback on essays, and her use of one-on-one conferences to share this feedback was incredibly useful in helping me to become a better writer. The course is definitely a lot of reading, but it is absolutely worth it because I got a lot out of the class and actually really enjoyed writing the essays. It is very dependent on the class discussions, so the people in the class definitely matter. If you're willing to do the readings and be engaged in the class discussions, this course is awesome!",
                "Honestly, this is a very difficult question. I don't feel that the subject matter that the course purports to engage with (philosophy, physics, and literature) was really explored to the extent that I'd like them to be. Philosophy and physics were definitely sidelined to literature in terms of depth and quality of instruction and discussion, but at the end of the day I felt like I came out knowing a lot more about the topics than I came in with. Of course you cannot teach quantum mechanics and modern epistemology in a freshman writing sem, but I think there could have been a better job of exploring the profundity of philosophical or physical developments rather than observing a text that was way above our understanding, exclaiming that it was really interesting, then moving on. This feeling would describe well my emotions throughout a lot of the course.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. My writing has improved, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to gain some exposure to the confluence of three incredibly rich intellectual disciplines. I do think that enjoyment of this course is proportional to engagement with the content outside of the class itself, however. While the class discussions were always thoughtful and relatively interesting, I never left class itself feeling like the quality of the conversations made the class worth it. I think I gained the most from this class in the process of researching for my essays, talking to Prof. B outside the class, and completing the readings.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student given that they were willing to wake up for it. Additionally, I think this course is very interesting even if you're not interested in going deeper into philosophy, physics, or literature.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in all three of these subjects, but particularly literature as this does form a large basis of the syllabus."
