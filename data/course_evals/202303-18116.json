                "The main strength of the course was it gave a good overview of statistical methods in R. The main weakness was perhaps the training wheels were a little too heavy. Our pset could have been a little more difficult with more initiation and exploration.",
                "Homework could be very time consuming, and maybe reduced in length/simplified to only apply the most essential statistical topics. Otherwise course was extremely well-organized and clear in expectations",
                "Weakness: too much work",
                "The content is very useful.\r\nIt would be better if there could be a review checklist with all the contents that might be tested.",
                "I think some of the homework assignments could have been shorter. I also think that theory could be emphasized more to help prepare for the exams.",
                "Strengths: extremely well organized, lots of resources for help, a comprehensive introduction\r\nWeaknesses: lots of little details tested on the exams, final extremely weighted in comparison to final project",
                "I think the homework assignments were well designed. I think that the balance between teaching stats concepts and teaching R is a bit difficult, but it would have been nice if the homework and tests aligned a little bit more on that axis.",
                "Strengths: homeworks were fair, office hours were quite readily accessible\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes, content required for homework was not always covered in class",
                "Strengths: the problem sets and project are interesting and force you to apply what you've learned to make interesting conclusions\r\nWeaknesses: the instructor is incredibly boring to listen to and the written exams are a pain and don't really reflect much of the work done in the class",
                "I enjoyed the coding aspect of the course. There was a strong emphasis on conceptual learning that I struggled to grasp during the lecture. Perhaps more interactive slides or different visual explanations that make the information more digestible.",
                "This course was very well organized and I felt like each lesson and homework was valuable. Sometimes we spent too much time on review causing us to rush through other topics.",
                "The course is very very good. Prof. Meyers explained complicated statistical theory in an intuitive and easily understandable way. The homework is very relative to the course materials and help students to improve coding skills.",
                "Strengths: lectures were very helpful, psets also helped learn a lot, and I enjoyed the final project!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish it wasn't at 9am",
                "I liked the interesting data sets that Professor Meyers chose. I felt that showing interesting findings and statistics from the data engaged me more, and helped me remember the concepts and practices better. I also felt that the homework and grading was very fair, and we were tested/assigned concepts that were actually taught in class. I also thought there was a good balance of time spent between teaching statistical concepts through the Powerpoint and applying those concepts to coding in R. A weakness is that at the beginning of the semester, the review of concepts from the previous lecture would take up too much time, and we would not have enough time towards the end of class to learn the coding or supplementary material. This was fixed gradually as we moved through the semester.",
                "The course is really nicely structured, great course organization and very thoughtful planning of classes and homeworks, as well as the set-up of the course (good use of Canvas and Ed Discussions). The professor, Ethan Meyers, clearly cares a lot about his teaching and our learning. Classes are a very well-planned, thoughtful mix of lecture slides and RStudio \"worksheets\" that we do together, with lots of interactive learning. Can't really think of any weaknesses off the top of my head.",

                "I think the course is great as is.",
                "Recorded lectures and great pedagogy were the two of the greatest strengths of this course. I didn't even need to attend office hours because the classes and R tutorials we did in class were enough to do the homework sets.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can think of are the unnecessary rules and regulations surrounding the cheat sheet we are allowed to create for the exams. That just makes things more stressful.",
                "Strength: being able to enage with the material through homework and asking professor in class\r\nWeakness: Some concepts were too theoretical",
                "I really enjoyed the class and I learned a lot that I can implement for other analyses.",
                "Weekly problem sets with repeated data sets were useful.",
                "strengths : great teacher, great engaging assignments and exams\r\nweakness: none\r\n\r\nimprovement: first few lectures were slow and pace can be hastened so we can spend more time on high yield topics",
                "Strengths: very practical and efficient use of R. The class was well-structured. Many new and advanced statistical techniques in R were taught.",
                "Weaknesses: The course is badly structured, is really bad at introducing useful coding skills, and focuses way too much on details that are not that useful.\r\nStrengths: The classes are not stressful.",
                "The topics are organized well",
                "I liked how it taught and incorporated R, had real world problem sets. I do not really know how it could be improved",
                "Strength: engaging p-sets\r\nWeakness: Challenging to track topics and review all topics at the end.",
                "Well organized, homework corresponded with content from class, but midterms and final tested information in a way that was different from how it was shown in class or on homeworks which made studying for them difficult. True False questions felt a little unfair as they tested concepts that hadnt been explicitly mentioned",
                "A strength of this course was that the problem sets definitely facilitated learning and kept you accountable for continuing to review the class content. Lectures weren't always the most engaging but were helpful as well. Weaknesses included that the level of difficulty increased dramatically in the final three weeks or so of the class; it would have been better if more time was spent on the harder content introduced at the end.",
                "The strengths are that there was a lot of help and assistance offered through several platforms and practice was done during class time as well."

R is something Ive wanted to learn for a while, and this gave a really good intro to working within the language and creating analyses/plots. Meyers has a very well laid out and structured course with clear directions for psets, exams, etc. It was really interesting to gain some insight on the different methods of statistical analysis and see ways that personal projects/research could use these in the future. Definitely helped that I had a bit of coding as well as intro stats background; it made the first part of the course a lot easier  if you dont have any coding background at all I think it would be quite difficult. His exams are honestly quite difficult though. He tests small details on the multiple choice that arent really highlighted in lecture and require quite a bit of extrapolation from understanding the concepts deeply, which can be frustrating. Overall, this is a great foundational statistics course and a good avenue into more advanced material.",
                "Yes, I think it was overall engaging and interesting.",

                "Yes, I would totally recommend this class! The amount I've learned since the beginning of the semester is really awesome. The exams are fair and Prof.Meyers is a great lecturer. A weakness is that the peer tutors and TFs for this class are not very helpful.",
