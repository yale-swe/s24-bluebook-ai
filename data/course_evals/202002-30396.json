    "Outstanding overview of the period. From literature and the arts to philosophy and politics, Professors Bloch and Spitz traversed the Belle Epoque with erudition and generosity.",
    "French literature and art.",
    "Learned to think critically about literature, got an introduction to art history  and french culture.",
    "I learned a lot about French literature, and the Belle Epoque in France. I developed skills for reading accurately and fast. I learned how to connect ideas and understand broad themes without outside sources.",
    "I improved my close reading and my visual analysis of paintings",
    "Besides just the material that was taught in the course concerning the Belle Epoque, its authors, and its artists, I took away some valuable lessons that learning online, although very different from the classroom setting, can be very fun and engaging. That was certainly the case with this class which I much much appreciated.",
    "Read good books, honed skills of literary analysis."

   "comments": [
    "I don't think the course can be improved; if anything, perhaps the class could meet three times a week for a shorter periods of time to reinforce student engagement, although engagement was far from being an issue this summer.",
    "Strengths- the professors, weaknesses- nothing",
    "I think the course might be improved by doing readings alongside the art lectures each week. In this way everything might be integrated.",
    "The course is wonderfully interdisciplinary and effectively ties together different artistic mediums\/movements.",
    "The strengths of this course are the instructors, their insight, their profound understanding of the material which they presented, and their overall ability to keep discussions engaging and interesting.\r\nWeaknesses may include the element that I took the course from a chair in my bedroom rather than a classroom in France:\/.",
    "The class lengths were too long to stay engaged, 2 hours twice a week would be much more effective in keeping our attention.",
    "Great syllabus, loved the interdisciplinary approach to the period."

    "reading culled by a very knowledgeable professor, and able to view the literature and visual art along with major historical events",
    "Yes, as long as 1) they are deeply interested in the period, and 2) they are prepared to do the reading. Professors Bloch and Spitz are fantastic, but the core of the class lies in its well-constructed syllabus. Having taken the class online, I can only imagine how good it must be when taken in person in Paris.",
    "Yes, very interesting",
    "Yes, I would especially recommend this class to STEM students who mught not have much experience in humanities, due to the accessible structure and engagement of the class.",
    "Absolutely, I loved learning about the artwork and the literature. It opened my eyes to a different time period that I had never learned about.",
    "Absolutely! Belle Epoque France was even richer and more variegated in artistic movements than I thought. This course not only teaches you about some of the seminal artistic and literary movements of the turn of the century, it also develops your taste.",
    "Definitely, the instructors are phenomenal and really know their subject matter. They present the material in such a way that even if you never experienced any particular intrigue from viewing art or studying about the \"Golden Age\" of France, your views would be liable to change by the end of the course.",
    "It's a very solid French lit class. Nothing about it blew my mind, but I'm happy to have read the books and feel like I got a good analysis of each of them."
