                "I learnt about the basics and a fair amount of intermediate knowledge needed to use ArcGIS Pro. The class has an emphasis on raster mapping rather than polygons (largely due to Prof. Tomlin's work in the former - he did invent the raster calculator, after all), so it is a tad one-sided. The class gives you an understanding of many of the functions and also a fair guide as to what resources you would need to consult to learn more.",

            "comments": [
                "While this class was a LOT of work (be prepared, and dont take this class when you do a high workload semester) it was well structured, and I really liked the segmentation of learning something new each week and then applying it to a PSET (rather than a final project at the end). This approach felt much more effective at facilitating student learning. Also Dana is a legend, and knows everything about GIS, and was really good at teaching this to students (I came in knowing absolutely nothing about GIS) \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didnt like the uneven weighting of the PSETS. I wish that every PSET had the exact same weighting on our final grade and that the lowest PSET of the semester was dropped (sometimes we didnt find out how much something was worth or if it would be dropped until after we had done it). The PSETS were also a lot of work, which I dont think is a weakness per se, but specifically, I wish each one was wholeheartedly applicable to real world situations. (Like I didnt like the cereal land one since it seemed pointless and was incredibly frustrating). But most of the PSETs were great, and although a lot of work, I always felt so accomplished and proud of the work I had done. \r\n\r\nI do also wish that some of the assignments made us bring in and format our own data as well, rather than having data sets given to us.",
                "This course was personally interesting and simultaneously useful to my career; it was taught very well and clearly. The assignments were both useful for practicing using ArcGIS Pro, and good assessments of my knowledge. Although Professor Tomlin was very responsive on email, I would have liked to be able to attend office hours via zoom to answer my more hands-on questions.",
                "Strengths: gave us a comprehensive understanding of GIS. I feel like I understand the software now and can apply it in the future. Topics were explained well, tutorials were provided to help us with every assignment...\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes assignment instructions were kind of unclear, could have had a little more on vector datasets",
                "Strengths: Professor Tomlin is incredibly knowledgeable, nicely structured class sessions, the rigor of the assignments forces you to really learn the system\r\nWeaknesses: not much in-class engagement, sometimes impossible to tell what he wants from a homework assignment",
                "Strengths: Prof. Tomlin has a great series of resources (tutorials, guidebooks, videos, etc.) on GIS that will really help throughout the semester. The assignments feel like they are helping you develop your skills.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Seminar-style lectures are a bit long and can get disengaging because of their length. The course might work better in a twice-a-week lecture format.",
                "Strengths: course materials were extremely thorough and well-planned. Homework assignments were all reasonable. \r\nWeaknesses: Homework was sometimes vague and thus more time-consuming than necessary. I appreciated that there was more guidance towards the end of the semester though.",
                "Weakness - no rubric for grading. Professor will grade you based on how eveeyone else is doing in the class",
                "Strengths: The older reviews of the class are somewhat inapplicable - the syllabus is reformed and so only has weekly assignments. This is a massive improvement, in my view. The weekly assignments were difficult, and thus I spent a lot of time on them. A final project on top (that weighed all / a significant portion of the grade) would be insane. Dana also is available for any help you would need, and provides clear feedback on request i/r/t how to improve, though this is not provided by default. I particularly like the choice to submit by Google Drive, so that we can see our peers assignments. I'm not too sure that letting people see each others submissions before the deadline is the greatest idea - I was somewhat concerned with plagiarism. That being said, I didn't see any plagiarism of mine/other's work, so maybe I just have too low standards of Yalies.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would appreciate more grading transparency - Prof. Tomlin is very unclear, preferring to use his own system of \"average\", \"above/below average\" and \"well above / well below average\", with no clear conversion to the A/A-/B+ etc. grades. He also uses an odd weighting system, where assignments later on in the semester weigh more than the earlier ones. It isn't clear how this manifests exactly, and I didn't really appreciate that part. A more standard grading system would really take away much of the uncertainty in the course.",
                "I think a final project could have been a solid application of the skills learned.",
                "The lectures and the assignments pair well together by showing the material and then allowing the student to apply their knowledge to a real product in the software each week.",
                "Did give a good understanding of GIS. The software was very annoying to use, with many problems pooping up out of the blue. The problem sets themselves took a while. Particularly the presentation of them could take as long as the work itself."
