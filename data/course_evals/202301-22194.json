                "The issue isnt the course or the instructor, its that is wasnt an intermediate acting course. Because 210 is no longer a requirement, the course was filled with people who should have been in beginning acting. Because of this, people who have more experience acting did not learn much because the course had to be tailored for those who didnt. I understand why 210 is no longer a requirement for the directing course, but beginning acting should still be required to be taken before intermediate acting.",
