                "I developed a better understanding of how to design and run experiments, how to write psych papers, and how to handle data.",
                "How to write a scientific psychological paper the exact, precise way. Very helpful, not too difficult if you put in the work and pay attention.",
                "I learned how to analyze research articles and conduct research myself. I learned a lot more about the specifics of the research process than I expected to before this class.",

                "Learned the formal processes involved in research in psychology, ranging from early brainstorming to report write-ups. Highly instructive and engaging course",

                "I learned not only how to read research papers, but how to break them down by each section. I learned how to analyze data and what thse result smight mean in the broader world. I also learned how to pose a question and answer it myself."

                "Strengths: Almost everything. Professor Hirsch is amazing. She was so accommodating and so helpful. Also, she is an amazing communicator. Always made things clear, and I never had any trouble understanding the concepts. If I did have a question, she was really helpful and answered my question. Loved the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't like that some assignments were due on Sunday. I would rather wait an extra day to get feedback than have to turn something in on a weekend. For student athletes \/ students on competition teams this was difficult. Had frequent trouble making these deadlines.",
                "The strengths were how well the course was organized and structured, as well as how much individual feedback we received. It was great to have the assignments split up into biweekly chunks rather than one entire assignment. No weaknesses.",
                "The course format was very engaging and I liked the sort of flipped classroom model, there was a lot of opportunity to share ideas with the group and foster discussion.",
                "Strengths: step-by-step guidance for major projects throughout the semester. Very detailed feedback from professors and TF.\r\nWeaknesses: Harsh grading",
                "Strengths: well-structured, accommodating to all, great helpful feedback, well taught\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: too rigid at times",
                "I think one main strength is the size of the class allows you to work one on one not only with the teacher and TA, but also to engage more with other classmates. I think one thing to improve the course would possibly more incentive to complete InQuizitives. Sometimes the quizzes seemed tedious."

                "Yes, I would totally recommend taking this course if you plan on doing research in the future and\/or if you need a writing credit!",
                "Yes, definitely. Don't be scared by \"writing intensive.\" They walk you through every step and you will love it!",
                "Absolutely. I learned so much more than I expected to, loved the material and assignments and my classmates and the professors. At least shop it, because it was amazing and youll learn more than you can expect. The name might sound boring but the class is super fun and also creative.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in research, academia, grad school etc., this course is very practical and useful",
                "Yes, absolutely if you are a Psychology major, taking this class with Professor Hirsch will really support your understanding of research in psychology in a fun and engaging way. Professor Hirsch is supportive, very attentive, and a great lecturer. Her teaching style motivates students to participate, engage with the material, and sometimes even go beyond what is asked.",
                "Yes! It might seem like a lot of work at first, but Prof. Hirsch does a good job structuring the class so everyone can enjoy the process and benefit from their hard work! As someone on the neurodivergence spectrum, this is one of the most accessible classes Ive taken despite the heavy work load.",
                "I definitely would recommend taking this course early if you are interested in the psychology major. I found this class to benefit me in the rest of my psych classes and I wish i had taken it sooner."
