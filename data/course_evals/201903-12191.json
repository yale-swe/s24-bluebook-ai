    "The strengths of the course are in the instructor -- Professor Mohan is incredibly knowledgeable about the material, and has spent enough time in his role at various governing institutions as well as at the Reserve Bank of India that his understanding of the concepts of the course shines through. He has decades of experience in the field and aims to impart what he's learned to students, so at times the course can be incredibly dense -- but his teaching makes every discussion worthwhile and intellectually stimulating."
