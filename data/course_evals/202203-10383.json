                "By taking this course, I learned more about the significance of the Catholic intellectual tradition and how religion has interacted with mainstream society over the years. In a more technical sense, I've also learned how to analyze texts and engage myself in group settings.",
                "I learned a significant amount about the catholic tradition and in general religion. I think it helped me to better understand the impacts of religion and its role in the world.",
                "I developed a much more in depth understanding of Catholic Church history, both of key figures and of theology.",
                "I gained a greater understanding of orthodox Christian theology.",
                "A great understanding of Catholicism over its existence. It was great to focus on specific time points in a bit more detail, and look into some works e.g. Dante's Comeda, whilst also gaining exposure to the entirety of the Tradition up to Vatican II",
                "An extensive knowledge and understanding of the Catholic tradition in its religious practices and manifestations, the intellectual history of Catholics, the development of Catholic ideologies, and how the entire Catholic Intellectual Tradition was both shaped by and helped shape the world in which it has found itself across millennia.",
                "I learned about Catholicism, a religion I have very little familiarity with.",
                "Understanding of the chronology and evolution of the Catholic intellectual tradition over time.",
                "Reading list gives a strong overview of many of the seminal texts in the Christian tradition (Aquinas, Dante, Athanasius, Luther, Pascal, etc.); understanding of many key theological disputes. My appreciation -- as someone who grew up secular -- for religion and Christianity grew greatly.",
                "I learned about the history of Catholic Theology and became a more skilled reader of theological texts as well as a better writer and speaker",
                "Learned about the development of the catholic church doctrine, how the the church has been anything but static and has had to change and grow with changing times. We began with the early creation of the bible, then heresy, mystics, the reformation, the enlightenment, the discovering of the new world, the industrial revolution, tension with capitalism and socialism, and modern day climate change issues. I learned about Catholic thinkers and their contribution to the intellectual tradition of the the church (Augustin, Aquinas, Dante, etc...)",
                "I learned the evolution of the Catholic church and left the class with several large questions about why the church is the way that it is answered.",
                "I definitely learned the tradition of Catholicism that has been passed down for 2 millennia. It was interesting to see how the Catholic church acted throughout the centuries and how it responded to movements that were happening.",
                "This course gave a comprehensive and in-depth overview of the history of Catholic thought and how it has developed over time, it was a great class from both a historical and philosophical perspective. The plethora of guest speakers keep the lectures very entertaining."

            "comments": [
                "This course is very good, but Professor Eire ought to speak more. His humility seems to hold him back from doing so  but he is the best, most knowledgable, most engaging speaker who spoke this semester.",
                "Strengths: solid survey course, covers substantial amounts of material, great guest lectures (world class)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it can be hard to draw continuity from unit to unit, sometimes it isn't clear how a text relates back to the broader meaning of the class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Eire is an amazing and very interesting lecturer; the variety of guest lecturers ensured the course remained consistently fascinating. You will not get to read 90% of these texts in other courses, and getting a chance to learn about the broad contours of Catholic intellectual history is an opportunity not available in any other course here.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the guest lecturers (John Thiel, for example) are much more entertaining than others.",
                "I thought the lecture material was often very interesting. Something I think could have been improved, though, was the quantity of work provided each week. Sometimes, the workload would be manageable, but other weeks I'd find myself having to read through an 80+ text, along with multiple 15+ page texts as well.",
                "The lectures oftentimes are very disconnected to the readings - the background they provided was rarely directed related to the primary texts we read which made them very hard to approach. The readings were sometimes excessive, especially given the difficulty in approaching primary texts. The continuous change of guest lectures sometimes felt excessive and was hard to get used to every professor's teaching style. That being said, with an excellent TA this course can prove very rewarding. I especially enjoyed reading Aquinas and Dante.",
                "This class is strong in the sense it helped to develop a better understanding of the class, but I think the midterm and final can be a bit stressful for students. I also think the lectures did not help to truly emphasize the point of the class.",
                "While I think the guest lecturers were sometimes amazing, others we just okay. I think Prof. Eire could have done some of the guest lectures better than the guests did. Prof. Eire is an amazing prof and is super nice and understanding! The readings were interesting and a reasonable length per week. The enlightenment week readings were the exception to this. The course was well organized and an overall great course. Glad I finally was able to fit it into my schedule as a senior.",
                "Strengths of this course include the various professors who are experts in their respective fields. The biggest weakness is the sheer number of readings, which are difficult to complete at times.",
                "I think the course could be improved by using fewer guest lecturers. Although they were all knowledgeable, it was strange having a different style of lecture basically every week.",
                "I appreciated the frequent participation of guest lecturers, although some were far better than others.",
                "The amount of content covered was great. I felt as though some parts e.g. Catholicism in the modern world could've been covered in a better way (in lieu of just autobiographies) to reflect more the intellectual tradition.",
                "The utilization of guest lecturers and discussion sections was excellent. There was a lot of reading, and it would have been helpful if we were told which pages, sections, or readings were most important.",
                "I thought the guest lecturer format was great, but we were given very little context for what we were reading.",
                "Good survey of primary texts in Catholic history. It was a bit difficult in the beginning for me because I had no background reading Christian texts, so I had to spend a little extra time in the first couple of weeks.",
                "The lecture style was quite disorganized and dull. The content itself was very interesting but hard to engage with in the way that it was presented to students",
                "The readings were often great, but too long (if my TA did not tell me what to focus on, I would have spent a lot of time with uninteresting reading). Justin Hawkins' section was fabulous. Prof. Eire is a great lecturer but unfortunately the guest lecturers were very poor -- one read almost verbatim from a wikipedia entry on one of the authors we were studying.",
                "Strengths: Teaching fellows and Professor Eire and his guest lecturers. They came prepared to lectures and gave us information about the sources that we were reading at the time.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was hard for me to understand the sources we were reading without any context before reading them and it felt like most weeks this was the case",
                "I liked how the class covered most time periods, at times I wished it was a more concentrated era we studied. I also wished the course would cover more modern day issues and how the catholic church views them today like the impact of colonialism, in vitro and surrogacy methods of conception, the pandemic, and abortion. I wish some of the lecturers came a bit more prepared, sometimes it felt like they were just going off from the top of their head. However, some lecturers were incredibly engaging and dynamic. A strength would be the readings chosen, I think the reading workload was manageable and purposeful, I could tell everything I was reading was chosen with intention.",
                "Strengths:\r\nStrong professor and a variety of excellent speakers, especially on the monastic tradition.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSheer volume of reading often felt like we could not sufficiently process the material before we had to move on.\r\nThe expectations of response length and detail were not clearly communicated for the midterm, meaning that I did not write enough and received a poor grade.  This could be improved by encouraging a roughly 1.5 to 2 blue book page length and encourage specific interaction with events such as 'Council of Chalcedon' rather than general analysis alone.",
                "Strengths: my TA Justin was excellent, I liked how there were many guest lectures and see them as experts in their field, I also liked how Professor Eire was teaching the class\r\nWeaknesses: the readings were sometimes too long and they should have been triaged"

                "Yes, as Christian influences are seen across the world, especially in America.",
                "Yes if they are truly interested in the topic and will bring the energy necessary to engage in difficult content even when it is not exciting.",
                "The reading list is fabulous and if you have a good TA you can get a lot out of the class. Also, if you are interested in learning more about your faith \/ feel like you want a strong overview of the Christian tradition, there are few classes outside of this one that will give that to you. With that said, the lectures were generally very poor (some guest lecturers read verbatim from wikipedia); because most lectures were presented by a new professor, the lectures rarely connected well with one another and made it difficult to trace themes across time. There was also less history (more focus on theology) than I would have liked.",
                "Yes, I would if they would like to become a better analyzer of primary source texts from theologians throughout all time. I would also recommend if they were interested in Catholicism in general and wanted to know how the Catholic Church has functioned throughout time in society",
                "I would. Even if you're not Catholic this is an enriching philosophical syllabus and course.",
                "I definitely would, this class is very well structured to increase your understanding of how the catholic church doctrine came to be. I think this class is great for Catholic and non-Catholic students. The discussion sections are fun and engaging and the readings shed a light on how the Catholic Church responds to different time periods.",
                "Yes! Professor Eire is excellent and anyone hoping to gain insight into the current state of the Catholic church will certainly find useful knowledge here.",
