                "Knowledge-wise, I gained a comprehensive knowledge of US foreign policy from FDR\/ Truman through Trump. There are some course blindspots, however, Howard's exceptionally cognizant of these lapses (we can only cover so much in one semester). Skills-wise, you write three policy memos, give one in-class presentation and write a large group paper for the finals. Though it's unexpectedly difficult to fill two single-spaced pages with clear, concise and and pointed policy recommendations, the challenge is worthwhile--you learn so much from the research (which, in the end, isn't THAT cumbersome).",
                "The course has two pretty distinct parts. The seminar discussions themselves are fundamentally a history course. The memos set up explicit policy questions that function more as a strategy or IR assignment. I greatly enjoyed all of it.",
                "I learned about the evolving nature of U.S. foreign policy following WW2.",
                "I learned how to write a succinct and compelling policy memo as well as how to use historical information and data to make policy recommendations. I also got an understanding of the intricacies of foreign policy, including the different stakeholders, competing interests, and complex decision making. Lastly, I got exposure to how NSC meetings are ran through a simulation that put the class in a hypothetical crisis.",
                "Most of the assignments were two page policy memos, so I learned how to condense important information and insights into two pages while providing insightful information. Even with COVID, it was an environment where students got to know each other and it didn't feel stressful. The downside is that the readings could be quite long, but there are reading groups to split the work. \r\n\r\nBefore this class I was very unfamiliar with the foreign policy of any president. The class is centered around in-depth case studies, biographies and news articles that contextualize American policies during their respective time period and connect their decision-making to today. There is definitely a lot for anyone to learn about American foreign policy, and this class presents course content in a fair and interesting way.",
                "You learn about foreign policy through the lens of different US Presidents",
                "I think the discussion we had in this course along with the readings  was incredibly valuable. I learnt a lot about American foreign policy and history, the different approaches to foreign policy, and the current issues the world faces today. Another key skill I learnt was memo-writing, which is very different from the typical prosaic paper I've written for other similar classes.",
                "I developed a deep understanding of American foreign policy and how it changes  and in some ways stays the same  from generation to generation. I also gained stronger policy writing skills through our policy memos, which forced me to write with clarity and purpose.",
                "I learned a lot about how to write more concisely and how to express my points clearer. I learned a ton about the history of American foreign policy.",
                "This course helped me learn a lot about specific events in American foreign policy, while also answering broad questions about what things should impact foreign policy (human rights, climate change, etc).",

                "One unexpected strength is the community that you build throughout the course; I thoroughly enjoyed the reading groups, dinners, group paper etc. for building it.",
                "Howard Dean is, without a doubt, the most refreshing and enjoyable professor I have ever had at Yale. If you're unsure about applying to this course, like I was, do it. I hate reviews like this, and I have often been the reviewer amid 20 fawning praises for a professor who talks about the disadvantages of the course. This class is really that enjoyable. After years of getting increasingly cynical about making change in the world as I dealt with constant toxic posturing from my classmates and the structures that a lot of Yale establishes, Howard gave me hope in making change again. The memos were also incredibly enjoyable; they made me enjoy the process of toiling with the course's ideas. More courses should adopt a many-short-memos evaluation!",
                "Professor Dean asks for students to complete a lot of reading but he assigns everyone into reading groups. Additionally, he speaks a lot during the seminars but that is both a strength and a weakness of the course.",
                "Strengths: Both Howard and Caroline made the virtual classroom environment both welcoming and engaging. They are really accessible and open to talking about anything. Moreover, the reading list was really strong and included some of my personal favorite memoirs. The topics and chronology covered by the course was comprehensive and didn't leave much out. Great guest speakers and a fun simulation make this course the highlight of my semester. Weaknesses: Every week, there are 2-3 presentations given by students on a topic unrelated to that week's readings. These presentations are interesting but often run for well over half of the class time, taking time away from touching on the class content.",
                "Howard Dean has a lot of experiences and perspectives to share from his personal career in government and in terms of policy decision-making. He is very accessible to students. There are also guest speakers throughout the semester, like Ambassador Samantha Powers, who have extensive experiences and unique perspectives to share.",
                "Howard! He truly cares about his students",
                "I think the strengths of this course are Howard Dean, and the discussions we have in class. It's incredible to hear Howard's stories and insights on the content we read, and to have him guide the discussion and ask the difficult questions. The other students in my class were also amazing, which I think greatly contributed to a high level of discussion. I think a weakness is probably the lack of structure in these discussions. Sometimes, it felt like we just moved on from one aspect\/question to another without fully addressing the details.",
                "The course was really amazing not only because Professor Dean knows the subject so well, but also because my fellow students contributed so much to my understanding of the issues. Professor Dean required us to give weekly presentations, and I learned so much from my peers' research.",
                "The strength is professor Howard Dean. He puts so much into this class and devotes so much time to his students. He helps form a real connection with the class and between the students. He brings in fascinating speakers and asks intriguing questions. No weaknesses.",
                "Professor Dean is awesome, I loved being in his class. The course has a ton of reading but you aren't expected to do all of it. There is no busy work - the bulk of the course is the fantastic class discussions. The strength of the course is also the caliber of the students - many students are really experts in specific areas and regions and I found I learned a ton from my peers.",
                "Great adaptation of an upper level seminar to an online format. That being said, the virtual work with groups was certainly harder\/less natural via Zoom  but also necessary to build that seminar camaraderie."

We had a week where she led the discussion, but it became very very student-led, to the point that I didn't know at the end what her stances were. As someone who knows nothing about her focus area, I would've enjoyed just listening to a 20 minute lecture somewhere in the sequence.",
                "The instructor set up certain things in the class to make sure students got to know each other, like reading groups and an assignment to introduce someone from the class. There were a lot of readings, but having reading groups decreased the workload. The class was very low-stress\/pressure because the professor prioritized students learning course content and developing better writing skills without penalizing students a lot in their grades.",

You will learn about American foreign policy not just from readings and discussions, but also through the professor's life experiences and the stories he will tell. If you're a global major, this course will give you a strong foundation in modern American foreign policy and introduce you to someone who has a unique perspective on major foreign policy decisions in the past 70 years.",
                "Definitely take it! Id never taken a US-centric foreign policy class, and it was interesting to learn how US foreign policy objectives changed under each presidential administration since Truman. You cover a lot of information, but its all engaging and doesnt feel overwhelming. Howard Dean and the guest speakers are also great additions to the class.",
                "Yes! Take it for Howard",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student if they are interested in history and\/or foreign policy. The opportunity to learn from Howard Dean is one of a kind, and the readings are also so valuable. Howard is also unique in that he is willing to spend so much time talking to students, getting to know them, and helping them improve their work. I have grown a lot over the semester both in my writing, and in the way I view foreign policy and diplomacy and I credit that to this class.",
                "Yes! The course is a very strong survey of American foreign policy and its ups and downs over the last 80 years. In addition to providing a thorough overview of how America has acted on the world stage, the course also delves into the personalities at play: Truman, LBJ, Nixon, Clinton, Obama, and Trump. These more individualized narratives helped clarify the ways that single actors can decide the course of history.",
                "Yes definitely! You will learn a ton and make friendships. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity!",
                "I would recommend this course, if not for the topic than for the opportunity to learn from Howard Dean. It was a rare and unique treat -  he has amazing stories and insight into history, government, and politics.  If you can get a spot, take the course.",
                "100%. Howard is a great teacher and practitioner. Caroline (teaching fellow) was always very helpful. The readings are great (usually a tad on the long side  budget 100+ pages per week minimum). The structure is well thought out. The assignments are practical enough while requiring an academic background. Howard gives great feedback."
