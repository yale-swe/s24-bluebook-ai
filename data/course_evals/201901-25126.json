   "comments": [
    "The course was super interesting! It was all strengths until the last few weeks when the professor stopped lecturing and had students present their final projects instead. Nobody really cared about each other's projects. I really enjoyed all of Professor Rickne's lectures, and would have much preferred to have had three extra weeks of lecture than three weeks of student presentations.",
    "Strengths: Papers that we talked about in class were interesting, Not too many assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Expectations were not clearly communicated during shopping period, Unfair grading, Very clear \"playing favorites\" game in class",
    "Weaknesses: arbitrary grading for which there is little preemptive guidance.\r\n\r\nStrength: the material has potential. The professor is alright.",
    "The course content was really interesting, but grading was harsh and honestly arbitrary with no rubrics or clear understanding of what was to be expected.",
    "This course is disappointing. I thought it would be a great exploration of gender divisons and gender trends; instead, it was a shallow policy and theory study. Prof. Rickne is a great researcher, but not the best teacher. Her lectures lack vigor and interest, and her assignments lack imagination. Every assignment was deceptively easy - because there was a total lack of guidance prior to the assignment, students were marked down due to small things like structure that could have been remedied by a rubric. This course is not a lot of work, and you really never need to come to lecture. If you don't care about your final grade, and just want an easy Econ senior seminar, take this course.",
    "Maybe a little more guidance on the final paper. It was the only big assignment in the class so there should have been more information given about it other than just an outline on canvas.",
    "Strengths:\r\n-teaches you how to write a thorough and concise term paper\r\n-studies are interesting and engaging\r\n-interactive activities (discussants and debates) -- Ideally, we would have more interactive activities throughout the semester (maybe a debate earlier on so that more people can participate)\r\n-helpful office hours\r\n-clear feedback on first draft of term paper\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-lack of rubrics for study questions",
    "I wish the class did not put as much emphasis on the final paper (which is the only real assignment and makes up most of the grade). But I enjoyed the lectures and the topics covered.",
    "Johanna was so understanding and so educated about gender economics, I learned a remarkable amount of information from the course.\r\nThe material was presented in a clear way, but sometimes an advanced understanding of econometrics would have helped (though was not required)."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes!",
    "Would not recommend. Class was portrayed as very chill and interesting during shopping period. However, problem set grading is arbitrary and grades were very volatile. Said at the beginning of the semester that term paper could be quantitative or qualitative, Everyone ended up needing to do some kind of STATA\/econometrics analysis, Term paper was very stress inducing and the prof gave little guidance, No logical reason to the grades that were given",
    "Not really, it was generally unengaging.",
    "The course material is interesting, so yes on that front, but probably don't take it for a grade.",
    "No. There are better and infinitely more interesting ways to spend your senior year. This course promises a lot but never follows through. Little work, little effort, and small payoff.",
    "Yes! Although the grading and expectations of the course were a bit confusing, the course material and readings were so interesting! I highly recommend this course if you are even slightly interested in gender economics. It is such an important and applicable topic, especially in todays society. Overall, had a wonderful time taking this course!",
    "Yes, if they are interested in gender economics, this course provides a comprehensive overview. The studies were very interesting and applicable to everyday life.",
    "I enjoyed this course a lot. It was an interesting look at gender dynamics in the economy, and it certainly changed the way I think about a lot of things.",
    "Take this course if youre interested in gender economics! Its a great Econ elective!",
    "100%! Easily one of my favorite economic courses at Yale\r\nMuch of the academic papers were new and so intriguing, relevant to our undergraduate experiences, but also helpful to keep in mind when entering the professional world.\r\nI am so much more aware of gender imbalances and differences that are present in our everyday lives."
