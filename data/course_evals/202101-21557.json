Then we looked at surfaces in space, and we talked about normal and Gauss curvatures. We then introduced differential forms and Stokes' theorem.

                "The main strengths of this course are that the material is engaging, the pacing is in the Goldilocks zone of not too fast and not too slow, and the course also includes useful information about the applications of the material. Another strength of this course is that it has a final project instead of a final exam, which gave me an opportunity to do a deep dive into a topic which I though was interesting. The main weakness of this course is that at times, it can feel like the course material changes on the whim of the professor, although this could be a strength for a certain type of student.",
                "I liked that we had all the lecture notes compiled into one master document.  Lectures were clear and relatively engaging.  I thought the take-hom midterm worked well, and I like the freedom to choose an individual final project.",
                "I thought the course was taught very well. The lectures were clear and organized. My only complaint is that I wish we did more stuff with manifolds in n dimensions rather than working with surfaces in 3 dimensions all the time. I also kind of wish there were more proofs in the homework assignments.",
                "Sometimes the homework was a little bit boring, but thats about it - I wish there was more theory building in the homework.\r\n\r\nThe class is fun and the lectures were clear.",
                "This class was fantastic. Prof. Neitzke did a fantastic job of approaching the material from just the right level of abstraction. We didn't ever get too caught up in the weeds, but I always felt like I could sit down and write rigorous proofs if I wanted to. Ever result felt well justified, but managed to avoid the nitty gritty ugly stuff most of the time. The problem sets were great, and they definitely reinforced the concepts from the lectures very well.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that I will say is that the problem sets tended to be very computation-heavy and were a lot lighter on the proofs. I would have enjoyed having some more substantial proofs in the homework from time to time. \r\n\r\nThere was one problem set that I have to mention, because I enjoyed it so much. Prof. Neitzke basically just said \"remember that theorem we proved in class? generalize it and provide some sort of justification.\" That one was a lot of fun, because we could just take it and run with it. The final project was also a lot of fun, for similar reasons. It was very open ended, and gave us a lot of freedom to explore what ever subject we wanted to.",
                "Strengths: diverse topics, accessible, makes reading further diff geo papers easy. Final project was fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: frequency of psets wasnt really enough to solidify the content sometimes. It was nice not to have to prove everything, but at some points I felt that a bit more rigor might be helpful, especially when it came to differential forms and connections",

                "I thought the lectures were very good, and enjoyed the level of organization of the course (e.g. having lecture notes LaTeXed and updated after every lecture). A weakness was that I didn't always feel like I knew where the class was going, or how different topics tied together, but this might have just been due to my lack of experience with the subject.",

The course notes made everything accessible and easy to refer to when following along in lecture, and provided clear annotations of notation and examples that were relevant to the discussion. I thought the course could be improved if we integrated some component of mathematical software, since differential geometry is particularly interesting with the different surfaces you can generate from equations."

                "Definitely. The course may seem intimidating with the dense notation and complicated names of theorems, but it can be intuitive at times and very engaging to follow. The field is very deep, and this course provides an introduction to a lot of the principles needed to explore it further. For anybody interested in geometry and extensions of geometry in graduate-level classes, this would be a perfect fit.
