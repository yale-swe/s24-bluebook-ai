Even for non-writers like myself I would recommend it just because of how insightful it is to writing generally and how fun and light this course is to the mind and heart alongside that.",
    "Yes!! I loved it. Prof is great and getting to write a story is great.",
    "Yes definitely. If you've always wondered about creative writing this is a great way to figure out if it's something you want to do in the future."
