                "I really enjoyed this course and felt like we discussed each piece of literature we read in good detail, but I felt like we could have covered a broader time period to see more of Russian history.",
                "Prof Dolgova is an incredibly engaging professor so our conversations were fantastic. The one frustration is that it's never quite clear what we are meant to do for homework because Professor doesn't keep a detailed schedule",
                "Strengths: Irina is a treasure, and she made the course a total joy. The literature was great as well, with pretty well-chosen readings. The course was also not too much work, and Irina have really fast and thorough feedback on every homework assignment. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The expectations on students were too low. I understand that Zoom made things difficult, and the level of the students was also likely lower than Irina is used to, but we had very few graded assignments and overall quite a low workload. I wish that we had kept the exams at least so that student engagement would have been higher. It was also often very unclear precisely what the homework was; some parts of it would be on Canvas and others would be described aloud, it would often be filed under the wrong date on Canvas. Often times we would have several readings, some optional and some not, and yet the professor would only ask about the optional ones.",
                "Strength: Very small class, strong engagement with the professor and with the other students.\r\nStrength: Professor Dolgova is extremely patient and will help you a lot with your language skills!\r\nStrength: Exposure to a lot of background material that will really help you understand literary works.\r\n\r\nWeakness: If any, the class could be a little more fast-paced."

                "We used breakout rooms a lot which was great. In future online semesters, it would be useful to start break out room discussions earlier in the class time. We often ran overtime because we were talking in breakout rooms until 5 minutes before the end of the scheduled time.",
                "The seminar was honestly not terribly affected, as I feel that students were still able to interact with the professor a lot and generally the conversation was good, even if perhaps it was too easy to get distracted. It was also quite helpful to have the sources and a dictionary in front of me while preparing to speak. The breakout rooms during the Zoom seminars were the biggest problem, though, as it was never completely clear what we had to do during them, and the conversation was often dead.",
                "We received a lot of timely feedback from the instructor on our homework and our class was small enough that we could all participate in class! Overall, I felt very engaged during our seminars."

Irina is great and this is when you really reap many of the rewards of having made it through 2-4 years of Russian, as the literature is great and the class is relatively chill. If you are considering skipping Fourth Year in order to take this course, though, I would hold back, since it doesn't spend a huge amount of time on grammar, and there is a lot you may miss out on.",
