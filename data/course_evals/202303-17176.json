Sydnie is a great teacher, and makes time for you in office hours and questions in class.\r\nIt is sometimes difficult to get through so much material in a 50 minute class. \r\nI decided to take L3 after high school Latin, and the learning curve for me was very steep. If you are a first year and have decided to start out with this course right away, I would recommend that you are very confident in your knowledge of Latin grammar. If not, the only other option to study for quizzes is rote memorization, which is very time consuming.",
