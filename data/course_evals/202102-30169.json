                "The strengths are that it is organized well. The Canvas page has a clear layout and its easy to follow. I appreciated the structure where we watched lectures online before synchronous class the next day. I think this course could be improved with a set office hour time slot every week and more feedback from the Professor and TF.",
                "Strengths: Professor Robinson is great and made the course interesting. Lectures are well-paced and helpful. I think the way the course is structured is also well done. I liked that Prof. Robinson never made us spend more time than necessary on certain concepts and basically gave the students free rein over how much time to invest in the class; versus other courses where the instructors make you do busywork. The emphasis on movies was interesting but sadly began to fall after the midterm. \r\nWeaknesses: While the first half of the course was well structured around movie physics, the second half felt more like an afterthought instead of being incorporated into the course. I really wish we had done more movie applications in the second half, but I guess those topics don't lend well to movies.",
                "Strengths: Covers a lot of ground in intro physics, and the use of movie clips helps make it feel more tangible and engaging as opposed to just being very abstract concepts. Weaknesses: There is a LOT to cover each week, and the fact that all the asynchronous material is in video form and not, for example, a powerpoint or PDF makes it hard to read things over quickly if a particular video is going at a slower pace than you are. This makes it difficult for people who have lots of additional time commitments such as work, as the videos take a LOT of time to sit through. This course would be majorly improved if some of the videos could be replaced by condensed notes or documents instead.",
                "The use of movie clips enhanced my understanding of the concepts covered in lecture because I had to figure out what information from the clips I could estimate and would be helpful. I think that using clips as a leearning tool was one of the ways I was able to get a handle on the new content as we moved through the class at a super fast pace. I also appreciated how efficent our Zoom classes were, given how much outside work there was to do (at least for me).",
                "This was a good class to revisit physics topics",
                "For a course on \"movie physics\" it's not really about movies and just like physics 1 but with more estimation from clips.",
                "The strength is that it starts from the very basics but is helpful in learning the material well nonetheless. The weakness is that summer courses in general are too fast paced and thus require a lot of timid.",
                "The course was mostly flipped, i.e. we watched lectures beforehand and then in class live the professor went over the most important topics then fielded questions. Worked out really well actually. Another strength is that we had a lot of real movie examples instead of just learning the physics from textbook problems.",
                "The course deftly took into account the different abilities of students coming into the class, so that it was self-paced but guided well.",

                "I would recommend this course to a student looking for a QR credit. To be honest, Yale doesnt really have any super gutty QR credits for non-stem majors the way they do for SC credits. I took this course to fulfill my QR requirement because I heard it was easy. It IS easy if you remember high school physics or AP physics because its basically the exact same curriculum. However, if you dont have that background, the learning curve is much steeper. Its certainly not impossible and I would even venture to say that the course is chiller than most other QR credits, but its not a throwaway grade. You have to work hard pretty consistently for the four weeks to do well.",
                "Yes take this course if you need a science credit and are interested in physics",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if you have a strong physics background. I personally had fun with the course, but that's because I didn't really have to learn the material, only how to apply it. If you have zero physics background or very little, this could get overwhelming pretty quickly, especially since Prof. Robinson really doesn't spend much time in lectures, so you'd have to do a lot of self-teaching. I just took the course for the science credit and because it looked interesting (and I'm not going to do more intensive physics after this).",
                "I would recommend this course to students with some background in physics. Having not taken high school physics before, I felt like there was a lot of content to catch up on. There is a pre-assessment quiz before each topic, and it seems like a lot of people were scoring around 6 out of 8, whereas I didn't have any experience with the topics so I had a lot more to catch up on and only scored about 2-3 out of 8. So I would recommend this class if you've taken some physics at school before, but if you have no physics background be aware that there's a LOT of catching up to do and this condensed summer class isn't necessarily going to be the best way to do thatit will end up taking a lot more time than on average.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to someone without a strong STEM backround (or who perhaps is a bit rusty). I feel like I've filled in a knowledge gap that I had from high school, and even though I won't need to apply this knowledge to my (humanities) major, I definitely grew as a student.",
                "Yes, if you had a decent background in physics in high school, not to hard and good review",
                "If you want that science credit out of the way and want to take algebra based physics",
                "I would recommend if you need to take a science credit. It is not very different from an AP Physics course if you took that in high school.",
                "Yes - awesome content, easy to follow even for non-stem majors, and nice professor/ta.",
                "I would recommend it to those who are interested in exploring physics, not those who are pursuing physics and have a substantial background.",
                "I would recommend to another student who is interested in learning more about physics; for me, the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics were particularly fascinating."
