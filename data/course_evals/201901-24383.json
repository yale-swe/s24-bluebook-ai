    "I learned so much about the history of reproductive health in this course and how to write academic book reviews.",
    "I learned about the broad history of women's reproductive lives in the United States starting from the use of enslaved women's bodies for the medicalization of gynecology to modern reproductive justice movements. Prof Eisenberg did a great job seeking historical patterns and pushing us to always seek missing voices from the narratives. I learned to ingest a considerable amount of readings a week and come to class each week with several key insights.",
    "Presenting and public speaking skills; asking critical questions about primary sources and reading and reviewing different types of literature and writing about",
    "This course has not only taught me the history of reproductive health in the US and women's longstanding fight for the basic human right of autonomy, but it has also improved my critical reading and thinking skills, public speaking skills, and writing skills."

    "Needed more clear instruction on assignments, was very confused as to what was expected\r\nComments on papers were unessarily harsh, not too helpful, and not open to different writing styles",
    "This course is amazing! I loved it so much!",
    "Professor Eisenberg is a gem and really made this class fantastic. He always encouraged seminar students to contribute their diverse opinions while also knowing when to push back on statements to generate further discussion.",
    "Ziv is very genuine and encourages students to think critically. I really enjoyed the discussions in this class.",
    "Professor did a lot of lecturing which was great since I didn't have a lot of in-depth knowledge about, but it didn't not allow for a lot of class participation which I missed which is also typical of a smaller seminar class",
    "Amazing course! Professor Eisenberg does a great job of engaging the readings, balancing lecturing with class discussion, and really gets every student involved in the class."

    "YES!",
    "I enjoyed taking this class and learned a lot. A lot of times in class it felt like we just went over the reading as opposed to delving deeper into the material, as has been my experience in other history seminars. Overall it was a great class, not too much work. I would recommend it.",
    "Yes! This was one of my favorite classes Ive taken at Yale. It was a super manageable workload (comparable reading load to other seminars and slightly less writing) and super interesting. If you have the chance to take this course you absolutely should.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course another student, whether they are an HSHM major familiar with the topic or first-time seminar taker like myself. The course is organized to facilitate learning and discourse no matter what level of expertise with the topic you enter with. I loved this class-- especially with Prof Eisenberg!",
    "Yes I would, if you have any interest in the historical side of reproductive health, but be prepared to speak up and gather courage to participate since there are a lot of opinions",
    "I would highly recommend this class not only to relevant majors, but to anyone, especially women, hoping to understand problems and cause change in society relating to reproductive health. This was the best course I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "Yes! Great course, great professor, and extremely important topic to learn about. 100% would recommend for everyone."
