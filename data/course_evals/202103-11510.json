            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The term paper was actually pretty rewarding to write. Appreciated the exposure in this class to topics that I hadn't learned in other undergraduate courses.\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, a lot of times felt like the class did not need to be two hours long and it was just dragging on and on. I would have liked the faculty invited to be a little more diverse in terms of topic area because I felt like there was significant overlap between profs. Or just have less presentations, because I thought the number of response papers we had to write was a bit excessive (writing one almost every single week). It might be cool to have students interact with current research in some other way, for example, visiting Professor Vaccaro's lab was pretty cool.",
                "Strength: the lectures from professors were really engaging\r\n\r\nWeakness: Each presenting on different research papers wasnt really effective, I think we shouldve all read the same 2-3 papers",
                "None",
                "This course is a requirement for the chemistry major. The strengths lie in the camaraderie cultivated among the students and wide-ranging exposure to current science. The weaknesses relate to the class length (2.5 hours is way too long) and its pedagogical value.",
                "I believe an improvement to this course would be to have the class collectively discuss, say, 3-5 papers each week rather than having each student pick an individual paper. This would facilitate better discussion of the research, as in the current format each student is tunnel-visioned into their own little presentation and it draws away from the purpose of the initial literature review.",
                "This year was a bit difficult because of the faculty transition; the course would run much smoother if at least one of the instructors who attended the class was familiar with how the course should work. It often felt like kind of like the blind leading the blind (although I understand this difficulty was just a consequence of the situation that we happened to be in). We also had little to no structured guidance about our thesis because there was no in-class time to work on the final paper, which is the main reason students take this course. Resultantly, it was difficult to understand expectations of our final paper, and I ended up not feeling entirely satisfied with  senior thesis. This course could have been improved if there was more time set aside in the last few weeks to focus on writing our final paper rather than being bombarded with various smaller papers\/presentations that may or may not be related to our research interests. The time spent in the classroom also felt like we were just trying to fill the two hours with words, and often did not feel productive\/helpful to developing our understanding of chemistry. I did not take a lot from this course.",
                "This class was in-objectively the worst class I have taken at Yale. I have taken some bad classes, but at least I learned something from them. Dr. G did not understand chemistry enough to comment on class discussions, and Dr. Parr left us after the second class. Every week we would talk about papers in class, and we just ripped right through them in a meaningless way. Then we would listen to a professor talk about their work and write essays about them and it honestly just felt like busy work that I got nothing out of. These papers were also graded inordinately harshly. \r\n\r\nThe final paper, which was not brought up until the end of the semester, was supposed to serve as our thesis which is extremely important, but I was so busy doing the other work that I couldn't start it until the last minute. In the future, the thesis should play the largest part in the class instead of the discussions about other professors' works. In addition, the full scope of information about what the thesis is and clear expectations for it should be outline from the beginning of the class. In the first week, this was somewhat done when old editions of previous theses were passed around but we were later told after pushing and prying for more information about the paper that the expectations of what our theses were supposed to look like were COMPLETELY different from what they were in the past, so we were essentially misled for the entire semester.\r\n\r\nThe only good thing about this class was the trauma bonds I formed with the other student in it.",
                "I really enjoyed learning about different fields of chemistry. I do feel that a weakness of the course was the format of each student doing a presentation on a different paper during class. Because the presentations were so short and purely oral, it was often hard to actually understand the papers that others presented when I had not read those papers myself."
