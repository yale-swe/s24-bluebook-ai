                "I learned an incredible amount about how to be a better writer--not only in the context of reviews and journalism, but for other purposes as well.",
                "I feel like I sort of became a journalist, and a good one for that matter! I learned how to write a really descriptive and colorful piece about art, and be confident in my opinions, even in areas that I previously knew nothing about. Professor Spillane teaches you how to have authority as a writer, which honestly I never thought Id have as someone who has been at Yale for a few years now and have always been really self conscious about my writing. I also just learned to describe my pleasure and be more observant in general.",
                "This course really helped me develop my skills as a writer. I didnt realize how much of my writing before this class was vague or overwrought or in need of some crossing out.",
                "I loved this course. I learned how to write, I learned about new art forms, and I learned about a specific style of critique \/ review writing. I also learned to communicate, review, and overall just appreciate art and words in a new way.",
                "My writing really improved this semester -- Professor Spillane is one of the few teachers that has given me feedback on the small-scale minutiae of my writing in a way that has made me much better at describing things. One of our guest speakers said that all writing is just describing things, so even though the performances you're describing in this class may have very little to do with anything you write about elsewhere, when you become better at describing these performances you become a better writer.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, I've learned a lot about different performing arts. Professor Spillane has a whole life of experience in all of the arts she teaches about and does a good job of giving you a working knowledge of everything you're learning about. I knew nothing about dance before starting the course and was surprised at how much I was able to learn in the two weeks we spent on dance.",
                "I learned a lot about how to approach the field of performance arts criticism, while also improving the concision and effectiveness of my writing.",
                "I feel like I learned how and why to incorporate my own experience of a performance piece into my writing, how to be more concise and cut fluff to craft a cohesive short piece, and how to approach a variety of performing arts genres and come up with something authoritative to say regardless of my experience with the genre. I have a much better sense of how to craft a review that feels like, as Prof. Spillane says, a \"performance on the page\"!",
                "ENGL 423 was an incredible course that taught me a range of skills from research, to performing arts history, to narrative structure and word choice in writing. I learned about tools I can use to provide context and establish author's authority, as well as draw the reader in and evoke performance art pieces of different types. Perhaps my biggest takeaway was that I was able to strengthen a writing muscle that I'd never worked before - journalist or creative writing. I feel am able to better communicate my thoughts on art in a non-academic way, and will continue to work on and strengthen these skills going forward."

                "Im sure many will complain about the weekly Saturday at 3 PM deadline, which I really struggled to meet. However, this forced me to produce a piece of work that I was proud of in a crunch, which made me a faster and better writer. The class is demanding, but dont let that hinder you if you want to see your writing completely change  trust me, its worth it. Also it allows Professor Spillane the time to give you the INSANELY DETAILED feedback she does. Ive never had a professor pick apart every single word I wrote like she did, and it was really intimidating at first, but my second draft of each piece was always so much better because of it. I grew so much as a writer because of it! Another strength is that I loved doing the readings, which I dont normally, and they honestly werent as heavy as I thought theyd be. Also having a professor like Spillane is just incredible. She is so wise and accomplished and she was a highlight of my semester.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is the many, many comments Professor Spillane leaves on every essay. While at first they were a bit disheartening, I soon realized that they were helpful when I stopped being so proud.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of this course is the number of readings per week. For many weeks, I struggled to complete the readings.",
                "The professor is amazing and so involved. You get so much feedback and it is so engaging. The material is wonderful and intriguing. It is just a lot of work and sometimes overwhelming to read and enjoy everything.",
                "Strengths: The seminar discussions are almost always interesting, even in the first couple weeks of the semester when they were over Zoom. Professor Spillane knows how to keep a class moving and engaging, and I learned a lot about the performing arts world in our discussions. Our writing also improved a ton over the course of the semester -- you get your drafts back covered in feedback every Tuesday like clockwork.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Don't let the relative length of this section make you think I disliked the class! All the feedback you get can be demoralizing, since negative feedback is weighed more highly than positive feedback. The first draft you'll get will make you think you are a terrible writer -- it took me until I talked to other people in the class who's writing I read for workshops and knew was good and yet still got the same demoralizing feedback from Professor Spillane. You also don't get a grade on each assignment, which probably works in your favor, but it doesn't give you a great sense of what your writing is like. The only thing I could pick up from the writing is that it is imperfect, which no duh, this is the second or third time I've ever done anything like this, of course it will be imperfect. On rare occasions, something similar in class will happen: you'll say something Professor Spillane disagrees with and she'll explain at length why you are wrong.",
                "Professor Spillane's structure of working through drafts is rare at Yale, where we often are rushing to finish a paper at the last minute. I appreciated the opportunity to fine tune a shorter piece of writing using her advice, and that of my peers!",
                "I loved how we had more and shorter writing assignments. Writing two truly polished pages is a challenge, and so few classes at Yale encourage you to learn the art of writing concisely. I thought the 2-page assignments were fun and a wonderfully fresh way to do a writing class. The syllabus is also a huge strength of the course. It's the most diverse syllabus in any English or performance class I've taken, featuring lots of non-male artists and artists of color that I'd never been exposed to before but definitely deserve to be studied. That said, I often wished we had discussed the readings more in class, as they were fascinating--there was plenty of stuff that was assigned that we didn't touch much, if at all. All of it was very interesting and enjoyable to read\/watch, but it was just hard to tell what the priority was for the class day. As well, though I found the class blog fun to read and write, I felt like the online platform was difficult to navigate and outdated.",
                "It's genuinely difficult for me to think of weaknesses in this course. Perhaps it would have been nice to get a little more time talking to other class members one on one, for example having paired review sessions, or small-group film viewings. One other thing I'll mention is that I really appreciated being able to chose what I wanted to write about - specifically in terms of genre. It would have been nice to trade one week of writing about an unfamiliar art form for another week of being able to write about a form in which I have some level of expertise. In terms of strengths, I really appreciated the depth and precision of Professor Spillane's feedback on my writing. I also thought that the in-person and virtual meetings with writers in the field was incredibly helpful and fascinating."

                "Yes, completely. It is a lot of work, but you gain so much out of the course and Professor Spillane is amazing. She's incredibly knowledgeable and engaging, and does a fantastic job of ensuring that students are both learning from her while also discussing amongst themselves and helping each other grow. She's also very accommodating, and she values her students' health and enjoyment of the class.  If you do take the course, though, don't think you can skate by easily; it's not a gut class in the slightest. The feedback you get will be harsh, and quite humbling, but ultimately function to bring your writing to a new level.",
                "YES YES YES. This is my favorite class Ive taken at Yale. Im not gonna lie, I complained the entire semester about how difficult it was. But it was all worth it because no class has ever done for me what this one has. It was a rigorous and challenging experience but by the far the most rewarding one Ive had at Yale. Even if you dont consider yourself the best writer, Prof Spillane is very good at teaching you how. And youll leave the class a more thoughtful, observant person. Also the guest speakers were awesome!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if theyre interested in strengthening their writing skills and are comfortable with receiving feedback.",
                "Yes, if you like arts it is essential. It helps so much with writing as well, but it is also such interesting writing. The professor also warms my soul.",
                "I came out of some classes (especially some of the ones with the guest speakers) feeling like they were some of the most interesting 75 minutes I've spent at Yale so far. I came out of other classes wondering what the point of trying to write a review when all I'm going to get back is nitpicks to the nth degree. Most of the time I loved the class and had only good things to say about it; I loved the seminar discussions almost every time -- the people in the class were so smart and knowledgeable and talented as performers -- and the readings\/viewings were fascinating and the feedback we got on our writing is some of the most helpful I ever got. So I can't wholeheartedly recommend this class to anybody remotely interested in writing, the performing arts, or both like I want to do because this class shook my confidence more than any other class at Yale. But if you are interested enough, it's worth it.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who has the bandwidth to really take time with their reviews.",
                "Yes - although a lot of work, it was well-structured and truly fascinating, great seminar group as well.",
                "Definitely! If you're not a \"writer\" and are looking to take an approachable and fun writing class that pushes you out of your comfort zone, this is a great option. If you've taken a million English seminars and are That YDN kid, it's a more lowkey workshop class that challenges you in different ways than many other Yale writing classes, which focus on much longer pieces. Spillane encourages healthy experimentation and risk-taking, which makes the class really unique among writing classes at Yale.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! But with a caveat: be prepared for an intense workload if you want to get the most out of this course. I think that you get out of it what you put in, and if you don't allow the time in your schedule (and you are relatively new to non-academic writing like myself), then it will be easy to go through the class without making much progress or expanding your exposure to different types of performance art."
