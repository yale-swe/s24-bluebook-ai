I learned a lot about how to write in a more concise and impactful way. I found the 5 units to be a great way of breaking up different styles of writing and they encouraged me to write about topics I wouldn't necessarily naturally be drawn to. The class discussions allowed me to listen to my classmates' thoughts and receive insight into ideas I hadn't thought of when reading the stories myself the first time. Professor Saraceni's feedback on each essay was especially helpful in making me a better writer, as she thoughtfully comments on specific parts of the document and provides general notes on the essay as a whole.",

                "This course was very engaging. Although there was no pressure to participate, our class always had a steady conversation and everyone was able to contribute equally. Although some of the readings were not something I would necessarily pick up in my free time, they all turned out to be quite interesting and unique. The only weakness of this course was that sometimes the the essay deadlines were tight. Sometimes, we only had a few days between when we received feedback on our first draft and when the second draft was due.",
                "This class was overall amazing. Professor Saraceni was so great at creating a positive discussion environment and she made the entire class better. I think the only way the class could be improved is if some of the essays were taken off the syllabus, but Prof Saraceni already addressed that in our last class meeting.",

                "This class is engaging and well organized. The topics we cover and the essays we discussed flow very well, and the class discussions were always smooth and insightful (even over Zoom). The \"Workshops\" were helpful and one of the best parts of the class. Professor Saraceni gave extensive comments on each of our drafts which allowed for revision and improvement.",

Class discussions never felt awkward or dry, and Professor Saraceni did a great job of keeping the conversation flowing at all times. The five-minute breakout rooms with classmates were a nice change from the normal routine. It definitely helped me feel like I could bond with my classmates on a more personal level, like I might have been able to do in a real classroom. Also, communication through email and Canvas was effective and not too hard to keep track of.",

                "Yes! Although I don't feel that my writing skills improved dramatically, I had so much fun reading and discussing all of the texts in this course as well as writing my own short stories. Professor Saraceni is super nice and she facilitates discussions so wonderfully, even over Zoom. Her feedback combined with workshopping comments were extremely helpful. The grading is not too harsh and the workload is very manageable. Would definitely recommend this class to anyone looking to read and write personal narratives and have a lot of creative freedom. It is especially great for first-years looking for their first English course at Yale. One of my favorite classes this semester!",

                "I would strongly recommend this class to any student wishing to enter a writing-heavy field. I think the skills developed would transfer well to any type of writing, although the course is rather intense so it may not be a good fit for someone just looking to fulfill a writing requirement.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to everyone! I think this class would be regarding and interesting to all students, regardless of year or major. I would recommend this class to anyone who enjoys reading and writing (or wants to improve at both!).",
                "yes! I feel like I came out of it a much better writer; I learned how to revise my work in terms of the bigger picture rather than just edit for fluency and grammar.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the professor is amazing and the course work is interesting and challenging.  The work load is not bad at all, and this is a great essay-based class that I would suggest to STEM majors to provide some relief from the stress of constant midterms and homework."
