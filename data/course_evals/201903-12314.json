   "comments": [
    "General writing skills improved considerably. As far as the history aspect of the course, learned a variety of ancient historians and their unique approaches to history.",
    "Taking this course was great for my writing. It brought my writing level from high school level to college level and taught me how to properly write a paper for a history class. I learned to embrace my own writing voice and, as professor Hansen emphasizes, eschew the passive voice. The class was also especially helpful in preparing me for future reading assignments in other classes. It teaches a lot of strategies to handle them and manage your time best with these assignments.",
    "I improved my reading, writing, and public speaking skills. I also read the works of historians from different time periods and cultures.",
    "I developed my writing a lot. The course helped me understand how the writing of history developed and how important writing skills are.",
    "Writing",
    "My writing greatly improved.",
    "I learned how to evaluate a historian as well as how to compare different approaches to telling history.",
    "This course was crucial to me honing my academic writing skills, particularly writing for history classes. Not only did my grammar, sentence structure, and vocabulary considerably improve so did my ability to search for suitable source material and read long texts. I was able to decipher how to read effectively for classes that involve thousands of pages worth of reading, and to take notes that can be used as speaking points in class. My debating skills also saw considerable improvement, particularly in tackling speed and argument nuance by limiting the scope of the material I was addressing.",
    "concision in writing\r\n\r\neschewing the passive voice\r\n\r\nstructuring an argument\r\n\r\nhow to read a book efficiently",
    "The course taught me how to selectively read large texts in limited time, write in a lively manner, and form more coherent arguments.",
    "This class goes over the writings of past historians and teaches you to analyze them critically. This is a good course to take if you are looking to improve your writing (especially your grammar!).",
    "Reading and analyzing both primary and secondary source materials, basics of college essay writing, seminar discussion skills, etc"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professor Hansen--she is a wonderful professor with a great personality. Very engaged and approachable. Also the material itself was usually pretty interesting, and the class discussions were usually interesting as well. Weaknesses: Not much, I personally did not prefer the Marx\/Weber portion of the class.",
    "The strength of this course is definitely professor Hansen's frankness. Yes it can seem brutal at times, but in the end her criticism is a great way to improve. It's weakness lies in the fact that it's a seminar and so it demands participation to benefit you the most. You can't show up to class and be passive or you won't learn anything. This isn't much of a weakness, but for some it can be, so make sure you like seminar style classes.",
    "Strengths: clear and timely feedback on writing assignments and class discussion. Lots of constructive feedback that helped me take little steps toward becoming a better writer. Great introduction to history and college-level writing. Weaknesses: I wish Professor Hansen could talk a little bit more during the class discussions. Sometimes I'd feel like people are talking for the sake of talking and class discussion is not that productive. It'd be great if Professor Hansen could intervene a bit more when the pace starts to slow down. The part about Marx and Weber also felt a bit disconnected from the previous section.",
    "The strength is how well the professor engages with the students and the weakness is the work load.",
    "Overall very strong course.",
    "Strengths: you get to cover a lot of material and Hansen will make you think more carefully about your writing. Weaknesses: the workload wasn't very even (I didn't mind having to turn in a rough draft of our final before break, but I would have liked a more consistent weekly workload), the last section of the course (on Marx and Weber), while interesting, was hard to connect to the rest of our coursework.",
    "The strength of this course is definitely the academic skills it teaches, particularly reading historical texts, writing(the various types of assignments including book reports etc. are challenging and serve as a great learning model), and also public speaking. One weakness is the text selection for the class. The first half which involved reading ancient text was well chosen, but the latter including the Marx and Weber reading material was not an effective choice given the nature of the writing prompt that was later selected for the written assignment. Perhaps, Marx's \"Das Kapital\" or Weber's \"Economic and Society\" would have made for better reading.",
    "strengths: easy to get a good grade, effective introductory history course, solid writing instruction, good primer for time at yale\r\n\r\nweaknesses: content of class could be more interesting, teacher a little weird, should have been more intense class",
    "Professor Hansen is very engaging and the seminar style class allows for great discussions. But the class goes through a lot of books and you need to be able to read efficiently.",
    "Strengths -- wonderful professor, engaging class environment (with field trips!), very comprehensive introduction into effective college essay writing and reading, overall class material was interesting \r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- none in particular, unless you have a strong dislike of relatively frequent writing assignments"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, absolutely! This is a perfect class both for people who are interested in history and want a good intro first-year seminar course, and those who maybe don't want to major in it but like history and want a QR credit. You don't need any background history knowledge, but you learn a bit into study of history itself. Also I feel my writing has improved considerably.",
    "Yes to any student interested in history who wants to improve their writing and speaking. The class is more so geared towards writing, but it has a huge emphasis on history (it is a history class after all) and teaches you many strategies that will be helpful in future history classes and teaches you speaking strategies. Come ready to participate in class, so you get the greatest benefit from the in class discussions. But also be ready to take some criticism. Professor Hansen is definitely not an easy grader and she will find every little mistake you make. Expect her to call you out even when you're talking and use the passive voice. That being said this honestly is one of the best things about the course. If you learn to accept her criticisms and improve you can't leave without getting better at writing and speaking.",
    "Yes. As a first-year seminar this class really prepares you for college-level writing. I went to the Writing Center so many times this semester, stressed about the papers a lot, and received some pretty harsh feedback. But ultimately I really feel like the work is worth it. Professor Hansen is eccentric but she is humorous and makes class interesting.",
    "Yes! It improves your writing skills.",
    "Absolutely. My writing improved drastically.",
    "Yes, but I would probably recommend this to someone who is already interested in history rather than someone who wants to explore it for the first time.",
    "Yes, any student interested in taking a history class (especially one with a writing credit) should take this course. I do not think the course is your best choice, if the intention is to learn history, but if it is to learn how to write effectively for history, then it does not get better than this!",
    "i would recommend if you want a relatively easy class that would provide instruction on academic writing.\r\n\r\nI would recommend this class to one interested in the history major.\r\n\r\ni would recommend this class to people who want an easy writing credit.",
    "I highly recommend this course. It is a great way to improve your writing and learn some fascinating history along the way.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking for an introduction to college level writing and who also enjoys history.",
    "Absolutely!"
