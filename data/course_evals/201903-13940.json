    "I learned a lot about the importance of the Farm Bill and its different programs. Additionally, I was able to become a better writer through this course.",
    "I learned how to organize my thoughts and write in a more clear and concise manner. I also learned how the Amerian agricultural system functions and the political, social, and economic implications of food.",
    "I learned a lot about Agriculture in the United States. A lot.",
    "How to use Yale's resources for research, how the Farm Bill and our food system operates, and how to write a speech",
    "Gained insights into expectations for college level writing and research. Felt like my writing definitely improved.",
    "I feel more confident in my writing and organization"

   "comments": [
    "Some of the readings in the beginning seem a bit redundant in some aspects--much of the reading is interesting, though.",
    "Strengths: The readings are interesting, the professor is clear and extremely helpful with students, and the course information is interesting.",
    "Fair course overall. The workload and grading was fair based upon work put into the class",
    "This course front loads a lot of information that is very valuable for further essay writing, and in-class discussions can help clarify ideas that are often unclear in some of the readings. However, for being a writing course, I found that only basic information about structure and organization were covered.",
    "Lots of readings for this course, but they are essential to understanding the current state of our food system.",
    "I would have preferred if there were fewer overlapping readings, or perhaps if the readings were more spread out throughout the semester to prevent becoming excessively repetitive too quickly.",
    "Strengths included class discussions and fun class community. Other strengths were the TED talks which were cool and the feedback and comments on drafts of papers. Weaknesses included the length of time spent on readings felt too short compared to time spent on the research paper and ted talks.",
    "I enjoyed the readings and thought they applied very well to the class yet they could be more current"

   "comments": [
    "If you have an interest or passion for the food systems of the US, topics about the environment, and other issues attached to the Farm Bill, I would highly suggest this course to fulfill one of your writing credits.",
    "Yes, it is an interesting course that teaches you how to write a strong, effective argument.",
    "I think that the workload for this class isn't unmanageable at any point, but if you are looking for a writing credit where you get more comprehensive feedback on your papers and writing, I would recommend looking into another section. I found myself going to office hours for extra tips and advice on my essay that I would follow and rewrite, only to find different criticisms on my essays. Professor Stuart is very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject matter, but I often found myself disappointed in the grades I received on the essays relative to the time I spent working on them.",
    "Highly recommend. Dr. Stuart does a wonderful job making the material engaging, interesting, and relevant.",
    "I would recoommend this course to a student who wants to take English 114 because the topic of the course is very broad and there are many areas within the scope of the course where any student will find an interest for a research topic.",
    "YES! great content and professor"
