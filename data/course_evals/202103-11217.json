                "I had never studied set theory before, but now I know a lot about set theory!",
                "I learned a TON in this course. A whole new way of approaching math, how to write proofs, introductions to set theory, automata and formal languages, etc. Even insights into what goes on in the mind/brain during language processing. This class is full of fun puzzles and neat concepts, most of which will change the way you think about language and the mind, and all of which feel like simply formalized versions of interesting games. Note: this class is mostly a proof-based math class, and applications to linguistics normally appear as a problem or two in the homework. Although the applications become more obvious and frequent in the second half of the course, don't be fooled by the LING listing--this class felt primarily like a math class (it should be double listed, IMO).",
                "Saw applications of mathematical structures I was already familiar with to language in an incredibly interesting way.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: fast-paced, addresses every concept precisely as opposed to handwavy arguments. weaknesses: turn around between submitting problem sets and receiving feedback is way too high. hard to know how you're doing in the class.",
                "The course was really fast-paced and exciting. Sometimes the pace was too fast, especially at the beginning of the course (when we were first learning about set theory) and at the end of the course (when we were learning about languages). Not all of the set theory material seemed relevant to the end goal of explaining languages, so it might help to lighten the pace by cutting out some of the less relevant material (lattices, posets, algebras). Professor Frank was a great instructor. I'm not a math person, but he made the course very enjoyable! I would definitely take another course with him.",
                "Strengths: this course does nearly everything right: lots of interesting learning that changes not only what you know but how you think; PSets are fun, cool, and interesting; grading is generous; intellectually challenging but never insurmountably difficult; dynamic, friendly, charismatic, funny, and engaging professor who always goes at the pace of the class (doesn't follow a strict schedule for the course--simply does as much as the class can handle and goes at our pace, moving on when we understand). The exams are all take-home and are basically just extended PSets.\r\nWeaknesses: the only weakness was that assignments were often sent out late and grades were sometimes slow to come back. The former of those things was normally a strength, however, as we were always given at least a week to do everything (Prof. Frank would often consult the class to decide jointly on a due date), so a late release of an assignment meant more of a rest-period between assignments and more time to do them. Only annoying if you care about having a fixed regular homework schedule.",
                "Wonderful course all around, first few weeks were a bit boring for those already familiar with basic proof based mathematics, but I don't see any way around that.",
                "This class was very enjoyable if you were engaged. The teaching style certainly can leave some people behind, meaning it's extremely important to ask questions in class; missing a couple minutes of lecture staring into space potentially means not understanding any of the rest of the lecture and struggling on the pset for sure. However, if you manage to stay with it, the class is very rewarding, especially for people like me who have no background in either linguistics or any of the mathematics covered.",
                "Overall the course was very strong and interesting to me. It was pretty challenging at times, but ultimately very satisfying to come to some profound conclusions about the structure of language.\r\n\r\nI think the course could have been improved if the connections to natural language were a bit more immediate. In the beginning of the semester, I think a lot of us were wondering how set theory related to natural language."

                "I would recommend the course to a student who is interested in math and willing to put a lot of work into the course. Full disclosure: if you are taking the course because you are interested in learning more about linguistics, you might be a little disappointed. The vast majority of the course was focused on abstract mathematical concepts, and very little time (half of 2 lectures) was spent looking at natural language. If you are a math major, though, or you like math, you will love the course! It really is a great course. I just send a word of warning to people who are less mathematically-inclined, since it might be quite difficult.",

Some of the concepts can be quite tough, but Professor Frank does a brilliant job explaining and you really leave this class with a greater understanding of a very interesting field.",
                "Yes, but I would not recommend it to those who had no experience in this strain of mathematics as I did. I had an incredibly difficult time although the content was interesting.",
