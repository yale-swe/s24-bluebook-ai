                "I gained a comprehensive education in writing for television, from defining the constituent components of a TV franchise to experiencing the inherently collaborative nature of the television writing process.  We discussed scene writing, sketching characters, writing loglines, making plans, playing into/against tropes, escalation, complication, and plot. \r\nIn short, Professor Green taught an excellent class in writing for the small screen while simultaneously showing us what it looks like to lead and participate in a writer's room.",
                "This course helped me feel comfortable writing a television drama -- such a valuable skill !! The first half of the semester was spent reading and discussing well-known scripts, and the second half was spent reading and discussing our own. I think these discussions were the most insightful and helpful that I've experienced at Yale thus far.",

                "Well-structured and effective in turning our class into a community. The collaborative nature of the course (I.e. those end-of-class discussions and class-wide workshops) allowed us to get to know each other and even lead to us spending time as a class outside of the classroom. The balance of talking about television to writing to actually writing television was pitch-perfect.",
                "This was truly a phenomenal course. Professor Green was incredibly helpful in guiding us as much as we needed through the script-writing process while also giving us lots of time and space to work on our craft independently. In-class discussions were amazing. If you're looking for a course that will help you write a script step-by-step, you won't find that here -- it's much more free than that -- which I think was a strength. Professor Green encouraged all students to set up one-on-one meetings with him to talk about our writing processes in detail.",
                "This was an excellent course and its strength is definitely in the quality and enthusiasm of the class. The class became a great community, created by frequent pitching and sharing of ideas early on in the course.",
                "Strengths: You get to read many scripts and get a sense of how to write a TV pilot, you get plenty of feedback on your writing, class turns into a \"writer's room\" where students assess each other's work in a collaborative way, interesting guest speakers. Prof Green is passionate/insightful and an absolute win for Yale."

Whether you are interested in TV writing or rare bird sighting, learning about the core constituents of storytelling with Professor Green will make you a better communicator, writer, and conversationalist about the things you love. Overall, this a 10/10 course taught by a 10/10 professor.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course! You need to be interested and willing to read at least three full TV and movie scripts each week. The workshop is an invaluable place to receive serious feedback from both the professor and other students on your work.",
                "Yes -- would highly recommend this course to aspiring Film/TV people! One of my favorite courses at Yale."
