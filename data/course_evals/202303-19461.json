                "Really good insight about the text in the middle east",
                "I learned about the change of literary tradition over time, the significance that form (poetry, prose, graphic novel, film, play, etc.) plays in the development of meaning, and the hazards and great promise of engaging with literature outside one's own cultural and temporal canon. I did all of this through reading from some miraculous works of literature: The Epic of Gilgamesh, The Old Testament, The Qur'an, discourses on love shared at an Abbasid-era majlis (gathering of minds), A Thousand and One Nights, Shubeik Lubeik, etc.",
                "This was a great introduction to Near Eastern literature of various forms and a great introduction to what the NELC department has to offer. All the readings were very interesting and Professor Hodgkin was a very knowledgeable guide.",
                "I learned analytical skills that allow me to better comprehend literary texts from different perspectives. I also feel like I have a better grasp on Near Eastern cultures and languages.",
                "I gained a newfound understanding of near eastern literatures, ranging from the ancient to post-modern contexts. The course also offers insights and skills in the form of different mediums. For example, the class visited archives at museums, used library resources to scavenge for books, learned different alphabets, and even worked with and handled Babylonian clay tablets. These enriched my learning experience with both the visual and tactile elements that informed my view of story-telling in the context of the course. \r\nIn terms of engaging with in-class texts, I developed the skills of close reading and plot analysis, and how these can lead to a more in-depth grasp on the literature at hand.",
                "I developed several strategies to communicate with an entirely unreasonable professor. I also gained a profound understanding of how the Yale tenure track warps incentives for professors until they prefer to reiterate how much more intelligent they are than their students rather than actually teach those unlucky enough to have enrolled in this class.",
                "I got better at writing and talking about literature, and I also got to read some really cool Near Eastern texts for the first time."

            "comments": [
                "Professor Hodgkin's enthusiasm and expertise were a clear strength of this course. Those qualities, combined with some obviously inimitable works of literature (Shubeik Lubeik was a definite highlightI am very grateful Hodgkin added itas was the excerpt from Irwin), made for a lively and lovely class. One problem, however, was the course size: the large number of students in the seminar made strong discussion difficult. I think committing to teaching the course as a lecture or committing to teach it as a true seminar (by capping the number of students enrolled) would be helpful. I might be partial to the lecture format: my favorite parts of the course were the literature and Professor HodgkinI'd have been okay missing out on much of the class discussion (and though maybe this discussion would have been better in a smaller class, it's not a guaranteethis literature is new for a lot of people, and that makes discussion sometimes revolve more around understanding than analysis). And I could imagine Professor Hodgkin as a wonderful lecturer ...",
                "I think this course is strong in its reading list and instructor. The texts are all fascinating and, for such a broad area and timespan, linked together remarkably well. This link is in large part due to the knowledge of Professor Hodgkin, who demonstrated high engagement with the texts and the cultures that produced them. Writing assignments helped foster continued engagement. The only weakness I can think of was how some of the seminars were conducted when students would discuss in small groups. I think our discussion was more engaging in a large group led by the professor. Small groups often wasted time and didn't lead to something more substantial than a general discussion would have.",
                "The readings are sometimes a little extensive, maybe there could be some transparency about page number on the syllabus so we can plan appropriately? Otherwise things were good!",
                "Strengths: The structure of the course allowed me to engage with the world of near eastern literature beyond the classroom. While seeking to sharpen your writing and thought-process, the course will also introduce you to a range of resources, archives, and exhibits at Yale that place into perspective the texts we engage with. There is also a lot of discussion groups held in class that encourage further critical thinking and class engagement. \r\n\r\nWays for improvement: having more writing workshops, perhaps spending more time on texts during the semester to divulge them further.",
                "In Class:  In a seminar where a students voices should be heard, Professor Hodgkin pontificates almost the entirety of the class. When you think he finally gives you the chance to speak he cuts you off harshly and carelessly moves back to his agenda. \r\nIn Essay Writing: There are no strengths. Professor Hodkins ensures that you are thoroughly confused. I worked with him several times throughout the semester and never left with any helpful advice. In lue of advice, Professor Hodgkins prefers to pick apart one sentence that has nothing to do with what you came in to ask about. There is almost no office hour time to meet with him and he sets his office hours to be in 15 minute chunks which are not conducive to meaningful engagement with the essay at hand. \r\nTA Office Hours: It is a trap! Professor Hodgkins does not trust his TFs and even they do not know what he wants. They will lead you astray and you will end up doing very poorly.",
                "I really liked the selection of texts that we read, although I think that reading the Hebrew Bible and the Quran was overwhelming for me at first because it was my first time being introduced to the stories in the texts since my family isn't religious. I felt better when I realized that I could just sit back and learn from what my classmates were saying about the texts, waiting until I had more of a foundation in the tradition to participate more actively. I appreciate that Professor Hodgkin didn't seem to have a problem with this (I think the large class size also helped). I think I settled into the class more once we started reading more modern texts and I'm grateful for what I learned about the earlier texts."

                "I would recommend this course to another student. You will read the oldest written story known to exist (The Epic of Gilgameshand if you're lucky, you may find yourself touching a tablet with the epic on it in the Beinecke), perspectives on love shared by Abbasid-era litterateurs, a modern Turkish retelling of a Sultan's descent into insanity (or feigned insanity ...), and more. Professor Hodgkin is great and has assembled a syllabus full of things that will provoke and move you.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The reading is manageable and all super interesting! Professor Hodgkin is a very knowledgeable and friendly instructor.",
                "Yes I would! I felt very supported while I was learning, and also what I was learning felt very engaging.",
                "Absolutely; this course both introduced me to and further enriched me with a knowledge base about the world of near eastern literatures. It allows you to expand on writing skills while also inviting an element of exploration and curiosity about the texts. \r\nI would recommend this course especially if you have an interest in a diverse range of near eastern texts, but more generally I think language or multi-lingual students would also thoroughly enjoy it.",
                "NO. Run far, far away. Any genuine interest in the text and excitement to engage with the material was squashed by unclear expectations from the professor. Students remain in fear that he would dislike one adjective in a paper then ding them by an entire letter grade after having discussed the paper in office hours six times. \r\n\r\nSince office hours prove unhelpful, one may attempt to communicate over email. Unfortunately, the professor will spend more time explaining why your salutation (Hey Professor) may be construed as disrespectful than actually answering your question.\r\n\r\nIn class the professor makes sure no voice is heard but his own. Cutting students off mid sentence and never seeming to care about their thoughts.",
                "I would! I really liked the class environment that Professor Hodgkin created. I think that everyone in our class was kind and thoughtful, and were able to contribute meaningfully to the class discussions. I learned a lot about the Near Eastern literary tradition, having not really been exposed to any texts from the region before, which was very fun. I think that while the course is intellectually challenging, the workload is also less intense than many other writing credits at Yale, so I definitely don't regret taking it."
