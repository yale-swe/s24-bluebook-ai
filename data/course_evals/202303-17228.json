He uses the blackboard unless it makes more sense to use slides (such as for pictures, or simply because the material is review so he can move faster through it on the slides). He provides spectacular lecture notes and is fantastically helpful during OHs. The material is wide-ranging, but I don't view this as a negative.",

The lecture notes are extremely helpful as well. The only change I would recommend is that the exams include more questions. The exams were only two questions so if you didn't understand a certain topic or proof you basically failed that question.",

But it is very proofs-based and definitely amongst one of the most intellectually challenging courses I've taken",

Psets and exams were both fair and really focused on understanding the material at a high level, how to prove similar things, and how to apply it, instead of nitty gritty memorization from class. The course really was centered around exploring and getting an understanding of the material which I really appreciated. It was pretty interesting and very fun. The psets all felt appropriate.

Each topic logically progressed into the next, providing a clear roadmap of the curriculum. The intellectual rigor of the course demanded significant time outside the classroom to fully grasp the concepts. However, Professor Zampetakis's exceptional lecture notes were invaluable, surpassing any online resources I encountered. They provided comprehensive explanations of the class content. Once the material was understood, I found the homework and exams to be exceptionally fair and reasonable. Additionally, the office hours were notably beneficial."

It gives you a sense of some of the questions that are being asked by theorists, how to approach them, and a very strong sense of how computer science is applied. Professor Zampetakis is a gem, with wonderful explanations. The work and grading were also very fair. While the material was tough, it felt like I was just expected to wrestle with it and get comfortable, instead of memorizing things from class. This was really a course centered on student learning, and I loved it.",

You should only take if you have a specific interest in game theory and want to explore it from an algorithmic perspective.",

This course was recently made as an alternative that could satisfy the game theory requirement for the CS-Econ joint major, and I am very happy this alternative was made available because I found this course much more approachable than ECON 351 (which I also tried but dropped). While this course was by no means less intellectually challenging than ECON 351, I feel like the course was designed in a way that was much more approachable and friendly to computer science-focused students. It also helped that we didn't have a long, difficult problem set every week.",

If youre a CS & Econ major, youre probably deciding between this class and Econ 351; take this class. Its phenomenally organized, interesting, and fair."
