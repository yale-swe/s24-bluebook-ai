I know genetics are complicated but I would only start to understand the terminology and reasoning behind things during the second or third lab we did on the concept.",

The pre-lab discussions and lab handouts were very helpful and set up necessary context. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At the beginning of the semester, it would have been helpful to a longer, more in-depth conversation about how to write a formal lab report, especially for students whose first lab class this is."
