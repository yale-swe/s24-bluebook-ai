                "a very in depth knowledge of milan kunderas novels",
                "This class is one of the few courses taught in North America in which students read all of Kundera's oeuvre, and this is such a unique opportunity. Hearing Prof. von Kunes elaborate on biographical elements of the author and provide historic background made the readings so much more enriching. Prof. von Kunes also hosts her seminars in a very casual manner, which allows students free rein to choose what questions they want to grapple with from the novel we read for the week.",

                "The course is excellent in its existing format, and the only possible improvement would be a stricter selection of students to ensure all seminar members are engaged with the material.",
                "the class discussions were great and flowed super well even though the class was so small. the structure of the class is super straight forward--one book per week (plus one film), one reading response each week, midterm paper, and final paper--so it was organized really well and not all over the place!! prof von kunes is also just awesome!! she is so kind and understanding and gives amazing feedback",
                "The course is extremely engaging and challenges students the right amount by having them read a book a week. I loved how Prof. von Kunes led our discussions, and thought it was very interesting to hear what other students thought of different passages in the novel. My only recommendation would be to find ways to incorporate the secondary readings more into the discussion, but we were already reading a lot so that's very fair.",
                "The only weakness of this class is reading the translated novels. The English translations are often awkward and confusing to read."

                "Highly recommend this class, which is unique for its exclusive focus on a single authors work. The readings are a single short novel each week & are more reminiscent of pleasure reading than academic reading. If youre serious about literature and have read any Kundera (or havent, which is a shame) you should definitely take this class.",
                "yes if you like milan kindera (or need a good lit credit) and dont mind reading many many novels! kunderas novels are pretty quick reads generally but reading every one of his novels chronologically over a semester is a lot of time to spend with one (very flawed) guy",
                "Answer in #1",
                "Absolutely - learning about Milan Kundera enhanced my knowledge on writing styles in general, as well as czech culture.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to a friend. This is a rare opportunity to read every novel from a single author. Professor von Kunes led us through Kundera's complex (often deceptively simple) works with extensive knowledge on Kundera himself as well as the historical context surrounding each plot. LITR 220 is essentially a seminar on the human experience. I recommend it highly."
