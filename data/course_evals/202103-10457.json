                "Course provided insight to the connections between colonialism and modern healthcare, particularly psychiatry. A semester-long, timely yet timeless discussion of the differing perspectives on healthcare, the varying levels of trust between different groups in society, and how these discrepancies came to be.",
                "An overview of the history of psychiatry and different concepts of \"madness\" across time periods and cultures; reading texts critically; discussing stigma and sensitive issues within mental health (institutionalization, pathologization, etc.) with a historical lens.",
                "Great course, I knew nothing about the history of psychiatry as a tool of colonialism. Extremely informative and would absolutely recommend.",
                "This course was one of a kind very interesting surrounding the dynamics of colonialism and psychiatry and how history affects dynamics of science and medicine",
                "This course provides a fascinating study of psychiatry and understandings of mental illness in a colonial setting, including both the functions of colonial psychiatry as part of systems of oppression and control, and through the works of liberationist mental health workers who saw psychology as a potential tool for righting historical wrongs."

                "I think one big strength was how accessible the course was and the environment that was created for discussion. I think sometimes the conversation died down a bit because we had alot of time to discuss the readings but I don't know how to improve this.",
                "This course is well structured and I appreciated the various settings/colonial relationships we used to analyze similarities and differences between colonial mental health manifestations. Professor Ramos is definitely a strength of this course - amazing at facilitating discussions without (overly) leading them, and is always flexible and wonderful regarding the workload and stress of this class!",
                "Strengths: Course is accessible to a wide variety of students with different academic and social backgrounds. Professor encouraged discussion on wide variety of topics, and allowed students to safely share their thoughts and opinions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Readings were sometimes a lot, which made it difficult to consistently engage with each author/piece on a deeper level.",
                "Strengths: the topics of this class are super interesting and the discussions are super well facilitated.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think it would be really helpful to have a lot more structured feedback throughout the course.",
                "Strengths: Most things! Prof. Ramos! The final project was a teach-in which I found incredibly engaging and a really great way to synthesize what we learned. The readings were largely great, some maybe a bit dry/outdated but felt necessary to gain historical perspective on some of the more niche topics.\r\nWeaknesses: There isn't much literature on some of the topics we discussed, it would have been helpful to have a bit more lecture from Prof. in the latter half of the semester to provide context. I would have preferred a bit more structure to the shorter papers - it was a bit difficult to get started without prompts. Most people put a ton of effort into our discussion questions, so maybe there could be some way to engage with these more, such as encouraging/requiring students to respond to classmates' questions.",
                "I loved the course! I think the final teach in project was a great way to end the semester",
                "I loved the final project I think we could have done some sort of presentation maybe? But everything was very insightful and helpful throughout the course",
                "This is a fantastic course. Discussion in seminars was always compelling and engaged. There was a great deal of room for disagreement, including about very difficult and sensitive subjects. The readings were fantastic. And professor Ramos organizes the curriculum around genuine engagement with the material."

Professor Ramos' teaching makes the class content incredibly engaging, but also accessible, so if you are looking to try an HSHM course but have no background in history, I would highly recommend this class.",
                "I definitely would and I think every pre med student should consider taking this course because it teaches you alot about general themes in the field of medicine and how we need to be cognizant of its history.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student that found interest in or resonated with the material outlined on the syllabus - this class is hyperfocused on the realm of how mental health has been colonized (and how to decolonize it) so it will be incredibly fulfilling for anyone interested",
                "I definitely would recommend this class to others; I think it would be an excellent course for anyone, especially those interested in working in healthcare and/or the sciences.",
                "Yes! please take this course, this course is so fascinating and the discussion is incredible. Professor Ramos is great!",
                "Absolutely! I learned so much and I'm very grateful to have acquired a critical lens to think about how mental health is treated (both medically and socially). I would encourage people to take this course who are particularly passionate and/or curious about mental health and psychiatry, and who are willing to be open-minded about concepts that you've maybe never questioned before. Prof. Ramos is wonderful, supportive, and very knowledgable about the field.",
                "Absolutely, especially if youre interested in medicine and/or psychiatry",
                "YES! This course was one of the best I have taken, everyone became very close as a class",
                "Yes. Absolutely. The subject matter is fabulously compelling and important. Professor Ramos is smart, understanding, approachable, cares deeply about the material, and is a great discussion leader. The class attracted a fascinating mix of pre-med students, historians, and others from a wide range of disciplines, leading to consistently excellent discussions."
