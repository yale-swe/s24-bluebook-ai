I attended lectures live most of the time but during very busy weeks, I prioritized other things and it was great being able to go back and watch lectures. In a regular year, all professors should make this a given--to have recorded lectures--if professors truly cared about the students' learning rather than something like always being in class. Besides being able to efficiently accomplish work due to recorded lectures, I was also able to re-watch lectures that I had attended to prepare for tests and finish a lab. I definitely would not have learned as much in this class if things weren't recorded--because re-watching things filled in the gaps. The remote access for the computers were a great success as well."

You learned theory in the first half of the course which can be boring and confusing at times (but also interesting). Then the real fun comes in the second half when you learn how to apply this knowledge to analyze satellite data. I'd emphasize this is more of a remote sensing course than a GIS course because you work more to pre-process and manipulate the satellite images than you do making visualizations. If you have no idea how to apply this in your work after Yale, this may not be the right class for you--but maybe you'll find a new passion after taking this course!",

Also, Natalie is fantastic in her support of the course in every lecture, with technical issues, and feedback for student projects. Additionally, the guest lecturers were all great and added fantastic perspective and breadth to the course material."
