    "I learned so much French over the course of this semester: vocabulary, tenses, literature, and film.",
    "I learned how to read French novels and refreshed grammar concepts.",
    "I learned a lot about french grammar rules that built upon FREN110 and 120. This course really reinforced those rules to a point of developed mastery. Along with reinforcing grammar, FREN130 also built upon my vocabulary.",
    "A far better understanding\/ command of french than I had before the course.",
    "My conversational French improved greatly, as well as my knowledge of French grammar, tenses, and vocabulary.",
    "The course improved my reading comprehension and grammar skills.",
    "French grammar, writing, speaking, and reading skills.",
    "My French oral and listening skills improved a lot along with my reading and writing skills. This course also strengthened many grammar concepts."

   "comments": [
    "There was a lot of homework every night and the frequent quizzes were very stressful. Perhaps lightening the load a bit would help the student while not diminishing the integrity of the class.",
    "This class is well-organized to facilitate learning, so that if you are eager to learn French, you will likely improve a lot. However, the workload is far too much. A lot of the homework felt like busy work, such as the MMPs for Jules et Jim. I feel like a smaller amount of more valuable homework a few times a week rather than every night would cause students to put their full effort into it, rather than having to get it done quickly because it eats up so much time.",
    "Strengths: This course will really engage you with the material. it is quick paced and you will feel like you are learning a lot in information in a short amount of time.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, the workload can be a lot. The tests can be a bit difficult if you are not used to its format.",
    "The main strength was that it really did teach me french. The downside was the constant, incessant homework could sometimes become overwhelming, and the pop quizzes were a bit irritating.",
    "I thought the course did a good job of reiterating the concepts we learned in class through various written, oral, and audio exercises. While sometimes a lot of work, the nightly assignments and reading, as well as daily review in class, did a good job of preparing me to use more advanced French. I do think that the workload could be divided more evenly night to night.",
    "This course is a lot of work but definitely worth it. You get as much out of it as you put in.",
    "While I understand the need to have class daily for immersion, the workload got a bit tedious at times, with an audio program and\/or reading a chapter every day. Prof. Koizim said that this course would have about an hr of homework a night, but it definitely was longer especially if the audio program assigned was 20-30 minutes long. Those in particular could have been shortened a little. By the end of the semester the voice of the man and lady reading the audio programs ended up putting me to sleep like some kind of Pavlovian stimulus, though I'm not sure if that was my fault for always doing them late at night or not.\r\nHowever, the audio and other written homework combined with in-class lecture more than adequately prepared me for tests. I appreciated the emphasis on pronunciation and usage of idiomatic expressions, which took my French to the next level.",
    "Weakness: A lot of material, sometimes overwhelming",
    "Strength is that this course creates a great French-speaking environment for students to learn the language faster. It makes the students more comfortable hearing and reading French."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend it only if you're willing to put in the work. There is a lot that you must do outside of class and the level of engagement is very high. You can reasonably spend 1.5-2 hours a night doing homework.",
    "No, unless you are a French major or absolutely love the subject. This class meets every morning all semester including reading period and has 2 to 3 hours of homework every single night. It's simply too much, and I felt like French took up the majority of my coursework this semester when I should have been focusing on other classes. I understand that frequency is important when learning a language, but the amount of work made me frustrated with the class and I couldn't devote my full effort to the homework since I had to learn how to get it done as efficiently as possible. 10-15 hours outside of class, when the class is already 5 hours a week, is too much.",
    "I would recommend this only if you are truly passionate about the french language. If you are planning for a fun and easy time, this is not the course to do that.",
    "I would definitely recommend if you want to learn french, but keep in mind the considerable workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Mme Koizim made class very entertaining and interactive, while remaining rigorous in her expectations and teaching of our French.",
    "Yes. Even though at times this course was a lot of work, my french definitely improved.",
    "Yes, if you are looking to develop a solid basis of French grammar and writing skills.",
    "Yes, you have to take it, unless u test higher sorry",
    "Yes, if they are interested in learning the language and improving in speaking and listening."
