It was also very interesting to learn about how other scholars and creators represent their ideas in a multimedia manner."

                "Strengths: Very engaging class. The hard work throughout the semester felt rewarding. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No real weaknesses for me. The difficult format was sometimes hard but that ended up being a strength.",
                "The course's main strength was the variety and rigor of assignments. Each different assignment contributed to our ability to create a final graphic novel, teaching us many different ways of looking at an environment and its features. We were allowed a great deal of artistic flexibility with each project, which was helpful. Feedback was offered each step of the way. The lectures were also engaging, as were the readings and various films we were assigned over the semester. The course's primary weakness was related to time management and organization. At the beginning of the semester, the workload was quite intense, and while it evened out towards the end, it was a lot to manage in the beginning. Sometimes directions regarding an assignment were unclear, as well, but usually that was figured out. However, overall, the course was enjoyable and helped me to develop many useful skills and new perspectives."

Not only is the teaching team exceptional, but this course really forces students to develop a set of visual tools of analysis and completely pushed me outside of my comfort zone. While the coursework is difficult, each assignment builds on the last, and students are encouraged to be creative. Anthony is a wonderful instructor and I think any Yale student would be lucky to learn from him.",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course. The workload might seem high at first (it is 1.5 credits, after all), but you learn to pace yourself on projects as time goes on. In another sense, it doesn't really feel like work because the projects are a lot of fun. You get to really be creative and innovative in ways that other academic courses don't let you be. For me, the class was a nice balance with my other courses, which involved more traditional methods of readings and paper writing. That said, I don't think I would recommend it to someone who doesn't have a deep interest in urbanism \/ planning. The students here are really committed to the subject matter, which contributes to a great class community.",
                "Yes, especially those interested in urban studies and design.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but only if they are willing to dedicate a lot of time and energy to the assignments."
