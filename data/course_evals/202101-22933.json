This course served as an introduction to different aspects of editing: line editing, fact checking, copy editing, working with structure and organization, and corresponding with writers during the editorial process. I was able to practice editing on sample pieces from The Yale Review and learn from professionals both at TYR and at other publications.",

We were able to dive into very practical discussions about modes and methods of editing, and more broad and abstract discussions about the role of editors and the publishing industry. We did things like edit tests where we had to edit a piece of copy as an assignment and also had response papers to books on editing and publishing. It was simply a FANTASTIC class with so much to give!",

                "one of the strengths of the course was the exposure to so many career editors at various stages in their career. something that could have been improved was integrating students into the submittable system to further expose them to the inner workings of a literary magazine. this was not an issue at all for our course, however, since we still got to engage with reviewing at least one submission each week.",
                "The breadth of the course was a strength: we learned both about the history of the little magazine and about the editorial work of literary magazines today, had both guests from different publications and coursework centered on The Yale Review. I also appreciated that the pieces we read at any point in the semester tended to be the pieces under consideration or in the editorial process at The Yale Review, so the discussions we had about them felt real and relevant.",
                "The guests, Professor O'Rourke, and the assignments. The only improvement I can think of is that some classes were more effective than others because they depended on the guest speaker.",

This class made me think so much about the role of publishers and editors, and also helped me become a better editor myself.",
                "Strengths:  reading the yale review manuscripts and discussing them in class; meeting with all the different types of editors",
                "Meghan did an amazing job organizing this course, especially considering the pandemic conditions! I think one strength is the diversity of perspectives we took/ modes and tasks we explored -- I loved starting the course with more theoretical consideration of the roles of an editor, editing as carework, the outdated model of iconic editor as exemplified by e.g. Gordon Lish, etc., and then moving into specific engagement with subfields like fact checking, copyediting, the final edit memo, audio, etc. I also really loved working with submissions to the Yale Review, and I feel that practical component really enriched the course.",

I wish we would have had the chance to have been more involved with the Yale Review, but I think that will be easier in an in-person semester.",

One of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale and, as a senior, a wonderful (and rare) opportunity to blend rigorous intellectual investigation with a specific and useful investigation of a particular professional industry.
