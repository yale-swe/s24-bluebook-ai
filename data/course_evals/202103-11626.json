I also learned the proper pitch and pronunciation of Japanese words, and my lexicon of Japanese words now contains hundreds of words.",
                "I have learned SO much Japanese in just a semester. This is a class where you get what you put in -- it is a lot of work, but a high payoff.",
                "By taking japanese which was a language that is so different from the two I speak, I have learned about 3 different types of writing scripts. One thing we also have focused on a lot this semester was the pitch accent and that is still a hard thing for me since again, very different from Danish but I felt, especially in the finally presentation, that my awareness of the pitch greatly improved. This is a great skill to start working on since it will definitely help my journey with japanese going forward orally. \r\n\r\nWith a new language comes a lot of new grammar rules and vocab so I worked with different studying methods throughout the semester and was able to find a combination in the end that worked best for me.",
                "I mastered the use of hiragana, katakana, and 50 kanjis. I learned how to use present/future tenses, past tense, present continuous tense and past continuous tense. I learned a large array of vocabulary words (~300 new words). I was given a comprehensive instruction of the Japanese pitch accent, and became more comfortable with speaking in Japanese about topic such as family, food, directions, describing people, etc...",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Nishimura-sensei is an incredible professor. The course content is paced well and lessons build off of one another. Every assignment or classroom discussion was intentional and improved my Japanese; there is no busy work. You also speak so much Japanese in class with your sensei-and peers, and I was surprised to have befriended half of my section!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are no weaknesses of this course. However, L1 Japanese requires an incredible amount of time, energy, and dedication to learn the content. I spent 1-2 hours, 5 days a week, doing HW.",
                "Strengths: It's a super fun class. We spent the vast majority of class time conversing with our classmates about things like going to the movies or our fall break or what tv we watched as a kid -- whatever our vocab for that unit was. We got to play some games and sing some songs. Nishimura Sensei is a great teacher and a lovely person and worked so hard to help us learn Japanese and Japanese culture while having fun. She wrote and recorded most of the songs we learned! We have learned a ton of Japanese in just a semester. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class is a lot of work. Since we mostly practice speaking in class, there is a lot of reading, writing, grammar, and listening to do outside of class. 2+ hours of homework, 5 days a week. It was well worth it in my opinion, but don't underestimate the workload. You can certainly put less into it, but ultimately you'll get out what you put in.",
                "The course was awesome! I would suggest making class preparation more part of the homework, and also vocabulary quizzes!",
                "A strength was definitely the way the different character systems have been introduced. I felt like it was a good way to introduce it steadily and start exposing it to us more and more so by the middle of the semester no romaji was used. \r\n\r\nOne thing that was hard for me, was that being on the rowing team I do not have a lot of time so in the beginning of the semester we would have to learn all the new chapter vocab at once which was too overwhelming for my schedule but I thought it was a bit better for the last 2-3 chapters of the semester since the vocab was due in intervals instead. This made the already big workload more manageable for me. The workload was at times very hard to get through but I think that it is just because it is my only class with day to day homework which makes it hard if big homework days happen to correlate with some of my busiest days.\r\n\r\nThe strength was definitely also the class, I really enjoyed coming to class since we could have fun with our japanese and even though we did not always know the words it was really fun to see the way we were able to interact with each other in japanese. Seeing our complexity in conversation was also fun to follow along. \r\n\r\nAnother strenght is was the vast amount of resouces available through lingco, the pitch accent website and the grammar/audio tobira files.",
                "The course is extremely well taught, probably one of the best taught at Yale. The structure is is well defined and there was not a single time in the semester where I didn't know what we were doing or where we were in the syllabus. There is considerable support in the form of the teacher and TAs. The workload is significant and constant throughout the semester, which is important when trying to pick up a new language. The professor is very responsive to feedback and integrates it in the course very easily. There are a lot of different aids to learning apart from the classroom, including the book, online Tobira resources, Padlet, JPP for pitch accent and Lingco. Such a vast array of media facilitates learning extensively. It is a great class with little to no weaknesses.",
                "Very engaging course. The pace was very fast and it was easy to get left behind.",
                "Strengths: very well organized and each lesson felt like a natural progression from the last. I never felt like things were moving too fast or that I didnt understand what was happening.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very time consuming, which is what I expect from a language class. Its really easy to fall behind if you miss a homework.",
                "Strengths of this course include how immersive the class is especially due to the fact that students are only allowed to converse in Japanese during class. Although the daily work load could sometimes feel a lot, I feel as if because of that I was really able to learn and improve at a much faster rate than I had expected.",
                "it was very thorough tho i wish more time was spent on explaining grammar and other concepts, but overall only overwhelming at first it gets a lot better. the pronounciation practices however are overwhelmingly similar, it becomes difficult to distinguish which practice is which."

                "Absolutely. If you are interested in learning Japanese and developing your reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills, take this class. You also learn about some aspects of Japanese culture, history, and society.",

                "If you are interested in Japanese definitely but if not, I think the workload and commitment is too great for a person to keep interest in.",
                "Most definitely. I felt like I progressed so much in very little time and feel more than prepared to move on to L2 Japanese if need be. I improved in writing and speech at a fast rate, and learned a lot about Japanese culture too. The class environment is furthermore really enjoyable and conducive to learning. I made some great friends in that class. That being said, this is a language course with a constant medium to high workload so be prepared to do simple but large amounts of homework.",
                "Yes, it is a fascinating language course with many helpful teachers and even clinic hours to practice your japanese.",
                "Yes! Probably one of the most fun classes Ive taken at Yale and I really learned a lot! You do have to devote a lot of time to it, but the work never felt pointless.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are committed to putting in the time to learning a completely new language from scratch, especially keeping in mind that it has multiple writing systems to memorize and the daily workload. Overall, I think the small classroom environment helped to build a tight-knit bond and I would recommend the course to anyone interested in learning more about Japan and Japanese culture.",
                "yes! although wouldnt complain if the workload is lowered a bit."
