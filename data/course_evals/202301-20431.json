                "Overall, it was organized very well, but it felt like all the projects and exams hit during the last 2 weeks, especially when dealing with a harder grammatical topic. More opportunities for speaking would also be helpful to develop more everyday skills potentially.",
                "Strengths: Professor Muravnik is an awesome professor. His understanding of how to teach grammar in a comprehensible way makes his lectures super valuable. Format of the class in general is conducive to student learning and improving one's fluency. Weakness: my one suggestion is to make deadlines for the individual assignments (i.e. presentations, home reading assignments, and discussions) in order to space them out, as without deadlines we all procrastinated and wound up cramming everything into the last week of school, which was very hectic. Note to future self: don't leave so many assignments to the last minute!",
                "The class is excellent in terms of developing passive Russian proficiency; however the lesser emphasis on the speaking component means that your proficiency can feel somewhat lopsided by the end.",
                "The strengths are the Professor - he has curated a wonderful syllabus. Weaknesses are hard to find.",
                "Very engaging and organized professor, small class sizes improve opportunities for clarification and student engagement, but near the end of the semester too many assignments were assigned."

                "Absolutely, if you're willing to put the hours in and really want to become proficient in Russian. If you have a sort of analytical learning style, the phonological and grammar explanations will be especially suited to helping you internalize a more instinctive understanding of the language.",
                "Yes definitely - if you love languages/Russian/History - this class is so great!",
