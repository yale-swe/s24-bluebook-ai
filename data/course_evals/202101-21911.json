                "I really enjoyed going to lab every week just to work with the experiments. However, I found the lab reports to be extremely long. It wouldn't be clear what data we may have been missing until after we work on the experiment, making some lab reports harder than others.",
                "This course was cool to explore parts of physics I am interested in. An issue was that each lab contained about three separate experiments under one heading, so it was sometimes overwhelming to do a writeup. However, I think the instructors and TAs were helpful and available whenever I reached out to them.",
                "Actually pretty fun class, but it would've been nice if there was less of a focus on being able to code, because the crash course from 205L did not feel like enough. Additionally, more information about the relative difficulty of labs would be nice to know when deciding which experiments to do. Finally, I truly believe this class should be a WR for the amount of writing we did; especially because EENG 200 is a WR, and we did equally, if not more, writing than that class requires."

                "I would strongly recommend this course to interested physics majors who want to learn how to use really interesting physics equipment like electron beam tubes, logic gates, and van de Graaff generators. The class is fun because you can work with really interesting equipment and solve for fundamental constants, but can be tedious at times when working on lab reports.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are more interested in physics, or who want to choose their own experiments. I think there is probably way less guidance in this class with regard to physics theory and experiments than in 166L. If you want to write freewheeling (but awfully long) lab reports, this is the class for you.",
                "If youre choosing between the 165/166 sequence and the 205/206 sequence, CHOOSE 205/206! Its so much more engaging, so much less stressful, and the professor and TAs were great. This course is really unique in that it allows you to design your own experience in lab, so take advantage of it and choose the labs that sound most interesting to you!",
                "Yes, I would, but I think the instructors should be encouraged to look into getting the class sanctioned as a WR. I didn't take 165L or 166L, so it's hard to compare, but it was fun getting to pick our own experiments and was actually pretty engaging. This coming from a non-physics person that took the course to meet pre-med requirements. Also, because the class was so small, you really get a lot of attention and help when needed, which was nice."
