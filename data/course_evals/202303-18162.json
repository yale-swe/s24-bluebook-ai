                "This class helped create an environment where it was easy to connect with other people who are interested in the major and in theater at Yale in general. It also forced me to problem solve and be creative in a collaborative environment.\r\nI felt that the course had too much focus on experimental work, and not enough on traditional theater. As an introductory class for the major, I felt that it did not accurately represent the components of the major. Often times, assigned reading or viewings felt extremely random and weird, making it very difficult to extract any meaning from it. Because there is such a diversity of interests within performance in the students, I feel that more diversity in the course structure would be beneficial.",
                "Strengths - Fosters creativity and you make AMAZING friends! The real strength of this course is meeting the other people considering a theater major and truly bonding with them\r\nWeaknesses - You'll be questioning, \"What the heck is this?\" a lot...",
                "I loved how the Collaboration course brought my peers and I closer together. We bonded and created strong friendships with one another through our collaborative projects and ability to work together. Unfortunately, I realized throughout the semester that a three hour class tires me out more than I had anticipated, especially after my class at 9 am. I love my peers and professors, but I found myself not being able to bring my fullest energy to the class. I think if the class was divided into two hour sessions per week, I would have been able to give my fullest attention. However, that it is something I could have worked on personally. I do feel though that the classes felt repetitive at times.",
                "This course is extremely abstract (more performance art focused than theater) so it's hard to say there were any hard skills gained from it. But it helps you bond with other students interested in theater/performance",
                "I felt that overall this class was very enjoyable. It really pushes students out of their comfort zones with performance during in class activities. I felt that the structure of the class was done well, with both whole class interaction as well as prolonged group work with the group we are assigned at the beginning of the semester. The growth alongside the group was one of the most valuable parts of the course. In terms of weaknesses, I think expectations for large group projects could have been made more clear sooner. While there were syllabus descriptions for these, they were often very vague or open to interpretation, or we simply would not have all the material necessary to start a project. The class requires a lot of outside group work, for which the scheduling is often difficult, so more clarification to begin proactive discussion could have been helpful."

For those interested in more experimental work or dance, maybe this would be a good course for them.",

It offered a chance to discuss interesting material, develop original creative work, get a look into the opportunities offered by the department and major, and give students the opportunity to connect directly with others that also have an interest in performance."
