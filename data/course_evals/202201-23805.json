This is one of the classes that I feel as though I learned the most. I also enjoyed the guest speakers. They were interesting and informative.",

We always had really great discussions, and the class was a great balance of lecture and conversation. Professor Sakthivel does a great job of drawing everyone into the conversation without making it stressful or unnatural.",

You have ample freedom to write on subjects you're interested in. Professor Sakthivel is extremely intelligent and provides extensive feedback on your writing. There is a high reading work load that you have to read in-depth, so remaining consistently engaged in the course is important to do well. Overall well worth it, and a very intersectional class."
