                "SO MUCH. You cover how to paint, from the basics to advanced techniques: pigments, how to create pigments, how to create paint, application of paint, different paint techniques, etc etc. You will leave the course being able to identify what pigments are used in the painting as well as how a painting has been constructed via its layers of paint and more.",

                "I have learned about describing the construction of a painting and become more familiarized with using the correct vocabularies. I also got to experiment with different types of materials and understand their different characteristics and applications through hands-on experience."

                "The class really shines during the studio days. Perhaps a little bit better time management as we would often rush when finishing paintings under the class time ends.",

                "This class is perfect - it is both informative and fun! The class has totally changed my perspective on looking at paintings and offered me a deeper understanding of materiality and how it affects the visual impact that each painting creates."

                "Absolutely recommend!! This course is a delight, as are Mark and Jessica. They are a wonderful pair, and they created a cheery, lighthearted atmosphere in the conservation studio. In a world where most of our work is done through a screen, it feels great to actually do hands-on work, whether that is making paint or reconstructing old painting techniques. The workload outside of class is very manageable. The readings are kind of long and technical, but the important information will be emphasized in class. It's also a huge privilege to spend time in the conservation studio and get close-up looks at the paintings in the YCBA collection. Mark and Jessica are extraordinarily knowledgeable--I think all art history students should try to take this class, as there's no better way to understand materiality than to actually get your own hands on the material. One of my favorite classes I've taken here!",
                "Yes! I think it is incredibly interesting content for any major.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! This is a once-in-a-lifetime course that Yale students are lucky to have offered to them. It enables you to explore all the incredible corners of the Yale British Art Gallery and YUAG from the conservators room to the libraries to each wing displaying art work you likely never contemplated previously... it's really the perfect blend of a seminar involving intellectual discussion, experimentation and hands-on painting and gallery viewing\/analyzing key art history papers.",
                "PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS! You will have learned so much, one of my all time favorite classes I have ever taken at Yale. Even if you are not an art history major, you will truly get so much out of this. I have never painted before in my life, and I feel extremely proud of the physical work I made in this course as well as all that I have learned. If you have taken the similar Physical Examination of Art course taught over at the YUAG by Anne and Irma, this course is an excellent complement to that class--you do not cover the same content at all, and I feel so blessed to have had such an amazing and rare opportunity in on-hands conservation learning by both courses.",
                "Would definitely recommend if youre interested in art or art history, or if youre generally interested in material studies. Youll get a lot out of it if you put in a lot.",
                "Yes 100%",
                "This course is a fair bit of work, but it never is too overwhelming because of how fun it is. Jessica and Mark are wonderful and have so much firsthand knowledge of the technical aspects of paint. I would especially recommend this class to Art History majors who have little\/no experience working with the mediums that they study.",
                "YES. Amazing and interesting course. I felt lucky to have class in the conservation studio and see masterpieces unframed almost every week. Mark and Jessica are so knowledgeable and funny. The course takes full advantage of Yale's resources and has really fun hands on elements.",
                "Absolutely. This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale and I would recommend it to everyone regardless of their background in art\/art history."
