                "learned lots about blockchain and consensus protocols",

            "comments": [
                "This class suffers from the same problem that most CS electives have. All the emphasis is put on theory and little to no emphasis is put on practical application. It's kind of like hiring someone to teach you to drive, but they spend all their time teaching you how to build an engine. Obviously knowing how to build an engine gives you a deeper understanding of how a car works, but it does absolutely nothing in terms of teaching you how to actually drive a car on the road. Part of the class title is \"Introduction to smart contracts\", but actually coding in Solidity rarely came up in class, and we were essentially expected to teach ourselves the language and actual implementation of the theory through coding labs. On top of that, the psets were very tedious and super proof heavy, and seemed to test our discrete math abilities more than our actual understanding of cryptocurrencies.",
                "I thought this course was very a little too technical and all of the place, I think it would benefit from a more focused lens with a goal and over arching theme over the semester.",
                "The course is very well organized with slides and readings grouped by lectures. The labs are also very well-designed and clear, and pointers to resources and documentation are provided to prevent confusion. The problem sets can be a bit confusing, especially with some of the more open-ended questions, so I wish there was some hint as to what the graders are looking for.",
                "Strengths: Lectures were nicely organized on the course website. The assignments and labs felt sufficiently challenging, but not unbearable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were not recorded. It was often difficult to study from the lecture slides because they contained a large amount of pictures and diagrams rather than text.\r\n\r\n The biggest weakness of the class was the lack of office hours (only 3 hours per week). This was likely due to the fact that this was a new course that did not have ULAs. However, this meant that I had to spend a lot of time searching through YouTube videos and blockchain forums to understand how to solve some homework problems.",
                "Class materials could better reflect the material covered in problem sets and the labs. I felt the difficulty of the labs and problem sets were much greater than any of the class material.",
                "a bit more basic instruction on cryptography could have been helpful, especially for the problem sets",
                "In the nicest way, this class was ridiculously hard for no reason. Received little to no feedback on the homework, the homework almost always consisted of concepts that we never really learned, and it was just very stressful.",
                "I think there need to be some more math pre-reqs for this class. I felt unprepared for the type of mathematical translation needed to succeed. I also think the psets could reflect lecture material a little bit better. After psets, I think going over the answers to questions that everyone got wrong in class would be beneficial.",
                "Instructor is an expert in the field, but lacks teaching experience. There should also be guided homeworks, as the grades were low, but have them be as thorough and difficult, but hold less weight then previously designed. This will boost student engagement and ability to absorb the material, while maintaining difficulty but decreasing bombardment of unachievable psets with low scoring grades(showcasing the lack of learning)"

                "I would not recommend the course in its current format to other Yale students. I think most people signed up for the class expecting to be able to deploy their own contracts on the Ethereum network or start working with cryptocurrencies in general, but the class did nothing in terms of preparing us for that. Most of it was just writing proofs and analyzing algorithms on paper.",
                "Yes, if you want a gentle introduction to blockchain technology and its applications, or are interested in distributed systems. The grading can be a bit harsh with no curves, so it might be wise to credit/D/fail the course if you can't spend too much time on Psets and labs.",
                "It's a good class if you're a CS major who has sufficient experience (like 223 and algorithms). The homework mainly involves written responses and math problems rather than programming. Even though it is not strictly required, it will be helpful if you have a background in probability, economics, and computer security.",
