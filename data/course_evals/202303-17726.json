                "Strength: My professor was really engaging and energetic. I think this is needed for a language classroom. He was able to teach us in a way that was very efficient and fun. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes I felt like the finger spelling was too fast too quickly. I am still trying to get a hang of it so when our professor signs quickly, it is hard to follow.",
                "Strengths: Zen is an engaging professor and always willing to help the students! He's also hilarious and down to earth, making the class feel like a conversation rather than an actual class. Overall, I loved taking the course with him! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Students with social anxiety may suffer because he tends to put students in front of the class to sign. He is VERY kind and does not humiliate his students, but sometimes, the student might not be comfortable signing in front of the whole class.",
                "Its great",
                "This course is very hands on, and I appreciated the balance between focus in class and time outside of class to participate in Deaf community activities. However, the asynchronous hours felt a little unstructured",
                "There was not a lot of feedback given for most assignments. I felt a little left adrift and our instructor didnt check in with us very often about how things were going\/what we needed to focus on individually.",
                "Strengths included being able to practice every day and fostering an inclusive, affirming environment.\r\n\r\nI think the course could be improved organizationally. The Canvas assignments were pretty disorganized, and I missed a couple assignments because they were mislabeled as having no due date or buried beneath several other unrelated assignments."
