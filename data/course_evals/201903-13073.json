    "I learned absolutely so much in this course that it still blows my mind.",

    "I was very much immersed into a French-speaking environment and developed all sorts of skills in reading, listening, and speaking abilities.",
    "My understanding of the French language grew exponentially. I feel comfortable speaking with other French speakers, attempting to read French texts, as well as watching French movies and listening to French music.",
    "We covered all of the essential grammar structures, as well as picked up vocabulary relevant to everyday French conversation. We also discussed French culture (movies, music, norms, etc.)."

   "comments": [
    "I have absolutely no weaknesses to give to this class. Despite the nature of the class being very quick-paced, Professor Sherak did an amazing job of teaching us the material, reviewing it, and also keeping us interested and engaged!",
    "The intense, immersive nature of the course is very conducive to language learning, and you really get to know your classmates! I loved the intimate and supportive classroom environment and genuinely enjoyed going to class and spending time with the people I met in it. \r\nOne weakness might be that towards the second half of the class (after we moved into L2) some of the workbook exercises felt unnecessarily long and repetitive.",
    "This course is absolutely amazing! It is super engaging and very well organized. I enjoyed every minute in this class. You are immersed in a French-speaking environment and your French improves very quickly!",
    "Overall the course is excellent. If there's one way to learn a language, this is it. It's really incredible the level of fluency you reach at the end of the course. I would say there could be a tad more speaking done within the class (outside of just speaking with partners) and its would be nice if tests weren't given over a computer. It's much easier and I think more helpful to speak with a person when you give your aural portion of the test and I think it could be more beneficial in the long run. Otherwise, I think the course was great.",
    "At times, the course moved slowly compared to other times where it felt like the course was moving extremely quickly and I felt there was no time to fully grasp certain topics. The course covers a lot in a very short amount of time, but I felt that some topics could have been better spaced out.",
    "The pace of intensive French was demanding but felt manageable. I think that the course packet was very helpful in supplying extra exercises to help us practice. More thought could be put into creating a wider variety of in-class activities that could get students practicing their French in different ways."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. If anyone is interested in learning French (or any language), I firmly believe that the intensive course is the way to go. Despite the amount of work, the intensive course is worth it not only for its comprehensive teaching of the language but also for its amazing class atmosphere (the professor and other kids included).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are serious and passionate about learning French. This is truly the best way to start a language and will set you up wonderfully for future success. Madame Sherak is so kind and supportive, and you will get to know your classmates very well since you spend nearly 2 hours a day with them for a whole semester! I didn't find the workload to be that bad on a night to night basis, and the material isn't hard (it's an intro language class after all). As long as you keep up and get into a rhythm of doing the workbook and finishing the other assignments you'll be fine, but you may have to prioritize French just because there is always more work to be done every day. Obviously don't take it just to fulfill a language requirement, but for people who enjoy learning languages, this course is a true gem. \r\nDon't get discouraged if you can't keep up in the first few classes; I promise by the end of the semester you will be so surprised at and proud of how much French you know!",
    "If you want to get better at French really quickly and are willing to put in the efforts, take this course! There is no better place to learn French here. Everyone here is dedicated to learn this language and Madame Sherak does all she could to help you.",
    "Absolutely. If you're really dedicated and want to learn a language, I don't think there's a better way.",
    "If you want to learn the French language in a fast but engaging way, this course is definitely one to take. I would not recommend taking this course with other courses that have high workloads, but if you feel you can handle the pressure, then by all means, you should take this course. You will not regret it.",
    "Yes. It's a great class to take if you want a challenging and fast-paced way to immerse yourself in French."
