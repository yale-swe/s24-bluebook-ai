Most skills and knowledge in this class are review of skills already obtained by many students through working in a lab (outside of courses) and Biochemistry lecture courses. Protein purification and PyMOL analysis were unique to this course.",
                "PCR, gel electrophoresis, enzyme kinetics, protein purification, molecular biology techniques like bacterial competence, transformation, etc.",

                "The main question of this class is exploring what factors most affect protein structure, and whether we predict structure based on an amino acid sequence. We specifically did an experiment with s. nuclease enzyme. Each week we performed a different step in our semester long experiment.\r\nWe learned how to do PCR, molecular cloning, transformation, worked with agar plates, how to analyze a 3D structure of a protein with computer graphics, etc."

                "This course was disorganized and not well taught. Even though it was a introductory biochem lab, the environment was stressful and did not facilitate student learning. One professor taught solely through zoom, even though students were in the lab space.",
                "The primary strength of this course was the absolutely fantastic grad student TA. They were our savior and stood up for us when aspects of the course were unfair. \r\n\r\nThis class was fairly unorganized and Zoom lectures were very dry and hard to pay attention to. The professor mean well, but can come off as very rude and condescending. This created an unsafe environment for learning for students and the TA. Several conversations were overheard between the two professor talking that were extremely unprofessional (including remarks that they didn't know why students didn't know the answers to discussion questions). Thursdays were stressful, except for the bright light that was the TA of this course! Though the material is interesting, this course was not taught in a way to inspire questions or interest in the material. Questions were not well tolerated and Zoom lectures were mostly reading off slides with copied and pasted bullet points from Wikipedia. \r\n\r\nPBS movies and labster's labs on top of 4 hours labs every week were unnecessary. PBS movies are outdated and the portrayal of women in STEM made me uncomfortable.",
                "Strength was definitely Dr. Pawashe. Great instructor, fantastic mentor. Very understanding and helpful throughout the class.",
                "Strengths: I enjoyed working on the same experiment throughout the whole semester, and I felt prepared to present and write the lab report at the end \r\nWeaknesses: At times the virtual lectures were difficult to hear, which created confusion.",
                "I liked that there was an overarching project that lasted many weeks and covered many lab techniques. The TA of the course was also a major strength; I asked her many questions and she was always so helpful and knowledgable. \r\n\r\nA weakness of the course was that it was slightly disorganized. I was sometimes confused about what we were doing.",
                "I think the way the lab was set up there was a lot of time we would sit in lab for an hour doing nothing, which I did not enjoy.",
                "strengths: TAs were a lifesave! The lab manual was also very thorough and very helpful. I like that the whole semester followed one long project as opposed to doing random labs each week, but of you missed one week of class or had a conflict, that could make a serious impact on your project. Professor Aruna is really big on mental health and taking breaks during class, meditation before class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some labster demos were too long. The hybrid format of the teaching team was not ideal and sometimes audio made it hard to stay engaged. The teaching team wasn't always in agreement and the TAs should have been treated better (especially considering how much work they do)  and given more preparation for each class.\r\nI also feel like we could have left class earlier most days but the way the agenda worked kept us for the full 4 hours.",

Most students majoring in MBB are already in a lab, so I would suggest that they learn the techniques taught in this course through their lab and have their PI sign off on certain skills. I wish I had done that as it would have been a better use of my time, and my work would have been put on something more meaningful.",
