Really great essay feedback as well that has helped me learn how to craft a strong argument. Also has made me appreciate poetry and word choice, by reading some of the people who have done it the best.",

We were able to dive into certain poets, especially Dickinson in great detail, but I would still appreciate reading other poets of the time to contextualize her work.",

Take this as one of your foundational requirements for the major! Or even if your not in the major, you will learn how to close read and articulate in your writing!",

Take it as a foundational english requirement or even if you are outside of the major - your close reading and writing will become so much better!",
