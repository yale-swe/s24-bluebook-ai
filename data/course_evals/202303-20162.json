                "I learned a lot about French culture and history in general through this class. The readings were very well curated to explore different time periods in French history and understand important cultural aspects. We had many \"rdactions,\" so I was able to improve my writing skills, and I appreciated the chance to practice my speaking skills through time set aside for casual conversations and when discussing the literature.",

                "Ability to converse in french and communicate more complex ideas in french",
                "Through this course, I learned how to more closely analyze works in French and write longer-length essays connecting several works together. I also was able to gain more confidence in my spoken French, especially through learning key vocab and phrases that improved the flow of my sentences.",
                "I gained a ton more French vocabulary a got more comfortable conversing in French and reading literature and articles. It was also great to hear all my classmates' perspectives on the material we read and watched in class.",

                "I think the improvement of writing was a strength while the course could do better in improving our speaking. Maybe if we did more class bonding activities or skits in the beginning of the year I would have been more comfortable practicing my speaking in class.",
                "I think more opportunities to speak in groups would be helpful. Although this changed in the latter half of the class and I think the instructor found a good balance.",
                "Strengths: \r\nTeaches grammar well, gives a lot of grammar practice. Strengthens your confidence in writing/syntax. Good reading workload.\r\nWeakness:\r\nI would've benefited from a greater focus on speaking, reading, and analyzing texts. Grammar homework load was very high.",
                "The literature, movie and song selection in this course was excellent. Combined they did an excellent job highlighting aspects of French culture and history. I would have appreciated more time just to converse in French and greater discussion of the films/songs. I really like the rdactions and how we turned in two drafts so we really had the opportunity to improve our writing skills.",
                "Strengths: read some cool French literature and watched some interesting films. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes I felt underprepared for exams, but I suspect that had more to do with me than the professor.",
                "I do not really see any weaknesses with the course",
                "This course does a great job of solidifying one's understanding of grammar structures, to the point that they feel more intuitive to incorporate in one's writing and speech. The discussion-based format of the class encourages active engagement and practice through communicating one's ideas both in small groups and with the whole class. One thing about the class that could be improved is the amount of feedback given, particularly after assessments are handed backI think having more time to discuss common mistakes would have helped clarify the class's understanding of the material as a whole.",
                "I think the course is structured well; I really like the revision aspect of writing assignments and the final project. I also really like the kind of hybrid lecture/seminar style of classes. The books we read and films we watched were also very captivating as were our class discussions. I think at times the workload could be a lot, especially with multiple assignments on some nights, and I would have preferred either shorter exams or more time to complete them.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-Class and seminar environment is well done\r\n-Readings are well selected\r\n-Homework is well done to facilitate learning of grammar\r\n-Lot's of feedback on the essays, which is good\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Wish you could learn a bit more. I think it would be better to make this into L5 either a 1.5 credit course which meets everyday, or split it into an intro conversation course and an intro lit (before 160 and 170). I just wish there were more options for beginner L5 courses so that one could take more right away. If one reads a lot outside of class you can learn many words and such, but it would be great to have more class time.",
                "I loved the course reading and materials but i believe it was too much! If students already deal with 3-4 other classes, it is too much to handle."

Getting a good grasp of grammar structures is definitely an important goal to have in the class, but it is all part of becoming a more fluent writer and speaker! Learning about the historical and social context for the media we discussed was also a highlight of the class.",
