    "Learned a lot about transatlantic slave narratives and their influence on future literature.",
    "Great reading list and Homans is excellent at engaging us in discussion.",
    "I learned a lot about analyzing seemingly disparate works as connected, and considering the implicit conversations between them.",
    "Evidence-based discussion skills, literary analysis, writing academic papers that draw connections between works, research",
    "This was the first course I took that focused on reading literature through the lens of race and gender. I think it was very important for me to develop my ability to see through that lens, and to analyze how race and gender roles play out in literature.",
    "I developed my close reading skills, and thought about connections between works of literature that I might not have put in conversation before."

   "comments": [
    "We read a lot in the course, which for me was a strength, but I think the conversation could have done with a bit more guidance.",
    "Only improvement could be more interesting paper topics but great readibg list and must experience professor.",
    "I thought the syllabus was great. The discussions sometimes lagged a bit--we would get caught on a particular idea or question and then have a very difficult time moving on to something else, even if as a whole we didn't find that particular idea or question all that engaging. I think there could have been a more natural flow to our discussions.",
    "I loved the texts from this course! Discussion was consistently engaging; although it lagged towards the last few weeks of the semester, I think this could easily be fixed by weekly reading responses."

    "This class is a lot of reading, but really rewarding, especially at the end of the semester! I definitely learned a lot and Professor Homans is great.",
    "Yes! Homans is awesome",
    "If you're interested in the works on the syllabus, or more broadly in questions of race and gender in literature, it's a solid class.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Absolutely! The topic of this course is relevant, and Margaret Homans is not only a phenomenal professor, but she is also kind and approachable.",
    "Take it",
    "Yes, definitely take this course. Professor Homans is great--clear in her expectations, astute in her observations--and for those who have never taken a class like this before, it will expand your literary vocabulary and your ability to see things through the lens of race and gender.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class-- reasonable workload, amazing reading list, and Professor Homans is great and makes for an engaging and energizing seminar environment."
