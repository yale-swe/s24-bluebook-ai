Just about everything, from octopuses and fire to mirrors and doors. The concepts really become internalized in you until you become unable to think about how everything is a medium. Use this throughout life as you will.",

Whether it be learning about infrastructure, writing, the radio, phonography, etc., Professor JDP did a wonderful job explaining these disciplines and reasoning why they are so prevalent in our modern society. It was a fun way to explore the intricacies of media (which I have never learned about before) and their role from the past up to our technocratic society.",

Absolutely brilliant. BTW if you are looking for a gut be cautious: this class is definitely \"WHAT YOU PUT IN YOU GET OUT\" sort of vibes. Definitely easy enough to get an A/A-, but you won't enjoy it and it will feel like a slog. I personally spent a lot of time on this course and loved it, but I couldn't call it a gut just for the number of hours it took. My friends that skated by without doing anything got fine grades, but were constantly complaining that they didn't understand what was going on and that it was like an annoying hassle. So I know they rate this class low on workload, but like, consider that and what you want out of a writing class.",

                "This course is taught in a \"podcast-style\" which works really well. The professor weaves from idea to idea, which works well with the content being presented. The section leaders were incredibly insightful and gave me new material to engage with. The only weakness, I think is the density of reading that needs to be done for the two classes on any given week. While they were informative, it was increasingly difficult to keep up with the content. The format of the final however, allows there to be some breathing room to catch up, and the sections do a great job of keeping everyone in sync in terms of the main takeaways for the week.",
                "Both a strength and a weakness of the class is how much material is covered. At some points, it can seem very disconnected and almost random, but it also opens our eyes to the broad scope of what is media. However, this left me coming away from the class not really able to tell other students what the class was about and what I learned from it.",
                "Brings in some interesting thinkers/themes/readings, but is frustratingly unguided (by design) and only of real interest to those with an academic interest in media theory. Laypersons will find themselves disengaged, confused - tough to tell if this is a result of media theory's mass appeal or the specific design of the course. Major assignments were often very fun and thought-provoking (e.g. object meditation, book review), and workload was not prohibitive, but lectures/readings can go in one ear and out the other, even for those diligently keeping up.",
                "Strength was that section was very good and helpful to understand readings. Weakness was that lecture seemed unnecessary for the assignments and was random at times.",
                "Strengths: the wide range of medium this class covers. Weaknesses: it starts out a little confusing, perhaps some base establishments of what media theory is might help, however part of the point of the class is to establish a definition for media as the weeks progress.",
                "Strengths are that there is a lot of hand holding. The TFs are very nice and provide a lot of opportunities for re-writing essays or providing help. Weaknesses are that the concepts are super theoretical and often remain unclear.",
                "My TF was rude and mean to students but facilitated good conversation. Would have enjoyed class much better had I had a better TF or had she been a more personable instructor. Also really difficult to keep up with TF-assigned coursework as it was mainly shared via one singular email thread that was simply replied to all year, not Canvas.",
                "Course would be better if discussion sections were more consistent across TFs.",
                "Strengths: The course material is interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class structure. Lectures are just streams of consciousness, and theres no discernible direction in the class until the last few weeks. The class is completely graded on your ability to write and synthesize information, but the TA and Prof. do little to build these skills.",
                "I couldn't really name any weaknesses, this class was very interesting and different than anything I have experienced before.",
                "Strengths: Peters is an almanac of facts about the world. Take this class just to be amazed I guess?\r\nWeaknesses: Ironically, Peters sucks at technology. So, you will very likely have to go to lecture.",
                "The course teaches you to think in different ways, but a lot of times it seemed like what we were talking about was very irrelevant and it was easy to not pay attention because it took so long to get to the point about what we were discussing.",
                "The lectures are interesting a require engagement because there are no slides, just the professor talking. The sections require some extra work and preparation which at times felt overboard.",

                "Its strengths is that it makes room for critical analysis of media and media-related concepts!",
                "The ideas discussed in this course are extremely interesting and the professor does a great job making lectures engaging. The only weakness is the amount of reading in comparison to time discussing it. Readings were often dense and long and it was hard to sort out what I was meant to be taking away. Lecture often engaged with the readings nicely but section always seemed to focus on some specific aspect of the reading that hadn't been an obvious focus.",

                "John Durham Peters is an incredibly impressive and engaging lecturer  I enjoyed coming to lecture and learning from his eccentric, creative examples. However, the TF and small section experience you have in this class can really make or break it for you. I had a much more challenging, inconvenient, and unforgiving experience with my TA that made me feel discouraged when writing assignments and caused me to lose motivation in the class at times. He shot down most of our discussions in class and was pretty obviously disengaged from a lot of our ideas when we tried to introduce spins on media theory that tapped into our own curiosities and passions for our final papers.",
                "lectures were very unstructured, could benefit from a little more guidelines for students",
                "Well organized, everything was clear. Some of the assignments were a little ambiguous, however, that let us be even more creative with our responses.",
                "This course was strong for its focus on conceptual and theoretical material, as this was the aspect of the topic I found most interesting.",
                "I think it would have been helpful to do a bit more of a deep dive with the readings that were assigned. While many of them were very profound and insightful excerpts from scholarly texts, I think it would have been nice to hear a bit more from JDP himself on his thoughts about them. Additionally, it would have been nice to have a bit more structure in the lectures (ie with slides that were a little more than pictures/quotes - but this is just helpful for my own learning process) but other than that I don't think there was any true weaknesses from this class. It actually turned out to be my favorite class this semester and I enjoyed attending every lecture and section, probably because of the creative, inclusive, and inviting learning atmosphere provided by JDP and my TF. I think another strength I found from this course was the helpful criticism provided by my TF, who was incredibly meticulous in his critiques which I think helped improve my writing a ton over the course of the semester.",
                "Strengths were the range of topics and challenge to take different perspectives on media. Weaknesses include the broadness of lectures.",

                "Strengths - really changed the way that I think.\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes lecture was a bit long but I wanted to feel more engaged, maybe taking a small break in the middle to stretch due to a lot of theory?",
                "Great professor",
                "I believe sections worked really well in analyzing the material learned in lecture that week. On the other hand, lectures were difficult to follow at times as it was almost all vocal.",
                "Strengths of the course were that it had a discussion section and that it was very communication based. The lecture was not dependent on slides, but moreso on theory, and I think that made the class more interesting and authentic.",
                "Strengths: The assignments are very flexible.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The content of the class felt very obscure. It was not clear exactly what I was supposed to be learning.",
                "STRENGTHS: Professor Peters is a gem, and his TA squad is brilliant as well. Could not ask more of a professor to truly show that he cares about his students. Because of that, everything else that flowed was brilliant: Lecture, readings, etc. It was bizarre at times, no question, but you gotta be ready for that if you take this course. Weird in a collegey way that youre not gonna get anywhere else. You gotta be willing to jump right in. WEAKNESSES: I would say first of all there's a low level of clarity on what the first couple assignments are actually asking from you, so you really gotta talk with your TAs about them, but I would prefer some more guidance early on, especially for the first essay. Also, office hours are sort of \"make them as you want,\" which can be kind of intimidating if you are just looking for a \"stop-and-chat,\" but really these are minor problems for what is a truly brilliant course",

The papers can get heavy, but they are extremely rewarding to get through. The class is clearly taught to facilitate student learning, and I believe it succeeds in doing so.",

I know some people didn't like the abstractness of media theory, but if you think you'd enjoy thinking about random objects and how they interact with human civilization give this class a try. Prof Peters' lecture style is very train-of-thought, but interesting if you can keep up.",
                "Only if you are a film major and you have to (although, speaking as a film major, I think this absolutely should be removed as a required course. It provided very little help for my greater study of film at Yale), or if you are deeply interested in philosophy.",

Honestly, it seems like a class that's more about thinking about interesting questions relating to the world, history, and media.",
                "No  if youre just looking for a WR or Hu credit l, no. This class is the definition of lofty intellectual nonsense. The entire class was about discerning semantics, and it felt like a very throw them out of the nest and see if they fly style of teaching. I definitely see an appeal for this class. However, as a STEM major who enjoys more concrete topics, this class was far too abstract for my liking. Do not take this course because its easy. I heard that a lot when registering, and its definitely not an easy WR credit (then again, I dont know what is). Take this class ONLY if you really think you enjoy the readings AND think you can synthesize similarly philosophical arguments.",
                "Absolutely. Wonderful writing credit, and great for people that want to challenge their thinking abilities.",

                "If you are looking to take a class that provides a new way of thinking about infrastructure and media around us (from doors and fire to the internet) and are interested in philosophical discussions on such topics, then this is the class for you. But I would warn that in reading new writers every week, there seemed to be an expectation at times that we have background knowledge on major media theorists and that might simply not be something you have. The class is still good, either way, but you just need to be willing to sometimes be a little lost if you aren't a FILM major",

                "Yes absolutely",
                "Yes, but be prepared for a different type of media than what you were expecting.",
                "I would recommend to students that are open minded and interested in broadening the way they think",
                "Yeah, especially for STEM students looking for a relatively easy WR class.",
                "Not if youre a stem major. Too abstract at times",
                "Yes! Very interesting and not too demanding.",
                "This course, for better or worse, changed the way I see the world. Peters' program was to make the world seem weird and he succeeded, whether through comparing Dolphins' eating of one another's poop to our wine-tastings or remarking that weather forecasters and pornstars are some of the only people to change their names to suit their profession. Obviously, these aspects of the world only seem weird because we haven't considered them, and that is the real purpose of this class: to question our conceptions until they seem strange, and then to integrate this weirdness until it is no longer weird to us. The lectures and \"readings\" (in fact, they appropriately span many forms of media) are engaging and the assignments are quite flexible and rewarding, though they required substantially more thought than typical writing assignments.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students, particularly those who enjoy learning about broader philosophical concepts with more ambiguous reasoning. I think it could serve useful for someone like myself who enjoys creative reading and writing, and I implore others to at least shop this course as it is something I found quite enjoyable. Professor JDP always made class interesting and I genuinely appreciated his quirky sense of humor that made 10:30am lecture worthwhile.",
                "Yes really cool class. Beware it is about all mediums, not just films and TV and things like that.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in thinking differently through a different lense.",
                "Highly recommend no matter what your discipline is - will force you to think about the media that engorges us in new ways",
                "Yes, overall this was a really interesting class to take. The topics of media theory are very applicable to other areas of study and in our daily lives as well. Prof Peters is a great lecturer and well known in the field of media studies. I do have to emphasize that there is a final exam along with a final essay that people should look out for. If you are taking this as a fifth class, make sure you plan ahead because finals seasons can be really intense with both an essay and exam for a class.",
                "No. Not worth it",
                "I would. Although, don't consider it much through the lens of Filmit's much more media theory and thinking of what media studies are entirely.",
                "Yeah it was super thought provoking",
                "Yes, it is a good writing credit and engages deep thinking.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because there is not a lot of stress associated with the class, which helps to focus more on the learning aspect. You learn a lot of new information that could help you navigate with the world differently.",
                "I am not sure I would. The only reason I took this course was because it was a requirement for the Film major. I would not have taken it otherwise.",
                "Yes absolutely 100%. Seriously, though, you have to be up to it. If you don't want to do readings and aren't interested with like weird college theory that is totally bizarre but makes you consider the whole world differently, you can still get an A, but you won't enjoy yourself. If you're willing to like do the stereotypical college thing and like get drunk with your friends and talk about society and stuff, then this class will be great. Personally, this class helped me think about a family tragedy differently, and for that I will always be grateful to professor Peters. Absolutely brilliantly done.",
                "This is a great course for someone looking for a writing credit. The workload is relatively low and the material is very understadable for someone without experience in media theory.",
                "Yes, the topic is interesting, the teaching fellows and friendly and very understanding, and the writing assignments are creative. I enjoyed the class"
