Going through exercises everyday and practicing with my classmates prepared me for day-to-day interactions with Cariocas.",

I felt all of my classmates loosen up more, which helped me do so as well. My only note would be that the last couple of weeks felt very grammar-heavy and conjugation-specific, and while I was able to stay afloat during this shift, I felt like it was very abrupt.",

Strengths: an amazing professor who was more than happy to answer questions.  The materials we just were also super helpful and always available to us."

This entire experience was amazing and I have no doubt my Portuguese would be nowhere near what it is without this course and it's structure."

I am really looking forward to reading some Portuguese literature, maybe first in translation and then in the target language. I also want to study linguistic interactions between the Iberian Peninsula and Northern Africa, and Portuguese will be an invaluable tool in that research. I hope Portuguese will continue to be essential in my day to day interactions.",

I hope to be able to facilitate more conversations and become a better communicator.  I also plan on continuing my Portuguese education.  Truly, what Professor Jackson has taught me will be appreciated for lifetimes to come.  Portuguese will now be added to the languages within my future household."
