                "Only weakness is that the lecture notes are hard to understand/follow sometimes, but other than that:\r\ngreat labs\r\ncool content\r\njakub is a great professor, but he is always late for grading stuff, like it is past the credit/d/fail deadline rn and bro still hasnt graded our midterms, so i guess dont take this class if you think you might want to credit/d/fail it",
                "I think the homework was a lot of busywork that didn't really test understanding. The courses greatest limitation is how quickly we move the a huge breadth of material, and I feel like a lot of the later and more complex topics didn't get enough time. Also, the grading was very slow, basically got 90% of out grades back during reading week which is not that helpful.",
                "I believe I learn by practice quite a bit so the sporadic homework assignments did not feel spaced out well enough for me. However, the lectures were good. The labs helped with learning material but often were quite difficult in that I felt like some manuals did not lead you through the lab very well or it was hard to directly connect material back to lectures.",
                "The course greatly simplifies very complicated topics, but I feel like we didn't learn much because of it.",
                "I absolutely hate slides. To thrive, I need a very active learning environment with discussion, teamwork, and in-class practice problems that demonstrate the concepts we are learning in class. Unfortunately, that is not what this class is. After a while, I grew to hate going to class. All my other classes were so much more engaging and I was beginning to worry I had picked the wrong major (Electrical Engineering), but when I began studying (cramming, really) on my own for the final, I realized the content was really amazing. I didn't really feel that the class had any notable strengths, other than perhaps the kind grading system.",

The only thing they graded very very fast was the final.\r\n- The p-sets (the first 3) are extremely extremely long. Could take up to 30 hours. This makes the course tedious and shows the professor is not very well at doing assignments.\r\n- The exams were weird and we barely had time to finish. However, I must say, the curves were very very fair.\r\n- Sometimes a bit disorganized in terms of p-set release... \r\n- The LABS. The only way to finish labs was either with Anthony or Kevin's help. HOWEVER, they were very long and almost had topics that we hadn't seen in class yet. \r\n- Overall, the time committed to this class was that of 3 courses.",

                "I liked the labs. The slides were thorough but slightly repetitive. That's not necessarily a bad thing. In my opinion, there weren't enough psets to really practice the material. I think there should have been a pset every week but that the psets should have been shorter."
