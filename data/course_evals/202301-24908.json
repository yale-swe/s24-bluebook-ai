I also learned how to more effectively read and digest literature and write effective reading responses. Furthermore, I got to further hone my creative writing and short story skills.",

Another strength of this course is that it was highly influenced by the class and like a proper seminar our discussions were largely student led and were highly engaging. The only weakness of this course was simply the large amount of reading that was required.",
                "I had a wonderful time in this course. I think the readings were deeply thought-provoking and I enjoyed writing essays and reflections on the readings. I think the long class period could have benefitted from a bit more structured discussion, but found the presentations and discussion highly fascinating.",
                "I loved all of the different mediums we were diving into, and how our conversations were super expansive, which I could think discussions about the climate crisis ought to be. I really enjoyed Dr. Brass' powerpoints that helped us situate arguments and analyses we were learning to one another. Dr. Brass had great energy and enthusiasm throughout the semester. There could be a bit more organization and stricter deadlines. I really liked the student presentations, and I think it could have been interesting to see more of them (i.e. make them mandatory)."
