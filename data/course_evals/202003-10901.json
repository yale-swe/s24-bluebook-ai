                "Taking this course, I learned more about Frederick Douglass as a man, as well as his contributions to American society. As the title of the course suggests, this course was focused on Douglass. However, in many ways, Douglass  his personal history, his speeches and writings, his actions, and the texts that have been written about him since  was used as a lens through which to evaluate bigger themes in history, including inequality, racism, the Civil War, etc.",
                "writing a long research paper, in-depth study of biographies and autobiographies",
                "Besides learning about Frederick Douglass along with the Civil War and Reconstruction era in U.S. history, I felt like I began to understand \"how to be a historian.\" Reading specific inquiries into the life of Douglass helped me understand what types of questions historical writers seek to answer. Doing research for the final paper (although incredibly laborious and daunting) showed me how historians browse through archives for documents and analyze them for content. Writing the shorter response papers similarly demonstrated how historical thinkers scrutinize specifics within certain documents. I know it seems like a lot of abstract takeaways, but I felt like this seminar helped me bridge the gap from introductory to advanced history courses.",
                "This was an incredible course -  I had the privilege to learn a great deal about Frederick Douglass, slavery in America, and the abolition movement.",
                "You learn everything Frederick Douglass",
                "My ability to interpret the complexities of learning from and critically analyzing autobiographies strengthened throughout this class, which I really enjoyed thinking about. This goes without saying, but I learned so much about Frederick Douglass, and learning about Douglass is an entry point into learning about slavery, the Civil War, the origin and legacy of Civil Rights, and historical theoretical perspectives on abolition, and how the history of social justice is never as straightforward as we would like it to be. Douglass is a fascinating thinker and writer, and our society is continually bettered by our remembrance of his ideals and his fight for equality."

                "The course was very reading heavy, which was both a positive and a negative. On the one hand, it meant that we had a lot of material with which to engage. On the other hand, it often meant consuming literature that we did not have proper time to discuss. There really weren't too many weaknesses in the course -- it was truly an incredible class.",
                "Strengths: everything about the course, but especially Professor Blight. I would take a class about dirt if he were teaching it. He is hilarious and kind. You read his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography as the functional \"textbook\" each week - the opportunity to ask the author of your reading questions is INSANE! he has such encyclopedic knowledge and cool insights into the research process. if you're a history major and you leave yale without taking a seminar with him, it's a complete missed opportunity. also, maybe because of the high workload, the kids in the class were far more engaged than most at yale - never a moment where at least a few people weren't dying to get in on the topic. Blight also welcomes a multidisciplinary approach to it - you can get at Douglass from a literary perspective, psychological, political theory, etc. something for every major if you can write well.\r\n\r\nIf there's a single weakness, it's the a wild amount of work - 2 5-6 pg essays, 1 20+ pg essay, 2 presentations and insane amount of reading. That said, Blight is flexible-ish about deadlines. And you can pick the due dates for most of the stuff. Worth it.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Blight is an engaging teacher. Besides being a clear expert in the area, he is always very friendly, down-to-earth, and flexible (he was pretty generous on granting extensions). He also keeps up to date with new material, current events, and such which he incorporated into class. The readings were pretty interesting as well. Two hours of discussion can be exhausting, so it is nice that he breaks it up by interjecting a lot. I appreciated his insights, but I do wish that he had inserted a five minutes \"Zoom break\" in the middle of class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are a lot of readings! Like A LOT. Prof. Blight gives pretty thorough feedback on the papers, but I wish that he had taken more time to sit down with each student to go through his comments as sometimes there were a little more abstract. Oftentimes, I understood the literal meaning of his comments, but I did not grasp how he wanted me to execute these larger, more conceptual changes in my writing. Also, the final research paper is a beast to write, so not procrastinating it would make the course much more enjoyable.",
                "This is one of those phenomenal Yale courses that should not change at all. Professor Blight is legendary -  my only regret is that I wasn't able to take his class in person.",
                "strength - David Blight! He is so passionate about Frederick Douglass \r\nweaknesses - I think it is tough to become an \"expert\" in Frederick Douglass in the course of one semester, and the grading was discouraging at times",
                "I think everything about this course was a strength. Every discussion was super interesting and it was a joy to hear Professor Blight speak on Douglass every week, as well as hear all of the insightful comments and questions of my peers. I loved coming to class every Wednesday. I also appreciated all of the assigned readings throughout the semester. Even though it was a significant amount of reading for each week, the reading was always really interesting and I looked forward to it. I honestly even procrastinated doing my homework for other classes by doing the reading for this class because I just wanted to keep reading about Douglass. I think the only thing that could make this class better would be if it went on longer! There is still so much I want to learn from and about Douglass."

To get to learn about a historical figure from the foremost expert on that individual is a truly unparalleled experience. Professor Blight is unbelievably knowledgeable about Douglass, and his passion about Douglass came through the Zoom screen every single class. Moreover, Prof. Blight makes you feel like your contributions to discussion are both novel and valuable, leading to a warm, respectful, and engaging classroom environment.",
                "see above about strengths and weaknesses - take this course in a heartbeat, or anything offered by blight.",
                "I would recommend this course to another students only if the student is really interested in Frederick Douglass or the time period and if the student is prepared to do a lot of writing. Of course, Prof. Blight is an amazing professor who I think is worth taking a class with, but if you don't meet those two requirements, perhaps his lecture would be better for you.",
                "Yes, I learned a lot about Frederick Douglass and abolitionism\/the Civil War more generally.",
                "I would recommend this course to any Yale student. I came into this course knowing very little about Frederick Douglass and left with a ton of knowledge. Additionally, the course heavily supplemented the knowledge I previously had about American history, specifically in the mid-19th century.",
                "Yes! But you should take this class during a semester when your other classes aren't as demanding. This course was the workloads of two hard courses",
                "If you are interested in 19th century American history, the history of black activism and political thought, and\/or the fascinating life of Frederick Douglass in and of itself (explored in a seminar taught by the man who wrote the definitive biography of FD), yes! I was continually surprised by how relevant Douglass's life and thought are to contemporary American politics. The term paper offers a great opportunity to learn\/hone the skills\/practices necessary to write a longform historical essay. Prof. Blightthough he kept us at least fifteen minutes over time every classis a wonderful person and instructor who seemed to genuinely enjoy engaging with us every Wednesday morning.",
                "Yes!!!! This was my favorite course I have taken at Yale. I think that everyone should learn about Frederick Douglass and read his work. Learning about Douglass not only enlightens you of his inspirational story, but it teaches you so much about the painful reality of civil rights in America, then and now. There is absolutely no way you will regret taking this course."
