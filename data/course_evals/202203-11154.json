But this class really solidified my ability to take on challenges and excel. I am very shocked by how much I was able to learn about one language in a few months. My native Chinese speaking friends were surprised and impressed by week two with how much I was able to say and understand.",

                "Strengths are obviously the incredible teaching and organization of the course, it was definately my favorite course by far. The only weakness was the workload making chinese my most time intensive class every day.",
                "Even at L1 there are a wide range of levels coming into the course. The professor consistently teaches up to those who have past experience which can make the class very difficult for true beginners. Workload is very high, but expectations are clear and fair. The class operates like a flipped classroom where you learn grammar, vocabulary, and structures on your own with the textbook and you practice in class. I think the teacher could also be a bit more patient with mistakes.",
                "Strengths: This course gives you a lot of knowledge and autonomy in produce and interpreting the language in the topics that it goes over.\r\nWeaknesses: none :0, it's just a lot of work, but rightfully so",

                "This course is challenging. But you will gain SOOO much out of it. I definitely would recommend this to any students that wants to try something outside of their comfort zone and is dedicated to learning for the sake of learning. It definitely is a lot of work for someone who is exploring so I wouldn't recommend to anyone unless they are dedicated to taking on the challenge.",
                "I would recommend this to a student if they are passionate about Chinese. This class a very fast-paced, with dictations every day and learning about 30 to 50 new characters per week. You also have homework daily, about 2-4 assignments per night. We had presentations every week, chapter tests every 3 weeks, and oral tests every month and a half about. If this workload sounds doable to you, then go right ahead.",
                "Yes, I think Chinese is a great way to break out of your comfort zone if youve never taken the language before. The teachers are all very helpful and the TA sessions allow you to practice the language when you would otherwise have no space to practice the language. Overall I really enjoyed being able to explore the language and culture by taking Chinese at Yale."
