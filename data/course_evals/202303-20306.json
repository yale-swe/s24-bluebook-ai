I learned that I like chemistry a lot more than I thought, even if I wasn't at the top of the class. I learned how to approach material through an understanding approach rather than a memorization approach, contrary to how I thought the class would be oriented. I feel very comfortable in the subject material and am excited to apply it in higher-level courses.",

                "CHEM 174 is a good introduction to the basics of organic chemistry, especially with regards to general principles and reaction types\/mechanisms. Prof. Herzon stressed the importance of having a conceptual understanding of most of the course material; I certainly agree with this approach but am not entirely sure of the extent to which it was employed (certain portions of the course were very memorization-based). That said, I do feel as if I am coming out of CHEM 174 with a solid conceptual understanding of many elementary topics in organic chemistry. For any student looking to learn the fundamentals of organic chemistry (for the chemistry major, in preparing for other courses, for fun, etc.), I would definitely recommend CHEM 174 (or CHEM 220).",

I learned about stereochemistry and many reaction mechanisms (alkene reactions, substitution, and elimination reactions). It is great environment to learn Orgo, since everyone is just as curious and confused.",
                "I was able to build upon my previous chemistry knowledge in terms of diagrams, including molecular orbital theory and reaction energy diagrams. The class also taught me to consider new concepts such as axial chirality, diastereomeric transition states, and A-values.",
                "This course is definitely one of the best when it comes to learning the basic fundamentals skills of organic chemistry, professor herzon does an amazing job at this! The skilled learned involves thinking about different mechanisms, proposing reagents to obtain desired products, and even think about how molecules tend to stabilize themselves.",
                "One of the best things about this course for me was that it was organized around overarching principles and big ideas rather than getting into the weeds of nomenclature, long lists of functional groups, etc. Because of this, even in the short semester we had, I felt like I got a good handle on the basic ideas of organic chemistry and the methods of reasoning that I could use to work through even unfamiliar problems  somewhat of the analog of teaching us how to fish instead of just giving us the fish, as the saying goes.",
                "CHEM 174 definitely challenges you to think \"outside the box\". As you further study in chemistry you realize that certain models don't show the full extent of chemical interactions, and certain rules clash with one another. Although the uncertainty that comes with organic chemistry can become frustrating, by the end of the course you gain an appreciation for this uncertainty.",

Definitely take the course if you are up for the challenge, its a great group of hard-working first-year chemists, and Professor Herzon was very passionate in teaching the class, too. We learned about a bunch of mechanisms and also how to discern in what kinds of environments (solvents, temp, etc) each of mechanism will happen\/ be preferred over the others.",

                "strengths - recorded lectures from past years to review, no curve so good collaboration, psets are completion based \r\nweaknesses - a lot of content is covered, easy to get lost, but not all content winds up on exams",
                "The major strengths of this course is definitely being surrounded by a group of first years, which made me feel a sense of belonging and community, as well as the easy access to peer tutors, professor, and teaching fellows who all helped me significantly throughout the semester in understanding confusing concepts. The major weakness of this course was that sometimes the class moves at very fast pace and shifts from one topic to another without allowing much time for deeper understanding of the concepts being taught.",
                "Professor Herzon and the TAs are amazing. Herzon is an entertaining lecturer who truly wonderful instructor, who takes the oft-feared class of organic chemistry and makes it enjoyable. It is a true mark of greatness to turn something that is difficult to teach into something simple to understand.\r\nI also found the problem sets to be an appropriate length while still allowing us to get the necessary practice. I also liked the setup of generally knowing what style of problem is going to be on each test, allowing us to stress less and focus on learning more.",
                "The course had a lot of support to help with the challenging material for first years. Sometimes the pacing of the class was a bit off. I felt as though we rushed through some difficult portions but spent too much time on easier portions.",
                "Some strengths include the practice tests, the choice to skip the final, the forgiving grading for the psets, Professor Herzon's humor, the opportunities for extra credit, and the peer tutors. However, I thought that the class moved very fast at times, especially towards the end and we ended up being a bit behind the syllabus.",
                "Prof. Herzon is a fantastic, engaging lecturer, and the grading scheme is quite generous, which lets students focus on learning concepts instead of stressing about their grade. Prof. Herzon's philosophy for presenting course concepts and studying them was logical, but it was sometimes difficult to get my footing. I wish that there were more basic-level pset problems because there aren't very many and they're advanced. It can even be difficult to go to the textbook for help because nomenclature is largely ignored.",
                "Strengths: Seth is incredibly engaging and accessible. The subject material is engaging and we were always reminded of its real-life application (it seemed like what were learning about really mattered, as opposed to just being something else we had to know for no particular reason). The tests didn't try to trick you, rather, they were the best possible demonstration of your knowledge. The class is structured so that you have every opportunity to do your best, and there is no curve so you didn't feel like you were competing against your peers (something I especially appreciated as a freshman in many lectures). Weaknesses: There was a disconnect between my AP Chem class in high school and the start of organic chemistry. I felt like I didn't have adequate preparation or understanding of the basics to speak about, debate, and work on the topics in the beginning. I really would have appreciated some sort of preparatory guide in the summer (with basic nomenclature, things to know, the basics) so that the playing field could have been leveled and I could've started the course with more confidence. This is my biggest recommendation, as we are all coming from different learning backgrounds and I felt behind right out of the gate despite testing into the course (the placement exam, I will add, should be harder. I'm not sure if I should've placed into the class in the first place). The PSets being completion deterred me from trying my best on them and they never really helped me in understanding the material. I would have also appreciated more practice problems on skills such as drawing chairs\/neumann projections, predicting reaction products, etc.",
                "Strengths: Format and grading (allowed space for mistakes and improvement)\r\nWeaknesses: Peer tutoring in the third unit was very flawed, and it felt like no one knew what they were doing, so you had to go straight to Herzon",
                "The lectures were very engaging and worth going to (especially since the recordings available were outdated). Grading was generous and Herzon was an excellent lecturer. An excellent course for well-prepared first-years.",
                "Strengths: A very good, solid course in foundational organic chemistry that was very informational and helpful without being burdensome in any way. I think there a lot of difficulties\/horror stories typically associated with organic chemistry courses (being too hard, far too much memorization, etc.), and I think that this course avoided all of those tropes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course did jump around a bit, and it felt as if we would talk about a particular topic for a few lectures and then shift to something largely or entirely unrelated; a course structure with greater cohesion between different parts of the semester (to the greatest extent possible) might have been easier to follow. I would also note that certain parts of the course (especially towards the middle and end of the semester) were very, very memorization-based. I understand that certain aspects of organic chemistry (namely reaction mechanisms) require a certain level of memorization, but a greater emphasis on conceptual\/foundational knowledge would have been nice.",
                "Very well taught and engaging",
                "Strengths: The class is structured to accommodate First-Years. For example, psets are graded by completion and effort, the average of the three exams  can replace the final exam, and there are many office hours available (by TAs, peer tutors, and Prof. Herzon himself). Grading is done very quickly, exams are graded within 3 hours. Prof. Herzon is a great lecturer and is even more helpful during office hours. The discussions and study halls are very helpful in ensuring understanding. There is a strong community among the First-Year Orgo group because everyone learns from each other in office hours and study halls.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish Prof. Herzon can post more handouts after lecture, or recordings of the lecture. He does have a YouTube channel though that is useful. The discussions during the beginning of the semester were less helpful since they were less structured. The discussions began to be helpful when TAs made slides on the content.",
                "Strengths: There are plenty of resources to help you clarify information and succeed, from discussion sections (which essentially serve as a review of lecture content), study halls (for extra credit), peer tutor sessions, and practice exams. The problem sets are challenging and rewarding while also being stress-free, as they are graded for completion but still corrected by your Teaching Fellow.\r\nWeaknesses: In my opinion, the class is not great at building a foundation for the more systematic side of organic chemistry. Organic nomenclature is skipped, and the alkene reactions are introduced before stereochemistry (meaning part of the course is rewinding to previous reactions and trying to figure out their stereochemical outcome). The pacing of the class overall felt somewhat unbalanced, with the non-SN2 substitution\/elimination reactions, as well as alcohol\/epoxide chemistry, being more or less glossed over in the final two weeks.",
                "I think one of the best aspects of this course are the weekly discussion sections - the TA's do a lovely job explaining the content further, in fact, most of the content was solidified in these discussion sections. Additionally professor herzon rewards students with extra credit for attending study halls, hosted on a specific day of the week to meet with your friends and discuss problems sets, peer tutors are great for this course also!\r\n\r\nI think the only way to improve this course is to have more office hours if possible, nevertheless though, the professor is very responsive and kind on email!",
                "Lectures are posted online so you can practice at your own pace. Extra credit reduces amount of pressure, but exams are difficult because limited number of questions makes each question worth a lot.",
                "Overall, the course was well organized and very smooth, with clear communication of logistical matters and expectations and prompt posting of problem sets and practice exams, as well as regular office hours (which were a great time by the way, it's a bit of a trek to the CRB but I highly recommend). Professor Herzon is wonderful and the way he breaks the often dense lecture material with fun stories is very welcome and very much needed. I can't really think of any significant weaknesses, other than the somewhat delayed PSet grading, but that's a minor thing and didn't really affect much considering they're just graded on completion and we go over them anyway.",
                "The lectures were very clear, well organized, and helpful. Professor Herzon always kept the lectures engaging. The PSETs were approachable and interesting, and the discussion sections and office hours were very helpful in reviewing material and working on the PSETs. The grade breakdown was structured in a way that didn't put much pressure on individual exams, in a way that was very forgiving and helpful, especially for a first-year, first-semester class.",
                "Strengths: A LOT OF RESOURCES!! From the TA's to the peer tutors, this course is designed for you to be successful and actually learn organic chemistry. I liked how Professor Herzon formatted the course to relate every lecture and mechanism to the 3 major concepts of organic chemistry that we learned from the first class. It allowed me to look at organic chemistry in a broader sense. In addition, the problem sets are graded for completion and the discussion sections + study halls were a great way to work together in a group setting. Collaborative work definitely helped me learned me learn the material better.\r\nWeaknesses: Organic chemistry is tough to learn and at times it won't make sense and it can take a very long time to ACTUALLY grasp a single concept. With that being said, the course is fast-paced and there are three in-class exams. At times it felt like the course dragged on and it was hard to study the material for the exam.",
                "Strengths:\r\nProblem sets are graded on effort rather than accuracy.\r\nPeer tutors and TAs are extremely helpful.\r\nIn addition to practice exams, practice problems and exams from previous years are provided in the Files section of Canvas. \r\nFinal is optional, which made my finals season infinitely less stressful. \r\nVirtually no emphasis on nomenclature and memorization.\r\nThe lax grading system alleviated a lot of pressure, which I think allowed me to engage more with the course content.\r\nThe smaller class size and only first-years allowed for a lot of camaraderie, probably more so than CHEM 220.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSome lectures were very dense and hard to follow, often to the point where it was hard to get the bigger picture, though that is probably the nature of organic chemistry.\r\nThe tests were not necessarily easy, but because half of the questions were verbatim from the practice exam, I don't feel like my performance on the exams is necessarily reflective of my organic chemistry knowledge and ability.",
                "Lots of advanced learners in the class make it initially hard to keep up, but content and workload is very manageable - many opportunities to get help",
                "Overall great class, Prof Herzon is the best professor I had this semester and although the content is hard he keeps you engaged. Evaluation is fair and grading was lenient so I wasn't actually stressed out about grading even though orgo is a notoriously hard class. As of improvements, maybe reorganizing the order and emphasis of concepts like putting stereochemistry first and spending more time on sn1\/2 e1\/2 reactions in later parts of the semester.",
                "Prof Herzon is amazing! TAs were all so helpful, too.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Engaging lectures by Professor Herzon that did a great job of explaining the most important and challenging concepts in organic chemistry\r\n- Amazing community in CHEM 174, since it's all freshman who share an interest in chemistry. \r\n- My TA, Zechun Wang, was phenomenal\r\n- Generous class\/grading policies, e.g. the final is optional, up to 5% extra credit for showing up to weekly study halls, weekly problems are graded for completion, half the test questions are distributed in advance.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- It is not so easy to stay consistently engaged with the class due to the lack of regular graded assignments (e.x. weekly graded psets). This made studying for the midterms a bigger lift than it otherwise would be.",
                "good",
                "The structure of the syllabus was very helpful in terms of extra credit and assistance. I think it could be improved by eliminating the third midterm and having 2 midterms rather than 3.",
                "I think the grading scheme for this class was its greatest strength. There were opportunities for extra credit, psets were graded based on completion, and parts of the exams were given to us beforehand. This really promoted a relatively stress free environment and encouraged collaboration between students. It also meant that I could be focused on really understanding the material instead of being focused on grades. The course was also taught really well and there were so many different opportunities to get extra help, including sections, office hours, peer tutors, and study halls.",
                "Strengths: Seth is a fantastic professor, the class was not too stressful, learned a lot, very organized and clear expectations\r\nWeaknesses: N\/A"

It's fun being in a relatively advanced class with only first years, and you will be ready for this course if you get placed into it by the placement exam, as the course starts from the fundamentals (with a review of the pertinent parts of gen chem), to ease your way into the truly remarkable world of organic chemistry.",

Taking organic chemistry earlier rather than later (especially if you're a chemistry major or very interested in chemistry) will open up courses\/opportunities more readily.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! There is a strong community of first-years in the class with varying expertise in Chem. Everyone will come across confusions, but Prof. Herzon and the TAs are very helpful in explaining during office hours. The pressures of earning of a good grade in the class is minimal, so you can focus on understanding the material. Herzon is a funny and great lecturer. Great class to choose if you are undecided between Gen Chem and Orgo as a First-Year.",
                "For students who have decided on the pre-med track or are considering a chemistry-related major, I believe first-year Orgo is a great investment; just be ready to consult the textbook on topics that the lectures don't cover in detail.",
                "Anyone who wants to do anything chemistry related should take this course, learning organic chemistry will help a lot in the future. Professor Herzon structures the course in an understandable way and his explanation to the content is great! He encourages students to speak up and ask questions and he is very patient. Anyone who needs this course to finish a requirement or just wants to learn organic chemistry should definitely take it.",
                "Yes, only if you have an interest in chemistry",
                "If you do place into it, absolutely take it. It has a generous safety net built in that regular orgo won't, and the smaller class and community of other first-years was a big plus. Even if you aren't pre-med but interested in chemistry and\/or the sciences in general, I think this class is a great way to get some experience with a pretty abstract (but not mathematically so  there's almost no math involved) yet quite applicable field.",
                "Yes, especially in comparison to what I've heard about the sequence of gen chem and non-first-year orgo. It is a very forgiving place to start STEM as a first year, and encouraged learning without significant stress. The lectures from Professor Herzon were great, and the TFs were very helpful as well.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I would recommend. From someone with terrible fundamentals in general chemistry, though the class sometimes felt overwhelming, it was never too much to the point where I was completely clueless. In retrospect, I think I learned a lot, and I would take this class again even if it were not a major\/pre-med requirement. For me personally, the higher workload mostly came from trying to understand organic chemistry rather than the actual course structure itself, which I felt was relatively light.",
                "Yes, great introduction to organic molecules with a lesser learning curve",
                "Take this instead of non-first year orgo if you can. But maybe don't take orgo if you don't need it for a requirement, it's still a hard class",
                "Yes, you learn to establish good study habits (attending office hours and stuff), but be ready to spend a lot of time on chemistry.",
                "If you want to take an introductory orgo class and are a freshman, CHEM 174 is definitely a better option than the general intro orgo class. The community of freshmen in the class is great, the course is intellectually challenging without being too difficult grade-wise, and Prof. Herzon is awesome.",
                "good",
                "Only if you have to take it \/ are interested in Organic Chemistry! If so then it's a good course to take even in first year, but will be a lot of work during midterm \/ final season.",
                "Yes! I learned so much in this course, and the way it was organized\/graded really helped get rid of the stress and difficulty that is usually associated with organic chemistry. Prof Herzon and the TF's were all amazing and super helpful.",
                "100% -- loved this class! Seth is fantastic. If you have the opportunity to take this class, you should. I learned a ton and was never too stressed out."
