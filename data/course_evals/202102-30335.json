                "I learned how to view world in different visual perspectives by participating in the discussions with my professor and my classmates. We not only have the skill of using two basic art manipulating apps (illustrator and photoshop) now, but also have the ability to work collaboratively with teammates. Thank to our professor, who gave us useful feedbacks and suggestions, led us to a higher level of appreciating and evaluating art.",
                "This class is a great introductory course for people hoping to learn about art history, art theory, and gain skills across different art disciplines. As it was a remote course, a lot of projects centered on digital art (using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop), but Professor Valentine did a great job of tempering this with outside work such as sculpture and an exploration photography project.",
                "I wasn't expecting to learn many technical skills during this course because I had an expectation that it would be more about art theory, but we were taught more than I had expected. We learned how to use some of the Adobe programs while also learning about art form and the history behind it during the slideshow lectures. I think in this class we were able to be much more creative than in some other art classes for our assignments which was really nice but at times frustrating when you don't even know where to start. I also learned to think more critically and really delve into how I saw a piece of art and to expand upon that feeling than just try and answer the question as to how I thought the instructor would want to hear since Alex really encouraged us to say what was on our minds.",
                "I learned about basic concepts of art such as composition and color, and different mediums like photography, sculpture, graphic design, and drawing. This class taught me how to use Adobe software, pencil sketching, and found objects.",
                "I learned how to use Abode apps including Illustrator and Photoshop. Similarly I also learned of many current artists and explored different mediums for art that I had never explored myself such as publishing and sculpture making. The readings for the course taught me about general topics such as color and explored it to great depths. My appreciation for art and my own abilities as an artist have grown as a result of this course.",

            "comments": [
                "I have to say that it is a very strong course with creative assignments and meaningful discussions. There is a small personal idea I would like to share is that different students have different backgrounds of using Photoshop and illustrator. As a beginner of using those digital art apps, I hope our professor could spend more time on teaching us how to use those apps. (But I know it's really hard to manage each student's capability of using these apps before the course, so this may be unfair for students who are already experts in using Ai and Photoshop.)",
                "I can truly say this course is all strengths. Professor Valentine is so caring and thoughtful but also balances this with giving meaningful feedback. The workload is completely manageable but also allows for you to try art across many different mediums. This is such an amazing course to take, especially with Professor Valentine, and I recommend it to anyone! Whether they are an art major or not. If I could think of one improvement, the length of the class was difficult. As it was a studio class it lasted for around three hours which is hard on Zoom, but Professor Valentine helped with this by allowing for a mental break in the middle of class.",
                "I think that giving time for feedback during the beginning of class was helpful and a good way to get some help if we didn't know exactly what we were doing. Plus, we were given a lot of freedom in assignments and just experimenting on our own time, and breaks halfway through the class was helpful and a good break from the screen.",
                "Videos about artists and power-point presentations were informative but lengthy especially due to the Zoom format. The professor was flexible regarding students' creative expression in assignments. All power-points and images shown in class being available on Canvas was very helpful. Assignments' instructions and expectations were made clear in class and Canvas. Every class had critique discussions, which were helpful for getting feedback from professor and classmates on assignments.",
                "The strength of the course is the space we have to create art and then get praise and feedback when presenting your art. Everyone taking this class wants to be there so that is a huge strength and something that made me excited to be in class. There are very few weaknesses in the course. One of them being the limiting format being online making it hard to see the art of other students as often, but I imagine the course being in person would eliminate this issue. Additionally some of the readings were not talked about in class so doing that extra work could be annoying but the content was useful nonetheless.",

                "Yes. Super nice professor, super sweet classmates. This course will help you to think creatively, explore new medias of doing art, and have eyes that would appreciate artistic things.",
                "Absolutely! This is the perfect course for someone with a lot or very little experience in art. You learn the foundations early in the course along with some art theory and history, but it truly is an opportunity to experiment with your own style and build your portfolio. It is a low workload, but if you want to use it to grow you can make as much art as you want and the Professor is great at providing feedback. Very straightforward and an overall awesome class.",
                "Yes, but then again it is also a prereq for art majors. If you like talking about art, especially art made by you or your peers, I think it would be a good class to take while also learning about other artists.",
                "Yes, it is required for the art and computing and the arts majors. It is a overall introduction to important concepts in art.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to students finding a low entry course that explores concepts of art.",
