                "I became a stronger writer and learned how to better conduct literary analysis. This was my first English class at Yale, and it was absolutely excellent.",
                "I learned so much in Professor Homans class! My writing greatly improved  being allowed to submit a second draft really allowed me to focus on my weaknesses and to learn what to do better for next time. I feel that Im leaving this class with a wonderful overall understanding of the course of American literature!",
                "I got better at looking at connections between texts, I became a better\/clearer essay writer, and became better at figuring out what to say and what not to say in discussion. I also really enjoyed, while in this course, thinking about the different ways that the arc of American literature can be constructed  this, I believe, both because our Professor intended it to be so and because students in the class had great criticisms about the state of the Yale English department and specifically the syllabus of 127 (specifically its continued emphasis on white, largely male, authors).",
                "I became a much stronger writer, reader, and thinker by taking ENGL 127. The seminar environment was led by the students and small group discussions and there was an emphasis on drawing upon connections between texts. We discussed different conceptions of \"America\", voice, and nation building with an intentional focus on texts that represented a wide array of voices, languages, and experiences within America. We discussed close reading and how to compare between texts\/authors\/times and also how to use research and theory in writing about a text. The early focus on close reading provided a strong foundation to build upon as the course progressed. There were also chances to revise and improve upon essays which, though difficult, allowed me to walk away feeling much better about the work I produced. ENGL 127 really affirmed the importance of the revision process to me and I am grateful for that experience.",
                "As an English major and this being my third foundational course, I wouldn't say I gained any mind-blowing insights from this course. I did enjoy the reading list for the most part and learned for example a lot about the American genocide of Native Americans through reading Sa's American Indian Stories."

                "Strengths: Homan's feedback on essays is really good. She doesn't scrutinize your work but points out key argumental and structural and smaller point changes you can make, and I loved that we had the opportunity to revise. I think that was really encouraging of growing as a writer and refining your work. She is does prefer more open intros instead of the nailed down specific thesis so that can be different. She was always very kind on deadlines and generally nice to talk to in office hours. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: our table was very long and we had masks on and margaret homans voice is very gentle. she also i think talked longer than necessary and had trouble understanding the ideas we communicated. i think while we had active discussions, their values were fairly low to me. i think talking more in small groups which we did sometimes would be very fruitful and i think also having books feel like they're being chosen for the nuanced work their doing and not mainly as a survey of different ethnicities would be nice. i think that homans is thinking about taking off moby dick and i think that's a good idea since while there can be powerful messsages in moby dick, i think it's just not the best structure for that.",
                "I really loved everything about this class. Professor Homans was wonderful.",
                "I LOVED this course. It was the perfect balance of learning to analyze literature and to think, and learning the concrete history of American literature. I find that often English classes struggle to find that good in between - and this Professor Homans manages to find the perfect balance.",
                "The course had a good list of readings, though I agree with others in the course that the treatment we gave white vs non-white authors was not equal. I enjoyed discussion, but, because many did not complete the readings for class (especially when it came to Moby Dick), sometimes these were lacking. I also think Professor Homans did, at times, not take up or fully allow us to work our way to the end of a discussion thread brought up by a student. And that this sometimes resulted in missed opportunities for a more fruitful discussion. I think allowing students to answer to each other  for the discussion to be more round-table than a back-and-forth between professor and student, professor and student  would help with this.\r\nAll this said, I think Professor Homans brought up some incredibly important themes for us to consider, and I felt, as we approached the different readings and topics, the amount of thought she'd devoted to her syllabus and discussion plans. \r\nA major, major strength of the class was that Professor Homans showed a willingness to work with us on each of our essays like none I've ever seen in another professor. One reason for this was the draft\/final system for papers (which I had not had in a class before, but which I now firmly believe is the absolute best way to structure a writing class. There's no doubt i got so much more out of every essay assignment this way than i would have if we'd only been able to submit one draft per assignment). But Professor Homans offered incredibly detailed, clear, and HELPFUL critiques on each of my essay. I could tell she had truly taken the time to step inside and think about my essays from the inside. I know from speaking to others in the class that they were also thoroughly touched and impressed by this attention of hers.",
                "Strengths: Professor Homans was incredibly devoted to each student and provided ample support and feedback. I felt challenged as a writer and thinker by the feedback I received and I really appreciated the opportunities for growth Professor Homans created. The expansiveness of the syllabus and early focus on close reading skills. The array of texts we read introduced many different conceptions not only of America, but of the role of writing and how we think about writing as an act of protection, survivance, healing, and more. The small group discussions also were a strength of the course as they allowed me to get to know my peers better (and we even had writing sessions after class together). Office hours with Professor Homans were incredibly helpful in developing my writing, the way I organize my work, and my essays. \r\nWeaknesses: At times class discussions felt slow, but this was likely the result not of the readings and more so to do with the roller coaster of spring semester being on zoom then in person.",
                "We talked about this as a class but I think the reading list\/syllabus could be tightened to have a more clear prerogative. The first half of the course felt jammed pack with \"classics\" and the second half felt like diversity pickings. As a result the lens with which we analyzed each work felt different. (I personally think we should have read each piece with a close readings lens rather than thematic which happened in the latter half at times.) On the other hand, I did feel really engaged with the course due to Prof. Homans openness. I also enjoyed how Prof. Homans often encouraged us to discuss in small groups before having a large group discussion. I felt our class really bonded by the end, and I made several friends through class which doesn't always happen."

                "If you are required to take this course for engl, yeah take it but maybe with another professor. Don't take it with michael warner tho he's kinda racist. I think as a white woman, margaret homans tries to be a BIPOC ally but there's things she just doesn't understand fully and it's hard sometimes to communicate and understand. I think in general, this is a failing of the English department as a whole. So they try to introduce \"diverse\" works but there's not always the background or knowledge or understand and it can feel like a reproduction of marginalization when marginalized authors featured primarily for their marginalization writing about their marginalization are marginalized to a short periods of time in the class. I'd rather sink into a work for a little longer. I want to feeel like the teacher really loves this work and sees it not only as speaking to marginalization but also speaking to the nuanced other aspects it features. again tho, her feedback and kindness and general anti-stress vibes are really lovely, and she does care about her students deeply.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Its a great introduction to American Literature, and Professor Homans is by far one of my favorite professors Ive gotten to take a class with at Yale.",
                "Absolutely! I learned so much. This course showed me that I do want to be an English major.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to someone looking a survey of American Literature. We cover a great breadth of material, and Professor Homans is a dedicated, conscientious, and very kind professor.",
                "yes",
                "Yes!! Especially with Professor Homans -- I felt challenged and supported in class and out of class with my paper writing. My ability to build an argument, write, and question my own writing became much stronger. The class structure was such that English majors and non-English majors could all participate and felt comfortable participating which is a testament to Professor Homans' teaching and to the variety of texts we read from Dickinson's poems to Zitkala-a's text. The reading load was also not too heavy and it felt manageable to complete the readings alongside 4 other classes.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Prof. Homans was the most understanding during this tumultuous COVID-19 filled semester, which is really important as the University aims to reclaim this botched sense of normalcy. In general, I think the foundational courses within the English department are really strong, so if a student is interested in reading novels without a hyper specific focus, this is a great course to take. The foundational courses also tend to have students in all 4 grades which is nice because everyone brings a unique perspective to the classroom."
