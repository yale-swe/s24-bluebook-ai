                "By taking this course, I developed a broader understanding of the Spanish language as a whole. After only one semester, I find myself able to keep up fairly well when conversing in Spanish and when watching television shows in Spanish. Further, I now have a deeper appreciation of how diverse Spanish speaking communities are. I found it fascinating how culture varies from country to country and I loved learning about different cultural traditions."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: You will be able to somewhat read, talk, and listen with Spanish.\r\nWeakness: Way too much work. The instructions in exams are in Spanish. The entire course is taught in Spanish, so if you don't have any experience with Spanish, you'll find it difficult to adjust. Cold-calls during class. You have to learn everything through VHL Central, which makes classes a time to \"review\" the material in Spanish.",
                "Strengths: It is taught in Spanish so that allows you to progress quite quickly and it is every day (minus one of online work a week), you also learn a lot of Spanish during this single semester. Weakness: It's a pretty big time commitment so you do have to be motivated to put in the effort, it is also taught in Spanish so it takes a bit of an adjustment period to feel more comfortable.",
                "There was a lot of work every day which was understandable because a lot of work is needed to learn a new language. But sometimes it felt excessive. \r\nMaking students pay for Linguameeting was not right in my opinion. Students are already required to purchase the textbook and VHL code. I spent more than $200 on this class compared to the grand total of $0 that I spent on my other 3 classes.",
                "Overall, I think the course is effective at teaching students Spanish. I enjoyed the lingua meetings because I felt like they were a good way to practice speaking while being exposed to different accents. I also liked the size of the class because it fostered the development of close relationships to peers, thus making it so that I felt more comfortable speaking with them. The break day is a really good addition but I think that it could be potentially more refreshing on a Friday. I understand that immersion is the quickest way to learn, however I think that we jumped too quick into it and I often found myself lost in class. I think the incorporation of more English into the class (specifically on test directions) would help students understand more of what is being asked of them. And, while it might seem elementary, I think that rhymes or songs really help in learning conjugations, irregular verbs, etc. so the incorporation of that into the class could be beneficial as well."

                "Yes. I enjoyed my time in this class, and I think that for people unsure about where they want to get their language credit, Spanish is definitely a good option, and Prof Vazquez is a good teacher.",
                "Yes if you have already learned Spanish is high school. If you haven't, beware this class is tough.",
                "I would recommend this course if you want to learn Spanish, because you definitely will!",
                "Yes. Even though the class is hard my Spanish has gotten much better.",
                "Yes. For students who want to learn Spanish.",
                "Yes I recommend this course. The workload is intense but that will be the same with all language courses. Spanish is undoubtedly the most important language to learn while living in America and you will be able to retain it better because there are so many Spanish speakers in the United States."
