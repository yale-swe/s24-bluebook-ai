                "Strengths: The professor/TF team is amazing for this class, and are very engaged with their students and dedicated to helping them grow and learn. The class has a lot of work, but that often means that there is less pressure on the big assignments (like unit tests and oral exams). The material is often organized/explained in a way that facilitates learning. Weaknesses: as mentioned before, this class is a LOT of work (reflected in it being 1.5 credits). Also, there is just a lot of material worked in, so there is a constant need to study and memorize. Additionally, with many of the assignments being on canvas, there is a lot of grade fluctuation and technical issues, which are always corrected, but just are a bit annoying and often take a bit to get sorted out.",
                "Julia is an amazing professor and the content is very interesting as you are constantly learning new skills and techniques.  You get from the course what you put into it - the only weaknesses could be from your own lack of effort or attention.",
                "very interactive and engaging, must be involved in class to get anything out of it.",
                "Strengths: Julia is an amazing teacher, the pace is fast but reasonable, the course is very well-organized\r\nWeaknesses: the daily canvas assignments could be reworked to be less rote and more contextualizedfewer questions like conjugate this verb and more exercises about conjugating verbs in a given sentence, for instance. The translation exercises should not be word-by-word but sentence-by-sentence.",
                "Strengths: The course is super clearly and efficiently instructed, students feel very supported by the professor and the TF's, there is a routine pattern of homework, quizzes, and tests, the course develops a class into a close-knit group of students because of the special context of learning a new language and because of the frequency of class meetings. Also, the class never feels like only a recitation and memorization of grammar rules- there is always some element of joy, art, or humor that accompanies the learning of a new topic.\r\nWeaknesses: Can't think of any, other than the shortening of the time to learn an entire new unit was a little overwhelming at the end of the year. It was a little disorienting to have a quiz, an Oral midterm, and a Unit test in the same week after having a lot more space to absorb and practice the content."

Obviously, if you are not planning on continuing your study, it is probably not a great use of your time and energy (as it takes a lot of it!).",
                "I would most definitely recommend it.  It is the best language program taught by the best professor.  Not much more you can ask for.",
                "if you want to learn russian, yes",
                "If you want to learn Russian, you should take the Russian sequence. Its great.",
                "Yes, I definitely would! Learning a new language is such a joyful and rewarding experience. Russian, especially at this time of global tension and fear, is particularly important and meaningful to learn. So many wonderful art, music, and writing is associated with Russian culture and to learn the language is to have doors opened to the culture of a country. It is also fascinating to adjust your perspective towards words, meaning, and grammar, through the learning of another language. If you take this class however, you must be prepared to immerse yourself in the work and learning as much as possible."
