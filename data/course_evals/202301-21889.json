                "I learned about global tectonics including plate tectonics, and plate boundaries (divergent, convergent, and, transform). I learned about ophiolites, some different types of rocks\/minerals, subduction zones, and generally how geology broadly impacts the planet. There was a course field trip to Oman, which was truly one of the highlights of my time at Yale. This experience was extremely valuable to my learning, as I was able to apply concepts learned in the classroom to the field; it completely changed my perspective of how I view the planet and its impacts on everyday life.",

Writing weekly summaries of what we learned also made me better take in everything we learned in class.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths were the field trip, which really helped further my understanding of the content. The lectures were both a strength and a weakness--when Mark was focused, the lectures were great and informative, but he tended to get distracted easily and diverge from the subject matter. The weekly summaries were a strength and forced me to keep up with the course's content without being stressful. The midterm was a bit subjective and required some understanding of Mark's personality to decode. \r\n\r\nA major weakness was that the class was so large and that there were so many non-majors accepted into it. As an EPS major, I felt that we never got into the content in-depth enough because Mark had to teach at a level that was accessible to non-majors. He waived the prereq requirement of Dynamic Earth, which resulted in a lot of people in the class who had no geo background since they wanted to go on the field trip. It was great to meet them, but incredibly frustrating that the course was filled with students who didn't care about the content and that the course lacked depth as a result.",
                "Strengths: there was a free trip to Oman!!! (though not sure that happens every year)\r\nWeaknesses: very disorganized Professor. We barely got through half the syllabus, and he changed the course structure after shopping period had ended (he suddenly decided to assign p-sets)",
                "The grading was very opaque and arbitrary. The syllabus mentioned a final paper, which never materialized, and the midterm was about 2 weeks before the final. I think these organizational issues need to be addressed. But the class itself was pretty good, I'd say.",
                "Professor Mark Brandon is a strength of this course. He's extremely fun, knowledgeable, and willing to have a good time. He will be able to explain any concept in a way that's digestible regardless of your geology background. This course is pretty disorganized. We didn't get through a lot of the anticipated material, so it may be better to stick to the schedule a bit tighter in the future; however, I learned a lot about a lot of different things in the world of earth sciences.",
                "Class is generally organized but sometimes unclear with expectations. Professor Brandon is a good lecturer; sometimes analogies are a little confusing, but the material covered matches well with exams and homework. Weekly summary assignments are not laborious at all but very good at ensuring knowledge is retained.\r\n\r\nThe absolute highlight of the course is the field trip, which aligns with course material very well and provides a once in a lifetime view of both geology and culture of an area. Single-handedly makes this course one of the best Ive taken.",
                "This course is somewhat disorganized. We were not able to cover all of the course's material because of spending a lot of time on the first two semester concepts. This did mean we were able to go into more depth on topics such as oceanic lithosphere but meant we missed out on other topics. The course concepts were very interesting, and the professor created an atmosphere where I felt comfortable asking questions.",
                "The course needs to have prerequisites enforced. There is simply too much time wasted on material covered in Dynamic Earth. This is my greatest frustration with the course. It is a middle-level geology class that should not host people with no background who just want a free trip. Otherwise, the textbook was great and the weekly summaries really helped cement my knowledge of the material. Mark Brandon is a force of nature, take that as you will.",
                "the course teaches material to a group of students with varying backgrounds in earth sciences, which does make it difficult at times to figure out how to pace the class. also, figuring out what material would be tested on was at times difficult. of course, the spring break field trip was a highlight of the class, as we were able to see concepts discussed in class in person",
                "It felt like the course wasnt sure what audience it was for, which frustrated both people with no background in the area and majors who were required to take the class. More clarity on that would help",
                "Unpopular take, but I actually thought the weekly summaries were a great learning component of this course. Having to compile a summary of the material each week ensured that I was prepared when exams rolled around and ensured that I stayed on top of everything I was expected to know. I think the course could be improved by speeding up the pace a bit, however. There was a solid chunk of material I was excited to learn that we did not end up making it too, so that was a little sad. The greatest strength of this course is undoubtedly Mark Brandon, who is just generally awesome.",
                "Weakness: could be more organized\r\nStrength: everything else",
                "Mark is very engaging and cares deeply about his students. He's quite entertaining and tries his best to make large-scale, eons-long processes understandable to even non-EPS students. I appreciated the breadth of topics we covered. The field trip to Oman was also spectacular and one of my highlights at Yale.\r\n\r\nI felt like it was sometimes hard to know exactly what we should take out of some of the content we learned, especially when Mark would answer questions people had throughout the week. That said I really appreciated how responsive he was to students' interests and inquiries.",
                "Strengths: the field trip to Oman was amazing, Mark is an engaging lecturer and tries his best to explain concepts in an easy-to-understand way for majors and non-majors alike.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the course had slightly more structure (i.e. we actually cover what we're supposed to cover, it's clear what we're supposed to know for each unit, etc.). Sometimes I feel like we would get caught up in one concept and randomly decide to spend the whole class on it.",
                "The field trip was awesome!",
                "Mark is a great lecturer and the content may be repetitive if you have taken eps courses before but it was sufficiently challenging for a non eps major to be engaging. The trip is also a huge pro. Oman was amazing",
                "Strengths: does a good job pounding home the simple concepts involved in plate tectonics. The subject matter was interesting. The field trip was awesome.\r\nWeaknesses: very poorly taught and organized. There were only about 2 lectures the whole semester where I left the room thinking to myself, \"that was a good\/interesting lecture.\" The professor was not thorough or precise in teaching the concepts. We only got through about 5\/8 of the material that we were supposed to cover in the semester, leaving me feeling like I was missing a lot of information that I would have hoped to get out of the class. The professor would harp on a few very simple platitudes over and over again in successive classes and seldom got into the more intricate details that would be helpful to learn more comprehensively and quantitatively about plate tectonics. There were not clear expectations laid out for what would be on the tests. Frustratingly, the grading was quite hectic and I think very poorly reflected the effort that people put into the class and the grasp that people had on the concepts at hand - it seemed quite easy for people who sucked at the subject matter and\/or who didn't put much effort in the class to still get a good grade just by being lucky by virtue of having a generous grader or by having the few things that were tested on on their cheat sheet, while people who tried hard and had a solid understanding of concepts in tectonics could easily not do well because missing just one or a few things on your cheat sheet, or a tiny careless error, could lead to disastrous consequences in one's grade. Also, the TAs were not very helpful. Also, Mark was not always very responsive over email.",
                "Disorganized, only covered half of the material. I think it would have been better if pre-reqs were required. Exams felt both more in depth that content covered in class as well as testing on trivial concepts. A balance in between would have been appreciated\/more info about the format\/content of the midterm.\r\n\r\nWeekly summaries were not very helpful. Would benefit from more engaging weekly activity. Perhaps a guided summary?\r\n\r\nFun class to listen to, field trip was incredible.",
                "Strengths - Mark Brandon is very knowledgeable and can answer any question in depth, the field trip during spring break helped contextualize a lot of what we were learning\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - professor goes on lots of off-topic tangents, we didn't cover all the course material, the class moves very slow, and the reading was not at the same level of difficulty as the course material but wasn't clearly explained"

                "I think so, but only if you're not worried about your GPA, as the grading is very arbitrary (which could end up being a good thing, or could end up being a bad thing). You wouldn't necessarily guess it from lecture because Mark isn't a gifted public speaker, but he's actually brilliant. Try to talk with him one on one if you can. The lectures are sometimes confusing or slow, but in general the course was fun and the material is really pretty interesting. If the spring break trip is still happening, definitely go!",
                "YES! This was easily one of the most fun classes I've taken at Yale. It's not extremely easy to do well in the class with no geology background if you're taking this as a Sc credit; however, the class is SO WORTHWHILE!!! Please take this class! I had the most incredible time on the trip and learned a lot of valuable information about global tectonics.",
                "Absolutely, even for non geologic backgrounds. Gives a good understanding of the largest scale processes (both time and space) affecting the solid Earth. Field trip compiles it all into an incredibly informative and fun journey abroad.",

                "I would recommend it if you have a reasonable background in geology. It is not easy to understand some of these concepts if you have no background. Otherwise, it's an interesting course that has caused me to see the world in a new way, which is always a great feeling.",

                "Mark Brandon is a very approachable and un-intimidating professor. This class was an introduction to tectonics (I didnt need the dynamic earth prereq). We had weekly 1-2 page summaries, 2 psets, a midterm, and a final. From the perspective of a non-EPS major, the workload and content are not too bad but some ideas can take a little bit of a bit to piece together conceptually and wrap your head around. Also, the class trip was a true highlight of this class and my time at Yale!",
                "Probably not. We didnt get through a lot of material and lectures could be really frustrating to sit through because the professor often went off subject or was hard to follow",
                "Yes! You will cover interesting material that is very hard to find anywhere else, including on the internet. If you want to understand why the surface of our planet looks the way it does, Global Tectonics is a great class for you. There is also no substitute for the type of field excursion I got the chance to participate in by taking this class. So many of the coolest research and field opportunities are (understandably) reserved for people advanced in their respective fields, but I got to go to Oman to study geology as a history major. How cool is that? This is the sort of course that should be ubiquitous at Yale.",
                "Professor Brandon did not cover as much content as we set out to cover (maybe only half) and we had two midterms. I've learned a good amount in this course regarding tectonic plates and the different parts of our interior. Professor Brandon is very much a \"dad\" lecturer, who likes to make somewhat odd references to make you understand the interior of the Earth, but he's great overall aside from some tangents! We also went on a field trip to Oman as a part of this class, and that was awesome and exciting!",
                "I would strongly recommend the course. The field trip was amazing(!), the info you learn you can use to understand earthquakes, why land around you came to be, rocks as you walk around, etc. The weekly summaries made it a good amount of work for me (although others could crank them out in 15m), but it was quite rewarding.",
