Although the term \"Southeast Asia\" itself is constructed terminology, I learned that \"Southeast Asia\" is very much real in the minds of both scholars working in the region and local governments interacting with one another. Consistent writing exercises throughout the course also helped to sharpen my analytical thinking skills and have made me a better writer.",

Primarily through readings and in-class discussions, we learned about the history of \"Southeast Asia\" itself as a conceptual region, tangible elements such as geography and environment as well as the urban landscape, ideas and expressions of \"tradition\" and how they interact with ideas and expressions of \"modernity,\" history, politics, migration, music, and many more aspects of life and society. Delving into such a wide and rich area of study, I learned more about the complexity of Southeast Asia and how numerous perspectives can be used to  create a fuller picture of subjects large and small.",

                "Strengths: AMAZING professor and TF Jill Tan who created an incredibly warm and supportive community one of the best I've been in during these two zoom semesters. Generally manageable reading, especially after Prof. Harms's disclaimer at the start of the semester about his expectations of how deeply he wanted us to read each text (approx. 45 minutes per text, for about 3 texts per lessons). I also really enjoyed the the collaborative way peers, our TF, and our professor worked together to build on ideas or make references to other ideas\/case studies\/texts that could be useful if you were particularly interested in a specific topic. Weaknesses: while the inclusiveness of Prof. Harms's admission into the seminar built a very diverse group of students, the class felt a bit big sometimes and it could be hard to feel engaged in discussions if certain days were dominated by specific students or texts. Perhaps if there wasn't a professor preference for which text to begin with, students could provide input the night before class on the texts they're interested in so the discussion can be more balanced!",
                "The course is very interesting and Prof. Harms always takes student concerns into account. It has a great organizational structure. I do wish we spent more time on some lesser known countries.",
                "One strength of the course was the wide selection of readings that examined a particular trend or historical process through a specific country case example. Perhaps one thing that could be improved would be to include more readings on the countries that had less attention. For example, except for the week where our class discussed the Rohingya crisis and the Cambodian Genocide, I did not notice any other readings on Myanmar or Cambodia in any of the other weeks. I also would have liked to have been exposed to more readings on Laos and Timor Leste. \r\n\r\nAnother strength of the course was that the \"mini lecture then discussion\" format of the course allowed for active student participation. \r\n\r\nPerhaps another area of improvement would be considering how the regions of \"East Asia\" and \"South Asia\" have interacted and continue to engage with what we call \"Southeast Asia.\" This could be especially salient in how either of those two aforementioned regions have contributed to Southeast Asian modernity. Maybe these connections were implied in some of the readings, but perhaps they could have been made more explicit.",
                "Professor Harms and TA Jill Tan were both fantastic! God bless them.",
                "Strengths: managable workload, engaging discussions, amazing professor\/TA\/classmates and the course was well-structured.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We got to sample one aspect of Southeast Asia each week, so we learned many things about Southeast Asia (culture, kinship, religions, etc) over the semester. However, we did not have the time to study one topic in-depth and look into smaller countries in Southeast Asia such as East Timor and Brunei.",
                "The main strengths of the course were its varied approaches to subject matter, often using sources which seemed very specific or idiosyncratic to draw out really interesting ideas and information, and its focus on student discussion of readings. Course assignments were also well designed to promote further exploration, and didn't feel stressful or arbitrary. A potential weakness of the course was that the balance between student discussion and lecture occasionally felt like it underemphasized the latter. Some readings could also be especially heavy for certain weeks, without much corresponding time spent on them in class. I think that a more regular period of time could be given to structured lectures, and that more choice could be introduced into the weekly readings.",
                "Very engaging and supportive professors, could have more engaging material during seminars",
                "I loved everything about the course. Perhaps the strongest part of the course was the knowledge shared between the Professor and the TA, and their ability to 'read the room' and gauge student engagement and adjust accordingly. By doing this, it seemed that the class was able to invest more into the material provided."

Scheduling virtual office hours was also very easy and accessible in comparison to other classes. In terms of things to be improved, perhaps Prof. Harms could share his presentations or lecture notes for the more Leminar style classes at the start because it could feel a bit like drinking from a fire hose at times.",

                "I thought that the modifications of the class throughout the term was beneficial, and Prof. Harms really showed how much he cares about the wellbeing of his students by doing this. We still managed to learn a lot during the class, showing that you don't need to read a book a week to start learning about modernization in the Global South.",
                "The use of breakout rooms in the class to help further student discussions worked well, and could have been expanded upon even further. I think that more time could also be spent using virtual activities and breakout rooms to build a stronger sense of connection between students, getting to know each other more personally outside of reading discussions. Screen sharing technology was also used well in this course to share videos and other material, something which I think could also be expanded upon so long as the technology enables it to be done smoothly without lag or distortion.",
                "Because of the small class size, this was one of the most engaging classes I took this semester. I really enjoyed the range of mediums used to warm us up to begin the class, from the google earth exercises to the music videos we got to choose and watch. No real complaints since both the Prof. and the TA were so responsive and willing to meet in the case that problems inherit in online learning (difficulty speaking up in class for example), to explain or help."

Honestly, getting to learn under Prof. Harms and within the student community he creates makes the entire class worth it. You really feel excited to be a scholar, often times reading people who are doing amazing work right now (sometimes even at Yale!). This class was the first time I really felt like I had an academic home at Yale, even though the pandemic semester really put a damper on things. I will be returning to many of the texts that we read in the future, which is definitely a testament to the quality of the syllabus and discussions we had.",

Given the extended history of contact too with other adjacent regions like South Asia and East Asia, Southeast Asia is a useful region to examine overarching themes and\/or other historical trends.",

It's a great course with fascinating insights into Southeast Asian society, culture, and life at various different levels. Its focus on the interplay between \"tradition\" and \"modernity\" makes it all the more relevant to understanding the human experience in general. I would go into this course with an open mind and a readiness and excitement to learn about and to begin to explore a variety of people and places in all their complexity and depth.",

The students who fall into this class are also super interesting and have so much to teach you as well. Secondly, the online application of this class was done beautifully, with so much care and intention put into it. In times of COVID-19, that part was super important since it provided a space that not only nurtured learning, but also felt like a community.",
