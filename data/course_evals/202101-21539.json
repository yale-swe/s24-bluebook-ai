                "This course isn't meant for zoom... The content is already quite dry so focusing through zoom is even more of a challenge. Also, Professor Moncrief's transition to prewritten notes lets him speed though the content (since he doesn't have to write on the chalkboard), and often he gives you example problems but since they're prewritten instead of going over what he did he just kinda gives you the option to look things over more thoroughly later (and since everything's online there was less incentive to ask him to slow down). I really wish we could've done hands on work in this class, the later p-sets get quite complex and with no in class practice it often felt like I was grasping at straws.\r\n\r\n...also Moncrief's handwriting can be difficult to read",

                "I guess. I'll be frank, its a dry\/ pretty boring course. At the beginning its quite easy but it gets a lot more complex\/ tedious later on in the course (especially if its you're first time dealing with matrices). This was definitely the course I needed the most outside material to understand, lectures are pretty dull (as will evident when class attendance starts to wane) and the text book is thorough, but seems unnecessarily confusing once you know what you're doing. There's also no peer tutors so you're on your own if you don't know others in the class. that being said Moncrief is (surprisingly?) chill, he's really good at responding to emails and always gives off the impression that he willing to help you with anything. But overall, the class is still pretty boring and I think a lot of differential calculus is too arbitrary to really have much intuition for (in the sense that there'll be no logic the way the formulas you get in class other were developed than some guy stared at the problem for a long time and took a hella good guess). As a result, it doesn't really feel like you learn much? You DO a lot, but I've no idea the actual applications or scenarios I'd actually want to use half the stuff we learned... I'd say only take it if you need to for some reason or if you have a kink for doing page long calculations...\r\n\r\nSide-note: taking concurrently with linear algebra (MATH225) can be quite fruitful. By the time the stuff involving linear algebra comes, you'll have leaned enough from MATH225 to understand some of the basic theory. The more complex stuff will probably go over you're head but since this isn't a proof based class you only really need the calculations. However, the linear algebra related calculations done in this class are some of the more annoying calculations you'll encounter in MATH225 (which doesn't focus much on the computation). Encountering them in both classes gives you good practice and basically does the studying for you.",
