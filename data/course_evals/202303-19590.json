                "Sometimes the readings were a little heavylike many once-a-week seminars at Yale, there's just not enough time to cover everything you read. But I wouldn't necessarily have cut any of the content because it really gave us a big picture of the field of Asian diasporas. We also went on a really cool field trip at the start of the semester that brought us all closer. By the end, I left the class with a lot of new friends, and I think this can mostly be attributed to the positive environment that Professor Tran fosters in her classroom.",
                "Strengths: Professor Tran is an amazing instructor. For me, I was not as interested in the global aspect of Asian diasporas. We spent a lot of time talking about Asian coolie laborers and theory, so it was not as engaging for me as I hoped, but the class was still enjoyable.",
                "Strengths: readings were well organized and very insightful, discussions were thought-provoking and helpful in understanding the concept of diaspora \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some weeks, the readings were extremely long and difficult to understand",
                "Strengths were the readings and Professor Tran\r\nWeakness were the seminar discussions - I often left class feeling like I did not really gain much from the discussions nor did they really feel entirely productive",

                "If you're interested in the history of Asia and theory like Lisa Lowe and are okay studying global context, then take the class! I think intro to critical refugee studies probably would have been a more enjoyable class that's tailored to my interests, but I still was able to explore my passions through this class!",
                "Yes, Prof Tran is amazing at synthesizing discussion comments and providing powerful insight into the readings! This class was truly amazing and we grew extremely close as a class because we had field trips to exhibitions and our final projects were deeply personal. I would recommend any class with Prof Tram, especially this one!",
                "Yes. I literally cannot recommend this class more highly. It could be the best class I've taken here and Prof Tran is the most amazing, caring professor ever. If you get the chance to take this class, do it.",
                "Yes, but if you're willing to really do the readings and work to understand how they are connected. Prof. Tran has curated a fantastic list of readings.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Tran is a fantastic instructor, and I learned a lot from the readings and assignments. I appreciated that the focus of the class was not solely on Asian migrants in the United States, which allowed for a more expansive and critical understanding of the term \"Asian diaspora.\" The trip at the beginning of the semester really set the tone for the course; this was a class filled with joy, laughter, and meaningful connection. This course was well worth the early morning trek to HQ!"
