    "I learned the theory and proofs behind statistics.",
    "I honestly couldn't tell you what I've learned.",
    "I gained a solid basis of understanding for general probability concepts.

    "I learned a lot during my tenure in Probability theory. This included Bayesian statistics, central limit theorem, etc.",
    "I developed a basic knowledge of probability theory.",
    "I learned about the basics of probability theory, key axioms and stuff like that. Didn't feel I got a great conceptual understanding of what probability is and and what a distribution actually is though. More like a bunch of corollary axioms I used to find things out. This is perhaps because I wasn't super engaged in the course though, but I do feel like there is too much focus on peripheral uses of the concepts and not on the concepts themselves.",

I personally enjoyed Professor Lin's course more. I thought Professor Lin's problems sets were more aligned to the class learning and I found the class better organized as a whole. \r\n\r\nI personally did not often attend lecture (which Prof. Lin does not require); however, I always read the book and went to his office hours, which I found helped me learn the main concepts.",

We then learned about several discrete distributions like binomial, geometric, etc and their PMFs and CDFs. Next we studied more continuous random variables and distributions like the uniform, normal etc. and their PDFs and CDFs. We learned a little about MGFs and how to derive those as well. Near the end of the semester, we covered how to calculate the PDF and expectation of joint distributions and more to test our understanding of how these distributions affect one another.",
    "I learned some basic rules of probability (LOTP, Bayes, et.), introductory concepts (PDF, expectation, variance, etc.), and important distributions (Poisson, Normal, Uniform, etc.).

    "Basic probably skills",
    "Concepts, formulas, and proofs of combinatorics, conditional probability, both discrete and continuous variables and various distributions. We also covered moment generating functions, expectation and variance, joint distributions, transformations, inequalities and limit theorems, like the WLLN and CLT.",
    "Probability theory, all the fundamentals that people say are necessary to advance in statistics.\r\n\r\nAs Professor Lin said, we learned a lot in this course that will be necessary for probability but did we learn anything that is applicable to the real world? No.",

    "Discrete and Continuous Random Variable probabilities, Joint PDFs, expectation and variance.",
    "I learned the basics of probability theory in this course, which includes definitions of probability, conditional probability, different distributions, and other important information mentioned in the syllabus. I also gained experience applying these topics through the weekly problem sets.",
    "I learned how to think in terms of proofs, which was a completely new concept to me. I also learned how to approach probability questions. But more importantly, I gleaned that statistics and probability probably wasn't my strong suit so I decided to credit d\/f the class.",

    "Discrete, continuous prob, all the different distributions, focus is on theory obviously",
    "I learned the foundations of probability, including discrete and continuous random variables, moment generating functions, and expected value calculations.",
    "Learned many of the theoretical bases behind processes you learn and take for granted in intro stats courses. Tried to learn how to write proofs.",
    "The course followed a great textbook that, unlike many STEM textbooks, wasn't overly dense. The textbook got me into the habit of actually reading textbooks again. I was taking quantum mechanics alongside this course, so there was a lot of overlap in notation and concepts.",
    "Coming into the course with a more analytical statistics background (AP Statistics), I learned a decent amount about the technical theory of conditional probability, random variables (discrete and continuous), expectation and variance, moment generating functions, joint distributions, transformations, and limit theorems. I generally learned how to apply statistical concepts to technical problem solving, though we only worked with toy examples (so not very applied). However, this theoretical backing should serve as a strong foundation for further courses.",
    "I learned a lot of topics in statistics. I'm not sure how useful it will turn out to be, but it felt substantial."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is well-organized and Professor Lin does a good job teaching it, but the material is inherently very dry. Don't expect to be thrilled during every lecture.",
    "I would like to see how the distributions are used more realistic situations.",
    "The office hours are incredibly helpful, and Winston makes it clear the first day that if you can't make it to class everyday, you can still do very well in the course. One weakness would be that lectures were a bit boring at times. I feel like we spent too much time on intuitive topics and not enough time on the most confusing topics.",
    "Winston made this course harder because he got in trouble last time he taught for making it too easy. Well, now the class is too hard.",
    "Strengths: Professor Lin is an engaging lecturer and very receptive to feedback from his students. He genuinely wants you to do well and tries to make examinations fair. The ULA weekly office hours are very helpful for completing problem sets. Weaknesses: It is obvious that Professor Lin intended to rank up the difficulty of his examinations from his first time teaching the course. However, the lack of practice problems made this change in difficulty nearly impossible to gauge. Additionally, the grading in this class is based 90% on exam performance. This created a large and unhealthy stress culture as the exams approached. Overall a great course, just be prepared.",
    "I would love more helpful lectures and more practice material. The slides really did not help with the psets or exams much.",
    "Dr. Lin is an excellent Professor. He comes to every class prepared with an ample amount of examples to explain a topic. \r\n\r\nThe only disadvantage in the class was the final calculation. Overall, 75 percent of your grade is based on the final, 15 on the midterm, and 10 homeworks. But out of the three criteria, the homework was the most difficult. I spent an average of 9 -12 hours a week on the psets only for it to account for 1\/10 of my grade.",
    "Strengths: the problem sets were a good challenge; they were great practice, and they gave me insight as to what I was expected to know how to do. Winston also made it really easy for students to stay organized. He posted great slides, and his \"news\" document made it very clear what we were expected to learn during each class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the teaching often felt a bit scripted.",
    "The strength of the course is how closely it sticks with the textbook (which is good) and Professor Lin's lecturing. He is a very smart guy, a good teacher, and he clearly cares about the class. I think it could be improved by focusing more on conceptual understandings and less on learning what to integrate when. Felt like I was taught a lot of theorems but not always taught why they worked and how it all tied in to the larger picture of probability theory. Also, this class is at 9 AM and I did not go enough. Lecture is nice, but I didn't go that much so, if that could be changed that'd be great.",
    "The course was filled with fascinating content, but it seemed disparate nearing the end of the semester. This made it hard to keep everything together during the last few weeks. Otherwise, the class was great - lectures were useful, notes were provided, and psets were very useful and approachable.",
    "The course was great overall.",
    "The lecture slides and suggested readings were very helpful. The homework could've been longer.",
    "Strengths: very well organized, thorough announcements and communications on canvas, definitely felt well prepared for the exams, had many resources with peer tutors and office hours to. succeed, grading system for psets and midterms was extremely fair. Weaknesses: some TAs would not give much guidance on the psets but others would essentially give the answers so it would be helpful to make clear guidelines about what role of TAs will be so that we get the same experience from all",
    "The course was structured well to help learning, including engaging lectures and informative slides. It would be helpful to have recordings of the lectures in the future.",
    "I thought Winston was a great professor although the timing of the course (9am) was so early such that the vast majority of students didnt attend.",
    "The course does not have many assessments (1 midterm, 1 final, 10 psets), which is both a strength and a weakness. Winston tells us that lectures are not mandatory but it is necessary to be engaged with the course to complete the weekly problem sets and do well on exams; attending lecture should be strongly encouraged. In addition, it is often very confusing what resources you should be studying. The textbook is references frequently, yet the problem sets are not exam-type questions. It would help to have more practice problems and resources to study that are specific to this course's content and exams, rather than relying on the textbook.",
    "I like that the course was structured in a way such that going to class was optional and it was pretty easy to teach yourself the material from the textbook, independently. The ULAs were also super helpful!",
    "The problem sets where very time consuming and challenging, but were worth only 10% of the grade. This was very frustrating because I felt like I put a lot of time and effort into them, but it didn't help my grade at all.",
    "This course could have most definitely used an extra section each week. The lecture nature of the class was as such that the material still seemed foreign to me when reviewing it, even as a student that attended every lecture. Having a section period each week with a TA would really allow us to internalize the  material, and understand how to use what we learned in application, which I really don't think was taught in the lecture.\r\n\r\nThe Psets were also a big challenge, and required me to go to office hours, because I wouldn't be able to do them otherwise. I really believe that the course would have benefitted greatly from extra resources, office hours, and optional (or mandatory) sections.",
    "Strengths\r\n1. Winston is such a nice, approachable person who cares about the students.\r\n2. The workload is very manageable and there are a lot of office hour that you can go to.\r\n3. Lecture supplemented the textbook + PSETs, so there's a way for a lot of people to learn: visually (textbook), doing things (PSETs), auditory (lectures).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. This is less about the course and more the course content, but I still don't quite understand the intuition behind how to think of a random variable of a random variable and what that even... looks like in real life--so I guess understanding how the concepts we learned apply to real life would be nice, since most of the examples are just random math questions.",
    "strength: lots of structure, opportunities to learn on your own or get help\r\n\r\nweaknesses: as with any STEM class, I couldn't do the homework on my own with just the material and example problems posed in lecture. I had to go to office hours every week for help, which was expected but still a little frustrating when my schedule didn't allow it",
    "Professor was very reasonable, and lectures were very clear, overall I learned a lot. Lectures were slow and sometimes went into more detail than necessary for the exams.",
    "Strengths: Professor Lin is an amazing professor - very sweet and extremely knowledgeable. The office hours were super helpful and the TAs and ULAs went through each and every problem during office hours! There were two grading structures and we receive a grade based onwhichever breakdown gives us the higher grade which was nice! \r\nWeakness: 9ams are very hard to attend :(",
    "With Winston, this class borders on a gut, yet the material is still well-presented and interesting. I'd say it's a pretty good standard intro class.",
    "This course was very abstract, and I feel like it took the meaning out of the material.  I thought that Professor Lin did a great job explaining the abstract material though.",
    "Was kind of slow at times; I wish we covered Markov Chains. But did a pretty good job of introducing me to formal probability. Also, idk who my teaching fellow was.",
    "Professor Lin's slides were pretty helpful in explaining the material that we need to know. However, while I learned how to solve problems with given formulas, I'm not sure if I totally understood everything conceptually. The large class size also made the class impersonal and discouraged a lot of people to attend lectures. However, Professor Lin was really organized and provided materials on Canvas to help us.",
    "Great course.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- Winston Lin is a great professor who legitimately cares about making the content accessible to his students.\r\n- Probability theory, at least for me, was a really fun topic to dig deeper into!\r\n- Not a huge time consuming class while also relatively difficult\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Not enough practice problems for exams\r\n- Office hours are pset reviews; you can't really clear conceptual issues during them\r\n- Too many people in the class",
    "The lectures in this course arent super engaging, but I think the material itself is by nature not very engaging in the first place. Maybe more real world examples or some kind of project might make the course more interesting.",
    "Strengths: Well structured, Prof. Winston is really nice\r\nWeaknesses: Zero incentive to go to class (sometimes just reading the textbook is more efficient), Final Exam was a bit too tricky, in my humble opinion, compared to previous problem sets and practice exams.",
    "I really appreciate Professor Lin making the class as accessible as possible for people who do not show up to lecture. It is nearly impossible to sit through a 75-minute math lecture with several hundred people consisting mostly of dry, theoretical concepts. Not to mention that it was also at 9am. By providing all of his slides from the lectures, he allowed us to go through the material at our own pace. I would encourage the math department to do the same, particularly for these introductory courses. I think it to be so much more efficient to teach ourselves the material when given the proper resources from the instructor coupled with everything else online.",
    "The strengths of the course was how tightly relevant it was to the concepts that I needed to know. The course taught exactly what I needed and expected out of an introductory statistics course, without delving too deeply into obscure topics and not delving deeply enough into common and fundamental topics necessary for the practice of statistics. The course could be improved by offering at a different time -- many of my classmates in the course had trouble making it to lecture and staying engaged, due to how early the course was (although this is by no fault of the professor or teaching instructors, and more due to logistics).",
    "Strengths: Overall not a super difficult course; straightforward; a lot of support from TAs and ULA staff; Winston is a really nice teacher\r\nWeaknesses: The class needs to be more than just \"reading the book.\" Lecture should build on the book.",
    "Course is fine as is, know that the class is quite light for a math course",
    "The teacher, Winston Lin, is amazing. He cares so much about the course and his students. No major weaknesses",
    "Winston is a very good lecturer, and the content is evenly paced enough to understand.",
    "I felt that a huge weakness was that the whole lecture was taken directly from the slides, thus allowing students to justify not going to class. Although, a strength would be the gentle nature of the professor.",
    "I cannot speak to the quality of the lecturer, as I did not attend class past the first week. This class is set up so that it is completely possible to get a good grade without going to class at all. The course notes are detailed and the class is entirely taught out of the textbook, Introduction to Probability by Blitzstein and Hwang. The fact that the course can be taken without coming to class at all is a strength in that the subject material is easy to find and learn alone. It is a weakness in that it is easy for students to not fully engage with the material, and then not perform well when the midterm and the exam come along.",
    "This is a good survey course in random variables and probability theory in general. The fact that it is a huge lecture just decreases the quality of teaching and the level of engagement from students.",
    "Strengths: Essential content that needed to be learnt for the majority of S&DS and Applied Maths majors. Winston was very lenient with grading and let us drop two Pset grades, and there were two different mark schemes that could be applied depending on whether you scored higher on the midterm or the final. Winston's also a big big sweetie and was very nice to all of us. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures could be dry and boring sometimes. Winston made things a little less rigorous and proof-based than I'd like, and at times it was difficult to understand what kinds of formal mathematical objects we were dealing with. In addition, our textbook was probably a little too difficult for the content we were learning and didn't have many exercises at the difficulty we needed it to be to study appropriately for this exam. At times, the amount of remembering of formulas and plug and chugs questions made me feel like I was in high school.",
    "Weakeness lecture is really hard to pay attention to. It does not seem to me like the type of class that should be taught with slides.\r\nYou never get a good intuition for the material, it just kinda appears on a slide and then on homework. \r\nNot that much work tho.",
    "Strengths: I think the problem sets test the main learnings of the course. I also really appreciated that Professor Lin allowed us to bring two study sheets to the final exam. Creating these sheets allowed me to really solidify a lot of my learning from the year. I also really appreciated that Professor Lin created a list of topics to review for the final. This was INCREDIBLY helpful as a gut-check to make sure I knew what topics to go over (even though I know the list was non-exhaustive)\r\n\r\nI really appreciated when Professor Lin solved example problems in class. I found that this best helped me understand the concepts and apply them to the problems sets. I would suggest you continue to do this! I also wonder if there's a way to capture these example problems so that they are in the slides or so that those students who are not in class are also able to refer to them. \r\n\r\nStrength\/Weakness: People in the class have a different prior experience with probability. Professor Lin was very careful to always spend a lot of time explaining a concept in class. This can be a good thing for those exposed to a concept for the first time, however, this is more frustrating for those with more exposure to a topic. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I thought that the problem sets often took quite a bit of time to grade. I know it's a big class, but I found it hard to not have feedback about the midterm material before going into the midterm. I also would appreciate if the PSet questions were more detailed. I appreciate gradescope, but I think it makes it a lot harder to get good feedback.",
    "75 straight minutes starting at 9MA is honestly just such a long time to have to be trying to process some of the concepts and examples presented in this course; I wish lectures were recorded so I could pause and sit with an idea for a second if I needed to.",
    "Strengths: Incredibly helpful and caring Professor, TA accessibility\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class size made it somewhat difficult to concentrate during lecture.",
    "Strength: the homework discussion section is helpful\r\nWeakness: there are simply too many people in the lecture to have any discussion\/feedback.",
    "The lectures are pretty boring. I attended every one and we did in-class exercises probably 5 times. And they were usually not at the same level as the problems on the psets. I think the class would really benefit from more in-class exercises in order to better teach the concepts on the slides.",
    "Strengths: Manages to cover a lot of material in a straightforward, managable way. The weekly problem sets were helpful, there were plenty of office hours, and the exams were fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Could benefit from more review material. We got one practice exam for each exam, but other than that, it was pretty difficult to find additional practice material. The questions in the book tend to be harder than exam questions.",
    "I thought that the class was good -- I definitely learned a lot. In terms of weaknesses, I thought that class was a bit boring, but that wasn't a problem due to the great slides & textbook.",
    "Winston's slides were well designed to help students complete the problem sets, but a structured review session might be helpful in the future for students to prepare for the midterm and final.",
    "Great course.",
    "Strengths: various examples were given to explain different concepts. The class was very interactive and entertaining.",
    "More practice problems not from the PSETs to prepare for the exams would be nice.",
    "Strengths are definitely the course materials. Weaknesses would have to be the support from ULAs and office hours (minus Winston)",
    "Winston was a very good lecturer with very fair assessments, but not the most stimulating lecturer especially at 9am. I think the class could have moved significantly faster.",
    "Strength is clarity weakness is slow pace",
    "The midterm and final were both much more difficult than the practice midterm and final.",
    "The strength was Winston who was really kind, helpful, and knowledgeable. The exams were also really fair. No significant weaknesses.",
    "I think that the lecture notes were fantastic for learning course material whether you wrote down notes during class or reviewed them at home. Topics were clearly explained and example problems were sufficient to demonstrate these topics. The professor was excellent and moved at a reasonable pace throughout the semester, making it very clear what we needed to be able to do on problem sets and exams and what was unnecessary. I think that problem sets were also a reasonable length and the midterm and final were fair game and not overly difficult. There are also ample office hours with TAs or the professor to ask questions about problem sets or course material in general. My only recommendation would be to upload lecture notes online so that slides are condensed and not hundreds of slides in one. It makes it more difficult to locate certain topics. This past semester there was a slide for each additional point added to the slide so that one completed slide would be printed over let's say 5 slides in canvas. Just cleaning this up would make the notes even easier to comprehend!",
    "The strengths are that the problem sets and exams are all fairly straightforward and there are many opportunities to get help outside of class, including TAs and peer tutors. One weakness is that class was usually not very engaging, so it was very tempting to skip lecture.",
    "Winston does a great job of summarizing the material in his lecture notes and I often look to his notes for clarifications that I need. Professor Lin is very nice and answers questions and emails promptly even though his class size has more than tripled in the last few years. I felt like the feedback on some of the psets was a little lackluster, and I felt like sometimes the grading was a little harsh on the psets, but this turned out to not matter as the psets were only worth 10%. Exams counted for 90% of the grade, which made the course really stressful at times, but the grading scheme is common for math classes at Yale. This stress was alleviated by Professor Lin giving us a very detailed guide for what to study on the exam so I could make efficient use of my time.",
    "Great lectures, class size is huge though",
    "I think that the course was very well structured overall. My only critique would be that it did not rely on rigorous proofs. For a math theory student, that can be very important.",
    "Prof Lin is a great teacher and lecturer. He is able to explain complicated concepts and proofs well.",
    "I felt that the lectures and slides were well-organized around content and well explained by Winston, but the homework would often be unrelated mathematically for the sake of being difficult. The exams were more well coordinated though.",
    "The strengths of this course are the clear instruction and curriculum, as well as the fair psets and exams. The content itself was interesting, at least to me. One weakness is that the psets almost count for none of your grade - that puts an overwhelming amount of pressure and stress on the one midterm and final, which seems unfair if you consistently put in a lot of work on the psets and throughout the semester.",
    "strengths: Winston is nice, low-key setting, nothing really matters til the final. weaknesses: Lecture is impossible to follow\/bring yourself to go to, the book is super super dense, Because nothing matters til the final I couldn't bare to pay attention or show up. I have no idea what I learned",
    "Winston is the best professor I have had at Yale. Hes amazing and has excellent office hours. He genuinely cares about students understanding the material.",
    "This course is well-taught and everything we need is clearly laid out in the class notes and textbook (and lecture). I liked that you could still be successful without attending class if need be. The homework grading was a bit inconsistent. That's really the only weakness.",
    "Strengths: you learn about probability theory, Professor Lin is funny at the beginning of the year, all the powerpoints are online, you can get the solutions to all the psets at office hours\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Lin says on day 1 that you really don't have to come to lecture and that you can self-teach yourself using the materials online. I don't like this attitude; at Yale, a professor's input should be invaluable, for all we pay in tuition. I found the psets very difficult without help, but then office hours give you all the answers so I didn't learn as much.",
    "Very easy to learn new things. The class is huge, so it's hard to understand things in lectures, but the professor makes it easy to learn by yourself, which he understands is better for some students. Homework and exams are very fair.",
    "Not enough practice problems, hard to build intuition",
    "Strengths: relatively interesting material, Professor is really nice and knowledgeable, fair tests and problem sets. Weaknesses: I thought the class was kinda boring, but still a good class overall",
    "I think it was great overall. The slides were great. I think it can be improved upon by having more practice questions.",
    "Strengths of this course are its complimentary nature of lecture and textbook -- you can do well in the course with either or both, and the exams and problem sets were fair assessments, though difficult. Weaknesses were in the lower level of engagement that results from this flexibility.",
    "Strength in Winston's explanations of proofs and different analogy. Such a huge discrepancy between the homework and exams and well as applying the information in class to the homework.",
    "I think that the biggest strength of the course is Winston. He is the most caring professor I have had and he truly wants to see his students succeed. I think that the way he delivers the material is effective. I think that the biggest weakness of the course is that the material at times can be confusing and somewhat dry. I think another weakness is that 90% of the grade is from two exams. I also think that the practice exams were a little deceiving as they were both significantly easier than the real exams.",
    "Winston is a great professor who genuinely cares about his students. His lectures are easy to understand and his slides are thorough and detailed.",
    "Strengths: Winston is a clear lecturer and posts good notes online, explains things very well, and is just generally a cheerful and helpful presence. The textbook used is also very helpful at explaining most concepts. The problem sets were good applications of concepts taught in class and did not take too long. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the midterm and final were both more difficult than the previous iterations released to us (although the final less so, and Winston made sure to note that it would be slightly harder than the exams). It would have been helpful to have been given practice questions for the exam that matched the skill level expected so we knew better how to study.",
    "This course does its job in teaching the fundamentals of Probability theory that will most likely be used later on in Stats. In terms of a prereq and getting basics down, I would take this course. Graders for the psets for sticklers for the details but overall, the work was fair and really helped learn the theory behind each topic. \r\n\r\nWinston is a great guy and genuinely wants to see his students succeed but his lecturing is not good. You'll probably not show up to lecture after the 1st or 2nd week, come back like the 5th week and then not show up until the very last lecture.",
    "easy, Winston was very open about his expectations and there were lots of office hours. Could cover more interesting problems in probability theory, the material is pretty dry",
    "As a math\/S&DS class, I felt like the course was weighted too heavily on tests, so the grades could be very punishing.",
    "Very rough final.",
    "This class had clear lectures that broke down the steps for proofs and explained the information in a succinct manner. Professor Lin is also nice to students and tries to answer all of their questions. Having more practice questions for some topics (like convolution) would have been helpful.",
    "Strength: office hours are helpful, Winston is also very dedicated to his students\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the midterm was very difficult, oftentimes I felt like this was a gut for math majors but for people like me who didn't really take math classes, the learning curve was really highand office hours became a time to just write down homework answers",
    "This course is fantastic. I wish it weren't a 9am. The lectures are very well organized. The professor is great.",
    "The only weakness is that the lectures can easily be substituted by reading the slides.",
    "The slides are very useful, and the course can be taken without going to class. The exams are also very close to the content of the homework.",
    "This course was very well organized and structured to facilitate learning. Lecture slides were very clear, weekly psets were helpful in allowing students to keep up with the material and self-evaluate themselves. It was helpful that we could drop the two lowests psets; that way, we focused more on learning the material than worrying about our grades. Despite this being a very large class, there were a lot of ULAs and TAs to support us. \r\nThe only weakness I can point out is that the final exam was a very large percentage of our grade (55% or 75%), so most of our grade depends on one exam.",
    "Strengths: There are a lot of resources available to help (LOTS of office hours). Even though I could never make it to Professor Lin's office hours, there were always some I could go to every week. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wished the lecture (or problem sets) had more concrete examples. There were several chapters in the later part of the semester that were all slides of concepts. It was hard to then apply those to the homework problems (which usually required a pretty good grasp of how to use the theorems already). I would have appreciated more concrete\/straightforward examples if not in the lectures, then in additional homework problems focused more on computation (these could be optional for those that want them).",
    "I think the only weakness is that it's such a large lecture, so the class can feel daunting. Besides that, I think that this class really did everything as perfectly as you can expect a large lecture to do: the professor is incredible, the slides help you review the material so well, and there are a whole bunch of TA's to help with the assessments.",
    "I thought this was a very strong course. I think the only improvement would be weighing homework more because the homework took a lot of time but contributed to very little of the grade.",
    "Exams were reasonable, weekly problem sets were not insignificant & the problems were hard. Overall a good class.",
    "This course is very much suited to the self-learner. There were many resources like slides, an online textbook, and many office hours sessions. However, if you do not put in the extra effort to study on your own, it is very easy to fall behind in the class.",
    "Strengths: Winston is a really kind and endearing professor. I think he really did The Most for us - kind grader, explained concepts well, told us very clearly what we needed to study for. The class is really fair and straightforward, but becomes difficult if you don't go to lecture and don't keep up with the material. Which is easy to do because honestly the material\/lectures can be a bit dry, class is at 9am, and the textbook is loooong. I do think it speaks volumes that Winston chose to grade every single midterm and final by himself (esp when the class size was double (~350 people) what was expected). Weaknesses: I mean, it's not a very fun course. I wish there were more office hours during reading period\/finals period, because having fallen behind, I found it difficult to catch up.",
    "Strengths:\r\nGreat textbook\r\nGreat online resources including lecture slides and notes\r\nGreat lectures with an articulate and enjoyable professor\r\nOnline resources and assignment submission made attendance, learning, and work flexible\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe somewhat optional lectures allowed me to get lazy and fall behind",
    "The main strengths of this course were the well-organized and contained curriculum, the fair exams, and the good explanations from Winston. The course manages to cover a fair amount of probability concepts which all integrate well and form a cohesive introduction to probability theory. Additionally, the textbook, the class lectures, the problem sets, and the exams all correlated well with similar difficulty levels and content. The exams were quite fair, with reasonable lengths and problems reflective of the homework. Unlike many other classes, it was quite possible to do well on them, which was encouraging. Furthermore, Winston did a good job explaining all the concepts, so I really gained a good understanding of the content by the end of the course. The main weaknesses of this course were the lack of mathematical rigor\/proof practice due to the breadth of student skills, the lack of practical application problems, and the lack of engagement in lecture due to the large size. Winston admitted at the beginning of the course that it might not be perfectly right for anyone due to the massive size and large differences in mathematical backgrounds. As a Math major with decent proof background, it was often dissatisfying to skip proofs of the more interesting\/complicated theorems and to generally avoid proofs on problem sets and exams. While we definitely proved a lot of simpler properties and theorems in class, we were rarely asked to do even simple proofs on our own, which probably would have been a good exercise for future (more theoretical) statistics classes. On the other hand, an alternate path to some more interesting problems would be to include more practical application\/analysis problems. I know this is really what S&DS 238 is about, but it would be cool to do a few more real-world applications of our theoretical knowledge, even without any kind of programming (maybe the programming could be a fun extra exercise). Some sort of application project would be fun and maybe could reduce the enormous amount the final counts towards your grade (50% is way too much for one test). Finally, lectures were a bit hard to stay engaged, with many people falling asleep a bit or not coming at all. This was not really Winstons fault, as he was actually a very interesting and fun lecturer, more a product of the size and early morning time. Maybe there could be some kind of mandatory section that would break it down into smaller groups to increase engagement, with enrichment options for more experienced students as well (maybe separate sections based on comfort with the material, like CS50).",
    "Great lecture slides, but I didn't think the problem sets were that compelling. \r\nI enjoyed the 'statistical stories,' and it cleared up a lot of things I've been wondering about (in terms of probability\/gambling.)",
    "This course is a very large lecture class and I think with that comes challenges in student engagement. I didn't feel very much accountability for the course, especially because many TAs and Winston himself gave pset answers during office hours. It was easy to be lulled into a false sense of security in this course, especially because the material in the beginning of the semester seems easy and Winston told us many times that \"many students do well in this course without coming to lecture.\" While this probably is true, many students do find the material difficult, and the book is not intuitively written.",
    "Winston is a great lecturer. I wish the course wasn't at 9:00 am. It would encourage attendance.",
    "This course could be improved if the instructor spent a longer time teaching the 2nd half of the course. While the first half was pretty slow and easy to understand, I found the 2nd half so much harder."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. The concepts are interesting and not too challenging, and the workload is light, making for a great 5th class. If you are planning to take more classes in S&DS, this class teaches some very important foundations and building blocks of statistics.",
    "Only if you are taking it for the major or want to learn probability theory (but not sure if this is the best way to do it)",
    "This was a good course for learning probability! Be aware that the focus is not on regular statistics, so you won't learn anything you didn't already know, but the treatment of random variables which occupies most of the course is interesting and useful.",
    "Yes, but be aware that it feels much more like a math course than a statistics course. You're probably taking it for the S&DS major or the data science certificate; as far as required courses go, it's pretty standard. Not super exciting, but nothing too dreadful either.",
    "Definitely.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Whether you're a stat's major or interested in probability and need a QR, it's very accessibly to people with all different math backgrounds. I think probability is often viewed as one of the most daunting parts of statistics and math, and this class was a great comprehensive overview.",
    "Yes! Especially if Winston is teaching it.",
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "Yes! This course is great at teaching you a lot of core probability concepts that you can apply elsewhere. Do be careful, though: the high pressure placed on the exams and the fast pace in the second half of the course creates a stress culture.",
    "I would not. You really have to teach everything to yourself unless Winston's office hour fits into your schedule. Other than that, you are on your own, and it's really not as easy as the previous years' course evaluations suggest!",
    "I would highly recommend 241 if Winston is teaching it (if its Yihong, run away, fast). Winston understands that the topic in and of itself is difficult, so he accounts for that by making the exams doable in a reasonable amount of time",
    "I would recommend this course. The material, as all probability material is, is very dry, but Winston is enthusiastic. You technically also don't have to go to lecture - only about 50 of the 400 people in the class would actually show up, but I think it is actually helpful to go.",
    "I think I would, it's pretty interesting, a good QR and it's not too difficult. If you're looking for a math course that is a little less challenging than Math 225 or something like that, I think it's a good idea. Don't take it if you're looking to learn some useful stats, this is strictly for understanding probability. If you put in a decent amount of work you should do well, and learn some interesting things along the way.",
    "I credit-D'd this class, almost never went to lecture, and did fine. It is fairly straightforward if you have an adequate math background.",
    "Yes, definitely take this if you have ever had any interest in math, probability, or statistics!",
    "I would. It is a good course.",
    "I would. Probability theory is very useful.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone. At times lecture was definitely boring but the content itself is a bit hard to make super engaging because of the nature of the theory and math explanations. I had never had any experience in stats or probability and felt that Winston did a great job making sure that people like me could access the. material and succeed even among stats grad students and experienced stats students.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to any student with an inclination towards math who's interested in probability.",
    "Yes, its required for the sequence",
    "If you are planning on the S&DS major or certificate, this is an essential course to take. It does not, however, have any practical applications and very insulated in the teaching of the content. If you have previous knowledge of statistics, you will be able to connect some of the concepts in the class to what you know, such as Normal distributions, but do not expect to learn any code or statistical techniques in this class, although the book it uses has R tutorials. Although limited background knowledge is required, knowing multivariable calculus helps tremendously for the class. The midterm was not that difficult, although a small mistake could cost you a large number of points. In contrast, the final was significantly more difficult than the midterm.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course to another student if they were considering getting the S&DS certificate!",
    "Yes, for sure to basically all students",
    "Probably not. Winston is great and very nice, but the class has no applications. Like the name says, it's only theory. The only reason I took this class was to help fulfill requirements for the Statistics Certificate.",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student if they are interested in theoretical statistics, probability, or math. I think most of the students in the class were taking the course as a mandatory class for their major! If your major requires the class, I strongly recommend it! If not, I would suggest taking a more applied version of statistics, as that might prove to be more useful.",
    "If you're going for the S&DS major, you're probably going to be taking it. I probably wouldn't recommend it otherwise. If you do take it though, you'll have a good time--the professor is nice, the workload is manageable + there are a lot of office hours that you can go to for help if necessary, and lectures supplemented readings quite well. Nothing was unexpected on exams.",
    "Yes! Professor Lin is very reasonable and a good lecturer. Workload is very manageable.",
    "Yes! If you need the course for the certificate I would highly recommend taking it with Professor Lin!",
    "If you want a pretty straightforward math class with an easy A, I'd say this is the class for you. Along the way, you'll also pick up some good basic stats knowledge. Don't expect too many applications though.",
    "I would recommend this course because I thought that it didn't take a lot of time to learn important concepts.",
    "Yes, this is important to learn. Also, you won't have to show up to lecture.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if it is a requirement for their major. I wouldn't take this class for a QR credit. The material is pretty dry, and the way the class presented the material was not very enticing.",
    "This is a great course for students interested in learning probability. It is more theoretical. If you are looking for an application heavy class, no applications were covered.",
    "If you need to take it, take it! If you need an extra course for a major and this is an option, and have the option to take something more advanced, then maybe take the more advanced course.",
    "For fulfilling requirements or a relatively easy S&DS credit, but not for an in-depth learning of Prob Theory.",
    "If it wasn't clear from the course description, there's a lot of math involved in this course. I know a lot of people that lean towards the humanities side of things take this course, and even more are going to thanks to the S&DS certificate and how this is a course that counts towards it, so here's a warning; although the course says that you don't need previous stats or probability experience, it would be really helpful to have that under your belt. The course only uses toy examples, so learning the concepts without knowing exactly how they're applied in the real world or other more practical courses might be challenging. Otherwise, I did learn a lot from the class, so if you're prepared for it, I do recommend it.",
    "If you are interested in taking higher level statistics courses, and\/or it is required, then this course is for you.",
    "If you need this class for the certificate or for a major, then sure. Otherwise, there's probably better ways to be spending your precious Yale credits. It's also very theoretical, not applied, if that's what you're looking for. If you want to do more with probability in the future, go ahead and take it. Winston's not a bad teacher and tries to make it easy.",
    "Winston is a phenomenal lecturer and professor. He dedicated so many hours to the course and it shows.",
    "It is good for an intro to probability if you havent seen it before",
    "If you want to gain a strong understanding of the proofs and logic behind probability this is a great course to take",
    "Yes",
    "I would not recommend it if they are simply interested in basic stats. This is because it is too difficult for the level of S&DS class it is.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who wants an understanding of probability theory, or an easy QR.",
    "I would as it is a necessary stepping stone towards higher level stats and probability courses. The workload is very manageable and it should be easy to get a decent grade at the end. The only downside is that it is a huge lecture so engagement is naturally low.",
    "1. Take this class if you have to, but you won't come out of it significantly more mathematically sophisticated. \r\n2. Winston's honestly really nice, but has some weaknesses as a lecturer as class ended up being pretty dry a lot of the time.",
    "Like if you have to. It'll be easier than a lot of other math classes so you might as well.",
    "Somewhat. I think that this is a great course to take for the S&DS major, and that it rounds out learning from other courses. However, I did not understand how I'd apply a lot of the concepts we learned (especially in the second half of the semester) to real life. Therefore, if you need the course, I recommend this over S&DS 238, but also be warned that it is theoretical.",
    "Yes.",
    "Only if you need it for something, but I'm simply not the kind of person who would take more mathy courses than I need to.",
    "Yes, it is a solid introduction course to Probability",
    "Only if you are intending to major in S&DS",
    "I would only recommend this course to someone who needs to take it for their major.",
    "Yes, I would recommend. Professor Winston was great. He went at a reasonable pace, I understood everything. Problem sets were also reasonable. Some questions were hard but there were so many office hours! I really enjoyed the course, where I felt the professor wanted to teach us, and was not looking to fail us with impossible problem sets and exams. Midterm was a little harder than what we thought, especially compared to the practice midterm he gave us. However, the final was very predictable. if you studied, you did well.",
    "Yes. This class is a good fit for people interested in probability and\/or looking for a fifth class. The workload is managable, and you learn about a lot of topics in a relatively short time.",
    "Yes, but also, exams are 90% of your grade. We did get a cheat sheet on the final.",
    "Take the class. It is really important to know as a baseline for future stats classes. Also, 241 & 242 are kinda core to the S&DS major here so if you want to do that major, I'd advise doing that. If you don't want to really make stats a central part of your education, I'm not sure if this class makes sense for you. It is interesting stuff, but I'm not sure that it's necessary. You might be better off just doing like stats 100 or stats 220. (or maybe take stat 240, which is a less mathematical version if you aren't really a quantitative type person and are still interested in probability).",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in purely the theory behind a lot of probabilistic concepts. We went through a few toy examples, but we never went in depth on applying any concepts. If you are more interested in application based learning, I would take another course.",
    "Yes, it is a very good intro course for probability and statistics concepts.",
    "Winston is just a gem. Go to class after the midterm and dont try to learn everything by yourself the week before the midterm. Great class overall especially since he gave us the topics and review questions to focus on for both exams.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes it creates a good base for other classes",
    "Yes. Excellent course to learn probability and Winston is the GOAT.",
    "There are probably a lot of easy ratings from earlier years, but this year the midterm and final were both substantially harder than they were in years prior.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot and the exams were fair.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student, especially if you take it with Winston! I haven't taken stats since AP stats in high school, but I was able to move straight into this course. It starts with a basic review of probability and goes from there but I think most students shouldn't feel too out of place in this course even if they haven't take a 100-level stats course. I missed stats a bit and found the course somewhat interesting. THere are many resources to help you work on your weekly problem sets and having two drops for the semester is handy as well. Winston was one of the nicest professors I've had at Yale and put in a lot of effort into lectures and occasionally the odd joke or two. I am pursuing the Data Science certificate and this was the first class I took to work towards completing that and this will set you up to take higher-level stats course if you so choose.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who wants a foundation in probability with minimal effort. You will need to understand the basics of multivariable calculus (double integrals and partial derivatives), but other than that, the math required is not very challenging. With that said, I think there are other statistics classes that are much more applicable than this one, such as any course that teaches programming or involves data analysis.",
    "Absolutely. This is a good gut course for when you need to fill your schedule with some QR or stats credit for the major or certificate.",
    "Yes; great introduction to useful concepts in probability theory",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who wants to develop a basic intuition for probability theory. The course builds up form very simple concepts and stays in touch with them throughout the semester. It is important to keep in mind, however, that this is not a proof based class. There are some proofs in the first half but virtually none in the second. The main focus is broad, foundational principles.",
    "I was looking for an interesting course to learn about statistics. This course was not really what I was looking for and I wouldn't say it's a gut if that's what you're looking for. I feel like the concepts were not intuitive. I wish there were more opportunities to support the concepts covered in class.",
    "I took the course as a prerequisite for further statistics classes. If not for that, I probably would not have taken it.",
    "it's a foundational class required for many majors, so you probably have no choice. It is a good class to learn the basis of probability.",
    "Not really no. I was all excited to dive into probability which I have never studied before, but I really just didn't get much out of it. It seemed easy for the kids that already knew what they were doing--like they were just breezing through--and I was just lost in the whirlwind of it all. I guess it was a chill class for the first five months given that I never felt the need to show up until I stressed for the week before finals and spent about 100 hours watching the harvard lecture videos, which were FAR FAR MORE HELPFUL THAN ANY MATH CLASS YALE HAS TO OFFER.",
    "Yes. Great for applied maths",
    "I thought the class was pretty boring and took it only to fulfill a major requirement ... that is personal preference though -- if you enjoy probability then I think this class would be a great fit.",
    "This course made me decide to quit the S&DS major. I recognize this is probability \"theory\" but I really missed application problems, that's the whole reason I like probability. Professor Lin is not great at answering direct questions but explains problems well enough in office hours. I don't like his attitude about this entire course is self-teachable from the online notes and how he practically discourages people from coming to lecture. That being said, Professor Lin is very nice and approachable.",
    "Yes! Very nice course, not hard but you can still learn a lot.",
    "Sure if it meets some requirement for you or if you like probability theory, if not probably not",
    "Yes. I really recommend this class because it is fundamental to statistics.",
    "If you are interested in probability or statistics or data science, this course or a similar probability course are a must. A great applicable math course.",
    "Would probably recommend to students majoring in Statistics and Data Science or math, but this was a difficult course in terms of application and conceptualization.",
    "I think that if a student is interested in probability theory, this is a great course for them to take. If they are not interested in the topic, then the course will not be interesting and will be quite difficult.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to a student who wants to deepen their understanding of probability theory and develop a strong foundation of knowledge.",
    "I'd recommend. It gives a solid foundation for working with probability theorems and very light proofs. For the exams you definitely need to have a strong working grasp of the material and not simply know the formulas \/ what was covered but really understand them.",
    "If you're taking it for a S&DS prereq, YES\r\nIf you're taking it for Winston, YES\r\nIf you're looking for a gut, MAYBE (only with Winston)\r\nIf you're taking it to try out Probability Theory or to see if you like stats, NO (Take Intro Stats or YData)\r\n\r\nDeciding between 238 and 241? \r\n241- \"Math-ier\" Course\r\n238 - Not a \"mathy\" course\r\n*Take 241 if you want to take 242 after, imo\r\n\r\nVERY HELPFUL TIP: Joe Blitzstein, the professor at Harvard who writes the textbook for this course, has all his lectures uploaded on Youtube online. They cover the same or similar material but in a different chronological order. I would recommend watching his lectures\/reading the textbook if you do not attend lecture and then reading the lecture slides (if Winston is teaching the course)",
    "Great class with Winston - would recommend",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in learning concepts within probability and probability theory but without any practical applications (which Winston was clear about from the beginning of the course).",
    "If you need it for your major, yes, otherwise probably not. You won't cover any applications or interesting problems. If you do have to take it, rest assured that it's low workload and pretty easy.",
    "This class is helpful for dipping your toes into probability. I would recommend it because it gives you a general background about probability, which is used in many other subjects of study. The homework assignments were helpful in going over the material in lecture. If you're looking for an introductory class, you should take it, but if you aren't interested in the content it won't be rewarding.",
    "Yes if you're doing anything statistics related, otherwise no.",
    "Absolutely. Probability Theory is a must-have in my opinion for any student seriously interested in the CS\/data science aspects of STEM. A basic understanding of probability is necessary in today's STEM environment no matter the field, in my opinion. Professor Lin cares more about his students than almost any professor I've encountered here; the resources he provides and the detail that goes into how he plans the course is simply astounding.",
    "Yes, it is a great course. The content is very useful and applicable and is explained well.",
    "The workload for this class is very manageable, and there are many office hours and study halls offered. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in probability. This is a very useful course for anyone to learn the basics of probability. It is interesting for students in any major in mathematics, statistics, or the sciences. The material is not very hard and the workload is reasonable.",
    "Absolutely. Probability has never been really intuitive to me and I feel like this course has really allowed me to feel more comfortable with it. Before I took the course, I heard that previous students didn't find the course particularly challenging. I disagree. Maybe it was because probability isn't the most intuitive thing to me, but I put a lot of time into this course, going to (sometimes several) office hours each week. I know Professor Lin put in an effort to make his exams more challenging than the previous time he taught the course, and I think he achieved that without being unfair. Overall, I'm really happy I took this course!",
    "Yes--understanding the fundamentals of probability is something that is helpful and interesting to people of many different interests. If you're not into quantitative stuff at all, maybe skip this, but besides that this class was a great time.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in probability theory and statistics.",
    "Don't underestimate the time you need to put in to the class. People take it because they think it will be easier with Winston but the weekly problem sets are kind of a significant time commitment (if you don't do most of it yourself, you're putting yourself behind for the midterm & final). Midterm was very reasonable, exam was pretty difficult but still within the realm of reason. Try to go to class.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who is looking to get a strong foundation in probability in order to take higher level statistics courses.",
    "I'd recommend it if you're willing to put in the work. I took this as a part of pursuing the Stats certificate, and truthfully it's a lot harder than I expected, especially as a non-quant major. The theory behind probability and statistics can be hard to grasp, and if you don't understand things at the start of the course it can be hard to catch up. Also the class definitely gets much faster in the second half. I don't know if I'll be able to apply this to future coursework but it did force me to think a bit more deeply about why certain statistical processes are the way they are. It seems that if you're to take this class at all, take it with Winston. He tries to make it as painless as possible.",
    "Yes, both for math\/stats major and liberal arts majors. The material was interesting and the course was enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants an approachable yet useful introduction to probability theory, without too heavy of a workload. It gives a good overview of various probability topics and is a useful prerequisite for many statistics and math classes. Winston successfully accomplished his goal of making the class pretty good for lots of people (mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, engineers, etc.). This course is a good choice for any one of these students, as well as those looking for an applicable QR credit; just dont expect a super intellectually challenging or engaging class. If you want a more rigorous or exciting class, consider another introductory statistics course.",
    "It's probably very good among the statistics classes for someone new to statistics. I saw a lot of graduate students take it as a one-of class.",
    "A good overview of probability. The course uses an excellent textbook.",
    "I would only because of how useful and fundamental it is for anybody majoring in statistics."
