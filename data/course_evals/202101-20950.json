                "Strengths\r\n-Very comprehensive\r\n-The assignments are super fun and really allow you to be creative\r\n-The professor is really nice\r\n-The ULA's are very helpful\r\n-Covers exactly what is promised in the course description\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-Too much time in zoom breakout rooms\r\n-MATLAB instruction was minimal\r\n-Professor sometimes talks quite a bit",
                "Strengths: We could continually turn in assignments again to get better grades, which was perfect bc the goal of the class is to develop work we're proud of and WANT to show off to others. Plenty of office hours and time to work in class to get to know our peers, which is essential but lacked in almost every one of my other zoom classes. Every level of CADer can be in this class and improve from the baseline they came in with, and your grade is not a comparison to others but a metric of your own effort and improvement.\r\nWeaknesses: You might die from dad jokes once you notice they never stop.",
                "Did a great job with the break out rooms for student engagement.",
                "Strengths: great professor who gives out assignments that are very doable and I believe he increases the difficulty of assignments incrementally which makes it much less overwhelming. I have never learned so much from one semester in such a reduced stress fashion. We also had a great grad student (Cameron Lerch) who was incredibly helpful and engaging in class as well -- he helped a lot of us troubleshoot! We also had incredibly dedicated peer tutors! I also loved the \"choose your own final project\" idea -- gave me space to do something I was interested in!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths:\r\nI felt some of the projects were good challenges.  I enjoyed how open ended the final project was.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nFor anyone with even the most slight amount of CAD experience, this class had a ridiculously small workload.  It also covered very little material.  After the first few weeks in the course, I justified continuing to take it by expecting that material would get more advanced.  It didn't.  My CAD skills are almost exactly where they were at the start of this course.  I learned to do extremely basic analysis, but that's essentially it as far as new skills go.  \r\n\r\nThe whole section of the class on projections felt like a wild divergence from the rest.  While I definitely learned some new material there, it felt largely disconnected from anything that would be useful now that drawing engineering diagrams by hand is no longer relevant.\r\n\r\nThis class should be thoroughly restructured around concrete material.  It should start with the basics of CAD, teaching best practices like how to deal with global variables and equations.  Then it should move onto advanced design techniques: the features in solidworks which are practical but complex.  After that it should be based on analysis.  This shouldn't be analyzing random parts we make, it should be problem sets where models are provided and correct answers are expected.\r\n\r\nA core message in this class was that we should be self motivated to do most of the learning by ourselves and do as hard of projects as we can.  While I understand this sentiment, it doesn't work in reality.  Some amount of self teaching is good, but if Yale wants to give its engineers the skills necessary to thrive in the real world, actual instruction is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the evaluations will be positive.  This will be because of the extraordinarily lenient grading in the class.  I didn't come to Yale for good grades.  I came to learn.",
                "no weaknesses.  A fun course where I learned a lot.",
                "Strengths: gaining a lot of SolidWorks experience, building a portfolio of cool designs, learning to run Motion Analysis and FEA simulations. Additionally, this was a relatively low-stress course with a emphasis on mastery-based learning, so we were allowed to continue to work on past projects until we got to a point we were proud of and mastered all the skills. I can't think of any weaknesses, other than potentially having access to a machine shop during a non-pandemic year so we could manufacture some of the parts we created. This course was really fun.",
                "Strengths: project based, fun",
                "Strengths: hands-on and fun, great professor, low stress\r\nWeaknesses: group projects were difficult to do remotely, and sometimes the mechanical terms used in class are not fully explained to the non-mechE majors",
                "Great class, not stressful at all. A mastery based class, so you worked at your own level of expertise and could redo assignments until you mastered them. I wish there was more content during our lectures, such as how to do more complicated modeling.",
                "Workload is very well structured to foster understanding and mastery of the concepts. The only improvement that can be made is to cover more features of SolidWorks, but this is where the breadth vs depth dichotomy comes into play. Not much should change about this class, I enjoyed it a great deal.",
                "It is very nice to have mastery-based learning and be graded on our own progress; I think I was able to push myself without being compared to students with previous experiences. I think that some of the assignments are a lot harder than others (the MATLAB assignment was a lot).",
                "I would say having the class online was actually a strength. Being able to follow along with my screen and even re-watch the recorded lectures if I missed something was extremely helpful. The ULAs were also great.",

                "I wish it went more in depth about how to use various features of SolidWorks. Not just the basic CAD skills that we learn repeatedly. But I thought it was taught well, teaching us practical aspects instead of just theory, like a lot of other classes."
