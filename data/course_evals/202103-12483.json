Professor Chalioti did a great job ensuring that the material we saw in our problems sets were concepts and ideas we had reviewed in class. She went out of her way to make sure the material was relevant, engaging, and interesting.",
                "The strengths are the breadth of topics covered and how each of them relate to new technologies being developed in our world. The weakness was that sometimes the link to AI was lost and the practical applications did not always come through in the models.",
                "Strengths: expectations from the student are clear! the class is extremely fair with no surprises. the topic is also incredibly fascinating",
                "Strengths: Prof Chalioti is fantastics--she is clear, knowledgeable, and helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: The course, as it is promoted as, does not teach the methods of AI or discuss the technical aspects of AI or machine learning.",
                "Strengths include extremely interesting course material and lecture content and an engaging presentation project and memorandum. Professor Chalioti is very knowledgeable about the course topic.",
                "I thought that the class was perfectly taught. It could be slightly improved by laying out due dates well in advance.",
                "Strengths: Lectures are easy to follow with the content being interesting and relevant. The assignments, especially the industry report + presentation, were fun to do. The material is a good blend of micro (models, simple calculus) and current affairs (lots of industry analysis and study of business models). Most importantly, Professor Chalioti is the best - she genuinely cares about her students and always makes herself approachable and available. \r\nWeakness: The presentations eat up a lot of class time that could be used for new material.",
                "No weaknesses. This was a great course!",

You learn a lot of material that is directly related to economics, but you also zoom out a bit to discuss AI in general and how it is used in other industries, which was a great way to introduce students' voices into the classroom. The course is well-structured, interesting, and has a reasonable workload.",

The course explores several different topics and industries that we all interact with, so seeing how AI influences them and changes their models is incredibly rewarding.",
                "Yes yes yes, it's a great option for a senior Econ seminar",

I highly recommend the class to anyone who is interested in learning about cutting-edge technology, discussing companies implementing AI, and presenting an industry analysis. The knowledge and skills I learned in ECON 472 will be beneficial in my future career in finance.",
