                "I learned so much about how to read and interpret works of fiction as well as how to repurpose the craft/style of professional writers in my own writing. I learned how to craft and construct a persuasive short story and how to provide readers with just enough information: not too much, not too little. I learned about how to be a part of a writing community where each member's piece of writing was treated with care and respect.",
                "This course offers the ability to write two or more pieces of your own writing while learning from workshops with classmates and discussion of published stories. It allows you to learn more about both writing and editing.",
                "This is a really good class to fulfill the advanced 451+ requirement for aspiring Writing Concentrators. I took it with Susan Choi (who is no longer at Yale) and she was an amazing and super helpful guide for this workshop writing class.\r\nThere's not much instruction for the business of writing if you're planning on going into the world of writing. This class focuses purely on the craft, on reading important works of short fiction, and on how to read peer work and comment on it.",
                "Over the course of this class, you submit two pieces for workshop, and you read 2 of each of your classmates' pieces. As this was the bulk of the course (and there was little instruction), the knowledge, skills, and insights lie in the insights you yourself take away from these experiences (which are rife with insights to be gleaned)",
                "I participated in a creative writing workshop that allowed me to present my own prose for criticism as well as provide feedback for other students' work, focusing on the 'craft' of short story writing.",
                "I got better at understanding the kind of conflicts that can drive a story. By reading other students' work, I also expanded my notion of what \"fiction\" is. Professor Choi's feedback really encouraged me to think about what makes characters believable and what makes for the kind of conflict that can drive a story."

                "The biggest strength of this class was Prof. Chois emphasis on the writing process over a given product. I learned so much from reading my peers writing and selected stories that supported me in my daily writing practice, and I felt very comfortable experimenting with new ideas during workshop.",
                "I thought this course pretty much nailed it. There was a great mix of written and verbal feedback. The readings were varied and helpful, and in-class discussion was fruitful when you were being work-shopped and enjoyable when you weren't.",
                "The strengths were getting to write two longer stories of our own and then getting class and professor feedback.",
                "I loved the course's workshop format. I loved that the focus was on collaboration and growth, the \"process,\" and not on producing some sort of end product. On the first day of class we did a mini writing exercise: I wish that there were more of those throughout the course. Almost like flash-fiction assignments (either in class or for homework), so that students could practice craft without having to worry about constructing a fully thought out story. I appreciated the fact that we didn't have to turn in a portfolio at the end of class, but I wonder if there could have been some sort of specific goal to work towards throughout the term. It felt a bit anticlimactic to finish with the last workshop story and then be done with the course.",
                "The course offers a lot of freedom to dive into the writing process and professor Chois comments were great. That being said, I didnt feel like there was enough ability to work on the editing process because there is only one draft due.",
                "I like having something concrete to take away from a class, so my one piece for improvement is that it would be nice to have a second/final submission of one earlier draft submission.",
                "I really enjoyed this writing workshop. I loved reading the work of my peers and looked forward to class every week. The combination of assigned readings and group discussions, guided by Professor Choi, certainly improved my creative writing.\r\n\r\nMy only main feedback would be to potentially restructure the class to rely more on creative submissions (whether large or small). I enjoyed the weeks where we had small group discussions/workshops of 3 or 4 people, and would have appreciated receiving feedback on even more of my work. I also found the weekly deadlines somewhat confusing, and wonder if Canvas posts should be uniformly due on Sunday evening as opposed to some occasions where it was requested on Fridays. Minor notes though--overall a great course!",
                "Professor Choi gives incredibly detailed feedback and curated a diverse and instructive set of readings for us. It is also wonderful to be able to read other students' work.\r\n\r\nI found the Canvas posts to be extremely onerous. While I understand that Canvas posts ensure that everyone does the reading, I found class discussions to be a much more interesting. I don't think anyone read the Canvas posts unless it was their own piece being discussed, and I think I would have had a lot more time to think about my feedback if I hadn't need to write 1500 words of Canvas posts each week.\r\n\r\nI also wish that we had spent more time at the beginning of the semester discussing what makes good fiction, and that the rhythms of the course were more varied. The course felt repetitive by the midterm, and I think it would have been interesting to have more specific prompts and some smaller writing assignments mixed.\r\n\r\nFinally, I wish there had been more of a focus on the art of writing/language. Feedback and discussion were almost exclusively focused on characters and plot, and I wish there had been way more attention paid to writing style, and the relationship between plot structure/theme and writing style."

                "Yes! But bear in mind it's really a workshop class. Professor Choi also talks a lot in class, which is great because her insights are always so astute, but that means less time for classroom discussion.",
                "Yes, this is a great class because you have freedom to write whatever you want, which is rare in classes because I feel like we are usually confined to a prompt but this class allows you to explore your own writing however you want.",
                "Yes!",
                "I could not recommend this course more. Professor Choi is the perfect teacher. She is so brilliant and accomplished, but exceptionally modest. She treats her students with such respect and approaches their work as if they themselves are already published writers. This class is one of the few at Yale that focus on learning more than production. We did not have to turn in any final stories. Instead, the class was about us working through rough versions of stories, exchanging ideas, and discoursing over professional works of fiction and \"fiction\" as a concept. It was refreshing and, from a pedagogical perspective, genius and inspired.",
                "Its a great way to explore fiction writing, but I think its best if writing is something youre already interested in pursuing outside an academic context. Workshop was low key and very thoughtful and outside reading was great!",
                "Absolutely, especially if you've ever been/are interested in writing fiction/creative writing in general, if you need a class for the Writing Concentration, if you need a Writing Credit (there's not too much work compared to the 5 essays of 120)...",
                "If you are serious about writing, take this class.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Choi ran an amazing class that both exposed me to a wealth of short stories as well as greatly improving my own creative writing abilities. If you want to take your prose writing to the next level, I would definitely recommend this class!",
                "Personally, I found it to be repetitive and a lot of work. Sometimes it felt like a slog. On the other hand, it is nice to get to read other student work and get feedback on your own writing. I would recommend this course to students who would be excited to constantly read other students' work and write feedback on it."
