            "comments": [
                "The course was very straightforward in terms of work and assessments. I wish the Stata were taught in class instead of via video, and sometimes the assignments were uploaded much later than promised. Due dates were always adjusted, though, so JT was a fair instructor.",
                "This was my favorite course I took this semester, even with content matter that taught in any other context would be incredibly dry. JT not only cares about getting to know your name and knowing his students, but he is also a fantastic professor. Lectures are engaging and explain the concepts quite clearly. There are a few things that could be improved, however. First, more guidance on the problem sets and their grading scale would have been useful, especially when going in somewhat blind for the first one. If not, a policy that would allow the lowest score to be dropped would be especially useful. Secondly, language is very crucial to grading in this class, but because of the focus on class participation, sometimes it is left a bit unclear what the exact language that is being looked for is. Perhaps, after lecture, the specific interpretations could be added to the slidesthis would be useful especially when studying for the midterm/final.",
                "Very time consuming. Very very harsh grading, likely most difficult grading I've encountered at Yale.",
                "The content of the course was great, and the instructor was engaging and fun. However, I found the course disorganized at times. Pset and homework videos were rarely posted when they said they would be, and this made planning my time and workload unnecessarily difficult. Additionally, I found it a bit slow at times. I think it would have been possible to cover many more topics in the time that we had than were covered. That being said, I appreciate that the amount of time the instructor dedicated to each topic ensured that everyone fully understood it both in its application and conceptually. I also liked that people could raise their hands and speak, even though it was a lecture.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The course starts very basic and builds up at an appropriate crescendo, facilitating student learning\r\n- The slides are clear and rely on real world examples\r\n- There is a fair amount of problem sets that reinforce course material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Sections repeat the lectures.\r\n- Exam grading looks for exact terminology and removes a harsh number of points when not found.",
                "Strengths: Lecture very engaging, discussion section very helpful for figuring out P-Sets\r\nWeaknesses: All TA office hours scheduled in the morning, which conflicted with my morning language class (most students taking this course are global affairs majors, and many are concurrently taking language classes that meet 5 days a week, so all office hours scheduled at the same time every day didn't make very much sense given the number of students who might have had language class conflicts).",
                "Could be interesting to have a visiting lecture and thank about the challenges faced in social research",
                "Strength would be incredible Instructor with a positive outlook. Weakness would be class material and lecture; not academically beneficial.",
                "strength is JANE!! she is an amazing TF who could answer all our questions and taught us insightful and important information during section and her review sessions. weakness is that the PSETs were really long and you can lose a lot of points. i suggest making a study group to check PSET answers the night before submission (you're allowed to do this!).",
                "More communication and more accessible office hours.",
                "The strength was definitely the professor. He was very animated about the course material, and it was clear that he valued his students. During the semester, I felt like so much information was crammed into each lecture that I could not retain it fast enough, though I understand this is how it has to be. I also think it would have been helpful to go over the Stata input in class instead of watching hour-long videos on how to do it outside of class. Lastly, I wish the psets were not as long because they took me several days to complete.",
                "Strengths: Straightforward, very clear and accessible lecture notes and TF section notes, strong TF team, problem sets and exams are clear. TFs always provide detailed feedback on problem sets and the midterm, which is very helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Problem sets sometimes feel repetitive, though this is also a strength because it helps emphasize certain concepts and forces us to study by repetition",
                "JT's definitely a strength of the course. I can't imagine there exists another statistics or quantitative analysis professor as engaging, entertaining, and energizing as he is, and I think it would be hard to find another lecture this big that feels genuinely conversational at times and where students feel comfortable asking and answering questions (and get called upon by name when they do). Between JT's teaching style and the actual structure of the lectures themselves, attending lecture was actually enjoyable and the material was very digestible. The only weakness I'd mention is that the first pset felt very long and tedious, especially given the length of the stata tutorials required for them. The rest of the psets definitely felt more manageable and JT was definitely generous in extending deadlines, but I think the first one could have been shortened somewhat without materially reducing the amount we learned from it.",
                "Strengths: PSets are straight-forward and so are the exams, JT is your best resource",
                "JT is amazing and great.",
                "Strengths - Amazing professor, there is a lot of information but it builds off of itself so it's pretty digestible.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Pset are pretty long/tedious sometimes.",
                "JT is a really engaging lecturer. The PSETs are long, but helpful in internalizing the course curriculum. I do wish, however, there were resources other than just lecture slides and PSETs and discussion sections to help us understand the content, as there is A LOT of content to remember in a short amount of time.",
                "JT is an awesome lecturer. He is extremely charismatic and also provided very clear explanations of the concepts we covered. Studying for the AQA final, I was struck by how much Ive learned and how interesting JT made the statistical theory we covered. The psets and tests were also very reasonable given what we went over in class. I took this class as a prereq, and it exceeded expectations by a large margin.\r\n\r\nThe class has two weaknesses that I want to emphasize are very small by comparison. First, the psets are pretty long. The workload for the class is quite reasonable overall, but I spent an average of maybe 6-8 hours on each pset. It might have been nice to have smaller psets every week than to have longer ones assigned biweekly. Second, the grading is a bit pedantic. For instance, I received a deduction on the midterm for listing one assumption as n > 30 instead of sufficient sample size for the sampling distribution to be normally distributed, which is true when n > 30 (by the way, the first one was what was on the answer key provided in the practice problems). Your interpretations also need to be worded in very specific ways. I understand, but given that this is the case, it wouldve been helpful to have more examples or for the teaching team to have published pset answers after they were due. You are allowed to appeal point deductions, which I appreciate. But a lot of students dont because they dont want to be a pest over a point here or there.",
                "Strength is JT -- he really makes up for the boringness of the material. The p-sets are super tedious and graded really nit-pickily.",
                "JT explains things very well, in my opinion. The course organization was a little messy, partially because we missed a week due to JT having COVID, so the course was much busier in the second half of the semester. I think that the professor and TFs could have been a bit more explicit about their expectations for the psets, i.e. reiterate exactly and all of what JT says in class. Otherwise, I think it's a great and well taught course.",
                "Simply a great course and it has everything to do with the instructor.",
                "I think the material is conveyed well and engagingly in lecture. JT is great, and the TAs were also really helpful. One of the best organized courses I have taken. The only downside is that JT is very slow to respond to emails. In my case, I did not get a response to any of my three emails.",
                "The strength of this course is that it is very well organized. I was never confused about what work I had to complete or how far along I should be in the textbook readings. There are also a lot of resources that students are able to access to be successful in the course.",
                "The actual lecture was incredibly engaging. The pace of the course was just right (we moved fast but always took time to really unpack confusing concepts), and I felt that it was generally well organized. I think that the class would not have been as good without JT, who was an amazing professor. Section was not always useful and many people did not attend. I think that if section provided more practice problems or helped with the problem sets, more people would come.",
                "the pacing of this course is very manageable and it is well organized. JT is a great instructor, who gives engaging lectures and the teaching staff are also great.",
                "This course is very well taught in that everything is well explained and problems are walked through. Although, the problem sets were very long and time consuming.",
                "JT is a big strength of this course. Weaknesses: ridiculously long problem sets, lack of support (TF office hours were 1 hour/week at 8 or 9am), and lots of grading discrepancies. It's VERY unclear what is expected for the open-ended questions, and it's frustrating that the same answers are graded very differently.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- covers a great deal of material\r\n- very structured according to units and what is being covered\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- sometimes over-whelming\r\n- repetitive in a way that is sometimes confusing"

                "Yes! If you're going to take any statistics class at Yale, this is the one to take. Especially for those continuing onto AQA 2, having this class and knowing JT is hugely useful. As someone who has never taken a statistics class before, this was accessible, but even my friends who had prior experience gained a lot out of the class and the depth it goes into.",

                "It does a great job as a course requirement for GLBL 121. For students going through the major, no matter their quantitative abilities, they need not be concerned. The way it is taught welcomes students of all skill levels.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in gaining a foundational understanding of statistics. The comfortable learning environment of this course (generated in large part by the professor) is a great place to explore something totally new.",
                "Yes. . . I really enjoyed the lectures and learned how to analyze different types of data",
                "No, I have told other students to not take this course. The material is arbitrary and unclear; I believe it takes a special person to find it remotely enticing. Overall steer clear unless you have a love for data analysis.",
                "yes but only if you need it as a pre-req",
                "No, unless you need it for your major.",
                "Yes, I would recommend the class to any Global Affairs majors or students expanding their knowledge of statistics. Now that I have completed it, I can look back and see how much I have learned, even if the journey was not an easy one.",
                "I recommend GLBL 121 to any interested Global Affairs or EP&E major (it is required anyway). It won't be your favorite course ever, but at six problem sets and two exams, it is very manageable. I strongly recommend forming a study group early on as it makes doing the problem sets and studying for the exams MUCH easier.",
                "For sure. The majority of the students taking this class are Global or EP&E majors taking it as a requirement or prereq, but even if you're majoring in something else, I would definitely recommend taking it. If you're going to conduct or analyze research for any purpose at any point, the methods and theoretical toolkit you learn in AQA will be immensely helpful. The psets can be a lot of work at times and I would recommend having a high attention to detail as you complete them, but JT's a great, engaging lecturer who genuinely makes class enjoyable and also really does help guide you through the material and creates an atmosphere where you feel comfortable asking questions and know you will receive helpful responses. If you're deciding between AQA and another stats course, I can't directly compare the material (as I haven't taken any others), but JT alone should be enough to push you to take this one.",
                "Highly recommend this class even if you don't intend on being a Global or EPE major! JT is one of the best and most dynamic profs you will likely have here.  Even if you don't like Stats, take it for JT! I promise that you will not only get a strong grounding in statistical methods, but also a new favorite prof!",
                "JT is amazing and great.",
                "Absolutely. Even if you don't plan on going into fields that use these skills, it will make you a much better consumer of research. Also, JT is a great professor.",
                "Take it if its required. Useful for global and poli sci. Would not recommend if you are looking for an introductory statistics course.",
                "Yes! I highly recommend AQA. JT is awesome, the material on tests and psets is quite fair given what youre taught in class, and this is a very accessible introduction to statistics. JT also makes the theory super interesting. I can honestly say that I find the theory behind the Central Limit Theorem/Law of Large Numbers, chi-squared distribution, Type I/Type II error, and regression fascinating, which is really not something I expected I would say prior to taking this class.",
                "I would. Or just in general, take a statistics class if you haven't before -- it might be a little boring at times, but I think it's important. And if you're gonna, might as well take it with JT cuz he's rlly fun. But its mostly GLBL and EPE ppl who take this class anyway",
                "Yes, I would recommend taking this as your introductory statistics class before S&DS 230. You will succeed if you memorize and reiterate, and in the process you will be able to understand basic stats concepts.",

                "I would recommend this course. It is very well organized and teaches you very important skills.",
                "Yes! This class is so much better than it sounds! JT is an awesome lecturer who knows how to keep 100 people engaged about statistics. You really learn a lot every class, and it truly feels very applicable. The class is challenging enough to feel rewarding while not being discouragingly challenging. There are a few things that could be improved, the main one being very unclear and inconsistent grading, but it's honestly the best stats/econometrics class offered.",
                "Yes, I would certainly recommend this course to students looking to gain quantitative skills for global affairs-type data analysis. I wouldn't recommend it otherwise simply because of the workload and the access to other more general statistics classes.",
                "Yes! Especially if you are a GLBL or EPE major! JT is excellent, and he makes every class interesting and easy to understand the theory."
