                "While I can't say I learned anything \"new\" in this class, it was a good chance to review concepts I had learned in earlier Japanese classes. This was helpful because I think even though these nuances were familiar, such as \"no\" vs \"koto\" or transitive vs intransitive, I did not really understand how to use them the first time around.",
                "Great way to improve your Japanese skills and understanding of Japanese culture and current affairs.",
                "I gained knowledge about a new world of Japanese, starting with newspaper articles. Learning Japanese has been very concrete for me (learning how to read, speak, etc.), but being able to read between the lines and understand underlying thoughts abstractly is something I never did until this class. I believe  that this class is very good to take to progress into the Advanced Japanese realm.",

                "We can share different options on different topics such as social issues, politics, gender discrimination, pandemics, sports, and games which are very interesting.",
                "Strength: good chance/environment at Yale to practice Japanese. Weakness: no syllabus, slightly unorganized.",
                "I believe the course could have been more structured. Particularly, the topics we discuss in class were not disclosed to us beforehand (i.e. no syllabus), which makes preparation for the class impossible. It might have been done on purpose, but this is not so effective, as some of us who have lower command of language might not have enough time to get used to the new or more technical vocabularies pertaining to said topics. This hampered my learning pace.\r\n\r\nThe class materials were articles from the news or a transcript from famous speeches. Those are great choices. However, compared to other advanced language classes (say Chinese), their worksheets are much more comprehensive with highlights on common useful phrases, topic-specific vocabularies, and idioms. As a non-native, these are hard to identify. Having just these \"aids\" being prepared would have helped immensely with the learning process. Contrastly, I had to create my own vocab list, and most of the words or phrases in that list were not even frequently used in the first place - a lot of wasted efforts here.      \r\n\r\nWe also did not get timely feedback on the weekly assignments. It was quite difficult to improve without such feedback.",
                "I think that the course was difficult to keep organized. This was mostly because the class had students of many different levels, but it felt like there was not much of a progression or sense of where the course was headed. We read articles, watched a TV series, and had chances to practice using Japanese, but one major difficulty was that we did not receive individualized feedback until about the last month of class. If there was more personalized corrections in homework, I think I would have been more aware of the mistakes I made.",
                "Weaknesses is just that there aren't enough higher level Japanese classes, so everyone above a certain point are all crammed in the same class. \r\nStrengths are the relevance of present day material.",
                "Not enough speaking practice",
                "Strengths: Not super difficult (you won't be assigned hours of homework) relative to other Japanese courses at Yale. \r\n- Also you get to watch Hanzawa Naoki in-depth, which is an amazing show that I believe everyone should watch.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's nothing on the professor, but the people who are in the class are sometimes at very different Japanese skill level, which can lead to a discrepancy between students. Many grad students and heritage speakers take this course, so the type of Japanese learning that is needed for each student varies.",
                "Nakamura-sensei designs the course to be highly malleable to the needs and wants of students. This is fantastic for a wide variety of reasons, but I think it may have overwhelmed her ability to evaluate our academic performance. We didn't have much in the way of exams or other evaluations, and we didn't get very many grades back. Overall, though, I'd take this tradeoff any day because the adaptability was great."
