                "Getting better at French. We discussed several grammatical structures, did comprehensive units on La Symphonie Pastorale, World War 2 and the Holocaust in France, and a small survey of some francophone literature.",
                "This course was an amazing way to develop and hone in on my French skills. Whether it was grammar, speaking, or listening skills, class with Madame Burton was literally the best. I learned so much about French literature and history associated with Francophone countries.",
                "Better reading comprehension and listening skills in French language.",

                "The class covers a lot of material, but at times, the amount of work seemed to be unnecessary.",

                "It is so hard",
                "Strengths: Professor Burton is absolutely phenomenal. The Sac de Billes curriculum and emphasis on speaking were also strengths.",
                "One strength of this course is that it meets on a consistent basis, therefore aiding students to develop language skills every day. There are no obvious weaknesses of the course.",
                "I think the biggest strength of the class was the breadth of what we covered--we spent time on literature, history, and pure French grammar without it ever feeling repetitive or unnecessary. The weekly actualites were fun and refreshing, and the exposes at the end were very informative. That said, I think it would be possible to streamline the ending of the class--or at least to redistribute that work. The month of April was extremely busy in this class, and I think rescheduling parts of it to even that workload across the semester would have been very nice.",
                "You will have to dedicate a lot of time into this course. L4 is not a joke and, if youre not really interested in the language, you are not going to enjoy it at all. Madame Burton was honestly the best professor I could ask forits a true shame she wont be teaching this course in the future.",
                "Strengths \r\n-great planning and enthusiasm from Mme. Burton\r\n-appropriate levels of homework\r\n-frequent feedback \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-would have liked more opportunities to speak, but this was a function of our larger class size",
                "I really appreciated how organized and structured this course was. The clarity of the syllabus and the course packet really helped me follow along with the material. I also appreciated how many extra resources were made available."

For anyone looking to develop an understanding for more advanced French, I would recommend this course.",
                "If it's something in which you are interested in and\/or need for the language requirement, I'd recommend it. The general workload was about an hour a night and an hour and a half over the weekend, but toward the end of the semester there were a good number of projects and films that bumped it up. I think some of Madame Burton was wonderful at explaining the concepts and teaching them to us, and the fact that she was a native English speaker who learned French helped her greatly in teaching us.",
