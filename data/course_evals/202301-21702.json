                "Strengths: Course material is extremely interesting, you learn a LOT, and weekly quizzes are very manageable. The professors are very knowledgeable about the subject, and are always receptive to clarifying questions. Lectures are also recorded, which really helps with studying. Weaknesses: The material is very complicated, and often slides do not have enough information (most of fit is transmitted orally). Additionally, the class grading system is 25% for each of the three exams, and then 25% for the quizzes, so there is not a lot of room for error - if you do well with exams it is fine, but just something to keep in mind.",
                "The lecture slides not being posted to canvas before the lecture made it very hard for me to absorb the information during lecture since I was too busy writing down the information on the slides. I think that by releasing them before it makes it easier to learn.",
                "It gives a very detailed introduction to developmental biology, which sometimes is a lot too detailed and specific regarding only 1 cell type.",
                "It was very well laid out",
                "Strengths: The material is very interesting and the lectures are engaging. I like the weekly quizzes as it encourages you to review and engage with the material as you go along and not just before the exam. The exams are also very manageable and non-cumulative which is nice because there is a lot of material being covered. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there would've been some sort of formal weekly discussion section where we had a chance outside of lecture to go through the important concepts again and ask questions, as well as read more about the current research going on in the field.",
                "The quizzes are too much of a hit or miss and sometimes cover very obscure topics. The class averages have been 70s and the class is generally not curved.",
                "The course covers a lot of information in a relatively short amount of time between various exams. The two professors are strict and refused makeups of quizzes or excused absences even with a Dean's extension or excuse. It felt like they were unwilling to work with the students in the class. Some notes or powerpoints were inaccessible due to the usage of an outdated website, which made the fast pace of lecture feel even worse."

                "I would! You definitely need to be interested in the material and willing to put in the extra work when studying for exams and quizzes, but the class is incredibly interesting and well taught. I never knew I was interested in the material until I actually started learning it. Although the grade breakdown can be scary, it really isn't that bad if you take good notes and study for the exams.",
                "Unless you really have to take the course I would not recommend taking it, since you will have to prepare for very specific and overly complicated exam questions that were not really discussed in lecture.",
                "If you're interested in biology, yes, but if not, absolutely not. It can be very dry and boring to those who aren't interested.",
                "Yes! This is has been one of my favorite MCDB classes I have taken at Yale. The lectures are very engaging and rewarding. You will learn a lot and it is important to review the material as you go along because the concepts will build on each other as you go through the semester. It is a manageable workload, with weekly quizzes (not that hard if you attend and review the lectures) and three non-cumulative exams."
