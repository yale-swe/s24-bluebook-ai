My only suggestion for improvement is to include more opportunities to translate texts relevant to our fields of study, either as homework assignments or possibly as an exam.",
                "There is too much work. I would have gotten just as much out of the course if there had been fewer practice sentences each week, for example. It didn't move too fast for me, BUT I'd done a lot of German grammar previously, so I imagine that it would for someone with less experience. I liked the format of reading the textbook then getting the exact same information again in video form (with helpful insights from the prof) as it made sure I really took in the information.",
                "The strengths of the course are that it allows students to go through the material at their own pace and get feedback on their work so they know how to improve. As far as weaknesses, I think it is always challenging to do a language course in such a short amount of time.",
