For example, the course had one lecture where we went over an example of deep learning, but if you don't have an existing background in it or do research outside of class, you're not going to get much out of that. I'm a little split on my feelings of how well I feel I've learned the topics of the course. Roy himself would say this is a survey class, so it's not the place to learn any of these topics in depth, but rather you should take more classes that go into greater depth.

They are very interesting and do a very good job challenging us to practice the concepts we've learned in class.\r\n\r\nThe course could be improved if it was more engaging. I loved the two classes where we split into groups and worked through a pandas exercise together. Everyone was very engaged, and I learned a lot from my classmates, which was awesome. In normal classes, I felt like many people were tuning out.",

Especially since the homework that followed was so closely related to the class work\r\n\r\nOne of the TFs also made a \"coding best practices\" document after the first programming assignment was graded, and it was super useful! Might want to just post it on the class server before the first homework is even assigned in future classes!",

Additionally, the lack of a clear course layout and deadlines was frustrating, as homework deadlines were constantly moved around and it felt like a lot of them were backloaded which made the end of the semester rather stressful. I also felt like the expectations for the homeworks weren't very clear, especially for the final extra credit assignment where we weren't really given any direction. Lastly, the lack of effort to upload or live stream lectures was very frustrating, given the fact that we are in a pandemic and the instructor was not willing to be understanding.\r\nI thought the problem sets were interesting, and useful in understanding Python syntax and data structures. Additionally, the in class work was useful. I also thought the ed discussion was helpful, as well as the student collaboration.",

                "It's nice to get a chance to use Python in an S&DS course. Most of the S&DS courses I've taken use R. Really liked getting the chance to learn how to use GitHub--really hope that is kept in future iterations of the course! However, as the course is currently organized, I don't think students are able to get the most out of the material and tools we work with (which are genuinely very interesting/useful!). I think code in the lecture notes could be commented better and headers made more clear (especially as this is an expectation for us when turning in our assignments--I don't think the lecture code provides a good example of this!). For example, there would be a code block that purposefully didn't run in order to demonstrate a common mistake or error. However, instead of an explanation in the code comments or markdown text around the code, there was typically only an \"oops\" written. Yeah... not particularly illuminating. One could argue we should take notes during class on this (and I did when the code was run/explained in class), but Roy often leaves large sections of the lecture notes for us to run and understand on our own. Comments would be super appreciated for clarity and learning here!!!! The latex documents with the more theory-centric lectures were much better organized and explained than the jupyter notebook files. Roy is a very kind professor and seems invested in student learning, but I unfortunately didn't really click with his lecture style. It wasn't the Jupyter notebooks per se, more just his way of explaining things.\r\n\r\nThe TF Daniel was great. One of the peer tutors (shout-out to Sam) was also really helpful in office hours and clearly knew the material and the math behind it, and could answer questions in a detailed manner. I didn't feel the same way about the other ULA's, who essentially worked exclusively off their homework solutions from the previous years.",

                "A real strength of the course is the individuality - you can really figure out the psets by yourself and learn in a trial by error way, which I personally liked a lot. There are also a lot of opportunities to ask questions via GitHub and Ed. A weakness would be that the lectures can be a bit dry. It is also tough to really understand the participation component of the grade because it seems difficult to fulfill and encourages students to ask random questions that they don't actually need answered.",
                "Lectures felt pretty ineffective in this course. There were a lot of typos and mistakes and it felt kind of arbitrary and disorganized. It didn't really feel like prof Lederman was very engaged in the course. The homeworks were the same way. The course had a lot of potential in terms of useful stats skills but was disappointing because it was disorganized and not engaging at all",

I learned absolutely nothing and the structure was horrible. The work was not hard, but it was useless. There were so many typos and mistakes to the point that the material and assignments became confusing (also little effort to fix this). The lectures were so unengaging and not helpful that there was no use in going, but I still went because there was a \"participation\" portion of the grade of this lecture. This course is not required for anything, so absolutely no one should take it. Seriously, if you are reading this, please do not take this course. I cannot go back in time and change my decision to take the course, but do not make the same mistake as me. There are plenty of better and more useful S&DS courses to take. Do not take this because you think it will be easy. While it was not challenging, it was a complete waste of time. You will regret it.",

Roy is a really kind person and in my opinion, does genuinely care about student learning. Roy bills this as a survey course, an introduction to the topics that doesn't go in-depth. He recommends you take further classes in the topics to truly learn them. There are a lot of pre-reqs though... to the point that many people in the course are upperclassmen and only have so much time to actually do that. Keep that in mind when managing expectations for what you'd get out of this course. I didn't think lectures were very well-organized or engaging.
