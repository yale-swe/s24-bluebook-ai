                "I learned about how to read and breakdown scientific/mathematical research papers. It was neat to see math modeling biological phenomena. I learned what common terms in differential equations referred to and represent. Further, I learned how to predict behavior of functions when one variable changes and talk about the biological real world significance of that. All of that on top of calc BC.",
                "The most valuable skill I gained from this course was becoming more comfortable with scientific writing and articles. I'd say the mathematical growth was to be expected in a math course, but I saw so much more value in being able to look at a model presented in a paper and read it like an equation. I was able to make sense of the models and such. If you're interested in using math practically, this course definitely gives you a good foundation because it takes things from meaningless numbers to actual scenarios. Most papers were pretty interesting! I also got more mathematically creative (if that makes any sense). The course gave me a bunch of methods to achieve a goal, but it was up to me to think through what avenue would best lead me to what was being looked for in the problem. Really thought I'd dread this course, but I actually ended up enjoying it upon reflection.",

            "comments": [
                "The course is good at introducing students to math in conjunction with the life sciences, though it was very dissimilar to 115 and traditional Calc 2 courses.",
                "Since we had to read scientific papers some class time was devoted to discussing those and that took away from class time learning about non-reading related material. \r\nIt felt like we did not spend a lot of time on any given topic, some more than others, there was a lot of time spent on phase planes. This was fine but it just took some getting used to and a lot of practice. Another major weakness was how everyone felt very unprepared to do the problem sets and it was almost like office hours were a required part of the class. \r\nIt would have been way too difficult to complete any problems set Without attending at least one full office hour session.However even though the class did not correlate with the homework, the homework problems definitely translated to what would be on the test. So did the practice tests. So it kind of balanced out and I was able to be well prepared for the test.",
                "This course is strong in the applications of the math; it made things more manageable and useful. The weakness comes primarily from the instructors' blindspots. At this point in their math careers, they probably see things a lot easier than students. As a student, however, a lot of the insights the professors insisted were intuitive did not seem intuitive at all. In fact, in a lot of situations, if you gave me what was given on an exam, I would not be able to draw the conclusions our professors drew in just a few minutes. As an FGLI student coming from a low-income, public high school, I did not feel like there was an adequate enough effort to make the math less foreign, especially in a room filled with peers who attended the top private schools in the nation. Another weakness came from the professors' lack of knowledge in the science aspect of the class. They were mathematicians before they were scientists, I'm assuming, so it makes sense. I feel like we missed several opportunities to have engaging discussions on the science or social science aspects of what we discussed. For example, the ozone reading we did resembled a free radical reaction discussed in my chemistry class. Predation, especially, could be a cool science discussion.",
                "The content is so far removed from anything I will have to do outside of the classroom, and even from other math classes, that my friends in the   math levels above me couldn't even comprehend what I was doing. In addition, the problem sets are so difficult that going to office hours is basically a requirement for getting a decent grade on them, which took up an extra 8-10 hours of my week. I did not enjoy this course.",
                "Very streamlined and all assignments and tests and reading connect well",
                "I genuinely think that being able to look at the applications of what were learning in class to real life is cool. I dont think that this course is especially helpful for pre-med students and I would even go so far as to say that the course description falsely advertises that. I dont think we spent enough time on the readings in class because the professors were hell-bent on cramming a ton of content into each class period. I would have also liked to see more time devoted to understanding the material being taught in class by giving us time to work on example problems in class. Sometimes, this is was allowed but simple things such as how desks are arranged can affect the facilitation of group work. There are a number of other things that I consider weaknesses about the course such as the fact that we were learning new material on the problem sets and that some problem sets would be due immediately after we cover its content in class. As someone who did not take Calc BC in high school, I also think that the professors assumed I knew a lot more than I actually did.",
                "The strengths were in the exposure to different readings and materials. I also thought the teaching was good but the weaknesses were in how we were evaluated. A lot of what was on the problem sets was not taught in class and it was needed to seek extra help in order to be able to answer questions. That disconnect made the course very difficult.",
                "The class moved very fast at times so I think recorded lectures would be beneficial.",
                "overall very good",
                "The course moved at an appropriate pace, and the tests seemed to be at a fair level. I would have liked to see more opportunities to ask questions throughout the course, however; classes were mostly spent on covering new concepts, and extra help sessions mainly ran through problem sets without much time to dissect them.",
                "The practice exams and solutions (both written and video) were SUPER HELPFUL. Cannot emphasize this enough. This is how I prepared for the tests and I did well enough. Also the review sessions with Professor Hall were great. \r\n\r\nAll the peer tutors were amazing. I went to their office hours a few times and without fail they helped so much. Huge thanks to them. \r\n\r\nI loved the time we spent discussing the papers, and that this made our class not purely math. They made the class so much more interesting, but also harder, because they were a lot more conceptual, rather than step-by-step formulas for the actual math part that once you understood the mechanics, you were set. \r\n\r\nThe extra credit assignment, homework assignments, readings, etc. definitely boosted my grade. \r\n\r\nThe lectures were chaotic. Not how they were structured but the information was being provided felt that way. I often took notes, but I was just writing down symbols that I did not know the meaning of. \r\n\r\nProfessor Hall was great. Ridiculously smart, super helpful, and explained everything so well.",
                "The course focused on applications of biological models that were rarely applicable to encounters of most students everyday lives. The course would be more engaging if the readings were more relevant and helpful for students wanting to pursue biology-related studies."

I took this class because I did not want to take a class similar to what I had taken in high school and it definitely added another dimension and more challenges and it was interesting. However I would not recommend this class to someone who isNot interested in math or science nor to someone who does not want you to vote a lot of time to a math class. Otherwise I would definitely recommend it because it challenged my brain in new ways that math never has because of the added biology dimension.",
                "I would recommend this course over math 115 because math without application is dead. Any other math course would've left me hanging as far as using the theoretical math went. I found the readings a welcome break from the endless slew of numbers I'd been accustomed to in a math course. For FGLI students coming from regular public high schools, I'd say this course was my biggest source of catch-up in college. I was surrounded by peers who'd gone to the best high schools and who had 5's on the AP Calc BC exam as the norm at their high school. I remember having to study extra hard for exams because the skills and techniques were genuinely new to me versus my peers who seemed to be coasting with semester-long review. There wasn't a feeling of camaraderie in the class because everyone was so distant from one another.",
                "No. Nearly everything done is this class will never be used again once this class is done. I was told it would be basically the same as math 115 but with a biology focus. However, having talked to friends in 115, the difference between the two is massive, and I feel wildly unprepared to move onto the next level of math should I need to, because the content was just so divergent. This class requires extensive office hour attendance, and it took up way more time than I was anticipating it to. If you don't truly enjoy math for math's sake, I wouldn't recommend this class.",

                "If you are a bio / life sciences student, take this class instead of Math 115. You get to read biological papers that use the mathematical methods learned in the course. This makes it more interesting but also a bit more challenging than a standard math course because it is more conceptual.",
