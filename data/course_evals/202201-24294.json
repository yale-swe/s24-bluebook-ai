                "The videos were really interesting. The class made me look at dance in a totally different way. The course is hard and it is difficult to write a dance essay without having any background doing it. The assignments are fun but challenging.",
                "I think the interactive format of the course was great. I think something that could be improved is offering a means of improvement - I felt a bit like grades were stagnant throughout the semester and based more on impression of the student rather than the actual work produced."

                "Yes, especially if you are interested in dance or writing about movement. Class is well-structured to expose you to many varieties of dance styles and dance writing. Feedback is excellent, as nearly every class dedicates significant time to workshopping each student's essay. Professor Seibert always gives tons of comments as well, and is super nice and incredibly knowledgable about the subject. Workload can be high, however; each essay takes a lot of thought to compose. Grading can also be tough relative to other classes, but it is fair.",
