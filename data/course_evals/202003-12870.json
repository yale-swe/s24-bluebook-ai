                "The course is well structured to promote learning and is very interactive.\r\n\r\nA huge issue of the course is the inherent disparity between students of different backgrounds. Unfortunately, it will be incredibly difficult for students coming in without any spanish background, which is obviously troubling for an introductory course. The course needs to think more about grading on improvement that simply raw ability to speak and write, because it is clearly unfair in this regard.",
                "Strengths are opportunities for class participation and interaction, clarity, and speed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses were just the deficits of online learning, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. Obviously considering the pandemic, conversation and practicing speaking through Zoom was not ideal, but in our class we still found a way to talk a lot and engage with each other. My only grievance with the course is that sometimes the homework assignments were really repetitive, but I understand that repetition is a necessary part of learning a new language. Maybe once in a while as a treat we could have a shorter homework day or a day without Supersite homework or something. Overall, though, I really don't have any complaints about this course. Muy divertido!",

We had breakout rooms in which we'd speak in Spanish with one or two other students, which was an effective way to practice some of the grammatical rules. We also did asynchronous days on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which I liked a lot. We would have some extra homework on those days, and while conversation is very important for absorbing a new language, having those days to study on our own was very effective for me.",
