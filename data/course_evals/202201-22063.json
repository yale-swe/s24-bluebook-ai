An improvement to the class would be to get the homework assignments released earlier to give us more time to do it. The assignments didnt take long, but the short time frame to compete them didnt leave a lot of time to ask questions or add the class kinda stressful especially when you had other assignments due.",
                "Great class! Labs are straightforward and procedures easy to follow; I also liked that the labs were done in groups/pairs -lab work should be collaborative! Homeworks were also very straightforward and didnt take too long I liked that there were no tedious and long lab reports. One thing -a better explanation of the procedures and background information for each lab should be provided beforehand."

                "Yes! Great lab class that is very little work (one hw every couple of weeks with a few straightforward questions to answer) and professors are really kind. Also all work is done in groups/pairs and you carry out the steps of each procedure with the professor/class which is great -avoids confusion. You also learn basic lab techniques that are applicable in a wide variety of contexts outside repro lab which is very helpful!"
