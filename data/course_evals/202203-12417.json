                "This course helped further my interest in space as a non-astro STEM major.",
                "I learnt about the fundamental skills needed to understand concepts in detecting exoplanets, studying black holes, and understanding cosmological models. Overall, the course gave me a good understanding of the topics discussed in astrophysics. I also learnt about general relativity and other fundamental concepts in physics necessary to explore topics in astrophysics.",
                "This course introduced me to the field of astrophysics and some of its current core topics, including exoplanets, black holes, and cosmology. It taught me how to apply principles from my introductory physics and calculus courses to everything from determining the orbital period of an exoplanet, to calculating the age of a matter-dominated Universe, to determining the amount of time experienced by an object facing the general relativistic effects of a black hole. At the beginning of this course, I couldn't tell you the difference between a raindrop and a stone (two different models to explain general relativistic metrics, for the uninitiated), but after taking this course, I have the confidence to go further with astrophysics.",
                "Understanding of exoplanet detection. More informed understanding of both cosmology and astronomy.",
                "The course was divided into three subtopics: exoplanets, black holes, and cosmology. I have a much better understanding on all three since completing the course. I especially appreciated the black holes section as I had previously encountered special relativity in a prior physics course, but through Professor Daisuke's teaching of it, understood it much better than I had before. This allowed for a lot better understanding of general relativity as a result, something I was always interested in but never quite understood.",
                "Learned about gravitational dynamics, general relativity, black holes, dark matter, and cosmology. Great survey of these topics to learn about different parts of physics and the understanding of derivations behind them without needing to know all the details",
                "Good introduction to exoplanet research and history, black holes and relativity, and cosmology (study of the origin of the universe and the early universe).",
                "I learned the mathematical concepts and fundamentals of our current knowledge of exoplanet search, black holes, and the structure and evolution of our universe. From these three topics we got a better understanding of the current field of astrophysics and astronomy while practicing the fundamental equations and math behind it all.",
                "I learned about modern topics in astrophysics: exoplanets, black holes, general relativity and cosmology.",
                "Dr. Nagai clearly cares a lot about the material he is teaching. He also was really receptive to suggestions from students and TAs about how things could be improved. With that said, this class was pretty challenging at times, and it often felt as if the TAs knew very little about what material we would be evaluated on. The psets were occasionally brutal, and the material did get a lot more difficult about halfway through the semester. However, I felt that Dr. Nagai was understanding when we struggled with the class. \r\n\r\nI know a lot of non-astro majors take this class. As an astrophysics major, it was definitely a hard class, but I honestly feel that I gained really valuable intuition for some important concepts! I also enjoyed how flexible the final project/presentation was; being able to work with a partner was also really nice."

            "comments": [
                "Not enough equations give, could rely more on the textbooks",
                "This was a very interesting course where you learn a lot in a short amount of time. Sometimes, because of the pretty abstract ideas of relativity, it was quite difficult to understand the material.",
                "Personally I liked that it had a lot of breadth. One weakness of this course is that it was quite difficult. I believe that homework should be used for mastery of content previously taught, but at times it felt like I was learning through the homework  this created stress as there was a trade-off between really understanding certain formulas and merely using them so that I can finish the homework on time. \r\n\r\nIt would help if there were worked solutions provided for reference.",
                "This course is extremely well-designed. It is accessible to nearly all upper-level STEM students with only single-variable calculus and introductory physics as prerequisites, yet it makes full use each student's prior coursework as all topics are taught from a mathematical foundation. Each of the three main topics receive a good deal of coverage, yet each topic is covered efficiently to ensure all three can fit into one semester. Students are encouraged to pick a subtopic that interests them to conduct more in-depth research to present to the rest of the class. The lectures are interesting and explain each topic thoroughly despite no prior knowledge being assumed, while the homework allows students to drill down the mathematical underpinnings of each concept. Overall, the course masters the balance of being accessible to a broad audience while covering its content with the depth expected of an upper-level course.",
                "It was a highly engaging course with incredibly interesting material to pair. It was a tad bit disorganized in a few respects, but this is to be expected given its recent \"hiatus\".",
                "I felt so supported by Professor Daisuke and the two TFs, Isaque and Naomi. Professor Daisuke held office hours directly after class and was so welcoming and patient with clarifying material from the lecture. I found that any questions I had during class were always answered right after and it made me feel very seen as a student and supported. Isaque and Naomi also were able to explain course material in ways that helped deepen my understanding and integral in supporting me through completing homework assignments. There was plenty of support made available throughout the course and I found that it was necessary to have.",
                "Strengths: course format was so helpful for learning a lot. Lectures were well made learning even if you miss class\r\n\r\nWeakness: problem sets were really long and hard beyond the point of learning new things",
                "Strengths: legitimately an \"intro\" course, but still somewhat in-depth; Prof Nagai very enthusiastic about the material; good balance between types of assignments; great textbooks; very organized; clear and thorough feedback on assignments: Prof Nagai + TAs very willing to help and helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: not explicit about where/when assumptions are made; some PSETs that required one to look up an equation/go to office hours; Mathematica usage required but not taught (although Mathematica only needed for two PSETs).",
                "I suppose I should have realized going into the course, however 3 midterms became overwhelming toward the end of the course when we had a midterm due the same week as our final presentation, which was the week before our final paper was due. The course just seemed slightly unbalanced and required much higher-level skills in computer science than I initially thought.",
                "A strength of this course is the variety of topics as it gave us a wider understanding of the astrophysics field and the current beliefs and topics in it. A weakness could be the mathematical focus of the course as it was very math heavy which did not allow much time for help conceptualizing the problems and topics discussed. More emphasis on visualizing or setting up problems rather than just using equations would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: the material is very engaging. All the concepts we discussed were interesting and relevant. General relativity and cosmology are topics that are difficult to grasp, especially since they are math-intensive and tough to visualize, but I think the professor did a good job of introducing them and giving a general overview. Weaknesses: the class went very quickly and sometimes it felt like we were just getting hit with a ton of equations, without getting any of the motivation or derivation behind them. The exams were also unreasonably long, which may just be because the material is inherently difficult."

In fact, I've already encouraged several of my friends to take it next year. It's a great course for applying mathematical tools to real-world topics in astrophysics, and for me personally, it's taken me from a point where I had no prior exposure in the field to a point where I feel comfortable completing a senior project in computational cosmology.",
                "Yes. It was incredibly fun, and although definitely stressful at times, the TAs were extremely helpful and responsive throughout the whole process.",
                "Yes! I think this is a great course to cover so many new and interesting subtopics in modern day astronomy. This course requires work just as any STEM class would due to PSETs and exams. However, the class is so well organized and without the stress of a cumulative final, it allowed me to give my all during each subtopic but also not be weighed down later in the semester if I didn't completely master a previous concept which is often the trouble in my previous STEM courses.",
                "If you felt comfortable in introductory physics then definitely if you have watched a video about aliens or black holes and want to understand the cutting edge physics to understand these topics. Each topic is so cool, the course doesn't go too fast, but the homeworks are kind of challenging",
                "Yes! Learned a lot. But beware the end of the semester: PSETs as normal, plus, presentation, research paper, and final midterm do create a lot of work.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as it is very interesting and has engaging topics in the current field of astrophysics. Just be aware it is primarily a math/physics course focused on astronomy applications with less qualitative discussion of ideas.",
                "I would recommend if you are interested in astrophysics. The material is just so cool and mind-blowing.",
                "As an astrophysics major looking for an engaging elective, then probably! If you're not in the major, I would definitely consider the amount of time you're willing to dedicate to an optional class (maybe credit/D)."
