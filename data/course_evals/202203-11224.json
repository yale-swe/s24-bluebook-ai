                "Strengths: The office hour setup and close connection to the textbook was critical for students who weren't able to understand a concept the first time around. and Prof Wooster made an active effort to engage students in the teachings of probability through asking for our (often wrong) intuitions before presenting the theory.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course sometimes moved at varying paces, with some weeks that introduced a lot of new and complex content at once.",
                "Keep the course as is.",
                "This course is well-designed and uses a great textbook. The problem sets were doable and office hours were frequent. It was great overall!",
                "I was extremely nervous about taking this course as I have always been bad at probability, but Professor Wooster taught it in a way that was so understandable and not terrifying. The lectures were extremely thorough, and the textbook was also very detailed and well-explained. I think the only improvement for this course would be to space out the topics a little better as we sort of rushed through the last two chapters in the final week of courses.",
                "Lectures moved quickly and sometimes didnt go deep enough in depth. Psets were much harder than exams which almost made exams sometimes harder to prep for because it was hard to grasp the concepts using such difficult problems for practice.\r\nSometimes prof Wooster will cover a chapter the day before an exam and put that content on the exam.\r\n\r\nStrengths are that things always felt very fair. If you put in the work youll get a solid outcome",
                "I thought the office hours were really fun, and the lectures were typically pretty engaging as well. Occasionally the professor would run through content a little too quickly, but I enjoyed going over examples in class and found the course to be generally quite interesting. My one recommendation for improvement would be to slow down a bit with a few units that we seemed to sprint through, and to incorporate more examples into the lessons.",
                "The course had a structure that I really like: weekly problem sets and two midterms. It makes it really easy to spread your work out so that you're putting in only a few hours per week and when the tests come you're already 80% prepared.",
                "Strengths: professor wooster and the TFs! so kind, so willing to support you and go through concepts or set up one on one meetings for individualized support if needed. loved the availability of office hours.  the exams were not too bad, just depending on your level of comfort with the material/how easily you can process all the things it might be easy for you to study and get the material or it might take a really long time for you to get it",
                "The problem sets were very hard!",
                "Strength: Dr. Wooster is amazing professor and person; Lectures are pretty engaging; Course content can be challenging but the psets are doable\r\n\r\nWeakness: On some weeks the workload can feel overwhelming depending on what other classes you have, but there are ample amount of OH.",
                "Strengths: Professor Wooster was great. Very helpful and made lectures interesting!\r\nWeaknesses: The psets felt pretty different from the lecture materials as well as from the information on exams that is to say, they were way harder. It pushed me to think though, which was nice. Still, I felt like pset questions were a bit hard.",
                "Strengths of this course included the way that the material built on itself over the semester and the time spent on examples after learning new concepts. Also, I have taken a stats class before using R, and this class did not use it. I am glad we didn't use R with probability because I think I was able to engage with the material better rather than trying to understand the coding part. Another large strength was Professor Wooster! I am also happy that I could take a Probability class with Math 115 background and that I didn't need Math 120. I don't think there were any weaknesses.",
                "I thought that the psets were very challenging, but the tests were very fair and manageable.",
                "Strengths: Professor Wooster and the resources he provides. \r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "Strength: Pace. You'll learn a ton in this class but it is definitely taught at a manageable pace.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Some parts of the class are very simple while others are taught a bit accelerated and harder to keep up with.",
                "Strengths are straightforward content grading and instructor. Weaknesses are homeworks are very difficult, but all the answers are online or in office hours",
                "Strength: Wooster is very nice\r\nWeakness: Class was difficult to follow and HW and practice problems were much more challenging than exams",
                "Lecture style could be improved. Clear outline at the start of the lecture on what the scope is going to be e.g. roadmap.",
                "This was a great course. Prof Wooster and the entire staff made this class not only real world applicable, but also incredibly engaging. I looked forward to class every Monday and Wednesday (and on Friday for mels office hours). Theres nothing I would change about this class."

Prof Wooster is one of the best people I can imagine to teach this content in an accessible way and I was able to look at my other quantitative (and non-quantitative) courses in a new way with this knowledge.",

Whether you're interested in probability (which I didn't think I would be until I took this course) or need to fulfill the probability part of the S&DS certificate (which I also needed to do), this course was challenging but also very rewarding. It is extremely well-taught, which helps make the content less daunting/difficult to learn.",

There's really no need to stress yourself with mathematical theories in 241 unless you're planning to take 242. The psets for this class are actually doable and I thought both midterms and final was really reasonable. The concepts are fairly interesting and Dr. Wooster does a wonderful job explaining during class. He also hosts a lot of OH and the TAs were also super friendly. FYI pset questions are a lot harder than the exam questions, so no need to freak out.",
                "Yes! Especially if you're going for the stats certificate. I liked the class a lot, and think I learned from it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I think that it was interesting content that is very applicable to everyday life and everyone's future professions. This is a class where if you put enough time and effort into it, you are in a great position to do well, and I think that is what makes it a great class. It is interesting, intellectually challenging, and students are equipped to do well.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! Definitely take this if you're doing the S&DS certificate. The class is super manageable and well organized. The material is not too difficult to follow, and Prof Wooster is INCREDIBLE. There's only one pset every week, and OH help so much. The exams are also very reasonable. I learned a lotttttt and there is a lot of real-world applications to the info you learn.",
                "It is a great intro course to probability theory.",
                "Yes! The class was manageable and not too much work. You'll learn a bunch - as long as you stay on top of it it isn't too hard.",
                "Yes. Probability theory is useful but not super easy to understand. Grading is very generous. Homeworks are hard but exams are easy. Dont really need to show up to every class either.",
                "Yes! Excellent introductory class.",
                "For the Data Science Certificate, yes\r\nOtherwise I'd say it's a pretty hard challenge esp for non STEM majors/backgrounds",
                "Yes. Good introduction to probability.",
                "If you need it for the certificate, yea. I think the content of the class is generally interesting, but it's pretty difficult.",
