    "This class goes over survey methodology. Half the course is focused on the psychology of survey response (i.e. how people process and answer survey questions) and half the course is focused on more quantitative methodology. I thought that the first half was pretty interesting, although I wish we had talked more about the book in class (sometimes the lectures felt a bit disconnected with the readings, and sometimes we spent too much time in lectures on things that I thought were a bit obvious). The second half of the course was interesting, although I feel like we did spend as much time on processing survey data as much as I expected. I was hoping that the class would be a bit more quantitative\/stats-heavy.",
    "I have become a lot better at being critical of political surveys and polls, particularly as they are displayed in the media. I am able to have a better grasp of the process of creating a question that can best try to gauge an attitude, and I know now how easily public opinion can sway based on phrasing and biases.",
    "I learned a wide variety of skills and insights particularly in the polling and elections campaign industry. It was an incredible course!",
    "From the course, I was better able to analyze polls and surveys and find possible misleading design biases. Even if you are not going into polling or survey methodology, this class is super interesting and is just helpful when watching CNN or Fox when they start talking about polls.",
    "This course was great in that it focused not only on learning about the theory behind conducting public opinion research, but on applying the theory in practice. I learned about why surveys are conducted, how surveys are conducted, the statistical basis for specific survey practices,  how minute differences in survey design can contribute to wildly different results, and how to be a smart consumer of polling data in the media."

   "comments": [
    "The class was disorganized in its current set up, but I understand the Prof. Gooch is new so it's forgivable! Particularly because he was really engaged in class and did a good job of opening up really interesting conversations. The greatest strength was definitely the fact that he was quite obviously an expert on the material and was genuinely really passionate about what he was teaching about.",
    "The strengths of this course include the professor, the course readings, and the intimate discussions we had.",
    "The class material and assignments are super interesting and actually fun to do. The readings, however, can be highly repetitive as they cover the exact same topics. This can useful if you need a second explanation on a topic, but it also becomes slightly annoying after a couple of weeks.",
    "This course was strong in its focus on both theory and application."

    "Yes! Prof. Gooch knows his shit, and it's really interesting, particularly if you are interested in political psychology and the effects of wording on public opinion. I think it was more interesting for me given my love of hands-on politics, given that this was much less theoretical than other classes (which I liked a lot). Prof. Gooch was a bit disorganized, but he was really fair because of it. Just roll with the punches, and you'll learn a lot and have a good time.",
    "YES!! Incredible class.",
    "The class was extremely fun, and the professor is great!",
    "Yes!  It's a great class and will teach you a lot about public opinion research. Applicable for anyone interested in market research or who just wants to consume polling data in a smart way."
