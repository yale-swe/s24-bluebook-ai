                "This is a solid reading-science class. It's a pleasure being under Professor Urry. I have absorbed much more astronomy than I expected to ever learn, but to be fair, this class does little \"teaching\" and more throwing information at one. I can tell you about the history of the universe, but I can barely actually make sense of it. If I can't explain it to someone else other than throwing a synopsis at them, it's not really information",
                "I learned how college presentations should look like. I grew a lot due to this course in particular this semester; I felt the frustration at not knowing what to do and figuring it out largely on my own.",
                "Relativity, black holes, dark matter, dark energy, CMB",
                "This class introduced major areas of modern research in astrophysics by first describing the physics behind the phenomenon or process in question and then discussing how researchers are developing ways to overcome our limitations and discover new information about our universe. We also developed our scientific writing skills through weekly one page write-ups, a midterm essay, and a final paper. These works of writing helped me better write about a concept in astronomy and convey critical information about a topic or a recent discovery through paper writing and presentation.",
                "Learned about the history and composition of the universe, time, relativity, and more.",
                "I learned a lot about astronomy.",

            "comments": [
                "This course is very good at creating community between the students with its seminar format and group activities like the YUAG tour and planetarium poster show. One improvement for the course would be to have more weekly writing responses throughout the semester and in turn lower the page/word count for the final paper, which is currently 10 pages single spaced/5000 words.",
                "The lectures were very interesting and fun for someone with no knowledge of astronomy. The professor was engaging and very accommodating; she wanted the class to be fun rather than stressful. However, the course content sometimes got complicated and hard to understand--we were lost some of the time. The workload was really light, except for the midterm and final. The final was a 10 min presentation and a 5000 word paper, which was pretty heavy.",
                "It could be improved by digesting information information better to students who don't have much experience with a lot of astronomy.",
                "There isn't a lot of structure on the assignments and very little guidance on how to approach topics most of us have never seen before and probably will never see again, so the class passes by largely in a blur. \r\nHowever, this class relies on one's ability to attempt to engage with the material, so it feels low stakes, and I find that to be a strength.",
                "Strength: the content is interesting, and we got to visit the Planetarium during our final presentation\r\nWeakness: the content is still very elementary. I hoped for a bit more math or deeper dive as opposed to a pop science understanding",
                "Daily discussions on readings and weekly guest lecturers from prominent figures in physics and astrophysics at Yale were fantastic in aiding my understanding of the class material and enabling further research on topics and areas of research that I am curious about. I think having more weekly writing assignments (which might allow the course to count as a writing credit) would help students better understand difficult course material and form a deeper connection to aspects of our universe that they will carry with them in their other courses.",
                "The midterm and final projects are one of the best aspects of this class - they force students to take complicated astrophysics topics and break them down for classmates, and in the process students become experts on their midterm and final topics and learn from other students presentations.",
                "I liked the guest speakers. I did not like that the quizzes were unannounced.",
                "Definitely manageable and enjoyable work throughout semester, but pay attention and plan accordingly for midterm and final presentations plus one 10-page SINGLE spaced final paper. Go to office hours and you will succeed!!",

It is a very good way to learn about advanced astrophysical concepts without the major roadblock of prior mathematical/scientific knowledge. The information you will learn in this course is very cool, simply put!",
                "Maybe. If you like astronomy, go for it, but otherwise, the midterm and final workload are too much for what you get out of the class, even though the lectures are really interesting. It's not a bad class to take overall though.",
                "I recommend this class because it throws you well into the depths of astronomy.",
                "Yes; this course is a fun way to engage with topics and ideas you wouldn't otherwise see. It's a nice low stakes introduction to astronomy, and I found that interesting and fun.",
                "Yes. It's pretty eye-opening",
                "Absolutely! Professor Urry is an amazing professor who is always willing to answer student questions and talk one-on-one about areas of physics and astrophysics that the students is curious and passionate about. The class gives you the freedom to study areas of astronomy and physics that you are interested in, and it allows you to explore these areas with the safety net of a professor who is incredibly knowledgeable about many areas of astrophysics.",
                "Absolutely - you learn so much regardless of whether you consider STEM to be one of your strong suits.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in astronomy.",
                "If you are interested, definitely apply, we had the best time in this class learning and discussing the coolest topics. However, stay on top of major projects, and there are occasional short pop quizzes on the readings (which are very interesting and worthwhile)",
