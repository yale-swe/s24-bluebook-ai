                "I learned how to read, interpret, and critically discuss papers that rely on statistical techniques. I also learned how to code effectively and in a way that is easily readable. This is an incredibly important skill that is not taught in other S&DS courses.",
                "The textbook that we used had exercises using R, so I learned about R packages for a variety of data analysis techniques including text analysis, clustering with K-nearest neighbors, and standard regression analysis. \r\n\r\nHalf of the course meetings (the other half are lectures) focus on understanding the strengths and weaknesses of political science studies that used different data analysis methods. I think these conversations helped me be a bit more critical of claims made by analysts about the generalizability of their methods. Fredrik encouraged students to ask - are studies measuring what they claim to be measuring?",
                "So many! Helpful introduction/review of basic statistical concepts as we move through the course, relating them to politics and policy in ways that you won't get from regular S&DS courses. Comprehensive work in R, as well as rigorous critical analysis of published statistical papers in the social sciences.",
                "I learned how to critique scientific papers that have a data analysis component, and gained the confidence to be a critical and informed consumer of this research.",
                "I improved my coding abilities in R, but especially learned with the final project how to run a more free-form data project with no \"right\" answers.",
                "The class started a little slow in terms of content but we learned a lot of really interesting techniques to deal with statistical information about politics. I also learned how to critically evaluate a social science study. The final project was a good way to learn how to engage with an open question without instructions.",

                "I really enjoyed this course. The only thing that would have made it better is if the small projects and final project were completed independently instead of with a partner, since partnerships in college usually look like one person doing most (if not all) of the work.",
                "I think the course would be great if it was just a discussion seminar with no lecture component. I feel like I learned more from the article discussions than from the lectures, which were basically recaps of the textbook reading.",
                "Very strong course overall  I really appreciated the intellectual diversity of the seminar, because it felt like we all contributed to each other's learning with our perspectives. The pacing was good and the small projects were helpful both for developing coding skills and applying the statistical theory.",
                "I didnt think there were any weaknesses. I liked how the projects helped us apply the skills we learned in the lecture-like classes.",
                "Speaking for myself, I loved reading the technical papers that utilize the data science techniques of interest. I personally wish that every week was like this and focused on understanding the techniques in each paper. I know that isn't possible so my more moderate suggestion is to cut the lectures in the early week that focus on more basic ideas like what a probability is. But I would keep the lectures on the more complex topics such as the one on power vs validity.",
                "The professor was incredibly patient, knowledgable, and understanding. He would always go the extra mile to address every single aspect of the question and make sure you truly understood the concept. I think sometimes the class could have been more engaging, as we sometimes spent too long talking about a tangential topic and the pace could have been a little bit faster, but that was also the strength of the class is we never went too fast, so I'm not sure what the best sweet spot is.",
                "Strengths: The partnering for problem sets was great -- it made it so that I learned so much more. I also really appreciated having a TA, which was very helpful for questions. Prof Svje is also incredibly good at explaining complicated concepts, which is very helpful. He forces you to consider and think about what you're doing. I liked the alternating quiz/pset format of the class as well. The reading load was relevant and manageable. Prof Svje is also very responsive and gives detailed comments on work. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While the lectures were helpful, the discussion seminars were not. There was one student who dominated the conversation and asked a lot of questions that were not relevant to the topic, and Prof Svje indulged that person's questions. Often, this meant very long tangents that were irrelevant. Other than that, I think this was a great class.",
                "The best part of this class is the discussions about the papers, which show you how to engage with social science research and critically evaluate it, and the final project, which was a super fun way project with a chance to be creative with your methods. Professor Savje is also very committed and gives very detailed feedback. The problem sets, especially the first two, were occasionally easier than the material we did in class which wasn't as valuable as it could be. After a while, the problem sets became more useful."

                "100%! Professor Svje is wonderful and truly invested in your learning/development, the workload is quite manageable, and the content is very engaging.",
                "Yes! It'll be way more focused on learning how to consume research rather than produce research, but the final project (simulating being the data person on a political campaign) was a great way to simulate real life data analysis problems.",
                "Yes! It is a very interesting and practical class on data science for public policy, and I definitely walked away with skills that were important and necessary in that regard.",
                "I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested. I would caution that the first few weeks might be more of a review for anyone, but the projects pick up towards the end and become really interesting and challenging without being too much work. The final project is also an incredible way to deal with an open question in a really interesting way. It is a simulation of running a campaign that I think Professor Savje created himself, which is pretty incredible. The class discussions are also very good if you are interested in social science methodology.",
