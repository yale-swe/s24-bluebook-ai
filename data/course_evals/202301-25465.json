                "Strengths: the essays, final project, and readings were super interested. I learned so much about the history of psychology. \r\nWeaknesses: the lectures can be a little disorganized at times. Professor Khan is super knowledgable about this field and can get a little carried away on some tangents (which I'll admit are super interested) that can be a little far from what we planned on discussing that day. Despite that the course was fantastic.",
                "Really interesting material. Enjoyed the schedule of assignments. I did feel though that I wish the essays themselves could be a bit more creative, rather than summarizing the material.",
                "I don't think the lectures themselves were structured super well. Professor would go on tangents, which were honestly extremely interesting usually, but in terms of class structure, it was pretty loosely formatted. It was a cross of a lecture and seminar but in a way where it felt like it wasn't doing the most important parts of either. If the content itself wasn't very interesting, I think this could have been very frustrating. It was taught more in a way I would've expected a history class would've been taught, which is great, but it just wasn't advertised as such at the start. \r\n\r\nAlso, I really did not enjoy the feedback of the papers. The prompts were very long, with about 6 distinct questions in each prompt, but for a four page paper. I didn't receive fantastic grades on the papers I personally thought were very well written, mostly because the feedback told me I should've elaborated more on XYZ things which sometimes felt niche / not central to the teachings or argument, especially when I added other examples. This seems like an infinite catch-up task, however, because there are only so many things you can fit into a short paper, especially one with like 6 prompts in and of itself, and with no rubric either.",
                "Strengths: Very engaging course material and novel sources to gather information from. Synthesized psychology as a discipline really thoroughly within the context of history. I enjoyed the song at the beginning of each class as well. I appreciated the community built in the classroom, and how we grappled with really difficult topics. Engaging lectures, I learn so much from each class! Incredible lectures, super interesting stuff.\r\nWeaknesses: It could have more interactive portions, such as having more open conversation with peers. I would want more material to read (due to my own personal interest!).",
                "Strong content area, strong flow of instruction",
                "I really enjoyed taking this course since I learned how to analyze different aspects of capitalism with a psychological lens and how to approach different systems our world has today that often have a different evolution and history than was may originally be thought or taught. The course was very engaging and allowed for frequent interaction with other classmates which made discussions always interesting and informative."

                "I absolutely would. Weaknesses aside (it was his first time teaching it), I think it was a very interesting course in terms of content, with extremely important teachings related to critical race theory. It was also important in sharing the ways psychology and science more broadly has been used to systematically marginalize groups of people and further certain harmful capitalist notions.",

I would argue that this course must exist within the Psychology department and beyond (should be cross-listed!) here at Yale. I find it hard to see a good Yale (Psych department) that does not continue to support this course or some iteration of it. It objectively and critically introduces many paradigms within psychology history and present that I argue that all psychology students must know. Take this course if you want to learn about the history of psychology.",
