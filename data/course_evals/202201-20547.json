This was new to meI'm more used to responding to texts comparativelyso it took an adjustment, but I definitely did build skills over the semester.",

That created an environment where discussion was happening on a fairly high level, which I think was a strength of the course. At the same time, however, I sometimes felt that students' questions about comprehension or concerns about texts were dismissed, which created a little bit of anxiety for me. Overall, though, I think it was good for me to work through these texts and emotions under some pressure, as the experience helped me grow as a writer and thinker.",

Professor Levene is a very tough grader, and isn't afraid to let you know where your writing is weakest, so you have to have a bit of a thick skin for this course. At the same time, if you go in with an open mind, you'll learn a lot, and I think that taking challenging courses is a great opportunity to grow.",

If you do your utmost (and maybe even if you don't), this course will be the best--most inspiring, most transformative, most enlivening (but perhaps also despondency-inducing)--you will ever take."
