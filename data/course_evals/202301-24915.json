                "French oral and written skills. I enriched my vocabulary by the many readings we had and often discussed difficult topics in a foreign language. This often included niche topics which I had to research and present to my peers.",
                "I learned so much about French literature and grammar.",
                "I learned a lot of French grammar and vocabulary, and also read several very interesting pieces of literature.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: strong teaching encourages students to keep up with homework and reading. Discussions in class were fantastic; Ngame is exceptional and truly makes the class shine. Speaking is encouraged; the grammar was sufficiently challenging but not as emphasized as French 130.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very few, except that examinations at times seemed to stress grammar more than the class itself. Adding more emphasis on oral examinations and presentations will help this course to reflect the skills it develops in students. There was a clear emphasis on written grammar, vocabulary that incentivized just studying the grammar\/vocab needed to do well on the exam. By having a more holistic examination such as an oral exam or presentation instead, students would want to keep up with the oral exercises in the course packet.",
                "The fact that there is no standardised textbook makes it difficult for me to follow what exactly we are learning. Also the exams I believe are not always designed to show your knowledge to the truest extent",
                "The class was very engaging and interesting.",
                "The quizzes were extremely unhelpful and there was not enough time before them to study. I consistently got low grades on the quizzes but higher scores on the tests because I had more time to learn the content before immediately being quizzed.",
                "Overall, the course was very engaging and pretty interesting. I liked the books that we read, and the grammar was a bit boring but necessary. However, I wish the class was 4 days with 1 asynchronous days like the other language classes.",
                "No weaknesses. Learning French with Prof. Ngame is an experience to be treasured.",
                "I thought this course was challenging but rewarding. The texts were interesting and I believe my mechanical skills improved. I think the course organization could be improved (sometimes it was hard to find assignments, answer keys, or review worksheets on Canvas).  I also felt like the evaluations were, at times, significantly more difficult than our in-class work\/practice."
