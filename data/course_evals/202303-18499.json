It requires lots of the same skills as other sociology courses (reading papers, discussing them in seminar, 2 projects and corresponding presentations). Because it's specific to the visual, though, I engaged with lots of readings and material I'd never seen before. It definitely increased my appreciation for sociology and opened me up to a sub-discipline I was previously unaware of!",

It's a really interesting field that seeks to understand people (why they do things, how they do them, and what it all means). I learned how to read sociology papers, how to conduct my own experiments, and how to write them up effectively.",

                "Strengths: Excellent readings and class discussions, Professor Smith does an incredible job breaking the ice and facilitating a comfortable class dynamic, grading structure that facilitates deeper engagement and learning, as well as allowing for non-punitive feedback, great reading guides every week that help navigate potentially challenging readings\r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "Strengths: Prof. Smith is super realistic about the reading load that students can actually take on, and does not assign fluff readings. He goes as far to specify which sections of readings are useful vs. unnecessary to read thoroughly, which made me twice as likely to actually do the readings, because I knew I wouldn't be reading anything unnecessary. He's made worksheets including everything you need to know from the readings every week, and this makes studying for exams loads easier.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, it's clear that almost every element of the pedagogy of this course is thought through thoroughly. I don't have much to say about its weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: a great space to participatelow-pressure, very encouraging, and there are multiple ways to engage (adding to discussion, leading discussion, presentation); good feedback on the papers during planning process and after the final submission; professor and TF are always there to help; the reading guides make the discussion really guided and double as great study guides for the exams; no discussion posts!!!\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes it can be hard to find usefulness in the readings",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Fun and engaging classes\r\n- Great readings\r\n- Approachable and helpful professor and TA \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- More guidance with our research projects needed",
                "I cannot think of any weaknesses of this course. Professor Smith was an excellent teacher, full of enthusiasm and knowledge. Seminars were exciting and open-ended."

This course provides frameworks that help students interrogate various taken-for-granted aspects of everyday life and connect them to larger ideas/institutions/etc.",
                "Absolutely! Very manageable workload, interesting readings, the opportunity to do cool projects. This is a great course.",
