                "I was able to look at the pillar of religion in a very different and abstract way.",
                "This class is incredible.  A cult classic, if you will.  It's a gut grade-wise, but that won't stop you from wanting to go to every lecture and listen intently for 50 minutes.  I learned about the material history of American religious movements, how religions are created, and how to view contemporary life through a religious lens.  We read a great mix of intellectual theory and contemporary articles from Vox and the New York Times, as well as movies and YouTube videos that kept the material engaging.",
                "I can't say enough good things about this class. Definitely shifted the way that I can analyze and discuss religion and culture.",
                "Information about religious movements but also new frameworks for thinking about culture, religion, history, etc",
                "Thinking critically about society and my own life choices.",
                "This course taught me that religion is more than what we traditionally view it as; religion can be as broad as whatever we care the most about in the world, or it can be a lens with which to view what we call secular that really holds many religious values and properties (from friend groups to politics to college itself).",
                "I learned how to think about groups and collective action through a completely new lens. I was taught to not take anything at face value, and instead dig deeper to find the underlying reasoning for seemingly normal and/or mindless activities. Structures of control and power; ethics and morals; identity and belonging. Everything!",
                "To be honest, I'm not really sure what I learned but I think that is the point of the course.  I got used to the skill of seeking out random connections between content that I would have otherwise missed.  Ex: what can a JoJo Siwa music video teach us about the role of charisma in establishing a New Religious Movement?  The most important part of this course for me was to think about my religious beliefs and convictions in a secular setting, to note when I got offended by things said in the classroom and probe into what was causing that offense.",
                "One of my favorite courses at Yale. TAKE THIS CLASS! It changes your understanding of religion by showing you that even plastic could be a religion. Each lecture is dedicated to a tenant of how to build a religion (ritualize eating, get people dancing, scare people) and each lecture incorporates pop culture. Prof Lofton does a great job of making the study of religion accessible and modern, proving that we have a lot to learn from how religious movements form and how religion has informed all of American history.",
                "This course changed the way I think about relationships between individuals, groups, society, etc. It really changed the way I understand \"religion\" in terms of social processes, hierarchy, power, control, etc.",
                "I have a totally different outlook on the world. I am obsessed with religion and hope to take more religious studies classes in the future and plan on taking any class Kathryn Lofton teaches.",
                "I've learned so much about American culture and how it relates to the field of religion. I never thought about religion simply as a theory of popularity but this class has completely changed my perspective on the way I view popular culture. I've also learned a great deal about the history and theory of religion in the United States.",
                "Knowledge of dozens of American new religious movements and how they rise in popularity, the important qualities of religion that leads to any movement's longevity, theoretical arguments for how important religious and social movements gain momentum.",
                "I learned to analyze religions comparatively and creatively",
                "Evaluation of both popular culture and academic studies through the lens of religion and popularity.",
                "This course offers an overview of religions and cults throughout history, but the focus is really on social organization and a broader understanding of what motivates humans. You learn to make connections between disparate topics and better understand how religious organization occurs.",
                "An incredible wealth of knowledge that really changes the way you see america and its history. Expanding what religion means in society and applications of religious studies outside of large scale organized religion.",
                "I think my ability to draw connections between religious theory and pop culture/ current events was strengthened",
                "I learned how to apply theoretical concepts and other ideas to life and common practice. I also learned better writing and academic strategies, as well as contributing to group discussions and how to participate in academic conversation. I also learned how to synthesize and apply readings.",
                "I developed a strong framework for understanding American culture, religions, and cults. I gained a very broad understanding of different religious movements but specific knowledge of their central markers.",
                "I learned so so much taking this class, about all religions and about what it means for something to be a religion and also about what it means to believe in something. This class definitely changed my perspective on life as a whole.",
                "Concision in essay writing, apply theory to pop culture which was fun",
                "I learned how to use the framework of religious studies to analyze culture and society",
                "Learned about the principles of religion, how religion has manifested itself through American history, and how the elements of religion continue to manifest in modern culture. We also read literature from religious scholars and historians to see how academics conceptualize religion.",
                "Beyond basic American religious history and new religious movements- this class makes you think critically about what constitutes a religion and how religion exists in every aspect of our lives and institutions",
                "I learned about the various aspects of new religious movements and how to think about pop culture and everything really in terms of religion.",
                "The history of religious and ritualistic development in the United States.",
                "Critical thinking skills, aspects of religion, reading and taking notes effectively, answering essay prompts that require thinking beyond memorization.",
                "How to think about the world around us as religiously constructedthinking with a more broad perspective rather than dichotomy-based thinking of true or false. WHY things are the way that they are a way to unpack things from a new lens.",
                "How to think critically about what we consider religion. Being able to self-reflect on religion in our lives.",

                "How to define a religion and see how it affects our lives.",
                "Although it's hard to pinpoint exactly the knowledge I gained, I feel I got a deeper understanding of many interesting concepts related to America, religion, and the history and practice of American religion. I also think I developed my skills in shorter, nontraditional academic writing.",
                "This class was incredible. Every student at Yale should take it. Its more a class about how people organize themselves than religion.",
                "Not really sure but super engaging clas",
                "I'm not exactly sure what I learned from this course, however, my worldview has definitely changed. Topics for this course ranged dramatically but were always interesting.",
                "This class completely reshaped the way I think about religion. The content covered in readings and in lecture was fascinating, and was definitely important in building the foundation for the course, but the way that Professor Lofton thinks and lectures is the main reason this class was so transformative. I left this class thinking about things I had never thought about before, and in ways that I had never thought of them. I learned how to think critically about religion, but also how to recontextualize what religion means in an age where the human imagination is possibly more expansive than it has ever been before.",
                "I learned about the major elements that underlie every religion. Things that religions must do in order to be religions. THis class definitiely expands your definition of religion. It highlights just how pwerful a force it is. I learned most through the readings, and then Lofton's lectures complemented and were just an experience to attend.",

                "Strengths: The lectures are incredible and engaging, Professor Lofton is super approachable and really wants to help her students understand the material she is teaching, the readings are interesting and not super necessary for participation in the discussion sections, and Professor Lofton genuinely cares about the mental health and engagement of her students.  I cannot recommend this class enough.\r\nWeaknesses: The writing assignments are graded on a rubric that makes it very easy to get an A but don't require much creativity, which could be a win for students who are less writing inclined.  I sometimes wish that we had more than 800-word limits on the papers but it does contribute to the guttiness of the class.",
                "Strengths: Lectures were phenomenal. KL is maybe the smartest person I've ever interacted with. Section w my TF was also awesome, he was super cool and made a really fun, relaxed environment. Overall, this class is just great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None really",
                "Professor Lofton is AMAZING",
                "No weakness. Only strengths. Take this class.",
                "The structure of this course is fantastic; all the short assignments and open-note exams were blessings, and they were designed to be genuinely enjoyable to write (and, more often than not, they succeeded). However, it was sometimes hard to engage with the readings because they felt sort of all over the place. This course is, at its core, all over the place. That can be a good thing, and its messiness is not without purpose, but it is messy. For me that is a weakness, but for others it may be a strength.",
                "Strengths: Everything! \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes there are a lot of readings, and I wish a little more time were devoted to discussing them (because they're actually amazing if you do read them!).",
                "Strengths: Genuinely the most fun lectures I've ever attended.  Professor and TAs are incredible and really care about our well-being.  Sections were super chill and low-stakes.  Professor tried to make the class fun, and she encouraged discussion and debate.  She encouraged us to press into the things we disagreed with and felt offended by.\r\nWeaknesses: I struggled to understand the purpose for a lot of the class's content, but I think this was Lofton's intention.  Coming out of the class I'm not really sure what I learned.",
                "Amazing course! One of my favorite classes that i've taken at Yale. Professor Lofton is a super compelling lecturer. I definitely think the assignments made less sense to me -- while they were easy to complete, I wished we had assignments that made us engage with the course material more because everything we were learning was so interesting. I think the midterm should be scrapped - i don't understand why we were made to essentially memorize things from the readings. The final exam was fun to complete, though!",
                "strengths\r\n- insanely interesting and relevant beyond \"Religion\"\r\n- Lofton is THE BEST lecturer I have ever had during my 4 years at Yale\r\n- Assignments are interesting and stretch you in new ways\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- I personally didn't love all the readings. However, I do not think they are bad readings. All of them are well placed.\r\n- Grading turnaround wasn't the best",
                "no weaknesses! Strengths: Prof Lofton, the TFs, the readings and reading questions, the free form section discussions, the clear rubrics, the open-ended and fun assignments, the captivating Ted Talk-esque lectures, I loved this class.",
                "I thought this course was strong in every way. The lectures were extremely engaging. The readings were diverse, insightful, and fun to read. The section leaders and sections themselves were exciting spaces of discussion and exploration of the topics covered in class. If anything, I wish there was a part 2.",
                "The topics covered in lecture and section are the biggest strength. I absolutely loved going to lecture and section each week and learning about how some element of popular culture relates to that week's topic. The readings, for me, were the weak point, but that is simply because I did not care much for theory of religion, which made the denser texts unbearable. I also did not particularly enjoy the first two writing assignments, but I understand the skills they teach students.",
                "I was always excited for the class. Lectures were fun, engaging, and made me think. I also enjoyed the diverse array of readings we had each week, ranging from historical texts to contemporary magazine articles to theoretical sociological works. Professor Lofton was an amazing lecturer and was very kind throughout the semester. The assignments were well thought out, enjoyable to complete, and not too difficult. The TAs were also incredible, providing engaging weekly sections for all the students.",
                "Great class! Very compelling and the instructors definitely care about the students.",
                "This course was AMAZING overall!! The only weakness was that often it was difficult to understand how some of the readings connected to broader themes in the course.",
                "The lectures were by far the most engaging part of the course. Professor Lofton is incredibly engaging and well-spoken in lecture, bringing in outside material and current events to engage the class. The readings were pretty dry in comparison to much of the other content in the course. I would've been fine with this as a foundation at the beginning of the course to allow for better discussions later on, but I wish some of the readings were more recent and based in current events.",
                "Strengths- every single lecture is incredibly entertaining and unique, workload and grading is very fair \r\n\r\nWeakness- none",
                "I believe that this was a very strong course. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
                "This class depends on Professor Lofton's wonderful lecturing abilities. I learned so much from listening to her. The readings that backed up her lectures, though, were difficult and disorganized. And the grading structure of the class disincentivized course engagement because it was ridiculously lenient.",
                "It covered so much. It applied so much to contemporary society and was genuinely so interesting. The connections were truly illuminating. At times there was too much reading to keep up with and sometimes the concepts were a bit hard to understand.",
                "this is the best class Ive ever taken at Yale. The lectures are SO engaging and fascinating Professor Lofton is the best lecturer Ive ever had. The course doesnt have that many solid takeaways in terms of specific information, but that is made very clear from the first day.",
                "Professor Lofton is a huge strength and I cant think of any weaknesses in this class.",

                "This was a course of almost all strengths, and the biggest one was Professor Lofton. She's an incredible lecturer and cares deeply about her students and their learning. I loved Professor Lofton's integration of music into our class, letting certain songs set the tone of a class and having others serve as texts of their own. The writing assignments came with grading rubrics so I always had built-in guidance, which made the course less stressful while still producing a decent amount of work. While I loved having this guidance, I did wish I got more specific feedback on my writing than the rubrics.",
                "Strengths- Professor Lofton is fantastic. Her policies are understanding and conducive to student learning. The grading policies in class are fair, the TA's are fantastic, the lectures themselves are always interesting. I love that Professor Lofton starts class with music- it makes a difference in the energy. All of the multimedia content during is engaging and important. This class is weird in a fantastic way. \r\nWeaknesses- No major weaknesses that I can think of. It would have been nice to occasionally have reading guides posted earlier, but this isn't a big deal.",
                "The lectures for this course are amazing! KL is a fantastic professor and going to class is such a joy. The assignments are also really fun.",
                "The strengths of this course was the lecture and the discussion sections! Truly amazing professor and TFs made this course what it is. The readings were also well-chosen to engage students and inspire unique discussions.",
                "Strengthsengaged me in a learning based sense rather than a production based one.\r\nWeaknessesloved it, cant think of anything.",
                "Strengthsinteresting readings, Professor Lofton is an engaging lecturer, this class really made me think, I liked the structure of the class to be one feature of American religions per class\r\n\r\nWeakness  sometimes I left lecture without fully understanding the points that Professor Lofton was trying to make but Im not sure thats a bad thing",
                "Strength: amazing lectures that get you thinking about all the small details in your life that you previously didnt think about, yet are extremely crucial. Professor Lofton delivers in a very thought provoking way. Each class was a joy to attend.",
                "Great course! Interesting and low stress.",
                "This class has very engaging lectures and interesting readings. Overall, it was a great course, but if you want a strictly-defined, linear curriculum it might not be the best for you, as classes each focus on different, interrelated themes and subjects.",
                "The teaching is wonderful, every moment was engaging. Readings were, on the whole, also incredibly engaging. I will say that a better level of clarity was needed for as to how the topics all connected to each other.",
                "When in-person, this class was incredible. Professor Lofton and the content that she's chosen to serve as the evidence for her course were perfect. At the beginning of the year, however, the class felt a bit directionless -- I think this is because it was online, and the participation and interaction between Lofton and the students is a key part of the course.",
                "Amazing amazing classopen your mind!",
                "Strengths: Lofton, the readings (carefully chosen, not too long), predictable assignments and grading, fascinating content. Lectures were engaging, always including songs or videos.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 50 minute lectures were too short",
                "Strengths: Amazing class! Super engaging lectures, interesting + manageable readings. The structure + content of the class promotes student learning and changed how I understand the world"

I would recommend Professor Lofton to anyoneher craziness and devotion to religion and pop culture is infectious and a general joy to experience. However, I don't think the content of the course itself was for me. But if you're prepared to take a trip through utter chaos, both in lecture and in readings, and come out on the other side feeling both enlightened by a broader sense of what religion is and far more confused than when you started, this course is for you.",
                "Oh my gosh. I could not more highly recommend this class. It completely changed the way I think about EVERYTHING. If you can take it, do!!!",
                "YES YES YES!!! I could not recommend this course more highly. It is hands down the best course I have taken here at Yale. This class totally changed the way I think about religion, America, Yale, and life in general. KL is a fantastic lecturer and the TFs are truly amazing. The instructors hold you to a high standard while empowering you to take the course material in whatever direction that you find most interesting. I found the assignments to be challenging but highly fulfilling. I think every Yale student should take this class if they get the chance.",
                "Yep, highly recommend as a 5th class because the lectures are so fun and engaging, the teaching staff is incredible, and where else will you get to genuinely ask questions (in a secular Yale space) like \"What do I believe about the afterlife?\" or \"Why do I have this certain set of sexual ethics?\"",
                "Yes! For Professor Lofton and her great team of TAs!",
                "YES. YES. YES. I took this my last semester at Yale and truly believe it's one of the best classes I've taken here. Yes, it's about religion, but it's also about social movements, music, politics, pop culture, fads, fandoms, and generally life. This class will give you an outlook you never saw coming that you will hold with yourself forever. Also, Lofton is AMAZING. JUMP at any chance you have to be her student.",
                "I LOVED this course, Professor Lofton is a kind of professor that is few and far between at Yale and I adored learning from her!",
                "Seriously one of my favorite classes at Yale. Take this class especially if you aren't an AMST or RLST major, it's a great introduction to religious studies.",
                "I would! It challenged my thinking a lot. This course changed the way I think about relationships between individuals, groups, society, etc. It really changed the way I understand \"religion\" in terms of social processes, hierarchy, power, control, etc. The staff is also awesome (prof Lofton and the TAs).",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It was so interesting. The workload was more than doable and honestly I was excited about every paper I had to write. Professor Lofton is amazing, my TF Dustin Gavin was also amazing. The content was fascinating.",
                "Yes! This is a really good course. The readings are interesting, the workload is pretty light, and Professor Lofton is amazing.",
                "I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. It was an extremely interesting way to analyze popular culture in the US: through a religious lens. I think the way it has shifted my view of the popular is an extremely valuable takeaway that would benefit anyone. I think taking this class with Professor Lofton also provided an extremely fun learning experience that I would recommend to everyone. It was just overall really fun and I think people should take fun classes.",
                "Absolutely, this was a fun lecture course that made me think about religion's impact on the world. I believe I am a more thoughtful student as a result of this class.",
                "Absolutely! Super cool and different take on religion -- I'm glad I took this.",
                "Absolutely!! Prof. Lofton is an incredible lecturer and all the TAs were amazing.",
                "yes",
                "I would recommend this if you are able to make connections between academic readings and current events. I found myself pretty bored by some of the readings and struggled to stay engaged throughout the semester. That being said, Professor Lofton is one of the best lecturers out there and makes class incredibly engaging and interesting.",
                "Best class at Yale",
                "Absolutely. This course is literally a must.",
                "Yes. It was an amazing course with coursework relevant to our everyday lives.",
                "Take this class if you are looking for a gut and you do not want to feel pressure in an academic setting. Do not take this class if you are really trying to apply yourself to the readings and learn about religion in America. The class, by the sole power of Professor Lofton's lectures, can change the way you think about the modern world and belief systems. But it will not feel very rewarding.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in this class, I would recommend that you don't enroll and just show up for lecture every week. It is worth it.",
                "Yes, it thought me so much about life and now I make connections to concepts I wouldnt have before. My TF was wonderful as well.",
                "YES!!! Everyone should take this class its seriously the best Ive ever taken at Yale.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Absolutely, to anyone interested in learning about religion or about life and people in general.",
                "Yes, it is the best lecture I have ever taken, and the sections are excellent.",
                "Yes!! A must before you graduate. Lofton and the TFs were awesome",
                "Take this class!!! It's been a highlight of my Yale experience so far. Professor Lofton is incredible, a dedicated scholar who cares immensely about her students and their learning. I could listen to her talk about anything. Getting to analyze pop culture is cool, and looking at events from a religious studies perspective is enlightening. Even if you can't take the class, sit in on the lectures! They're awesome.",
                "YES. The best course I've taken at Yale. Most enjoyable by far.",
                "Absolutely. One of the best classes Ive taken at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is looking for a Humanities credit and has prior interest in studying religions, even if they haven't taken any classes in the subject. I often found the readings to be a bit dense and difficult to follow. Professor Lofton's reading questions help to structure the readings, but I sometimes found myself questioning the reason for the inclusion of a certain reading.",
                "Yes! Professor Lofton and the TAs are amazing, the course is interesting, and the lecture is engaging. Great course to take if you want a lecture that still has a personal feel.",
                "Yes! So interesting and just generally a good time. The lectures, readings, and sections will all make you think.",
                "Yes!! KL is a genius! This class will expand how you think about not just religion, but how society operates as a whole.",
                "Yes, very fascinating.",
                "This course was phenomenal. If you want to change the way you think about the world and religion, this course does just that. Professor Lofton was incredibly knowledgeable and gave some of the best lectures I have ever heard in a Yale classroom. The course is a deconstructed approach to religion, so don't expect a complete history of religion in America. It's more about understanding people and why people believe in the things they do.",
                "Yeswill be a lot of reading but the faculty that teach this course are wonderful.",
                "Yes, if you have never take other religious studies classes on culture before. Its a good intro into the field.",
                "Yes! It is relevant to everyone no matter if you consider yourself religious or not.",
                "Definitely would recommend! It's mind-opening and not too time-consuming.",
                "Yes, I'd definitely recommend this class to most students as an engaging humanities course on an interesting subject without an overly demanding reading and writing workload.",
                "YES!!",
                "yes !! prof lofton is an incredibly engaging lecturer and will challenge you to think about how the different elements of religion appear in the most mundane parts of our lives. if you take the class definitely attend lecture. they're very lively and 100% worth it, which i wish i'd realized before halfway through the semester.",
                "100%",
                "Yes! I loved this course, and it changed the way I thought about religion (both in the traditional sense and the more expansive one I was introduced to in this course).",
                "YES! So goos and fun and just a chill class.",
                "Absolutely. A fun, interesting course. Especially good for a fifth course for students.",
                "I would recommend this course to pretty much anyone. The class is effective and thoughtful even for people without much of an interest in religion, like myself, and allows them to understand this function of the world we live in in a completely new light. Plus, Professor Lofton is immensely fun and intellectual, and I considered myself lucky to be in the same room as her.",
                "One of the best classes at Yale. Not one for the close-minded",
                "YES, I would absolutley reccomend this course to another student, any student who is curious and loves to learn. The course's content is fascinating and always left me thinking and wanting more. Lofton is special. She is not afraid of who she is and she knows how to lecture. She has strong opinions (about most things!) and is highly critical o the world around her. She keeps her political views mostly out of the content of the course. She is anti-grades, anti-tests, and pro-curiosity and pro-learning. I loved that. She does not want her students to stress more than she knows we already do. You don't really leave this course with textbook knowledge about religion. You leave a better thinker and critic.\r\n\r\nNOTE: this is not a traditional religion class. You do not go through the major religions one at a time, discussing their beliefs and practices. This is about sectarian religions, so branches and offshoots of religions. Honestly, I would describe this as more of a culrural or societal anthropology class. Lofton likes popular culture so always weaves it in to our discussion.",
                "Yes! Amazing class, amazing professor, great TAs. Low stress, very high reward"
