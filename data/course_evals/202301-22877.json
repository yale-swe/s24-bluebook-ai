                "Good amount of workload, interesting readings, Prof Kreiner did a great job leading our seminar discussions and prompting thought-provoking insights. Prof Kreiner is also INCREDIBLY understanding and flexible with deadlines, which we all really appreciated. However, there were some weaknesses in organization; there were a few instances where the readings and upcoming assignment submissions would not be uploaded and students were left in the dark wondering what we were supposed to do. The grading rubric was also unclear and students were graded harshly even though we did not spend much time in class talking about writing techniques.",
                "Strengths: Tim is a good instructor and very personable. The opportunity to practice writing is essential.\r\nWeaknesses: The readings were not discussed much in class so people stopped doing them.",
                "I think the turnaround for papers might be a bit too quick. I think especially for the research paper, the time for research is really spring break which happens because of the way the semester is set up. Still, I think it isn't actually best to write cohesive works with well-thought-out, well-organized evidence. I also wish there were a few more office hours per paper offered or that the feedback for each draft was returned in a more timely manner. I also think there could be more room for student discussion? I don't know how to voice this thought completely, even though I loved the course I think sometimes our section didn't get to do too much roundtable talking about the readings or asking each other questions about thoughts we had.",
