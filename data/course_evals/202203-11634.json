                "Strengths -- this was unique from any other class I had took \r\nWeaknesses -- very few pratice problems. Felt like those who would do well in the class were those who had a natural aptitude to economics",
                "Strengths: I think this class was accessible for everyone regardless of math background. Although 108 was not calculus based, I found myself working together with students across classes. In lecture questions and interaction with the professor is promoted with the class size which I also found as a strength. The office hours are often helpful from TA's since they break things down and often stay beyond time to help students on problem sets.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Although it is easier to ask questions, this class moves very fast for someone who has no economics background. 90% of the time, each class is a completely new chapter, so in order to follow adequately, a student has to solidify each chapter's understanding on their own. Coupled with only 4 problem sets, you have to depend on yourself to practice.",
                "Tolga uses great anecdotes to relate back to economic principles that helped me understand things. Things that can be improved about the class is how fast things are written down and even the legibility of things being written on the board.",
                "Office hours were great and the lectures were well done. The seminar made it nice to ask questions. There is a severe lack of practice work; only 4 (rather easy) psets that did not prepare us at all for exams, and students who wanted more challenging problems (or just practice work in general) did not get them.",
                "The strength of this course is definitely Professor Koker. He brings static theories to life. The course also has a relatively low workload in terms of problem sets and homework.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish we could have more problem sets to prepare for our midterm and final.",
                "The course was engaging and helped us develop an interest in economics.\r\nIt would have been helpful if there were more practice, especially relating to questions that may appear on exams but were not directly covered in class or in the homework.",
                "Weaknesses: The seminar format is not very useful. This course is just about internalizing the content (equations, concepts, etc.) so there isn't really any point in doing it seminar style. Tolga is definitely an entertaining character (get ready for some wacky tangents), but his teaching style is not very engaging. He explains the concepts extremely quickly and offers minimal opportunities to solve problems independently and review them as a class. This means that you don't really internalize the material and have to re-teach it to yourself when studying for the midterm or final. This could have been a Khan Academy course.",
                "The small size of this course and the lower number of psets are some strengths of this course. One weakness is the difficult curve of the class.",
                "The strengths are it really goes in depth and teaches you to think outside of the box. The weakness may be the lack of practice questions provided and there being only one midterm. If there were more practice questions handed out and another midterm, it may have been more forgiving and given students more chances to improve.",
                "Strengths: Tolga was an engaging professor.\r\nWeaknesses: More practice material and questions would have been nice. The textbook was very complicated and hard to follow."

                "I would not recommend this course to someone with no econ background, for the reasons stated earlier. The content is cumulative and you are really depending on yourself to find *and* use your own reinforcement since the pace is so quick. However, if you are really passionate about econ, I would take this class over 115, since we have small in class discussion, talk about things we've seen/read with Tolga. The sharing experience adds to the engagement, which is so much more difficult to do in a large lecture.",

                "I would not. Take the lecture. It'll be boring either way, but at least in the lecture you can do what you want and space out more easily.",
                "I think this would depend on what the student is looking for. I think the larger lecture version, Econ 115, is much easier to get an A in and still teaches the material well. However, the smaller class size and scheduling of this class can make it more attractive to many students. I think this class teaches the material well and was fun with Professor Koker. The only thing I would warn a student about is the curve of the class.",
