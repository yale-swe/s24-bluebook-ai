            "comments": [
                "The course is really strong in its course material, but its homeworks are lacking. The undergrad ULA is amazing and incredibly smart, but there should be absolutely zero classes at Yale with an ULA making a problem set. Either the grad TA should be making them or the professor herself. Problem sets are long and they change two days before the due date, even though they take an average student probably 20-30 hours to complete. I cannot emphasize enough how much the psets detract from the rest of the course. Psets are terribly long and not optimized for learning, in the sense that much of it is going back and forth in a jupyter notebook trying to interpret what the pset is even trying to say. Instructions are vague, clarifications are desperately needed and often given 1-2 days after questions have been asked, and in general the psets give the sense that whoever made them doesn't really care about the students.",
                "This course had a perfect amount of material, and the content was delivered in a nice order that built upon each different step. I think that to take it to the next level, it would be nice to see more live demonstrations of the techniques, or more examples included it in the slides. Also, sometimes the math notation was confusing, and so introducing some of the symbols (specifically the more complex probability related ones) might be helpful for students who dont have that background.",
                "Smita's lectures are very strong and I learned a ton of interesting content. That said, I have a relatively surface-level understanding of many topics thanks to the extremely wide range of material covered by the course. Reducing the breadth of the class would help students understand concepts in greater depth. Also, the problem sets were monstrously long. While this isn't terrible in and of itself, it's unrealistic that Smita wants students to completely them *and* do the supplemental readings posted for each class.",
                "Topics are interesting, but prof could do a better job explaining",
                "The problem sets did solidify understanding by providing concrete examples of what we were working on. \r\n\r\nSome of them were difficult to understand, though, and needed lots of clarification from Piazza. They also were often very tedious and I felt like I sometimes spent more time figuring out library syntax than learning.",
                "The strengths of this class are the problem sets. The problem sets are very detailed and allow you to learn how to apply the material presented in lecture. Also, the papers you can read are very good at explaining things that are unclear during lecture. Another strength is that we cover a lot of exciting material and techniques in the class which are extremely applicable to a lot of research topics. Another strength is that the final project in the class allows you to explore whatever material you want, and present it in the form of an ML research paper. Extremely cool, and a lot different than assignments in a usual CS class.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this class is definitely that the second problem set was extremely long and taxing, with not a lot of knowledge gained. I would definitely have preferred a problem set on CNN's or RNN's because that was the coolest topic and the coverage of it was rushed at the end of the semester.",
                "Strengths: So many modern techniques that are super cool. Professor Krishnaswamy is also a GOAT. Also, the TF and ULA worked their butt off to give everyone individual customized feedback, which is pretty nuts for a ML assignment. Very rarely do I find a course where it feels like the instructor and teaching staff put in more work into the course than their students, but this is one of those courses, and it really shows in the learning experience imo.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it's a lot of work",
                "Problem sets were way too long! Having only 3 with parts of them having errors and \/ or not being covered in class until nearer the due date made it difficult to plan consistent work; splitting them up into more problem sets that are smaller would be much better."

                "Kind of. The course material is amazing and it's such a strong plus to have a grasp on what's being taught. The techniques the professor goes over are cutting edge and powerful. However, the problem sets are so shockingly bad that I can't really give a definite yes here. They are raw and filled with inaccuracies and vague questions. This might not be so bad, unless (as is the case here) psets are also already unnecessarily long and tedious. So extremely tedious. I'd actually recommend cr\/d\/f for this course and just boot half of each pset (there's bound to be 2\/3 of each that will cause you extreme frustration to do) and go to lectures and focus on learning the material.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is not scared of math, and is interested in expanding the computer science repertoire into the area of unsupervised learning. I personally was not very strong in the prerecs, but was able to understand enough to do all of the problem sets without any problems. And still walk away with a large improvement in my theoretical understanding of the concepts we talked about in class.",
                "This was probably one of the more difficult courses I've taken at Yale, but also definitely worth it. I came in with little knowledge of machine learning and without having ever taken any CS classes, but it was manageable with enough time put in. Definitely very relevant for analyzing biological data and any large data in general. I've found that after this course I've been able to understand many more analyses and computational papers. Towards the end of the semester, we had a third pset, final project, and final exam all clustered around the same time though, so the workload is more end-heavy.",
                "Absolutely - it's super interesting, the psets are good coding practice, and Smita is a stronger instructor than the other Yale faculty who teach machine learning. That said, students should be prepared to have this class dominate their semester academically.",

It's one of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Yale. \r\n\r\nIf you don't have a lot of experience with ML, maybe consider taking S&DS 365 or Computer vision before trying this course. I would have been extremely lost without prior experience in these classes.\r\n\r\nA LOT of time was spent on the problem sets, so make sure you're not taking a heavy workload along with this class.",
                "Heck yes! The class is SO cool, Professor Krishnaswamy is SO nice and flexible, not to mention top of her field. If you're interested in ML, this class is for you! The class also almost exclusively focuses on frontier work, and you just feel in awe the more you learn. Really great stuff, probably the best class I've taken at Yale.",
