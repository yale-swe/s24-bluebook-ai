            "comments": [
                "It was a good survey course.",
                "Strengths: There was a lot of support and understanding from the Professor and the TA for students.\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures moved a little slow and it was hard to stay engaged.",
                "In terms of strengths, I thought that the biweekly lectures were very engaging. It was clear that the professor was very invested in the class and in us as students, and that made the classes more fun and interesting. She made a very strong effort to ensure that we were learning about topics that interested us, instead of just following what was in the textbook. I thought the syllabus structure was good and that it was better to have the easier topics towards the end of the semester, when students had a lot of assignments due for other classes. I also really liked having midterm and final projects rather than exams - it encouraged students to do in-depth research into specific topics rather than brute-force memorizing a bunch of stuff and forgetting it right after the exam. For weaknesses, we definitely had more total class time than we should have because the lectures were often quite long. I don't think the lectures should have been shorter, because it would have been impossible to fit in all the material, but I often felt like we had an extra 45 minutes of class a week, which is not what anyone signed up for. Even though the textbook readings were generally helpful, a lot of times they just repeated what the professor said in lecture. I'm not sure it was necessary to have quite as many textbook readings as we often did.",
                "Strength is Professor Bowern genuinely one of the nicest professors I've had. She went out of her way to make herself accessible and switched to a form of grading that would be more accessible in an online format. She seemed to understand the stresses of the pandemic period and was extremely kind with deadlines, help, grading, and engagement. I would recommend this course just for her. Weakness: No major ones but the biweekly section-like classes were a little disorganized.",
                "This is a good survey course that introduces many different kinds of linguistics without being confusing or overwhelming and the textbook is well-chosen. I liked Professor Bowern's use of Slack, various videos, and guest lectures to enrich our learning experience.",
                "I thought this course was exceptionally well thought out and organized! Professor Bowern went above and beyond, getting the lectures up the weekend before we were supposed to watch them. She had so many opportunities to chat with her, both over zooms, emails, and in slack, as did our TF Marisha. Psets were clearly explained and synced up well with what we learned in class. Sometimes they were even fun, given how different linguistics analysis is from many of my other classes. Although I bet this course would have been even better in person, this was a relatively good course to take online because I could pause pre-recording lectures to shout out whatever random examples we were discussing.\r\n\r\nOnly weakness: I wish we'd spent less time on phonetics and more time on phonology, but this is such a minor change.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- I really liked that we covered a lot of different topics. Even though this meant that we couldn't spend much time on each, it still helped me form a better understanding of what linguistics is.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I thought the discussion sessions were not always productive. In some of them, we spent the first half of the session (or even more) talking about less essential things such as reviewing the previous problem set before jumping to the discussion.",
                "I thought the projects were a huge strength of the course; rather than an exam for which students would just memorize information, the projects allowed us to actually apply everything we knew to a language of our choice. Professor Bowern is also a huge strength and a phenomenal and understanding instructor. The only weakness I can think of is the time spent on phonetics, which I think could have been increased, but I think this is partly due to circumstances of this year and it would have been much easier had the class been in person.",
                "Generally this course was taught very well. The project based nature of the class felt like a great way to apply our knowledge (although I know historically it is a exam based course. COVID would not allow for that). Sometimes the content felt like just saying things (I don't really know how to describe it but specifically the brain section of the class didn't feel as engaging as other sections). Overall though, it is a well taught class with a lot of interesting content to absorb.",
                "Strengths: Midterm and final were projects rather than exams so you can focus on how the class content applies to a language you choose. Problem sets stuck pretty closely to lecture and textbook content and rarely had curveballs.\r\nWeaknesses: Attempts to construct opportunities for virtual social interactions through \"study groups\" were awkward and forced.",
                "The course was very flexible with a manageable workload. The recorded lectures were easy to review at any pace, and the discussion sections were good opportunities to ask questions about the readings and expand on subjects from the lecture material.",
                "A strength was the vast array of topics we were able to delve into each week. On the flip side of that, a weakness was that we could not dive as deep as I would have liked to in some topics.",
                "I just had a really rough time with the online aspect of this class. I did a lot better in other classes, but the recorded, asynchronous part made me feel very detached from the class.",
                "Strengths: The midterm and final projects were designed well to push us outside of our comfort zone and analyze a foreign language of our choice on the basis of various linguistic features (e.g., phonology, writing system)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Would be nice to do more practice exercises during the live lectures so that we're better prepared for the psets. Professor Bowern started doing this during the second half of the semester, and I think a lot of us found it helpful.",
                "I thought the course was very approachable for a beginner, the instructors were kind and helpful, and the material was very interesting. I thought the recorded lectures were clear in their presentation and matched the readings. I enjoyed the problem sets, which were helpful for reviewing the content but generally not\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the live sessions felt less useful than the recorded lectures, with relatively low information-density. I also felt like the course could have been slightly more technical and rigorous while still being an accessible introduction to linguistics. Lastly, I didn't think the project format for the midterm and final was particularly useful for reinforcing the material. I thought it was a great way to learn about world languages, but I felt like we weren't really applying the information we learned (and probably could have completed most of the assignment without having even taken the class). However, I do appreciate that this was trying to adapt to remote-learning, and the class usually has conventional exams (which not everyone prefers!)",
                "I really enjoyed the projects. I felt that they helped me engage with the material much more than I would have if cramming for exam.",
                "Projects instead of final exams allowed for application of learned linguistics skills on languages of our choice.",
                "Strengths: the instructors (Professor Bowern and Marisha) were clearly very passionate about the subject, and I liked how they incorporated their current interests\/research into the course. The problem sets weren't too demanding and helped reinforced what we had learned during lectures. Weaknesses: The live lectures were hard to engage with at times and not all of the activities we did during lecture were helpful for learning the material. That said, Professor Bowern provided us an opportunity to give feedback early on in the course and incorporated our suggestions to make the course more engaging.",
                "The course covered a broad range of topics and engaged with students' individual questions and interests about the topics covered. The midterm and final project were a good opportunity to use the different concepts we had learned and make connections between them to analyze a language of our choice, and to explore larger themes and trends between multiple languages, including learning from the research of our classmates. Including even more examples throughout the course of linguistics research or connections to daily life may be helpful.",
                "Amazing course all around",
                "The broad scope of this class is fantastic. As a complete beginner, it gave me a great overview of the subject. The class is ideal for determining whether you want to pursue further studies in linguistics, and if so, which type of classes you would enjoy in the future. It was also enjoyable if you are just looking for some cool social credit. Professor Bowern is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful; her expertise in Bardi, language change and revitalization, and the Voynich manuscript add extra depth to the class. I wish I would have asked more questions. The midterm and final projects were very fun, allowing me to implement what we learned during the semester on a specific language and then analyze the results of our typological survey.\r\nPersonally, the asynchronous nature of the class was less preferable. I found myself enjoying the discussion sessions more since they were more engaging and helped practice the analysis tools we used on psets. I also wish we spent some more time on syntax (with more in-class practice).\r\nBut overall, this was a very enjoyable class and I learned a lot."

It's hard to think of things I would improve.",

I had a hard time staying focused in those discussions, especially since they were at the end of days full of Zoom classes for me.",
                "I really liked having the recorded lectures, although towards the end they became longer than what was promised in the beginning, so that when combined with discussion sessions, I committed more time with lectures and discussions for this course than I expected.\r\n\r\nI don't like that participation\/OH participation was part of the grade (this was in the syllabus, but not sure if it was kept this way), given that students around the world may not be available during certain times.",
                "The recorded lectures were really interesting, but I found the synchronous sessions during the week a bit less helpful.",
                "I didn't really like how in-class time was essentially a Q&A session. I felt that my engagement with the class was extremely low because of this.",
                "Recordings are always good, I wish the discussion sections were also recorded but I understand Professor Bowern's concerns with doing that. Uploading everything in the modules tab was also a great organizational tool. Sometimes the amount of resources felt excessive (I'm not exactly sure why we had a detailed canvas page, a slack, and much more for this one class).",
                "The recorded lectures and online projects were very flexible, and I enjoyed the asynchronous discussion lectures to ask questions. I would have appreciated smaller discussion sections as opposed to full-class discussion lectures to make discussions a little more interactive. Nonetheless, the format of the class seemed very appropriate for the situation with the pandemic.",
                "Prerecorded lectures were helpful but at times a bit lengthier than necessary.",
                "Prerecorded lectures were given closed captioning, GREATLY affecting how well students were able to follow the material. I found the prerecorded lectures immensely accessible and they were successful--although personally I prefer live lectures with more direct engagement.",
                "Having more interaction and doing things life wouldve been way better.",
                "Overall, the learning process was fairly smooth in the virtual environment. Professor Bowern allowed us to ask questions throughout the lectures using the Zoom chat feature, and she also made use of the breakout room feature to help us work on problems with our peers. I strongly appreciated the fact that the professor and teaching fellow would stay on the Zoom call even after the class was over to answer any lingering questions that we have. The professors in most of my other classes didn't do this. Perhaps the course could be strengthened by having a Piazza page (I know a lot of other social science courses have this) where students can ask questions and get them answered.",
                "The asynchronous lectures were a great idea and worked well. Being able to pause the lecture and take a quick screen break was conducive to learning. I would have preferred if they were posted a bit more in advance so that I could organize my time better.",
                "The pre-class lecture videos helped the course adapt well to the virtual format.",
                "The combination of recorded lectures and live virtual enrichment lectures worked really well.",
                "One thing I liked about the flipped classroom model is that we could put our questions in the \"discussion\" tab in panopto and Professor Bowern would answer those questions during the live lecture. This helped keep us engaged with the course. We also had a slack for the class where we could ask questions, and it was nice to know that there were multiple avenues to engage with the instructors.",
                "The recorded lectures worked well, I was able to take notes on the slides and replay parts I found confusing. I also liked the ability to ask questions in the Panopto program. I liked going over questions in the live discussion sections, but sometimes the breakout rooms were not helpful or did not lead to as productive discussions as larger group discussions.",
                "This course was excellent and very pandemic friendly! It was totally remote (many students were off-campus) and the mix of recorded lectures and live virtual discussion\/lecture made virtual engagement with the course manageable and enjoyable. Additionally, the professor divided us into study groups, which we went into for every breakout session, which helped cement relationships within the course (as opposed to seeing strangers in random breakout rooms that you never speak to again). The professor was very attentive to our needs and cognizant of the unique struggles of this semester, and as such was appropriately lenient and willing to adjust deadlines. This course handled the pandemic very well!",
                "The discussion sessions kept me motivated to do the readings and watch the asynchronous lectures. Office hours and the Slack channel were incredibly useful for quick questions and help on psets. I never worked with my group much, so in the future, I think it would be more effective to randomly assign groups earlier into the semester and have a designated time to meet similar to office hours. The asynchronous lectures themselves were less engaging, with the ability to leave questions being the redeeming feature. Shifting the delivery of content to be more balanced between the asynchronous lectures and discussion sessions would be helpful to improve engagement. However, the class was generally organized well for this remote learning environment."

                "Yes, I would definitely recommend the course to another student.",
                "If you are interested in Linguistics this would be a good course to confirm that interest and learn more about the broad field of study.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I took this course as a senior because I had been interested in linguistics for several years, and I think it is a class that works well for students of any year regardless of how much time they've spent in college. It is a really solid overview of every major topic in linguistics and you will definitely leave the class feeling like you've learned a lot. I did not find the weekly problem sets to be stressful or difficult to complete, and there is a lot of support in place if you are struggling. This is a genuinely very interesting and enjoyable class that will not add a significant amount of work to your schedule even if you're taking it as a fifth class.",
                "Yes!!! Professor Bowern is just too kind and knowledgable for you to miss out.",
                "Yes! If youre not too familiar with linguistics and want a nice, not super demanding intro definitely take this course! Dr. Bowern is a wonderful professor that truly cares about their students.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is passionate about languages and wants to develop a more scientific\/analytical understanding of them.",
                "Yes! Linguistics provides such an interesting way to think about language, something we use everyday. Particularly Professor Bowern and Marisha, but everyone I've engaged with in the department has been so passionate, understanding, and kind. You should absolutely take this course if you're even a little bit interested!",
                "Yes, if you are even only partially interested in linguistics.",
                "Yes -- taking this class taught me to appreciate languages, which I used to take for granted.",
                "Yes! I think it's a great introduction to Linguistics and will really let you know if this is a field you would find interesting to pursue. Even if you're not planning on majoring in Linguistics, I think a lot of the information we learned was super interesting and applicable seeing as language permeates nearly every aspect of society.",
                "Yes! It is a great introduction to linguistics. I genuinely feel as though I've taken many things from this class that I will be taking with me, generally as a mind set. Great intro class for anyone willing to try something new or start their linguistics adventure.",
                "Not unless it is required for your major.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any student remotely interested in linguistics. No previous knowledge of linguistics is expected at all, and it is a great opportunity for non-linguistics majors, as well as prospective linguistics majors.",
                "Yes, I definitely would.",
                "I would recommend the class if it was in person. Theres so much about linguistics that wouldve been really cool to learn in person, but the online part really hurt me.",
                "Yes! This course is a straightforward introduction to linguistics that is accessible to anyone with zero background in this area.",
                "Yes I'd recommend it. Linguistics is an interesting field, and this class is a great overview of its most important areas. The workload is relatively low, which was nice. I will note that the class is clearly geared towards beginners (of which I was one), and those with past experience in linguistics might want to take a more advanced course.",
                "Yes, absolutely.",
                "I would recommend to any student interested in linguistics or psychology.",
                "Yes, linguistics is really interesting and this course taught it well.",
                "Yes! You get to learn a lot in this course without having to put in a ridiculous amount of work. It's worth taking just to learn about linguistics (which not that many people are exposed to before college).",
                "Yes, this course is a good introduction to linguistics and offers a new way of thinking about language, culture, and cognitive science for those who may not have much background in these fields. It it a good course to go out of your comfort zone in!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who is interested in linguistics but has not really engaged with it before and is hoping to get baseline exposure to nearly every subfield within the study of linguistics. Going through this course will give you a good idea of what you like and don't like, and areas you might want to explore further in the future. Even if you come away not wanting to pursue linguistics further, this course is enjoyable and fascinating and I would recommend to anyone regardless of major\/area of interest.",
                "110% great for cog sci majors!",
                "Yes, it is a wonderful class to explore each major area of linguistics and get a sense for your interests! I took this class as a complete beginner with a STEM background and ended up really enjoying it. I would definitely take if it you have general interest in linguistics or if you just looking for a cool social credit. Professor Bowern was excellent and very knowledgeable! I would make sure to go office hours and ask plenty of questions. The overarching idea of being able to find patterns and order in such a complicated system is super interesting."
