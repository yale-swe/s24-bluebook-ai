    "I learned about the formation of the Latin alphabet as well as about theories regarding the origins of ancient scripts such as Hieroglyphics and Cuneiform.",
    "I learned about how the alphabet that we used came to be and how our systems of writing have affected the societies that rely upon them.",
    "This course  was very hands-on and engaging. This has been one of the most interesting classes I have taken at Yale and I really enjoyed  both the content and how it was taught.",
    "I learned about the historical development of the alphabet. For the first time in a while, I worked on research for a history paper, so getting back into the swing of that process was helpful. On a meta level, I also learned a little about a field very different from mine: I study biology, so it was interesting to see the dramas and disagreements playing out between a very small group of scholars of the ancient near east. So different from bio!"

   "comments": [
    "The strengths were Professor Thames and the small size of the course. Professor Thames' teaching style and the small number of students made the environment feel very relaxed and encouraged people to participate.",
    "Strengths: interesting syllabus, reasonable workload, great readings, and free-flowing seminar discussions that enabled the students to focus on whichever elements of the course we found most interesting.",
    "Strengths: Professor Thames is very fun and was committed to teaching us the material in new ways. The assignments pushed me to think differently about our alphabet and the way it originated.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the readings could  be a bit dense and hard to follow because of the level of detail, but this  usually  wasn't a problem for class discussions."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I don't believe it will be taught again, but if it is, I highly recommend it.",
    "Yes, very much so",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Each class was different from the  one before and our discussions were all engaging and interesting.",
    "This was a fun course! Some of the readings were a bit dry, but it also wasn't essential to read every single page of every one. There was a lot of freedom to guide the discussion as you (and the others in the class) saw fit, and the final paper was an opportunity to go crazy and research whatever seemed interesting! The field trips (to the Peabody and the Babylonian Collection) were very cool too."
