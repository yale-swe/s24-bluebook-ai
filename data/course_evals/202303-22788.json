Students are taught to analyze the rhythm and meter of pieces from a wide range of musical styles and world cultures (including many songs of our own selection). Throughout the semester, students make class presentations and write about their findings. If you take this class, you will finish the semester with an entirely new, incredibly useful toolbox and approach to music analysis!",

                "Definitely; I would especially recommend this course to any student interested in expanding their tools for analyzing music, broadening their perspective about music theory, and deepening their understanding of the connections between math and music. Professor Cohn gives students so much freedom to choose works to analyze; rather than being bound by a few already-extensively-studied pieces, we are free to choose our own path and come to our own discoveries. The class is well organized and expertly taught in a small seminar format, allowing extensive individual feedback and encouragement.",
                "I think so. A good foundational course, but for people who already have a sophisticated sense of rhythm, it may not provide as much."
