                "I'm not sure how this course could be improved. I think that maybe the psets should have been a little easier, or that there should have been a few practice problems to do as a part of the pre-class homework because I definitely felt like my understanding of the concepts were not good enough for the psets and I always needed a lot of help doing them.",
                "Strengths: material is interesting; peer tutoring is available. Weaknesses: due to everyone already having taken multi in high school, it really messed up the curve. It's not fair to grade those with experience to those who don't. The true false questions don't reflect the studying you put in and for some reason we also kept being asked to write counter examples on test questions. Psets were unnecessarily long, but somewhat reflective of the tests.",
                "I personally thought this course was extremely well taught, contrary to what I heard before taking it. For context, I did take Calc 3 before this year, although I didn't do well in the course. There are ample resources, and my professor was John Hall, who explained things extremely well. I liked the Jamboards and breakout rooms along with the worked out examples. The Psets were difficult, but I utilized peer tutors, who were able to help you however much you needed to solve the problems. The tests were much easier than the practice tests, so I always felt adequately prepared for them.",
                "Strengths: so much support of which I wished I took advantage, Professor Hall is amazing, and the tests and psets are fair for most of the people I have talked to.\r\nWeaknesses: the final project is a little bit of a pain though I would prefer it to a final exam, frequent mistakes on psets corrected one or two days after they are posted. The main thing: it is very time-consuming to learn a concept three times since we are supposed to read the textbook and watch the videos before coming to class every day. The expectation is very inefficient as there could be a better way to structure it.",
                "Strengths: tons and tons of resources available to students including peer tutor office hours (bless the peer tutors!), Ximera, professor office hours, review session before exams, and so many more. Weaknesses: I've heard that instructors are a pretty mixed bag in terms of quality, but it's not super difficult to grasp the material yourself if you take advantage of their resources. I also disliked having prerecorded lectures and reading quizzes; I'm the type of math student who learns better when I am taught by someone and I'm able to ask questions in real time and reading about a concept from a textbook\/video was difficult and felt too much like Khan Academy.",
                "Strengths were a well organized class. There were a lot of resources for practicing problems. Weaknesses were I found the pacing to be extremely fast, and the psets were a big step up what I was used to.",
                "STRENGTHS: Small class sizes make it easy to interject questions during lecture. My professor, John Hall, was in charge of all sections, and his teaching and explanations were exceedingly clear. Problem sets and practice exams were very comparable to the midterms, so we knew what to expect and could prepare accordingly. The plethora of posted resources (Ximera, recorded videos, lecture notes, etc.) made my transition from MATH 230 halfway through the semester very smooth and aided greatly in studying for exams \/ understanding concepts.\r\nWEAKNESSES: From what I've heard from my friends in other sections, the quality of the professors was rather hit-or-miss (however, as I stated earlier, I got lucky with Professor Hall). In my experience, this course's primary weakness was that most of the learning took place outside of class. The readings and pre-recorded videos (due before each class session) laid out the concepts, while class time was typically spent on calculations. I don't think it's absolutely necessary to complete each and every calculation; we know how to integrate. I think spending more time on the parts of example problems which directly involve applying unfamiliar concepts during class would erase the need for those pre-lecture videos, saving everyone's time and benefiting the students. Also, assigning a 30-minute presentation as a final project worth 10% of our grade hardly seems fair for how much work this requires. I personally would have preferred that our third midterm just be pushed back a couple weeks and function as a non-cumulative (or cumulative, I suppose) final.",
                "Strength: Not much. I thought the discussion sections were somewhat helpful but they were usually just repeats of the pre-class videos we had to watch. Beyond that, I didn't find any other strengths in the class. Weakness: Almost all the learning ends up being self-learning.",
                "I enjoyed the problem sets because they were good practice for solidifying the knowledge we gained from class and homework. \r\n\r\nI think my grasp of the material would have been improved if we had been introduced to the concepts during class when we could ask questions in real-time and then practiced problem types for homework.",
                "Strengths: recorded lectures were good, concepts explained well in live section, psets weren't overbearing\r\nWeaknesses: live lectures not really engaging, very fast-paced and covered many topics quickly",
                "I liked how we were in small sections for the lecture. It made it easier to get to know my peers and my professor.",
                "Strengths: Good support system, sufficient resources to learn the material well and prepare for exams\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, we went through some units very fast. I think for students with some prior multivariable calculus knowledge, this was fine. But for students with little to none prior multivariable calculus knowledge, this pace was problematic.",
                "I really enjoyed the lectures, but I thought because the videos already taught the material, lectores could focus more on example problems.",
                "There were a lot of resources present that allowed me to be comprehend the material.",
                "This was a very fast going class, but I think the required reading and videos before class was very helpful for students.",
                "I felt that, when online, the students did not have to fully engage with the material and I barely knew anyone in the class. Professor Hall was a fantastic teacher, but I could see how this course would be far better if it were online.",
                "A very well organized and structured course. A lot of self-studying though.",
                "Math 120 is well-organized and well-designed. The pacing was quick but manageable with effort.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hall is an amazing teacher who knows the subject well and can explain it to anyone in a very brilliant manner....whenever there is a confusion, he makes sure that every particular difficulty is carefully dealt with...he can really empathize; another strength is the practice exams which really mirror the actual exam format....I highly recommend making use of those; the course material is also very interesting and applicable in various fields\r\n\r\nWeakness: Notwithstanding the rigor of the material, the pace of the class is pretty fast so if u miss some part of the class or don't understand key concepts introduced early on, you could suffer.....advice: I highly recommend that u first study Multivariable Calculus from Khan Academy (the playlist has 175 videos) before taking MATH 120........for me, at least, this made the class really manageable and fun, even if I never took MVC in high school and had very little familiarity with Calc 2 topics",
                "The pre-lecture videos were generally very clear and informative. The lectures themselves, technical issues aside, were also good. I found the psets generally too difficult and with all the work I had to do for my other classes I struggled to get them done as well as I would have liked every week.",
                "A good amount of the learning felt routine, which is both a strength and a weakness. Much of the material was not difficult, which is surprising as 120 is the first math I took at Yale after BC Calculus in high school. However, the material was not as engaging and fulfilling. I feel like there was too much focus on doing complicated problems instead of learning important concepts as to how they work. Prof. Hall emphasizes learning to understand and not memorize, and I think shedding more light on the backbones of multivariable calculus in problem sets are important so we can execute them in the complex problems. However, the final project, presenting a practical application of one mathematical topic, was very rewarding to work on.",
                "The strength of this course was that it was taught by Professor Hall. He made the pre-lecture videos so it was helpful taking classes from him. One weakness might be that this course had a flipped learning format. While this format made room for more activities like exercises on Jamboard, I felt that some concepts were just rushed through.",
                "This course lacks a few key things. This course needs to work to engage its students with the math they are learning. It is hard to feel excited to come to class when your instructor goes so quickly and skips enough steps that you cannot accurately follow his writing on the page. It is discouraging and muddies the clarity needed for a course like this to be taught effectively. In general there seemed to be an apathy toward students' needs. I recognized that I needed help in this course early on, and reached out to my instructor multiple times over the course of the semester, as he had told us to do. I was not contacted by the extra instruction teacher (who had been running sessions throughout the semester) until two exams had passed. I had asked for help with exam study at the beginning of the semester, and followed up on it. When I did I was told my instructor (I had no way to follow up directly) would \"check on it.\" This was unbelievably frustrating for a student putting their all into this course, and getting very little in return. Similarly, as content became more difficult, the course did not take the time to make sure that the content was getting across. This could have been helped if the instructors had taken more time on these concepts, maybe giving more feedback on them. If slowing down is untenable, then the instructors of this course should seriously think about creating a version of this course that stretches over two semesters. This course needs to work on being more student friendly, as strange as that sounds. It should not be a gatekeeper, but should excite students about what they are learning.",
                "One weakness was that the course was online which made it difficult for me to learn. I am a very interactive learner, so watching a computer screen was incredible challenging."

I do not know how to improve upon that, but I think that was the only glaring issue I had.",
                "We had breakout sessions where we were given problems on Jamboard and we worked in smaller groups to find answers to them. The professor also used other tools like the survey feature on Zoom. The warmup exercises worked through at the start of each class were also helpful.",
                "It felt like there could have been more thought put into how to engage students online. The instructor ran the class in what appeared to be the same way as if we were in a classroom. At the beginning of the semester there was more effort to engage, but this stopped. Students would be put into groups to solve problems on a shared document, and we would then be given feedback on our effort. This practice stopped almost altogether until the last week or two, but would have been beneficial the rest of the semester. Doing this even twice for some classes could have been helpful. Also, we would do small quizzes before each class, at the end of which we could ask questions to be answered in class. These (not just mine, but the lists of questions in general) were very rarely addressed if at all, which made me wonder whether they were being read or used."

                "I took this class for fun\/for my QR, which I don't recommend. Take this class if you're a stem kid and you have to. This is not a for fun kind of class. You will regret it, I promise.",
                "Only if they have to. John Hall is great and all, but you still have so much self studying to do, especially since you're competing with kids who already took multi in high school. Ximera is your friend. Find good peer tutors.",
                "Yes, I needed it to fulfill my major and pre med requirement.",
                "If you are looking at the class, you will most likely take it at some point in the future... It is not easy but I would definitely recommend taking it with Professor Hall!",
                "It's not a crazy course and it's definitely a manageable QR, especially if you've complete calc BC or multi in high school. I completed the course without taking multi in high school, so it was a bit challenging at times, but there are so many resources available to you that it's alright in the end. Not sure if I would've taken this course if it wasn't a prerequisite, though; the content is pretty cut and dry and not super enthralling.",
                "If you have to take it, take it. Be aware that it felt like a very grindy class, and make sure you read the reviews carefully to find a good professor that teaches it.",
                "If that student can take it with John Hall, yes. He runs the whole MATH 120 program, and he's an excellent professor. However, I've heard from friends in other sections that the other professors are very hit-or-miss. The course material isn't particularly exciting, but it's an important foundation for a lot of majors \/ paths of study. If you liked calculus I \/ AB calculus, you might like this class as well.",
                "Only if you need multivariable for your major. I can't say much about the comparison to ENAS 151 but people have said it is much more engaging is a slight bit easier. The class wasn't the most engaging and a lot of the concepts you had to self-learn. The exams were fair (though the true\/false section worth usually a 1\/5 of the exam kills people's grade) and were always just easier versions of the weekly psets. Though note that the class is usually not curved so you have to score in the A range on exams to get an A in the course. The psets did take a decent amount of time but weren't unreasonable.",
                "Yes! Professor Hall challenged us to think critically about the problems presented before us. Because of his class, I also have a much greater understanding of how vectors and multivariable calculus present themselves in space.",
                "Yes. I think this course can be very challenging if you're coming in without a very solid math background though considering the pace and difficulty of some of the topics. I enjoyed the course and thought the topics I learned were interesting",
                "I enjoyed the subject matter. If the student was interested in math and not afraid of a larger time commitment, I would recommend the course to them for sure.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to students who have done some Calculus before, and would like to study Mathematics or other related fields.",
                "Yes, although it requires lots of work, I was able to master basic concepts of Multivariable calculus.",
                "Yes - it is a good foundation for any STEM or math-based major.",
                "Yes, a good QR credit for those who felt comfortable with calculus in high school",
                "I don't plan on pursuing any STEM-related major. I took Math 120 anyway, and I'm glad I did. Working through long integration problems really did develop my quantitative reasoning.",
                "100%! But please try to have some familiarity with the topics covered....either from Khan or somewhere else........just to make ur semester smoother.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student seeking to major in STEM, or otherwise looking for a challenging QR course. I would not recommend it to anyone who does not fall within those categories.",
                "It depends. Math 120 had classmates with all kinds of math backgrounds. There were some fresh out of Math 115\/Calculus II\/BC (me included), and others who already took Multivariable. Math 120 might not be a good first exposure to Math at Yale, since there is a lot of self-studying involved. Those who already took multivariable might be engaged in applications that were not learned before, but they may find the material a little repetitive. Others who have never taken multivariable before may find this material much more engaging but also very difficult. If you are interested in more application-based maths, Math 120 is a good course. If you like calculus, Math 120 will be a fun challenge for you, but if you don't enjoy learning calculus, don't take this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. While it requires a lot of time outside of class, it is a class that leaves you with that much knowledge. I took it because it was needed in a major that I am interested in, but if it were for QR credit, I'd look to other classes.",
                "I would not recommend this course to a student unless they have to take it. The instructors were kind and seemed to enjoy teaching, but, at the same time, I experienced a lack of care about students' learning and progress. I have read accounts of other students' experiences of this class in more normal years, and it is the same. This course can be a gatekeeper course for students, rather than one that gets them excited about math. I genuinely enjoy and find interesting the math that I learned, but wish that the class was structured in a way that did not just impart the information, but aimed to really have you learn it and enjoy doing so.",
                "Yes, Math 120 was an excellent class to take. It establishes a lot of fundamental mathematical theories that are important in almost every STEM subject."
