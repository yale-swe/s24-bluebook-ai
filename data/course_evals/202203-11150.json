                "Learned a significant amount of introductory Chinese, including character writing, pronunciation, key phrases\/vocabulary, and grammar patterns.",
                "Yale's Chinese Department is just amazing. We learned so much in the L1 course. I can now text Chinese friends mostly in Chinese characters and can speak about most daily activities, in and out of the classroom. While daily character dictation tests were very difficult, I think they really helped us when it came to recognizing characters. I still don't feel like I can write all of the characters we learned from memory, but I feel confident reading, listening and speaking with the vocabulary and structures we learned."

                "Strengths- The structure of the class is very clearly explained to students, and if you pay attention to that structure nothing will ever be a surprise to you. The class also really felt like a learning community, like we were all in it together. \r\nWeaknesses- The textbook feels a little out of date, and also there's more emphasis on vocabulary around academic life than I expected.",
                "Strengths:  A very comprehensive and well-crafted curriculum. Everything in the class made sense and was explained very clearly, and it was taught very efficiently: there was no wasted time or busy work. \r\nWeaknesses: I can't think of any real weaknesses",
                "Learnt how to say my name in Chinese",
                "The course's pacing is one of the best designed at Yale. Although the workload is high, the diverse types of assignments, well-structured syllabus, and the high level of coordination with the in-class presentations makes most of the out-of-class work feel very relevant. One potential weakness is that the course does move over pronunciation basics and character writing quite quickly, and could potentially provide more resources on how to memorize\/practice tones\/hanzi, but there are available assignments and in-class practice as well.",
                "The textbook and the professor were definitely the strengths of the course. I felt the vocabulary and structures of the textbook were perfect for beginner language learners. The pace was great as well. A potential weakness is the large size of the classroom, which decreased individual engagement with the professor. I also felt like the tutorials lessons would have been more useful if we did more speaking practice, but perhaps our level wasn't quite high enough for that yet."

Even if I had no intention of taking more years of Chinese, I wouldn't regret the time I spent it on this semester.",
                "Certainly. The program is exceptionally well-crafted, and I felt a tangible amount of progress. It was face-paced, but I never felt left behind. While I think the workload can be intense, I thought it was a proportionate amount of work for a 1.5 credit class. The characters are the real time sink (in my experience), but the rest is not too bad.",
                "Yes, but be prepared to put in the work",
                "No :(",
                "I wasn't completely new to Chinese, so my adjustment to the language was faster than my peers, but by the end of the semester, everyone was engaging with the material really well. If you're excited about learning Chinese, and stick to the work, the course provides so much substance to build a great foundation.",
                "Yes, definitely! There are so many amazing scholarships to continue Chinese language study in the summer and postgrad. The course and textbook are amazingly designed for student learning. The professor was knowledgeable and compassionate. Chinese is so fun and beautiful!!"
