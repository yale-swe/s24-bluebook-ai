By delving into the subject matter, I was afforded the chance to showcase Montana as an emerging hub for Latinx individuals to converge and establish a collective sense of Latinidad. The course material encompassed various readings that critically examined the political and societal challenges faced by Latinx communities across the nation. Simultaneously, I had the privilege of listening to my peers' personal narratives and their distinctive perspectives on the intricacies of Latino place-making in the United States.",

Professor Hidalgo expanded on the theories of place to have us learn about being Latinx in more spatial terms. I developed an appreciation to learn how people and institutions shape space for their own projects.",

Dr. Hidalgo is amazing at leading discussions and the class environment made it enjoyable. \r\nWeaknesses: Some weeks were VERY heavy on readings and sometimes it was hard to do the weekly reflections (300-500 words).",
                "This course provides an exceptional opportunity for individuals seeking to delve deeper into the profound meaning of latinidad and explore the intricate concepts of space and place within the Latino community. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed this course and appreciated the freedom it granted me to unleash my creativity.",
                "The strengths are the content of the course as well as the discussions. A lot of the students in the class were ready to engage and connect spatial theories from readings to our own examples which provided very rich conversations. I also really enjoyed the co-facilitations as it allowed me to see the content through the eyes of my peers and see their interpretation as well as their practice of the content by having us to do an activity.",
                "It could be improved by having more detailed information on expectations and assignments but was amazing material wise",
                "strengths are class discussions, especially student lead facilitations, and reading content. \r\nWeakness are that some readings are not that relevant to the subject of the week and provide little to no insight into what the discussion is centering--on that note, the readings for every week are also really long and it is sometimes impossible to do all of them in time to post for the early discussion post deadline. I spoke to other students throughout the course and noticed that many people struggled with these aspects as well."

Its in-depth exploration of the meaning of latinidad and the examination of space and place within the Latino community make it a valuable and enriching educational experience. Moreover, the course's allowance for creative expression and freedom of thought further enhances its appeal. As such, I strongly encourage Yale students to consider enrolling in this course and reap the benefits of its insightful content.",
