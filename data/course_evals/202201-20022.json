                "The syllabus!! The authors we read are truly spectacular and the course is worth simply because it forces you to read the syllabus. Also, Mahurin's analysis and commentary on the books is very interesting.",

I would honestly say this class is closer to a leminar Prof. Mahurin always gives very insightful lectures of the books, authors, topics, etc. but also gives people time to bounce ideas off each other!",

                "Dean Mahurin is simple an amazing instructor. Amazing.  The course material is sometimes difficult to read and she deftly guides the students through the difficult parts by hitting them head-on. Dean Mahurin is raw and real and at the same time compassionate and concientious.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The texts were very engaging \r\n- Professor Mahurin is brilliant and points out things in the text that I could never do on my own\r\n- Comfortable space to participate",
                "Strengths- Dean Mahurin, most of all. The reading list is fantastic and the discussions in class were useful. There was a great balance of discussion between the concrete literary elements of the text and broad themes (and their connections to life outside the text). The student presentations were great for hearing the amazing things others in the class had to say and understanding what they found most interesting. \r\nWeaknesses- None, other than I wish I had more time to deeply dive into each of these texts. But each text was essential and Dean Mahurins addition of optional meetings to discuss outside of class time worked to resolve this.",
                "I think the strengths of this course are the syllabus and Mahurin's commentary on the text and focus on specific passages. I think the weakness of this course was the class dynamic. I think every instance of this seminar must be different, but I felt that there was a lack of boundaries in the seminar discussion this semester. I think this was because a lot of the people in the class were in TD and had Mahurin as a dean. I think it's wonderful that she has such close relationships with the students in her college but I think that it created a weird dynamic of people trying to say what she wanted to hear during seminar. I think that she didn't realize how invested students were in gaining her approval and how that affected the seminar discussion. I also think that she had great things to say about the text, but I wish she had just said them instead of fishing for them from students. I think this course would be better as a lecture/leminar because it would get around the dynamic of students trying to say what she wants to hear which contributes to students staking their sense of self in her view of them. I think this was a particularly odd dynamic for a class about afam autobiographies where a lot of the students were people of color and created weird power dynamics.",
                "I can't think of any weaknesses! This course is really well organized.",
                "Strengths: really strong syllabus with engaging, varied texts (poems as well as memoir). Professor Mahurin (best Professor Ive had here. Truly amazing). The people in my class were great as well! Weaknesses: no real ones, though I do wish we didnt only get feedback on the first essay, especially for those who chose the autobiography option for the final. It felt a bit odd to turn in something so personal without any feedback."

                "I would definitely recommend this course for the syllabus and Mahurin's commentary on the books! However, I would shop it and see what the vibe of the seminar is. My class was a lot of underclassmen in TD and it felt like they were trying gain Dean Mahurin's approval. I also think Dean Mahurin wasn't great at setting boundaries in the classroom setting. For this reason, I would try to take this class at some point but shop it to get a feel of the seminar dynamics.",
