   "comments": [
    "Learned a lot about ancient philosophy, particular regarding Plato and Aristotle. Improved philosophical analysis and writing.",
    "This course helps me become a better speaker and contributor to discussion; it pushes me to articulate my ideas quickly and clearly.",
    "Through taking DS Philosophy, I learned a lot about the Western philosophical tradition and the ways in which different thinkers built upon one another. It was very valuable for me to understand the foundation and properties of Western thought and especially insightful to discuss ideas with the professor and fellow classmates.",
    "I engaged with philosophical thought mostly in the Greek and Roman worlds.",
    "I learned basic philosophical thinking and read authors from the western canon. I learned how to participate in a philosophy seminar.",
    "How to grapple with a text, presenting a philosophical analysis, inventing arguments",
    "Intense reading of dense philosophical texts. Analysis of texts. Discussion of ideas we have read. Formulating a cohesive thesis and argument from the material read.",
    "I learned to think in a different way in this class. I had never taken philosophy before so it was intimidating to enter a new area of study but through this course I learned to ask questions and break down difficult texts into both more manageable and even more perplexing parts. This class changed the way I think about life, purpose, and religion.",
    "Analytical skills",
    "Writing skills improved greatly, thinking critically, and expressing thoughts in an eloquent manner during discussion.",
    "I learned a lot about the origins of philosophy and the ways earlier thinkers viewed the world. I appreciated the way Professor Eitel made the course both more approachable and more applicable by drawing comparisons between the hypothetical theories in our readings and real life. This made the worldview of our various thinkers more insightful."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Excellent overall, but the amount of time spent on Aristotle is somewhat frustrating, especially considering the difficulty of the Ackrill translation. Obviously Aristotle's contributions are of utmost importance, especially to the later texts read in the course, but that specific edition was very challenging to read and was not super clearly explained.",
    "Weaknesses: Possibly a rebalancing of the curriculum\/schedule (some of the later philosophers felt abnormally rushed.) Lectures weren't always engaging, unlike section.",
    "The course has excellent materiel and readings. Sometimes it is difficult to get at the most interesting ideas in the readings, especially when people have difficulty grasping the basic concepts or have not done the reading. At these moments, guidance from the instructor is very important.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- Professor Eitel is excellent, such a lovely man. Willing to meet for office hours and gives extensive feedback on papers.\r\n- Interesting texts, if you're into Plato and Aristotle.\r\n- I enjoyed lecture, too.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Class structured around student arguments rather than explanation -- because of the way the class was structured, we had to come up with opinions about the text before we actually understood the main arguments. I wish we had had more explanation of the text before we decided what we thought of it. This wasn't always a problem though.",
    "We often only discussed the very beginning of our reading, before reaching the crux of the pholosopher's work - the central arguments of the text.",
    "I felt as if because the material was so dense, I would have liked more discussion based around the understand of the text. Especially with some of the more telegraphic translations (Ackrill Aristotle comes to mind) I felt as if a lot of what I was reading went over my head and unfortunately we never really took the time to sit down and talk about what exactly they were saying.",
    "This class was amazing. The small, discussion-based was necessary for our exploration of the material and my professor was always available if we reached out and he gave clear, helpful feedback. My class became close because of our shared struggles with the material and the environment designed by the course.",
    "Hard to get through all material but very enjoyable seminar discussions",
    "One weakness is that we go through books so rapidly that it's impossible to fully absorb the full meaning of the work."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely would recommend this course. It's not only an intellectual challenge but a matter of personal enrichment.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is so intellectually stimulating and provides a fertile environment for ideas and revelations to grow.",
    "I would recommend this to someone interested in ancient Western philosophy.",
    "Yes! I learned so much from DS. Professor Eitel is a wonderful, generous and kind man.",
    "Yes",
    "This is an essential course for the DS Program. In that light, I think that if your major requirements allow it, DS is a very fulfilling program and worth the time and energy. Put in the effort and the course work should not prove to be that difficult. It is simply just a lot of reading.",
    "Yes. For Directed Studies as a whole I generally say that one should only take the program if they know that it is what they want to do because otherwise the workload isn't worth it to be miserable for all of freshman year. However, I think that philosophy as we explored it in DS is important for any student and I would definitely recommend for another student to take this philosophy, or if not DS as a whole at least a comparable philosophy course outside of DS.",
    "Yes. Nice introduction to philosophy",
    "I think this is a wonderful course to take if you're interested in philosophy, especially early philosophy. However, if you're moreso in DS for the HP or Lit sections, like I was, be prepared to be pretty frustrated with these texts."
