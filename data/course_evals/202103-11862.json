            "comments": [
                "Professor Baker was the strength of the class. He was kind, approachable, and funny, and he made the class much less stressful. The workload was reasonable and never overwhelming",
                "While the concepts are generally very interesting and important, they sometimes lacked motivation and it seemed like we were just doing random math without any real background.",
                "There is a big emphasis on hw and qualitative understanding over exams and quantitative (mathy) stuff, which i find to be great. I think most would agree.",
                "Strengths: Better than 401 by a long shot",
                "I like that many different topics are covered in depth, and think the exposure to more advanced mathematics in a physics context is very good for prospective majors. However, I think problem sets could be a bit more challenging and lectures could focus more on conceptualization rather than going over every step of mathematical results.",
                "The strength of this course is that it delves deeply into the mathematics behind topics covered in an introductory mechanics class, allowing students to solve a broader range of problems, many more complex than one might have seen before. It also explores topics that may have been covered only briefly in an introductory course, such as coupled oscillations and special relativity. Assigning textbook readings might improve this course, as the material really does come straight from the textbook (and Classical Dynamics is a fantastic book that students in the class should not only be encouraged, but required to read).",
                "Strengths: Prof Baker provided clear lecture notes (that students often referred to instead going to lecture itself); the exams were ridiculously-easy, comprised of 'conceptual', multiple-choice-questions that tested a basic understanding of the definitions and equations described in class, without evaluating a student's problem solving ability whatsoever. Weaknesses: the lectures were almost always unnecessarily confusing, as derivations and problems were often botched on the blackboard. Barring Prof Baker's entertaining anecdotes from his professional life, there was little academic motivation to go to lecture. Furthermore, this course should not be listed as a substitute for, and not a succession to the intro course PHYS 260. I learnt far more physics in PHYS 260, to the point that barring the cursory introduction to Lagrangians and Hamiltonians, the syllabus for PHYS 410 was essentially a subset of what we learnt in PHYS 260.",
                "The strength was the low workload and general low stakes of the class. A weakness was the lectures themselves. Another not so big weakness was that the tests were oftentimes confusing. \r\n\r\nI wish the course would go directly into the new topics instead of covering the exact same topics as in the intro courses. I felt very bored.",
                "I think the course is a good course, but there were some problems with the professor that made it very difficult for the course to be enjoyable. I think more focus should have been spent on Hamiltonian and Lagrangian methods. Also, I felt that the exams and psets were unreasonable at times. Overall, I felt like I would have enjoyed the class if it were not for the fact that I did not understand the material well enough to find it interesting.",
                "I wish there was more time spent really digging into lagrangian, and especially hamiltonian, mechanics.",
                "It felt at times like lecture notes were a more confusing version of the textbook, and lectures themselves were a more confusing version of the lecture notes. That's not to say lecture was uselessif you came in with specific questions, Prof Baker was quite accommodating, and that did serve to clarify issues that we were fuzzy on going into the lecture. Sometimes these would turn into full on tangent mini-lessons, though, which were fine until they started running up against the course deadlines. Baker was good about handling that, though, and there wasn't any sort of nightmare scenario where we were expected to know material we didn't have time to cover in class. I think one of the greatest improvements the course could see is just in terms of logistical smoothnessit sometimes took a while to get responses to emails, the syllabus and lecture notes often needed amending, and things of that nature. I don't want to make it sound like these were deal breakersthey aren'tbut all things being equal it'd be nice to have our schedule laid out form the start. One big upside is Baker's philosophy on exams; essentially, psets are for proving you can do long, arduous math, and exams are for demonstrating conceptual mastery. You won't lose a bunch of points on a super important test because you made arithmetic errors or forgot one relatively obscure equation, which I found to be just a better way of doing things.",
                "There isn't a strength tbh, the material is quite standard. Weakness: we try to cover too many different areas\/chapters.",
                "Prof. Baker is a massive strength of this class. He is incredibly kind, approachable, and cares a lot about his students. However, that being said, this course was a little too easy to be an upper-division physics course. In an effort to emulate graduate entrance exams, Prof. Baker made exams in this class entirely MC. While this was nice at the moment, a certain level of rigor was lost by not having to study for these exams. We also did not cover some core classical mechanic subjects (Noether's theorem) and spent too much time on introductory level material (we spent a full class drawing force diagrams).",
                "Prof Baker has very detailed notes and follows the textbook in content, so it is easy to keep up with the class contents",
                "Hopefully your instructor covers additional and\/or engaging topics. Classical mechanics can be rather dry if it does not have a good problem-solving feel to it.",
                "Strengths: Very easy course and professor Baker is very nice and caring.\r\nWeaknesses: I don't feel like I learned lots of new material, and to be honest the lectures were not great.",
                "Strengths: content. \r\nWeaknesses: comically easy exams, Professor Baker's teaching style.",
                "Problem sets are good, but could be more difficult. Lecture was good until Prof Baker started reading from slides and notes, then it was less good. Exams are different but not as difficult as they could be if they were problem based rather than comprehension based.",
                "The lectures were full of math mistakes that made it difficult to follow. We eventually covered a chapter a week, so the more interesting parts of the chapters were skipped. Likewise, the problem set problems were not difficult or interesting at all, and didn't showcase what could be done with the new techniques we learned. \r\nMidterm and Final were MC tests (a lot of which had 2 - 3 choices) that tested reading skills more than anything else. Their difficulty was comparable to intro high school physics exams. \r\nHard to say I learned much from the class.",
                "Strengths: It is a pretty easy course. Exams were multiple choice and easy, problem sets usually didn't take long. Professor Baker is kind and understanding about potential issues.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't learn a lot in this course, mostly because I didn't have to learn a lot to score well. Lectures were often dominated by doing examples that didn't really teach the material, and some of that time was lost with Prof. Baker getting lost in his notes. I also think that the emphasis should be on the entirely new material (Lagrangian and Hamiltonian) because it is important in future courses, but we only spent a week or two on that."

It was very difficult to go to lecture, because it felt like I would have learned just as much from reading the textbook for the same amount of time. I do not feel like I have a very thorough understanding of most anything we learned.",
                "Yes, it's definitely one of the easiest classes I've taken at Yale, but it remained pretty interesting (and it's required for the intensive major).",
                "I'd recommend it, because if you're here, you're a physics major (or a math major trying to get a BS, in which case this is definitely the one for you). The exams were all multiple choice conceptual questions, which meant that they were really more focused on testing whether you were paying attention in class than whether or not you can complete some Sisyphean mechanics problem. The psets weren't the worst, the material is somewhat interesting, and you should be able to get through just fine.",

                "The problem sets can get quite mathematically involved at times, but otherwise it is a great first step towards the advanced physics elective classes.",
                "Yes. If they learn well from reading the textbook they could get a lot out of it. I found the lectures useful as a supplement to the book, but not always on their own.",

                "I recommend this course to physics majors and math students looking for an easy science course. The class is engaging but exams are very light, so a student looking for a more rigorous treatment is the material might look to other mechanics classes.",

From what I have heard, PHYS 401 teaches the same (or similar) material but it is taught well. With that being said, PHYS 410 is easy and it is a requirement for the intensive major, so if you are looking for an easy course, take this."
