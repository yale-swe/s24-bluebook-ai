    "The Italian department at Yale is so welcoming and helpful! L4 Italian is a great class to continue your Italian language studies and the class size was very small so it meant that I was able to have a lot of talking with other students. I really liked how this class engaged with a variety of texts and films to discuss Italian history and culture. The class was one of my favorites!",
