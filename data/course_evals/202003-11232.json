                "The (very) small seminar format was a huge plus for me - everyone was unmuted all the time, we could interrupt, ask questions, laugh, make comments. Although the sessions are quite long (almost 2 hours on most days), time moved faster than slower. When in discussion with peers, it always seemed like we didn't have enough time. Also because the group was so small, we became very close, and we were able to open up, share, and connect in a deeper way than I experienced in other classes\/sections. Professor Ahn is wonderful and she cares a lot about her students. She is always more than happy to help if you ask nicely. Her powerpoints are also the creme de la creme.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes time did pass slowly if you didn't fully engage, so be sure to do the readings and pay attention.",
