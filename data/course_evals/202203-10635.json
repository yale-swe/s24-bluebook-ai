                "A thorough exploration and analysis of the genre of the \"grotesque.\" This was also my first time reading a novel in the Russian language. Since I started learning Russian a few years ago a major goal of mine has been to start reading Russian literature, but I was always overwhelmed about where to start. I am so glad I took this course because, in addition to exploring the genre of the grotesque, it has shown me 'how to read' in Russian, as well as 'how to compare/analyze texts' in Russian.",
                "At the end of the semester, I joked to my friends that this class has given me the tools to go insane if I ever want to. What I was trying to capture with that statement was that, aside from enriching my Russian reading and composition skills and exposing me to a new branch of Russian literature, this class implicitly painted a deep and philosophical portrait of the human psyche, which I really enjoyed. Because all the narrators in this course on the Grotesque are insane, and the reader's reality is so blurred with their fantasy, there are lots of delightful opportunities for the student to quietly question elements of their own existence and their personal experience of art.",
                "I developed an understanding of the Grotesque genre of fictional writing. In reading the pieces outside of class and preparing reading responses I strengthened my Russian reading and writing skills. I also developed vocabulary to discuss the readings through class discussions and informal class presentations, as well as written exams."

                "No weaknesses at all. The strengths of this course are numerous. Some of the biggest strengths are that 1) Doctor Muravnik has realistic expectations for his students and does not require native level/ advanced proficiency to excel in this course. Students are assessed/ graded based on their individual level alone. 2) Doctor Muravnik does not force students to speak, which is great for non-native/ non-heritage students like me who get anxiety when speaking Russian in a room full of fluent/ near fluent Russian speakers. 3) Big focus on reading, but minimal writing (yay!)  4) Easy vocab quizzes, and we go over the vocab lists in class!"

            "comments": [
                "Yes, I highly recommend!! This is a highly worthwhile, enlightening Russian L-5 content course. It's truly such an enjoyable class. The instructor is extraordinary. Any course with this instructor is sure to be an incredible experience. The minimum to get in is 3 years of Russian, and if that is you and you are questioning whether or not you are ready for an L-5 content course (exactly how I was feeling when I was considering enrolling in the course, and I took the chance, as you should too!), just know that Doctor Muravnik grades students based on their individual level alone. So what is expected from a native speaker, or a fluent heritage speaker (which will be most of the class) will not be expected from someone who just started learning Russian a couple years ago. In order to succeed in this course just come to class, do the readings and reflections as best you can, and that's literally all that is expected. You aren't expected to understand 100% of everything that is read, but you are expected to do the best you can. Also, the written assignments are SHORT. Lots of reading, but submitted writing is like half a page a week, OR LESS. FOR ALL LEVELS TOO. The reflections are free form, so you can also write about anything in the reading (you also have the option to answer some of the reading comprehension questions as an alternative). And also, if you want to push yourself, you can submit lengthier written work, and Doctor Muravnik will actually take his time and sit and grade longer submissions if you want to practice writing, even adding a lot of his own commentary about the passages you write about, something I really appreciated! It just shows how dedicated he is to his students and his craft. Additionally, there are vocab quizzes every other week which are EASY. Exams- there are two or three written take home tests which may appear long at first, but the questions at most really do only require a meaningful paragraph. Again, you are graded on your own level. In class participation means you need to add at least minimally to the class discussion every day (a couple sentences/ thoughts/ reflections). For non-native/ non-heritage speakers like myself, it can be anxiety inducing having to talk in Russian in a room full of fluent speakers, but please know that Doctor Muravnik's expectations are realistic for students at every level. I found that if you just come to class, do the best you can, and if / when the instructor calls on you to answer one of the reading comp questions, you're only expected to say a couple sentences about it at most. VERY EASY! If you take this course and apply yourself, Doctor Muravnik is your biggest fan for the semester. So just enroll in the course. It can be a life changing class, if you let it, and you can easily find something in this course that fills your spirit and stays with you long after this class is over.",
                "I 100% would recommend this course. Professor Muravnik is one of the most erudite, meticulous and caring professors at this school , and he supplements discussion of Pelevin with a huge range of sources from the Russian literary canon, Western and Eastern philosophy, pop culture, etc. Chapev y Pustota is also a must read - very mind-altering experience",
                "Yes, the course was very interesting on a literary level and also effectively engaging for students with diverse Russian backgrounds. (E.g. some people had taken through L5 Russian at Yale, while others came in with various levels of native/heritage experience.) A great course to further your study of modern Russian literature.",
                "Yes I would. My only concern arises from the fact that the language ability of the class varied greatly. I think the professor managed it very well, but it was a challenge for weaker students like myself, to always follow exactly what was being said. Advanced and native speakers certainly get more out of this class concerning the literary works themselves, than others do. However, it's very manageable for weaker speakers as well."
