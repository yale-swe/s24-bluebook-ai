    "This class is extremely important to any engineering or stem student. We learned how to solve and use differential equations.",
    "I learned various techniques of solving and applying both ordinary and partial differential equation to the physical world. The mathematical insights allowed me to connect the course with its abstract, mathematical roots.",
    "I learned a lot about differential equations and how to apply concepts I learned to harder, more complex problems.",
    "Through this course, I was able to gain insight of partial and ordinary differential equations, as well as math concepts applicable for engineering methods.",
    "I learned about different methods for solving differential equations.",
    "I developed the ability to analyze and solve certain types of differential equations. I was able to obtain knowledge on the use of differential equations in the context of mechanical vibrations, waves and elastic strings. I gained the skills to model different systems using differential equations and solve these derived differential equations.",
    "I actually feel I learned a lot in this course about solving differential equations and how to apply them to the work that I do as a to-be engineer. Prof. Smooke is a great teacher I think and the summer set up with the online course was actually probably better for me than the real term course, so Im so glad I took it now.",

   "comments": [
    "The recorded lectures were great because they allowed me to go at a comfortable pace. Towards the end of the course, however, I found myself treating the lectures as a slide show because the words on the slides were repeated almost word-for-word anyhow, leading me to think that maybe adding the slides themselves might also be helpful.",
    "Virtually, it's a bit harder to engage with the material, but the professor did a really good job at presenting it.",
    "I feel like the online lecture format is not very helpful. Although the professor answers questions during lecture, the lectures themselves are not very helpful. They jump many steps and leave it to the student to figure out how to get from point A to point B many times, which can be extremely frustrating. As for strength, the TA's are incredible and definitely put in the time and effort to help the students. I would improve it by having the professor work out the problems during class rather than just read them from the powerpoint and give more example relevant to the psets.",
    "Very strong asynchronous class with an \"in class\" element. Professor Smooke was an incredibly wonderful professor. He was very kind and made the effort to learn all 40 student's names, even though it was an online class.",
    "Strengths include a solid professor and well informed TAs. Very straight to the point course with plenty of practice problems to master concepts. Weaknesses include the fast paced nature. Very easy to get behind or lost if a concept is misunderstood. Lastly, the lecture slide format was sometimes hard to follow, leaving a chalkboard or live problem solving to be desired.",
    "Strengths: TAs, having lecture videos ahead of class, posting assignments well in-advance, pretty fair grading (we'll see ab that tho)\r\nWeaknesses: no way to collaborate with students :( , a LOT of work, final was way more difficult than other tests, fast-paced, limited office hours with TA and you have to schedule an appointment with prof",
    "The strengths include the engagement with the material via the homework and the TAs. The weaknesses include lack of class participation and general lecture style (i.e. simply reading the slides).",
    "I liked the lecture videos and watched them before each class. In class, Professor Smooke went over the lectures that I had already watched and thought it was somewhat repetitive. Instead of going over the lectures in class, maybe class time could have been used to answer any questions about the material\/gone over concepts the class found tough and then work on some practice problems.",
    "Course moves way too fast in the summer. Dont take it in summer session, especially not with another course.",
    "I think this course has the potential to be more engaging\/interactive.",
    "Strengths of this course included the live classes and the opportunity to set up meetings with the Professor and TAs in order to discuss content. The material was clearly taught in class and lectures were very engaging. The problem sets covered an appropriate range of problems that was reflective of the material taught and provided good practice. Weaknesses of the course include the lack of solutions provided for the problem sets and exams and the limited time for office hours. The course could be improved by making sure to provide clear solutions to problems sets and exams. Solutions are always very helpful to me in understanding content, studying for exams and the overall learning process.",
    "The strengths are that Prof Smooke posted videos of the lectures beforehand, which meant I could watch as many times as I needed, take notes, and figure out where I was struggling before I even got to class. This was SUPREMELY helpful and I wish all my teachers and classes would do this! It takes a lot of pressure off of lecture time, which I then treated as almost a review, where I could clear up any questions or concerns and hear my classmates ask their questions too. \r\nThe weakness of this course is that they required us to schedule exams outside of class time. No other class did that, and actually because of the videos beforehand class times were ALWAYS cut at LEAST AN HOUR short, so we had plenty of scheduled class time to take the exams. I really dont understand why we could not have done the lectures in tues-weds and the exams Thurs during class time, or something like that. During the school year exams are scheduled outside of class but they are also usually presented that way before class even starts so we can schedule our lives around that. It was a little frustrating, as I spent a lot of time taking care of family members and working this summer outside of class times and I had to move things around when I didnt feel I should have needed to. \r\nWe also had to find a completely silent room where we could be alone for the 60-120 min of the exam, which is great except that I have 8 other people living in my house and that was really difficult to do and I took 3 other classes this summer that didnt require that so Im not sure what the deal was with that. \r\nI hope Professor Smooke will take such circumstances into consideration in the fall and possibly spring if we are still online. I know we are all still figuring it out so I dont hold any animosity towards him of course but I do think he could do better.",
    "I liked watching the lectures ahead of time, but I would prefer if he wrote out the problems instead of just posting powerpoints.",
    "This class was primarily a self-study course, and although you could get help from the TA and instructor, the scheduling due to it being a summer course made it very difficult to receive help apart from certain designated times. Homework took a very long time, and the textbook will become your best friend in explaining the material. \r\n\r\nMost of tests were fair, except the final. There were four 1-hour exams, and for the most part, these exams were doable if you studied the material. In the final, however, the averages for the exams dropped from a mid-range B to a D. This had to do with a couple of factors. The last week of material was somewhat rushed through and there was little actual class time covering the material (which was significantly more difficult than the first few weeks of class). Also, the instructions on the exam were vague, and many students missed points for not \"completing\" the solutions. \r\n\r\nCanvas was very well organized for this class, and all lectures were recorded!",
    "Cramming a 13 week class into 5 weeks was rough. There was so much content to cover and not enough time to do so."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "If you like math or might use differential equations in future classes, then by all means.",
    "Yes",
    "Yeah, it's a basic requirement for many of the engineering classes and isn't terrible. Probably, the class would've been easier to manage over the semester, but because of the shortened time, the YSS workload was massive.",
    "Yes, if they have to take a differential calculus class I would direct them to ENAS 194, especially if it is with Prof. Smooke",
    "I mean, this course is likely not going to be offered in an online format over the summer again, so you'll likely avoid the difficulty of the material being super rushed. You def learn a lot in a short amount of time but it's worth it. You likely have to take this for your major anyways. As long as you have good TAs and stay on top of everything, you'll be fine.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student during the academic year. The summer version was too rushed and skipped over conceptual insights that are essential to the theory of differential equations. Furthermore, the course skips over two very important chapters (Linear Algebra and Sturm-Liouville Theory) that should be included. Nevertheless, the first few chapters are taught fairly well, and the rest of the course is doable if you put in the effort. Finally, most students that take this course have to take it. However, if you're looking for a theoretical introduction to differential equations, take the math counterpart to this course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone interested in engineering\/math.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, particularly for its rigor and importance to engineering.",
    "I would recommend they take it over the school year, not summer session.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is considering engineering\/applied math\/data science.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The course covered many aspects to differential equations and provided a solid foundation in applying and solving differential equations in varying systems. Having completed this course, I feel like I can now model many problems in science and engineering and think that the course is vital to future engineering classes.",
    "I would recommend this course and I also wish that my earlier self had not been so afraid of this course. Its very interesting and dare I say fun for those of us who enjoy math, and wasnt nearly as difficult as I expected (except the final was extremely challenging).",
    "No, especially if you want a more conceptual understanding of differential equations. ENAS 194 was the most boring class I've taken. This really an APPLICATION based course, and will become really tedious if you are not interested in the applications. The problems are excruciatingly long as well, some taking over an hour to finish, with most of the time spent manipulating variables and not using the actual new techniques. You'll become an expert at integration by parts by the end of the course. \r\n\r\nThis class makes you question why you are learning this material in the first place. The methods you learn seem pointless, unless you are dying to solve thermodynamics\/fluid dynamics problems in a different course. \r\n\r\nAlso, lecture isn't too helpful, and for most of the course, you will have to self-study. If you take it during the summer as well, attendance is MANDATORY.",
    "Durring the summer NO!, but maybe durring the school year yes."
