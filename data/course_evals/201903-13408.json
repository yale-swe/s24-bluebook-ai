   "comments": [
    "My writing improved tremendously, specifically organization of ideas.",
    "I feel like I've gained basic skills to be able to be confident in reading and writing. Although I don't feel completely confident to write on my own, I definitely gained what I need to keep growing.",
    "I learned how to successfully conduct research on a topic and transfer it into a paper.",
    "I developed how to put texts in conversation and include a they say\/I say into my writing",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to college-level writing. Above all, I learned academic writing is the process of entering a conversation, that we should always take others views into consideration, and that we should always bring new insights.",
    "In this course, I worked on my writing skills, learning how to more coherently organize my thoughts and develop more original topics for papers. Beyond the writing, I learned how to reflect in an unplugged setting and will continue to use those skills throughout my life, both in academic and non-academic circles.",
    "I was able to gain the benefits of taking the writing process step-by-step throughout the semester.  Professor Coleman did an incredible job and the content of the course was extremely relevant.",
    "Argumentative writing, critical analysis of other people's writing, and an understanding of my classmates through the \"unplugged\" presentations.",
    "My writing skills became much stronger."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It is good to have a break while writing and this course offered class trips which had to do with the course and helped our mind relax.",
    "I liked the interactive real-life aspect of the course. I wish there was more discussion time, but other than that I feel like I learned lessons that are beneficial to my life and not just academics.",
    "I think it would benefit the entire class to have discussions more frequently .",
    "This course helped improve writing a lot and we did fun activities as a class.",
    "The only weakness I can think of is taking more time to discuss specific ways in which to improve our writing, as opposed to having one paper assigned directly after one is turned in.\r\n\r\nIt is a really engaging and useful course. Also, it was an excellent introduction to academics at Yale, because through the many field trips we took we were able to discover different things at Yale.",
    "The strengths of this course lie in the dedication of the professor to help us develop, both as writers and people. She developed workshops where we could learn from our peers while also supplementing this with one-on-one conferences with her and detailed feedback on our papers in all stages. Additionally, she planned many field trips that allowed me to get a better understanding of the resources on campus and expand my knowledge. By focusing on the individual unplugged activity and tasking us with journal entries, I felt that I learned a lot about myself and became more reflective in my day-to-day. In general, this course could be improved by taking more time to discuss readings and debate.",
    "It might be helpful to take this course a little bit slower as it pertains to the actual process of writing. Sometimes it felt like we were just told to write without any direction we had to figure it out ourselves. This course is strong in its ability to connect people and produce works that one can be proud of.",
    "Prof. Alison is the number one strength of this course. You'd do well to find a professor who cares more about her students and their growth as writers and participants of the class. She listens attentively to her students' comments, and always makes a strong effort to respond to everybody's contributions, making her students feel more comfortable participating in class (for you introverts out there--this is huge!). If you have suggestions, she genuinely takes them into consideration, consistently asking her students for feedback as to how she could improve the class. \r\nWhat makes this class absolutely unique among everything I've taken at Yale is the \"unplugging\" activity. It made the class feel a whole lot more personal--we got to choose to spend an hour a week doing some sort of activity that we're interested in but otherwise don't do bc of lack of time or whatnot. There were some creative choices by students in this class. The trade of a fourth essay for that unplugging activity was one I'd make over and over and over again.",
    "Very well structured class with clear goals."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, great professor and I learned new writing techniques.",
    "Yes, I think a class like this which is more experienced-based learning is something everyone should try. I also think that basic English classes are beneficial to building some writing skills you'll need later on. It is never boring or dry. I felt really engaged in every class.",
    "Yes, I felt that it was a great introduction to writing at Yale.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot and our professor was really nice and helpful.",
    "I would totally do it. It is an excellent way to develop the skills needed to write efficiently at college.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It allowed me to grow as a student and a person and the professor was incredibly communicative.",
    "This course is a really useful introduction to the writing that is required at a place like Yale.  It's definitely not the end, but it is a good beginning.",
    "Definitely",
    "Perhaps think of this course as what the \"Psychology and the Good Life\" course tried to achieve but could not. I want to recommend this course to everyone I know, but at the same time, it feels too precious to share with the whole Yale community--I would want my close friends to enjoy this experience. You'll improve your writing and reading skills, yes, but you'll do much more than that. You'll get a better sense of Yale as a campus, by taking campus tours, visiting the YUAG, going up to YSB to learn about hair from a science prof, checking out minerals at the Peabody, and much much more. A truly invaluable experience.",
    "Yes - I really enjoyed the topic of \"unplugging\" and Alison Coleman was a great professor."
