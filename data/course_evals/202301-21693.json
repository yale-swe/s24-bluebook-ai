            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Amazing course material selection and the professors are good at teaching the material. Also, Dr. Pyle hosting \"Molecular Biology Lunch\" with Dieter Soll (genetic code) and Joan Steitz (splicing + everything) was fantastic for bringing engagement to the course. The weekly journal readings and associated study guides were great for learning more specifics about molecular biology. The selection of research papers is also fantastic.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the course doesn't focus enough on critical thinking in molecular biology. I think there could be additional focus on the experiments that led to the discoveries we learn about. I think that this could just make the class more interesting.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Pyle is an incredible professor. She clearly cares about students. Dr. Isaacs also was a great lecturer. I really liked the material we learned, but at times it felt like the lectures went over-time and included information that was not super relevant/necessary given the scope of this class. I would have appreciated if that material had been cut out and we focused mainly on the concepts with examples to illustrate them. Weaknesses: The TAs were great, but the ability they could help us was limited due to their not having a great understanding of what the professors believed was most important for us to know. I would have appreciated more communication between the Professors and TAs so that the TAs would be able to help us better understand what to prioritize when studying.",
                "The strength of this class is that it is a relatively low workload, pretty comparable to the bio sequence. Aside from weeks of an exam, there are no problem sets, just reading responses for papers, they usually took 2-3 hours per week. The weaknesses in this class are the exams. 3 exams that are worth 25%, and each exam is 10 pages long. Don't expect to finish them early either: it's either you know a majority/all of the content on the exam and you are writing for 75 minutes straight or you leave problems blank-- no in between.",
                "Both professors are knowledgeable and teach well. The section papers correspond with what was taught in lecture. \r\nWeakness is just how much information they expect you to absorb from lecture, would appreciate some form of outline on the important pieces they really want you to learn versus the things they tell you about purely from a point of interest.",
                "Strength: a lot of content about molecular biology; involves contemporary research. Pyle is a great instructor. Weaknesses: Isaacs does not care about teaching; he walks into the classroom at 9 am having yet to edit all his slides.",
                "Strengths: fascinating material that all builds on each other, interesting papers discussed in section that improved my understanding of course material\r\n\r\nweaknesses: exams at times seemed more focused on testing our speed than our actual understanding of the material.",
                "Good",
                "Strength: discussion sections that helped supplement the lecture\r\nWeaknesses: no access to recorded lectures",
                "Strengths: exams were actually pretty straightforward and the class was very organized. Weakness: it was very difficult to tell what the exam was actually going to test on and you were expected to memorize A LOT. I think it would have been beneficial to offer homework and study guides that allowed us to practice the material.",
                "too much paper to read",
                "The workload for this class is very manageable, however in order to pass, you must take the initiative and study a little at least every day. Each lesson is packed with a lot of information, so it is not sustainable to only study before the tests.",
                "Strengths: Excellent teachers, patient at answering questions, and readily available to help.  Also, the discussion sections are very interactive.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the tests are hyper-specific to the material, and a lot of questions were just \"you know it or you don't.\"  I think the tests could use more critical thinking, longer problems.",
