Some strengths were that we got to delve deep into examples, but some weaknesses were that we only covered a few examples for each chapter.",
                "I loved this course overall, mostly because of Sebastian. Although I really enjoyed the group projects, I wish there had been a greater variety of projects rather than just videos, because in many of these video projects one of the people who knew how to use iMovie or TikTok would carry the whole thing. However, I enjoyed the course material and through the peer work in class I made many good friends.",
                "Strengths -- a lot of different assignments that engage different skills (speaking, writing, etc). Meets frequently which helps with learning. Weaknesses -- compared to last semester, participation was not as heavily encouraged. At times it felt like corrections while speaking were more like getting cut off.",
                "This course was strong in the aspects where it tried to go beyond simple grammar and focus on overall fluency.",
                "The main strength of this class was group projects, as I was able to connect with other students. I also enjoyed talking about my weekend in Spanish with my classmates. As a Christian student, however, I did not enjoy the unit on witchcraft.",
                "repetitive",
                "I liked that there were no tests and I enjoyed the projects. The topics in class were interesting.",

                "One particular strength of the course are the many ways in which we practice our writing. I also appreciated beiong able to develop our own interests in the individual projects!",
                "More talking. Some of the subjects touched upon were very complex and I didnt have the vocabulary to talk about them",
                "The weakness of this course is something that applies to many language classes at Yale: it meets almost every day. This means that there is a lot of work (sometimes a lot of busy work). The strength of the course is the instructor. Professor Diaz was fantastic. He made the class interesting, gave helpful feedback, and was very helpful.",
