Before this class, I believed that the body was only a vessel for the mind, and that the health of the mind and the health of the body were independent of each other. It feels silly now to write that because I know now that that is completely wrong. I have also learned that no matter how healthy or comfortable you are, you can always improve. My posture has improved, my flexibility has improved. I have learned to never settle for discomfort. Whenever I feel tight or uncomfortable I do my best to change that state. By improving my physical health, I improved mental health as well. I feel happier and more content with myself. I was not in the greatest mindset this summer during the pandemic and this class has honestly improved my life so much.",

                "I love how we got to move during most of our classes. Dancing or moving in class always made me feel more energized and engaged. Our discussions were always fun (although they would of course have been much better in-person). My only issue with this class is that it sometimes felt like a pseudo science. As in subjective opinions were discussed much more than objective fact. I understand, however, that this is not a science class, and it may just be the STEM major in me that makes me feel this way.",
                "Great professor and interesting topics.",
                "A main weakness is the inability to truly practice dances and movements due to the limitations of our dorm size. Under normal conditions we would have a whole dance studio to move and interact with our students: something that is impossible to do over zoom.",
                "Strengths: Very fun, active, and very informative.\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of the activities done in class had no or barely any connection to the reading, which made me feel like \"Why did I read all that not to ever use it in this class?\" Like, those readings were cool and sometimes really interesting (other times boring), but I would have appreciated if we used that knowledge more.",

                "I loved this class, but I was constantly reminded how much better it could have been in-person. All I know is that dancing a lot more fun when you can do it with a group of people in the same room than when you do it in separate rooms over zoom. It's a difficult problem because this is an inherently physical class. I don't have the solution and I think that professor MacArthur did the best job she could have in adapting this class to online.",
