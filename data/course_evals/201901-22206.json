    "CHEM 335L is an awesome lab course!! it was nice to have small lab sections, and the experiments we did were really interesting. learning about the principles behind quantum dots, SEM imaging, single molecule fluorescence, optical trapping, etc. were great. the second half of the course was a little less organized than the first - lab report grading came back later, and the lab handouts were comprehensive but sometimes a little unclear\/confusing in the directions. but overall, it was so enjoyable to learn about these advanced materials chemistry and biophysical techniques. make sure you budget more time than you think for the lab reports - they take time!",
