                "I would say that the workload is very manageable and the tests were, in general, fair. I would suggest removing the conversation partner part of the class because I found it useless.\r\n\r\nI think the course could be improved (and the entire german language instruction at Yale) by teaching to one of the Goethe Zertifikat books. That way, we would be able to take the test should we need it for professional purposes in the German speaking world.",
                "This course is a lot of work, which means you get consistent practice with the material. I always felt like I was engaging in German and I was given many opportunities to improve. I also feel that this course gave us chances to work on writing, reading, listening, and speaking as well as learn German history and culture. However, I feel like the workload was sometimes excessive and, at a certain point, became busy work. I wish there was a bit more flexibility in the syllabus so the course could help students learn at their own pace; while some units went by too quickly, others felt slow. I also think this course could improve if a different textbook was used--the organization of the textbook was a bit odd and sometimes unhelpful.",
                "The course is great for learning general grammatical structures in the German language. However, much of the vocabulary for exams is learned outside of class and is not used during class discussions.",
                "Strength: Instructor was amazing!!! She made the course a whole lot better than how it was intended. Course frequency was good as well. \r\nWeakness: Course material could be better. As someone who has learnt German through German instruction beforehand, I didn't like learning German through English instruction in the materials (the book or so). 50 minutes was a bit short for genuine learning.",
                "This course is great in teaching about German society, and about how to build more complex sentences and phrases in German. The one thing that could be improved is the fact that there were no group projects. Group projects can sometimes facilitate language learning, and I would have liked to have at least one group project.",
                "This course was very much structured by the book, to the point where it wasnt very flexible to the needs of our classes. For instance, some of the assignments and tests covered material that was a few weeks out of sync, and there wasnt as much time in class to branch into natural conversations and discussions as I would have liked. That being said, the lectures in class taught me a lot of good grammar and vocabulary and I really liked having smaller tests every two weeks instead of a large final at the end of the semester. The textbook used was also fairly outdated and used a few words that arent as acceptable these days.",
                "This course was one of my favorites because I find the language really interesting. One downside was that the number of small assignments was hectic and occasionally hard to follow. The work is very doable, but keeping track of all of it is challenging."

The course requires a lot of consistent work and it can be difficult to keep up--the content itself is not overwhelming and the grading is not harsh, but the density of work is a lot. I also did not love the textbook we used and felt the course material could be better organized with a different textbook. If you want to learn German, you have time in your schedule and Shila is teaching the course, I would definitely recommend it.",

                "Yes, I'd, if they want to learn German.",
                "I definitely would because in the course you are able to learn not only German, but also German culture and society.",
                "Yes, Shila was one of the best professors Ive ever had, and the course itself was definitely fun and manageable. The weekly assignments can sometimes be hard to keep track of, but its overall a good course to take.",
                "Yes! This course is engaging and even fun. You gain both a comprehensive understanding of the German language as well as the culture."
