   "comments": [
    "Way too much work. And way too harsh grading. Literally dont think a single person in my class got an A due to her grading policies. She also only speaks in German to us, and she doesnt explain the instructions of things well.",
    "The strength of the course for me was the variety of activities and the multiple different assignments each week, which kept me working on my language skills consistently. The online homework system was convenient, but sometimes the activities were confusing and presenting technical frustrations. Sometimes I was marked down for inputting data incorrectly, and had to restart assignments. The automated grading of some of the homework questions is not ideal in this regard.",
    "This course moves relatively fast in that it covers a lot of information for L1 but the workload is definitely manageable. This course places equal emphasis on vocabulary and grammar along with German culture. The fact that this course is taught in German from the first day makes it challenging to grasp the information at the beginning.",
    "Strength is obviously learning German - and its also just fun to get to chat about little day to day things w classmates in a way that you cant normally at Yale. \r\nMain weakness, I think, is we often had homework only once a week, whereas I think I really would have benefitted from smaller assignments every night.",
    "Strengths: group work; german cultural lessons with film, songs; emphasis on vocab and pronunciation\r\n\r\nweaknesses: lack of formal lessons about grammar; self-learning"
