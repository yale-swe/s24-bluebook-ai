                "Strengths: Yale's Chinese department is very well-organized as a whole. Liu Laoshi, who was directing the umbrella course, gave very clear instructions. The weekly syllabus was easy to understand and the feedback on coursework was also very comprehensive. I definitely learned a lot. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I believe Guo Laoshi is a new professor so there were some days when we were not as engaged because we had already gone through all the textbook material, and were just reading off of the board. I think it could benefit from more social learning activities, such as Chinese Jeopardy, making example sentences in partner pairs rather than having to raise your hand and volunteer individually, and more collaborative activities in general.",
                "The strength is the discipline the course requires. You learn a lot in the course of a semester. I think it could be improved to encourage more small discussions among classmates.",
                "Strengths- well organized, great for heritage speakers, strong focus on writing characters",
                "This class makes you memorize numerous amounts of characters, which is good since you will be able to read more Chinese. However, memorizing the textbook is a boring way to learn.",
                "Strengths: Lots of individualized feedback\r\n\r\nWeakness: Class became boring at times when we just read passages aloud"

                "Yes, especially if the student struggles with writing characters.",
