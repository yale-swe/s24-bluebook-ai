    "interesting discussions on ecology and politics",
    "Got to read a load of books with really interesting subject material!",
    "I learned how the high modernist control of rivers has disrupted non-human animals' livelihoods.",
    "This course does a great job of exposing people to more spiritual interpretations of nature. Students are better able to analyze the pros and cons of practices like environmental impact statements and cost-benefit analysis, while criticizing the idea that enough money can justify anything.",
    "- discussion approaches via the seminar method\r\n- critical thinking",
    "The ability to sit and discuss a wide range of environmental and political topics with Professor Scott is invaluable. Not only he is a wonderful teacher, Professor Scott is excited to engage with his students on whatever topics they choose, making this course more of an intellectual exploration centered around rivers, with subjects ranging from the dispersal of early settlement to whether nature should have legal rights. I learned so much through this course about the environment and its interaction with political structures and so much more."

   "comments": [
    "brilliant professor and insightful peers, but not much structure in terms of assignments\/learning outcomes",
    "Great discussions!",
    "The course's syllabus is outdated. Few of the readings are from the 21st century. The course could be improved with a revamped syllabus. I also think the course should include another assignment besides the final paper to allow students to engage with the course material more closely. The main strength of the course is Jim Scott, a renowned political scientist whose life experiences make any conversation thought-provoking.",
    "The course's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. There is almost no structure to the course outside of the weekly readings which means that discussions were able to flow wherever students or Professor Scott wished them to go. Sometimes though this was somewhat frustrating as it seemed that whole classes could go by without reaching anything posed by the reading for the week, whereas in other classes great topics of conversation were brought up from other students individual experiences and academic backgrounds.",
    "This course is extremely interesting, and the conversations were incredible. The workload (all the readings) is very heavy, and he does not always draw direct lines from the books to the conversations. Sometimes only certain chapters are relevant, but the whole book is assigned: if you can figure out which parts are relevant, it becomes much easier.",
    "I think there is little that could be improved with this course. Professor Scott has selected a great assortment of literature to read before every class, and the discussion points he uses to focus our class periods are fascinating. The loose nature of the final paper topic in addition to the short topic presentation  a few weeks earlier made that assignment exceptionally manageable, and gave me a lot of intellectual freedom to choose a topic that interested me. Overall, this was one of if not my favorite course at Yale so far, and I see no clear ways it could be improved."

   "comments": [
    "Would recommend if you enjoy reading books, or if you are interested in the way we think of rivers and the way rivers influence society. Interesting class!",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. Class discussions were unstructured, and the reading list was outdated.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are excited for the readings and are willing to fully engage in high-level conversations. If any of that sounds like a chore, absolutely do not take this class.",
    "Yes - I very much enjoyed this course and reading these books. Jim was good guide for the seminar and I have improved my debate\/argument and conversational skills greatly.",
    "100%! Please take this course if you have any interest in the intersection between politics and the environment and\/or rivers more specifically. Professor Scott is a treasure and makes every class a wonderful intellectual exploration. There is a fair bit of reading (around a book a week) and Professor Scott cold calls students at the beginning of class to offer their initial thoughts, so preparation is necessary. However, the class is very casual and the tangible requirements for the class are also quite minimal. Also, Professor Scott brought in the authors of several of the books we read which was a super informative and interesting experience as well. So overall, if you have the chance to take this course, I would definitely recommend it for a great seminar atmosphere."
