                "Learned how to data clean (formatting data, reading in data from PDFs and html files), use more vectorized R functions (sapply, lapply), use the leaflet package to create cool visuals; essentially just more about the entirety of the process of analyzing data",
                "Definitely the best course of the S&DS major. Picked up a lot of skills in modelling, data cleaning, and graphic representation. It also boosted my knowledge of R significantly in just several weeks.",
                "Worked with large datasets, did a lot of data cleaning and wrangling, and a lot of data analysis. I think the data cleaning in particular was something I had not really covered in other S&DS courses, which was really helpful and practical for future jobs.",
                "I learned a lot of helpful skills in this class. One of the funnest parts would be finding and cleaning raw data. You do everything in R, but its honestly not that different from Python and super translatable if youre more used to Python. Model building is also super helpful, even though you dont learn much theory behind them, honestly if you wanted to understand it, looking it up online and reading up on what you need is quite more than enough.",
                "This class does a great job showing the practical application of statistics and data science in the real world. We went through New Haven housing data and Olympics data, so that was fun.",
                "Very practical data analysis skills, not just data cleaning or running models, but actually the whole process of devising a research question and writing up conclusions.",
                "The main skill that I thought was incredibly helpful was data cleaning. In most Yale classes we learn how to do data analysis and skip the heavy cleaning part, I loved that this class went through the tools we can use to clean messy data and data in different formats (pdfs for example)."

                "The strength was definitely Professor MacDonald. The excitement and knowledge he brought to the course is what made it worthwhile. Sometimes the exercises we completed felt a bit un-necessary and wish we had done skill-building that felt a bit more useful. It also would have been nice to get the chance to work with different people in the class instead of one group the whole time.",
                "I really liked how this was a seminar with both lecture and \"work days.\" The datasets were interesting to look at, and Brian was insanely helpful and nice. The grading feedback was kind of unclear though--it would've been nice to know exactly how points were taken off.",
                "strengths- definitely useful and practical skills are learned, small class size, helpful support from instructor, freedom to work with own datasets for capstone project\r\nweaknesses- the focus on sports datasets was rather frustrating. for our class assignments, we only worked with 1 dataset that was not sports related, which was not fun for someone like myself who is not interested in sports. we worked on this particular dataset with olympics diving data for way too long, and none of the students seemed that interested in it. additionally, the pace of assignments early on in the semester was very intense, with assignments being due on one class day and then a new one being assigned with a due date for the next class. i was also not a fan of the group work, because my partner was rather dismissive of my ideas and not helpful to work with. lastly, the grading on some of the early assignments seemed rather unclear and inconsistent.",
                "Very strong. The assignments can get a little intense in terms of time, but always doable. Love the teamwork style, learned a ton working together as a group in a technical project and dividing coding work amongst multiple ppl",
                "Strength: I really like the group work aspect of this class and the practical side. I felt like this was one of the more coding based statistics class I've taken, but it wasn't overwhelming and engaging. \r\n\r\nWeakness: by the end of the month, I would have liked time to work on the final project but we did \"in class\" tasks that were more distracting than helpful.",
                "Strength: a lot of focus on students and engagement with individuals\r\nWeakness: I would love to have more feedback on the assignments, especially discussion with other groups.",
                "Strenghts: the instructor is amazing, it was great to take the class with Professor Macdonald! Moreover, working in groups was super fun and a big part of the class. I also liked that we got to keep the same group from beginning to the end of the semester, we really had time to build good team dynamics - which I believe is a really important skill to develop.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the deadlines were not proportional to the amount of work. For instance, some assignments that took a lot of work had shorter deadlines, and assignments that were fairly quick had longer deadlines. Maybe that could be improved in the following semesters."

                "Yes! I know it's not recommended by the DUS, but personally, I think it's the right capstone for the major. It's the first course I've taken that really attempted to integrate what I've learned, while also teaching new material. Because the final project is pretty self-directed, it also allows for better pacing, along with exploring your own strengths and realizing\/improving upon your personal weaknesses. Especially for students who feel underprepared for a career coming out of this major, I think this is the right go-to.",
                "yes- for a capstone project, it was helpful to first gain experience working with large datasets, and then to have the individualized support for the second half of the semester.",
