I'm not sure how else it would be taught but be prepared for more of a lecture format than a section-style format. Class is pretty quiet, also."

                "American Silver was FANTASTIC! Professor Gordon is such a fun and engaging lecturer and getting to handle 10+ objects every class was so unique and interesting. This class seriously transformed the way I look at silver and American art and was very very accessible to students from non art history backgrounds. Class discussions were engaging and assignments were well thought out and fun to do. Cannot recommend this course enough.",
                "yes! seeing the objects you are learning about in person is insanely cool",
                "Yes! Professor Gordon is awesome and the class really takes advantage of the resources of the YUAG.",
                "I would recommend this course whether you do or don't have any art history knowledge. I've taken a lot of art history courses at Yale and one of the great things about this is being able to handle objects directly each week. You adopt 1 object and get to spend a lot of time researching it, and the assignments are a great first brush with art history since you're writing museum labels, research papers, and acquisition proposals...as art history classes go, this is actually one of the more practical ones. There wasn't much feedback on written assignments but I think where you stand in the course is relatively clear, and the class overall was not too much work - well spread out over the semester. Also JSG knows everything about silver and this is a wonderful opportunity to learn from a curator!"
