    "Strengths: pace was not too fast but not too slow; the class was structured well in terms of lesson planning and content; we were always engaged (I found having this structure as really helpful because I knew what to expect + how to prepare for new lessons and grammar rules)\r\nweaknesses: I think we could do a wider variety of activities in class that tested our grammar and oral skills; the same structure I mentioned can still be preserved, but just mixed up with a more vast array of activities (e.g. Kahoots, more writing activities, more oral activities; it would be really fun if groups of people could create dialogues in Spanish and then perform them with each other as speaking practice)",
    "Even if it's frustrating, the course being daily was essential to my learning and coming back from breaks always made me appreciate how essential daily practice was. More reading exercises, like short stories, would be helpful. Organization of the course towards the end was a little confusing with a lot of jumping around."

    "I would definitely recommend! It is a fun and engaging class. Just be prepared to put in the work required to develop mastery and knowledge of a language. If you are committed to improving and putting in the work by any means necessary (e.g. extra assignments, more office hours), you should do well in the class.",
    "Yes, Maripaz is a great instructor who was great at teaching the concepts and giving clear examples."
