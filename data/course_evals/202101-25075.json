The assigned readings and class discussion taught me immensely about the clear and not-so-clear functions of mental health in colonial contexts which in turn helped me think critically about the ways mental health works today. In doing so, I was able to learn how decolonial theory can apply to contemporary conversations around mental health.",

                "It was tough being over Zoom/the curriculum was definitely in flux but Prof. Quarshie is one of the most excellent professors I've ever had",
                "Strengths: the discussion prompted by Prof Quarshie was very enriching and really helped make me think beyond what was written on the pages of texts read in class to see what implicit arguments could be made and learned. the selected articles and theoretical texts were very effective at setting up discussion for class with appropriate tools and language to discuss decolonization in mental health.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: occasionally, discussion would get derailed as some prompts were a bit unclear/complicated to answer which in large part was due to some of the book selections. this could be averted perhaps by selecting the most pertinent chapters to assign in conjunction with related articles to help students start thinking through themes of texts before class.",
                "I really loved this course. Almost every aspect of the class was a strength, especially the discussions and writing feedback. The one improvement I can think of is including more texts with authors who write from a place of belonging in the communities they are writing about.",
                "The greatest strength of the course was the novel and one-of-a-kind course material, and the way the teacher and students were all invested in and excited in the material. The class environment was wonderful.",
                "strengths: fascinating material and discussion, engaging and thought-provoking professor and classmates\r\nweaknesses: there was a lot of reading each week, which is worth keeping in mind when deciding to take the class; sometimes I felt that I could have used a deeper introduction or foundation at the start of class to best discuss the material for the week."

                "Absolutely. Should be required for all HSHM and pre-med students to better understand structural formations of the mind, health, and justice",
                "yes ! Professor Quarshie is an excellent instructor with much of his own thoughts and work to supplement discussion with. He centers student discussion and learning in his work, stepping in when needed to pick apart some dense texts and stepping back when students are deep in discussions. He strings together observations from each student well and suggests prompts that help lead students to important points and arguments made by the readings. The content itself was also very interesting to read and think through; the main texts were all published within the last 6 years or so, so the readings reflect the current state of academic thought around mental health in colonial contexts and beyond quite well. The assignments can be a bit daunting as the prompts are broad, but Professor Quarshie is more than willing to meet and speak through paper ideas to help guide and begin the writing process.",
                "I would (and already have many times) recommend this course. Nana is a really amazing professor, the class is engaging and challenging, and the subject material and discussion challenge one to interrogate their own thinking and expand their ways of understanding.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "definitely! this course is challenging and forces you to rethink how you think about psychiatry and the decolonization thereof; the material is dense and at times disturbing, but if you are at all interested in the decolonization of medicine this is a must-take course!"
