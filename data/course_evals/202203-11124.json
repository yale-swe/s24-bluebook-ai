                "This course desperately needs to be restructured.\r\n1) The expectations for how developed our ideas should have been was very unclear. We were at once being told that it was ok to be unsure, and at the same time being expected to have fully drafted abstracts and making presentations. To be clear, in the fall of senior year, it seems like one should be expected to have a relatively fleshed out idea of what their thesis will be. I wish we were told in the spring of junior year what the expectations were so we could begin to prepare over the summer. I know that many majors do this.\r\n2) I do not understand what the point of the assigned readings were if we barely ever talked about them. It's too bad, because the readings mostly looked wonderful and I think they would have helped everyone develop their ideas in a more critically informed way. We were expected to do responses, but then never even talked about them in class? When we did briefly talk about them, we had only been expected to read 1/4 of the assigned readings. In a class of 10 people, this means that only 2-3 would have ever done the same reading. The readings largely felt like an intellectual facade.\r\n3) I wish there was some kind of \"Critical Readings in Architecture and Urban Theory\" class which was required in the spring of junior year. I know the Art History major does this. Instead of an urban lab, this could serve as a counterpart to the design studio for the design track. That way, everyone will be able to speak the same language in colloquium and these ideas will be able to percolate in our brains over the summer to inform our thinking. At the moment, I think colloquium has no critical engagement of any kind, which is troubling. \r\n--> To be clear, this is no fault of Marta or the TFs, all of whom were wonderful. My troubles with the class are all a result of deeper problems with the syllabus and the structure of the architecture and urban studies majors at large. I really hope that things change going forward, because, as it stands, this class really did not offer much. In fact, I even encouraged friends in the major to switch so they did not have to do it.",
                "Strengths - Prof and TA are very supportive and provide a lot of insight, resources, and encouragement throughout the process of building your senior project.",
                "Strengths: 1) The TFs are awesome. 2) It is nice to meet consistently with a group of people. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) the class size is far too big to allow any real sort of benefit to come from everyone going around and sharing what they have been thinking about/working on. In the future, I think it makes sense to have separate colloquium classes for the architecture majors and the urban studies majors. This semester, it was awkward because of the disciplines' different methodology/way of seeing/thinking and also because any sort of community that could have carried momentum from the architecture students' or urban studies students' previous classes within their major was thwarted by the awkwardness of being thrust into the same classroom. 2) there isn't enough feedback to make the assignments worthwhile exercises. 3) there does not seem to be room for a student to come into colloquium with an idea of how they want to pursue their research. Instead, one approach to research is offered, instructed, and assigned. I think it would be more helpful to have a substantial 1-on-1 relationship with one member of the teaching team. This way, students could outline the way they want to approach the semester and then feel more agency over the work. 4) I was looking forward to this class to being the peak of my college experience: a group of students that are interested in similar topics committed to meeting every week to discuss their new ideas/progress. I was pretty disappointed when this class wasn't the lively, engaged environment I had hoped for. I think meeting on a Friday morning is a bad time for this class. Earlier in the week would have been better and would have made the class feel like less of an end of the week \"add on\"."
