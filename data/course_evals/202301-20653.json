                "The course is very well organized, and has lots of support for students.  Guiseppe is a great professor, who gives plenty of time in class for students to solve problems on their own or to answer questions, which is a great way to facilitate engagement.  He also deeply cares about his students.  Once, I came up to him after class with a question, and when he did not know how to answer it he sat down with me for 20 minutes until we both figured it out (and this was after class, when he had no obligation to be there!).  Great professor and great course.",
                "Good intro into proofs!",
                "Strengths include academic rigor and beneficial problems sets. Weaknesses include harsh grading on specific aspects of exams.",
                "Proofs are not something that everyone enjoys, but theyre definitely essential for higher level math!",
                "Strengths: the material of the course builds on itself well, especially how previous definitions and theorems can be used to prove later ones. Even though the course is proof-based, there are parts of the lecture that showcase applications, such as links to geometry or calculus.\r\nWeaknesses: the way this course is organized is counterproductive to student learning. Office hours are all early in the afternoon, when students most likely have other classes and commitments and thus cannot make it; when we do show up, we are supposed to work among peers most of the time and our questions/confusions aren't addressed in a reasonably timely manner. The lecture does cover all the basics, but some concepts on the psets are newly introduced but we are expected to understand and be able to apply them right away. The grading is sometimes needlessly pedantic, especially considering that this course is supposed to be an introduction to proofs. There is a marked lack of review material provided for any of the exams -  there is only one short set of practice problems which are stated as not being representative of the ones on the exam (as opposed to a typical STEM class where you would get 2-3 tests from past years).",
                "More development of proof-writing skills at the start of the course. More low-stakes opportunities to write our own proofs would have made the transition from calculation-based math courses much easier.",
                "The instructor (Giuseppe) and organixation was excellent. The content was also great and convinced me to take math. Instruction was the highlight.",
                "There are no clear weaknesses and this course is extremely well taught.",
                "It was good to learn about all of the concepts through lecture and the associated homeworks.",
                "The material we cover is this course is interesting. However, I think it is taught in a way that does not allow students to fully engage with the material. Office hours and problem sessions were at inconvenient times so even if I had wanted to understand the material better, I did not fully have the opportunity to do so. I think if the class went over more examples, gave more step by step instructions, and reordered the lessons, the class could be truly interesting and fulfilling.",
                "I think it could have been made clearer which sections of the textbook corresponded to the respective lectures.",
                "Instruction was generally very good, however content was a little rushed towards the end.",
                "This course was strong in connecting aspects of math to parts of life and show the merits of math as a field.",
                "The course was the perfect amount of difficulty for me to know that higher level math classes were not for me.",
                "Strengths: The class does not go too fast, so it's very digestable overall.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The biggest weakness of this class are the third-party grader. Contrary to almost any other mathematics class (especially proof-based ones) you're likely to take, the graders on homeworks and exams in this course care more about semantic ways to dock points off an answer rather than looking for conceptual understanding or creative ways to engage with material. This is especially egregious because the class places a super special emphasis on the process of mathematics and not placing yourself in a box when doing math. That makes a lot of sense given that this is a linear algebra course, and an introduction to proof-based math. It could be an eye-opening experience for many people to see what math is truly about, and with such a beautiful and perspective-heavy subject like linear algebra, the course could have fostered that environment of mathematical exploration. Instead, students are again put into that box come homework or exam time. You'd better have read the textbook word for word, because that it what they want to grade you on when it comes to recounting definitions or giving the \"as seen on textbook\" proof.",
                "I thought the lectures were confusing as a lot was thrown at us without much context, thought there was a decent amount of resources available outside of class.",
                "I think the distribution of points on the exams is not good, the exams had 3 true false each worth 6 points each so if you missed one or two your entire grade would suffer. I also think the psets should be graded a little less harshly considering this is an intro proof based class.\r\n\r\nThe strengths are definitely the instructors, they explain everything very clearly and are always very willing to help and encourage us to email them and come to office hours. The psets were also very instructional and solidified the content very well, and they weren't unnecessarily long.",
                "strengths -- great professor and interesting subject topic, good introduction to proof-writing (coming from someone who had never written a proof before), and lots of revelatory moments over the semester about the nature of mathematics and connections between subjects; main weakness was lack of accessibility, most students I knew didn't bother going to office hours (like Monday 10am-noon??) and problem sessions seemed somewhat unhelpful",
                "I think the strength of this course lies in its ability to show students the bigger picture of why math is such an integral part of the world as we know it. At first, vector spaces seemed to be pretty narrow in applicability, but once we got to the matrix representation of a linear transformation, it became readily apparent just how wrong my initial assessment was. With applications in solving differential equations, analyzing functions, doing calculations for quantum mechanics and more, linear algebra exemplifies what math should be - a unifying force between the seemingly disparate concepts that govern the universe.\r\n\r\nHowever, I feel like some of the richness in the later units (particularly with regard to eigenvectors onward) was cut short due to timing restrictions; we only had a few weeks to appreciate the power of the diagonalization techniques we learned. I would have preferred moving on from vector space and subspace proofs a little earlier in favor of exploring things like the spectral theorem and dual spaces in greater detail.",
                "Weakness: even though this isn't the applications class, I wish there were still some applications because learning anything abstractly is difficult, especially for the first time, as was true for most students taking this class",
                "The strengths of the course are that it is a good introduction to writing mathematical proofs, it improves one's problem-solving skills, and it provides a solid conceptual basis for understanding and applying linear algebra. The weaknesses are that the content of the course is not particularly well structured, the instruction of the course could be improved, and some of the concepts could be made more clear and their application to the real world could be made more explicit.",
                "I think the class is very well taught, only weakness I could come up for the class is that the cutoff for an A is very high",
                "The weaknesses of this course are really in the way the material was presented. There was not a clear connection made in lecture between consecutive ideas, and for someone who has never taken linear before, this made the class extremely difficult for someone who usually learns best in lecture."

At first I had some reservations about taking 225 because I am a CS major and this is a math class, but it turns out a lot of CS electives require linear algebra as a prerequisite.  This couse was also my first introduction to proofs, and it did a great job!  (much better that CPSC 202)",

Even though I appreciated the intellectual satisfaction I got from proving key concepts and understanding the deeper reason for why certain applications work, I don't think the work and frustration that the rest of the course gives you is worth it if you just want linear algebra's practical applications (222 is probably preferable here) or you are curious about math in general (a different advanced course may do here).",
                "Absolutely if you have any interest in proof based math.",

This course is definitely not the easiest and you have to put in a lot of time and effort outside of class time going over the material if you want to fully understand the concepts.",

                "Yes, it is great for people considering a math major.",
                "It's a necessary course to take, and the material is not bad. I just think it's a shame that such a great subject and a great opportunity is wasted (and it's doubly stinging because they seem to emphasize the importance of the opposite so much).",
                "Id say its important content but the teaching detracted a bit from it",
                "Yes I would, it'll improve your ability to learn and understand math at a higher level, and it will teach you important skills if you want to take upper math courses.",
                "Yes! Linear algebra is so conceptually fascinating and has so many direct applications to the physical sciences (QM, stats, solving systems, etc). Beyond learning the concepts, I think I am a better logician/reasoner now and appreciate and enjoy *math* (rather than just pure computation) so much more now. Class definitely is not easy, but struggling through ideas, proofs, and psets together makes for great bonding experiences and new friends!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who plans on continuing their math education at Yale, as it does a really lovely job at showcasing what the subject can do with regard to bringing separate fields together; that includes anyone whose major relies on math, from physics to economics to computer science.",
                "Honestly, I haven't taken applications so I don't have a basis of comparison but I've heard people like that one more. This one still teaches you the concepts, I guess you would just have to learn the applications yourself if you're going into something like QM",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if they need it as a prerequisite for the math or physics major or if they have a significant interest in proof-based linear algebra. I did not strictly need this course as a prerequisite for my major and I generally prefer application to theory, so I had a difficult time adjusting to this class and its abstract and proof-based nature. I would definitely advise any student interested in taking the class to think hard about their choice and/or consider taking MATH 222 if they are more interested in application or are interested in an applied science.",
