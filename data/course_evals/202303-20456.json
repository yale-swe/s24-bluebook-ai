                "An introduction to probability theory suitable to someone new to probability but with a math background (but explicit measure theoretic formulation  is avoided). Then, proofs of concentration inequalities, an introduction to subgaussianity, then moving into higher dimensions. We discuss a lot about uniform distribution concentration which can be worked out via concentration inequalities or more sharply often by volumetric formulations of uniform distributions (i.e. standard integration). In higher dimensions we discuss more about subgaussinity and covariance and epsilon nets. This prepares us for introductory random matrix theory. Finally we covered in detail concentration of measure without independence, and its implications for random projections and we prove a matrix form of Bernstein's inequality. The last bit of the course discusses in a little less depth random Gaussian processes and Gaussian interpolation, along with Dudley's inequality. \r\n\r\nOverall the course teaches you the essential tools (i.e. concentration techniques) behind pretty much any modern paper in high-dimensional statistical theory. There's no course at Yale that teaches these tools and, and you will be at a major loss if you don't take 421 but need to follow modern research in statistics.",

                "It was very well-taught and gave us essential tools to move forward in statistics that aren't otherwise available at Yale. It should be taught annually. The only potential weakness is it could be somewhat more difficult on PSETs... I didn't mind at all personally but it definitely could've been a more difficult class in certain regards.",
                "Strengths: I love the seminar feel to this class - very rare treat for a STEM major. The content is also interesting and presented in a very accessible way.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The first month of the course contained no TF or grader, which made it rather disorganized the whole semester even once that was sorted out, and (perhaps as a consequence) office hours were badly timed and not very helpful as a result.",
                "No notes. Overall, great class.",
                "It's a very solid syllabus to me. I think some would be inclined to push it away from math and towards more statistics stuff, but I would argue against doing that.",
                "Strengths: Prof O'Neill was great at lecturing, and the course more or less followed an easy-to-understand textbook for reference. The workload was very manageable (especially for a math class), and having a final project instead of exam was also nice. Weaknesses: I wish we went a little faster to cover some more material, but the course otherwise was great."

                "Yeah, I would. Honestly it's so teacher-dependent, and Kevin is in the last year of his Gibbs assistant professorship, so I can't speak for future years, but he was a great professor and class was fun to go to. I really liked the seminar feel to this course, which is rare among math courses and STEM courses in general. The class was a bit disorganized, since there was no grader\/TF until a month in, so I hope that gets fixed for future years. Exams were tough but I think that's just Kevin's style cause he wrote them - not sure if that'll carry over to future years. One final note: don't let the title fool you, this is really a theoretical course in high-dimensional probability. Data science applications are mentioned from time to time but never relevant in the psets or exams.",
                "I would. It requires a pretty strong math background, but assuming someone has that, it's a great class. The material is interesting, and has some very practical applications in data science. The tests were difficult but not overly difficult, and the final projects were interesting both to do\/ watch. I looked forward to lecture most of the time.",
                "I would, but I would caution them that this is very much a math\/real analysis course. Don't expect it to be like statistics classes, if you're a stats major.",
                "If you're interested in the weird phenomenon relating to random vectors and matrices in high dimension, this is course for you! It's great in terms of workload and difficulty for a math course!"
