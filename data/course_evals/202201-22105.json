We developed our analysis, synthesis and argumentation skills while questioning some of the narratives\/discourse surrounding college, prison and college in prison.",
                "Understanding of CIP system in the US.",
                "I learned a lot about how college in prison functions and about theory about education, incarceration, and liberation.",
                "I learned a lot about the history, practice and evaluation of college in prison programs. I thought critically about the institution of the university and how it related to the prison. I was introduced to a new vocabulary of terms pertaining to CIP and read many different arguments and sides to get a nuanced look at the discourse surrounding recidivism, rehabilitation, and prison education. Because of Shawn and Clyde I was also able to get invaluable insight from CIP alum.  Zelda provided insight into starting a CIP program as well. The course felt like it was both really grounded in readings and theory and had lots of practical on the ground insights.",
                "I gained an understanding of the basis for and effects of College in Prison programs, as well as a broader knowledge of the contexts and systems from which the need for such programs arises. The class was very well-structured, taking a nuanced approach to the histories of prisons and our general educational systems.",
                "This class covered an in-depth overview of College in Prison programmes in the United States. However, my most salient take away has been the insights gained from our rich conversations on education, racism, privilege, and society as a whole. This course was an excellent jumping off point of which to start thinking deeply about my educational experience, as well as education overall."

                "Zelda, Clyde, and Shawn's collective wisdom, patience, questions, and care.",
                "The fact that this course was taught by Zelda, Shawn and Clyde made it very meaningful for me! I appreciated how much the voices and experiences of program alumni, students and personnel was centered (from the readings and instructors to the guest speakers we had).",
                "Strengths: interesting readings. Wonderful professor set up. \r\n\r\nWeakness: felt like we didnt have a clear trajectory during class or more broadly through semester.",
                "It was incredible to have the course be co-taught by professors who themselves had enrolled in CIP programs.",
                "Having Sean and Clyde was SO vital for this class to be as wonderful as it was.",
                "The class had a great balance of theory and connecting us to real experiences of higher education in prison. The fact that Clyde and Shawn were teaching with Zelda was a really special and valuable part of the class. I really appreciated how much this class connected to real experiences and actual college in prison programming, as well as pushing us students to theorize about college in prison.",
                "The strengths include the EXTREMELY well crafted and organized syllabus and the three professors with life experiences that deeply contributed to our discussions and understandings of material. Another strength was the assignments. They connected with our readings and themes in a way that felt productive. The discussion posts were also a super helpful way to engage with each other and the text and track your own thinking. One weakness could be that sometimes there was a lot of reading, though even then I appreciated A LOT the guidance of how to approach our readings as in what to skim and what to read closely. One weakness could be that when reading some more difficult Foucalt readings I wished we spent more time trying to understand it together.",
                "Strengths: I thought the units were organized well, and as a result the course was comprehensive without sacrificing detail. The guest speakers were enlightening and added depth to my understanding of the readings. Also, having Clyde and Shawn as teachers was essential to the class; their insight into the programs and material really enriched our discussions.\r\nWeaknesses: Some weeks had far more material than others, meaning that the more complicated texts sometimes fell to the wayside. For the most part, though, the syllabus was reasonably balanced.",
                "great readings great conversations",
                "The class was well organised, with a natural progression from each week's topic to the next. The guest speakers were also fantastic and prompted rich discussion on the topic at hand. One thing that I wish could be improved on is that each conversation felt unfinished with no clear conclusion, however this could be due to the highly complex nature of the issues we were tackling, where there really isn't a clear answer for anything."

                "Yes! This is an excellent course, and by far my favourite one of my Yale education thus far. As someone who is deeply passionate about education, taking this course has fundamentally altered the way I approach thinking about education. It may seem like an incredibly niche and inaccessible topic, but the content of the course digs deep into fundamental questions about the pursuit of education that is relevant to anyone who is a student."
