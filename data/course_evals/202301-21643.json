I realized how little practical knowledge the ee major at Yale teaches, and how unprepared we are to start a job in industry out of undergrad. The ee major at Yale is a disgrace to the ABET accreditation name.",
                "This course is advertised as the capstone project for the ABET EE major, designed to synthesize the ideas learned throughout your four years into a cohesive yet challenging task involving robotics and self-navigation. The goal at the end of the class is for the robot to be able to traverse an obstacle course using autonomous sensing and self navigation -- what you will actually accomplish is moving the \"robot\" from point A to B, perhaps with an obstacle in between. Primarily what I learned was how to manage people and work on a large scale project with individuals operating at various levels of commitment, decipher unclear instructions and unfeasible objectives, and appease a professor\/advisor who has given up on providing students with meaningful feedback and actually helping them to acquire new technical skills. This capstone course was also the third time I had an opportunity to use a soldering iron in a class setting throughout my ABET EE journey. I also acquired skills in self-directed development and iterative engineering design at the expense of my mental health. Finally, I became intimately familiar with the entire process of PCB design and fabrication, from building custom component blueprints to placing the final print order at a fab (although this was entirely voluntary, done in order to have develop some sort of meaningful industry experience in this course, and students usually have no idea that this is even an option)."

                "Open ended research and development coursework. We get a lot of support to buy and test stuff in the lab. \r\nDue to ABET rules it is a group project, so that poses its own challenges in organizing and planning out the tasks over the semester.",
                "This class desperately needs more structure. There is almost no direction for the project and what little direction there is changes each week. I think the only way to improve it would be a complete overhaul of the class and the major as a whole. Also, Prof Kuc cannot continue being the advisor for this class. He likes to talk but he never succeeds in saying much. I understand completely restructuring a class is difficult, so in terms of immediate changes with the biggest impact, replacing kuc should be the #1 priority.",
                "The biggest weakness of this course is the fact that students are never provided the resources or opportunity to propose projects of interest. The self-navigation robot project is quite frankly archaic and misleading regarding the various technical skills it promises to teach. The subgoals of the robot project played to none of the strengths of the members and that is a symptom of the unrealistic expectations attached to the project. The ABET EE curriculum does not include essential courses like analog and digital circuits\/design, PCB design, systems integration, practical signal analysis, etc. And yet, we are expected to design a fully autonomous system consisting of sensors and control modules that seamlessly interfaces with an existing mobile unit and guides it through an obstacle course. This course can be improved by hiring dedicated TAs that have the ability to provide substantive help and guidance throughout the course of the capstone project because the current professor fails to fill the role of a competent advisor and often poses a roadblock to student progress. Having dedicated TAs would also help with course organization and logistics as it was often difficult to determine what deliverables were expected of the students and what the time frames were."

If you are still able to switch majors do mech e or literally anything else where you might actually learn some useful skills. If its too late and you have to take this course, all I have to say is good luck. You are going to need it.",
                "Before reading this evaluation, please refer to the SPRING 2017 course reviews for EENG 481 and note that many of the issues mentioned there still apply 6 years later. The lack of real change over 6 graduating classes is an embarrassing disservice to the students who work so hard to pursue an already challenging field and an affront to the Yale name. As this is a capstone course, it makes sense to comment not only on the senior project but the ABET EE major as a whole--both of which may be summed up by the words disappointing and inadequate. The degree of neglect toward the major on behalf of the electrical engineering department, contextualized by the price of tuition and the supposed prestige of the institution, has been disappointing. The degree of preparedness I feel in terms of the practical and employable skills gained from my coursework ahead of industry positions is inadequate. Before I can honestly recommend the EE track to a prospective student, there needs to be an institutional-level reevaluation of the curriculum and learning resources. While the curriculum is extensive (one of the largest required course loads in Yale College), students still leave feeling entirely unprepared, indicating that not only are the core classes ineffective in conveying the material but in fact, they are over bloated with material that seems unimportant and reduces the task of learning to an exercise of jumping through hoops to get the grade. There is desperate need for more practical lab material and exposure to industry standard software\/analysis techniques. As other course reviews have mentioned, the EE faculty needs to seriously take inspiration from the pedagogy of top engineering schools and better optimize the EE coursework at Yale. Student cannot and should not have to learn entire courses worth of material (on topics like analog and digital circuit design, PCB design, real-world signal processing, etc) DURING the one semester long senior project in order to accomplish anything meaningful. How exactly can we be expected to take anything of value away from the capstone project when we are forced to spend the first two months deciphering the expectations of the project and catching up on learning the material we think we will need for proper implementation. The faculty must accept the realization that \"sleepless nights\" being essentially mandatory year over year in order to cross the finish line and even turn in a barely working product towards the end of EE481 is indicative of a wholly dysfunctional classroom and teaching environment. It is not difficult to notice these facts if anyone from the faculty was to visit any one of the project meetings throughout EE481. Yet, the fact that the same grievances from spring 2017 ring true today plainly demonstrates the department's utter apathy toward undergraduate learning. Somehow, the decorated professors of Yale cannot figure out how to properly convey their decades of electrical engineering experience and it is truly a shame. As it stands, the ABET EE program at Yale excels at churning out middle managers who know how to take the Fourier transform, not capable engineers that will lead the innovations of tomorrow."
