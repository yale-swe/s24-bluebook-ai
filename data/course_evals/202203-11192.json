I also learned the flaws in data and not to trust all the data presented in the media or news, unless you're able to understand how the data was retrieved and how it was distributed. This class was a great introduction to many key and foundational principles of statistics.",
                "More advances statistical understanding.",
                "This was a solid introduction to statistics and its practical applications.",
                "Having never taking a statistics class before, I gained knowledge and a wide range of statistical tools to apply in many scenarios (including regression, ANOVA, box plots, probability, etc.). I appreciated how interdisciplinary the course was and how applicable Minitab was.",

                "Having both in person and recorded lectures made the course very accessible and easy to participate in. PSets were easily structured that evaluated students understanding of concepts in class and less of strict busy work. JDRS is also a pleasure too watch teach and makes classes very enjoyable.",
                "Asynchrony format -- at your own pace. never had to go to class in-person. more zoom office hours would be helpful",
                "Help is very accessible and you can do the modules whenever it is convenient for you. The only weakness was that for the first half of semester I felt like I didn't understand the bigger picture of what we were learning.",
                "The fact that you have a choice of whether to attend in-person lecture or watch pre-recorded videos is INCREDIBLE, and as someone who very much struggles with statistics as a concept, this was so, so helpful.",
                "Strengths: the fact you can go to in person lecture, watch the lecture, or watch ore-recorded lectures. Making the class accessible for everyone. The Professor is a very engaging man, \r\nWeakness: the class moves extremely fast.",
                "Strengths: well-organized and structured for successful student learning, assignments are manageable, easy to engage in the way most effective for personal learning\r\nImprovements: JDRS could slow down a bit in his lecturing - sometimes he flies past things and it's hard to understand him",
                "This course being live in-person, asynchronous, and live virtually, was incredibly helpful and made class accessible to students at all times. For me personally, I appreciated being able to hike up science hill to attend class in-person for the first couple of weeks, but as my schedule become more stringent and the weather got colder, I liked being able to attend class virtually. This plus the floods of office hours throughout the semester made learning incredibly accessible and it left it up to me as a student to decide how engaged I wanted to be. I think sometimes class would go very fast and we didn't have much time to sit with some of the terms and concepts learned in class, this I think could've made learning a little more difficult.",
                "A big strength of this course is its flexibility. The course can be taken at any time because there are pre-recorded modules. All of the exams are take-home and open-note. This is a wonderful and amazingly flexible course. Another great thing is that there are office hours for this class literally every day bc there are a million TAs. \r\n\r\nI have no notes. This class has no weaknesses.",
                "Prof. JDRS has structured the course to offer it completely asynchronously if that's what you prefer.  All of the lectures are pre-recorded and also offered in person which made it really easy to learn and review the course material.  The notes that JDRS provides are extremely comprehensive and helpful.  I felt that the course had a lot of support available, but office hours with ULAs were pretty unreliable, especially toward the end of the semester.  There were several times when I tried to attend Zoom office hours, with other students also in the Zoom room, but the ULA was not there.",
                "A strength was that the pre-recorded lectures allowed students to move along at their own pace. It would have been nice if the p-sets weren't as long but were instead more frequent.",
                "The TFs need to consistently show up to their hours and a lot of them did Not know what they were doing and could not help.",
                "A strength is the ability to take this class synchronously or asynchronously, depending on personal preference",
                "Strengths: LOVED the different ways to take the course and the amount of office hours opportunities \r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "strengths: excellent course. workload super manageable and TAs very helpful.",
                "The notes were organized and the asynchronous structure of the class was favorable, but TAs were consistently unavailable and made many grading mistakes throughout the year.",
                "Its asynchronous nature makes it really easy to not be engaged. More incentive to come to in-person lecture would be useful",

After taking this course students will have a solid grasp of statistics and terms that matter when it comes to measuring data across the world.",
                "I absolutely would recommend and HAVE recommended this course to many other students. It's a wonderfully flexible course that made learning statistics easy.",
                "Yes - especially with JDRS.  There is a lot of material, but all of the supports are available to help you learn it.  Learning intro stats has been really helpful in understanding methods in scientific\/academic papers that I read in my other classes.",
                "Yes. Don't be afraid to tackle this course in R instead of Minitab, it is very doable.",

                "yes!",

                "It is a good basic introduction if you are not going to take any other stats classes!",
