    "A deep understanding of music theory and the trends in music between the 17th and 19th centuries that I had played before but not studied."

   "comments": [
    "I thought the course was excellent in that it had good content and also went at a moderate pace which would not stress its students out and instead enabled the students to enjoy the course but learn at the same time.",
    "I wish there were a few more grades, so I could monitor my progress.",
    "Lord knows the last thing we need is more music by old white male composers. This class was basically just about studying classical music, deconstructing it, and learning what makes it tick. Its fascinating at first, but perhaps as a personal frustration, being a composer definitely made the material we engaged with and were expected to produce less enjoyable.",
    "This course is a pleasure to be in. It's extraordinarily well-organized and takes such a natural progression through the material that you can feel yourself learning during and between every lecture."

   "comments": [
    "Yes - you learn a lot about music without getting too stressed out about it. Take the composition projects seriously -- there's only two of them anyway -- and you will find it super rewarding. BONUS if you get to take it with Prof. Adam!",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student. It pushed me to think outside the box and made me do things that originally thought were impossible.",
    "Great class especially if you can get Nate",
    "If you want to learn about the way music works, go for it."
