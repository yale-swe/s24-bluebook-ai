It's a really solid foundational course in literature",

                "maybe move through books a little more slowly, i found we were rushing through content rather than really engaging with it",
                "The strength of this class was the in-depth knowledge and high engagement from Professor Warner, who truly made this class interesting for me. Its weakness was reading difficult and dense texts at a very fast pace.",
                "STRENGTHS: good mix of books in the curriculum, liked the discussions in class, workload is reasonable. WEAKNESSES: none. I do wish that there was a way for introverts to actively participate more in the class discussions, but the professor does have a weekly reading response in place and he encourages everyone to talk, so there isn't really a weakness.",

Don't get to spend much time on any one work but that's a fault of it being a survey course rather than the teaching of the course or anything like that",

Professor Warner was amazing -- I really looked forward to class discussions, and I felt I learned a lot about important American writers and improved my writing and literary analysis skills. I really enjoyed the reading selection, and I thought Professor Warner did a great job leading discussions and providing context for the books we read.",

                "Yes, I would 100% recommend this course to another student. The literature is rich and diverse. The discussions will open your mind to new perspectives. Most importantly, Professor Warner is absolutely amazing and, in my opinion, a must have professor at Yale!",
                "Yes, would highly recommend, even if you aren't an English major. Loved the readings and made me a much better writer. Also if you get the chance, take it with Michael Warner. So intelligent and offers really personalized and helpful feedback.",
