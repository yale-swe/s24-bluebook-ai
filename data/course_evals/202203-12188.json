                "The workshopping was great and very helpful, but it took a lot of class time and each person needed to remind the others what is the research question. Sometimes, it became a conversation between the instructor and the presenting student. The course might have been even smoother if in the second half of the course the workshopping is individual consultation between students and the instructor. In the first half, I would have liked to learn something more practical, such as choosing among different platforms\/software for experimentation, the statistical tests to choose, etc. That said, I liked the course and it helped me (and us) to make a lot of progress.",
