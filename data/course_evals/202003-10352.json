                "This class was great! It helped push the boundaries of what incarceration is (prison v. forced hospitalization v. detention centers, etc). We worked on a vocabulary to discuss reform, abolition, Hippocratic oath in prison contexts. I also really like how we carried the course up into the modern.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of health and incarceration in the US. I also really appreciate that Professor Rich encouraged us to think like historians and taught us various skills throughout the entire semester. As someone who had never taken a history class before, things like analyzing primary sources and doing historical research were completely new to me but this class was taught and organized in a way that it didn't feel overwhelming.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of carceral systems, a topic with which I wasn't very familiar before taking this class. I also learned a lot about the social and political structures that shape incarceration and healthcare within the carceral systems. We touched on different aspects of health and how they have been approached within and outside of carceral spaces.",
                "In this seminar, we delved into the birth and domination of incarceration in the United States, and how it is deeply intertwined with public health. The course content felt especially pertinent, due to COVID-19's horrendous impact on the penal system currently, as well as the Black Lives Matter movement.",
                "Learned about the history and state of incarceration. This course was for all, both those who were familiar with incarceration but also those who weren't. This class helped me be a better historian and how I interacted with secondary and primary sources.",
                "I learned a lot about the incarceration system through the perspective of many different types of people who are affected by it. Though this course focuses on health, it is very much a useful and comprehensive introduction to the history of incarceration in the United States and how we got to where we are today.",
                "I had the opportunity to not only learn about health in the realm of carceral spaces but also to learn about real historical thinking. Dr. Rich did an excellent job of guiding us students through navigating and interpreting historical scholarship and through deep analytical discussion.",
                "reading dense texts and forming questions\r\n\r\ninteracting virtually, navigating important discussions respectfully\r\n\r\nwriting about a primary source - learning dif between a primary and secondary source (SO HELPFUL!!!)",
                "I became more familiar with primary source analysis and learned details about the historical development of systems of social control and incarceration. In particular, this course analyzed this history with careful attention to race, gender, and autonomy."

                "Major strengths included the source material (primary and secondary) and just the class environment-- really supportive. I also like the way assignments were spaced throughout the semester. There were always clear expectations and guidelines and plenty of help offered by students and professor. No weaknesses except that we didn't always have time to hit all the readings in class!",
                "The strength of this course is Prof. Rich and her style of teaching. She is such a great facilitator and can lead courses on any subject material with ease. The classes that she teaches in and of themselves have very interesting material that students can learn much about and from.",
                "I loved the diversity of the primary and secondary sources we took on, and how well Professor Rich guided us through our final project research. Our discussions were also some of the most thought-provoking I've ever had in a seminar format.",
                "Strengths were that it covered an intensive amount of material, but done appropriately and sensitively. My peers acted in the same way.",
                "The strengths of the course are the engaging nature of the readings, the high quality class discussion, the very manageable workloads, and the incredible attentiveness of Prof. Rich. I think the only thing that I did not love was how much of it was student-led. I would have liked for Professor Rich to lead class discussion more than she did.",
                "course had no weaknesses",
                "This class was well crafted. We discussed relevant topics through a historical lens from a diverse variety of sources, both primary and secondary. We were able to bounce ideas off of each other and discuss important topics meaningfully. We applied our knowledge to different frameworks in the medical and historical fields.",
                "This course is spectacular. Miriam Rich is brilliant, supportive, and kind. The syllabus is incredible, and contains works from a variety of different fields, allowing students to gain exposure to different methods of analysis and writing. Professor Rich provides detailed feedback that helped me improve my writing and directed my to additional sources I wouldn't have found on my own. In addition, class was engaging, and felt inviting and safe, even though we often discussed extremely difficult themes. The assignments were also helpful-- they allowed us to start thinking critically about our final project early, which allowed me to explore sources outside of the course and connect outside themes to the reading I did each week for the course. \r\nMy only suggestion: my favorite classes were the ones in which Professor Rich provided some of her own analyses\/summaries\/questions as well as the discussion leaders. I understand the benefit of having discussion leaders (and enjoyed being one myself), but I would have liked to hear slightly more of Professor Rich's thoughts. Perhaps in the future Professor Rich could lead part of the discussion (or summarize some main points at the end) as well. Other than that, this was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale."

Our classes were centered around discussions, and it wasn't particularly hard to facilitate those in virtual spaces.

Maybe make it clear that the discussion leaders and do whatever they want, don't need to follow the same format\r\n\r\n\r\nthank you for giving us 10 min breaks, they really changed everything and I was able to be more focused and productive in class.",
                "The seminar worked quite well- people were able to speak fluidly and discuss and build on the points of other students. I felt the pre-class reading responses also worked quite well, as did the discussion leaders and research assignment. I think the start-of-class checkins were nice and built class community, but they might have been shortened slightly (they often took around 30 minutes, which restricted the amount of time we had to discuss the actual material)"

Really important for thinking about how society ranks people as \"deserving\" of care.",

                "Yes! A wonderful exploration of incarceration that is super relevant to the present day, no matter what field you are entering. You start the class from the beginning with the formation of prisons systems and end right up to present day thinking of abolition. You read works that you might possibly never encounter without this class!",
