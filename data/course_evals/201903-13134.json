   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Well, I learnt about the basics of material science... duh. What youd expect. The labs were really fun.",
    "I learned about some scientific principles behind art conservation and the physics and chemistry of light and paint.",
    "I gained knowledge about how to evaluate the properties of paint or sculptures, what conversations and values go into the process of restoration, and how light, chemistry, and physics are involved in the creation and display of art.",
    "I learned how to understand and analyze pieces of art from a scientific perspective.",
    "I built up a great understanding of curatorial skills in a fun and interesting way!",
    "I would say I learned the most about conservation processes in museums. There was a small amount of scientific knowledge, especially elementary ideas from chemistry, as well. I also learned a lot about color mixing.",
    "Although the material in this class is a little random, I think that overall, this class is FUN! I highly recommend this as a science credit! I always learned something new in class and I always really looked forward to Lab, because I had the opportunity to get my hands dirty and apply the material we learned. \r\n\r\nI learned SO MUCH in this class -- I learned how color works, I learned the chemistry of paint and how to look at a painting and describe the methods an artist used to create a painting, and I also learned how materials work. \r\n\r\nI think overall, my big takeaways from this class were \r\n1 - how to observe the world in a new way. I found myself looking at statues and trying to estimate whether its center of gravity was centered, or looking at pantings and thinking about whether any fading occurred. \r\n2 - how to conduct experiments. In one of my favorite classes, Glenn spoke to us about how he solves problems as an engineer. He described a series of steps he took, including outlining all the functions of the new product, mapping out the product over and over again and testing the product. Getting to practice this scientific method over and over again in labs was super fun.",
    "Basic chemistry and physics that apply to art.",
    "I learned a bit about fluid behavior, a bit about the physics of sculpture, a bit about light and color theory, and a bit about spectroscopy.",
    "I learned a lot about light (how we see it, what it is, etc), a bit about paint and chemistry of materials, and an unclear amount about forces and restoration",
    "I learnt how to view art more critically and think about the processes that led to the art piece and how the materials interact. I also learnt about many scientific forces and phenomena at play in art such as surface tension.",
    "I learned a lot from this class! It was truly interdisciplinary, and gave me a great sense of all the ways one can approach a work of art (physics, chemistry, ethics, aesthetics, etc.).",
    "I learned about all kinds of art-creation methods and the science behind them -- color\/light, paint, and sculpture were the three main topics, and we delved pretty deeply (for a non-science major class, so nothing super technical)  into each topic. I also learned how to get the important information out of a scientific paper and how to participate in a lab, since I'd never taken a lab science credit before.",
    "I developed a better technique to reading and discussing scientific methods. I also learned to better engage with group activities during labs."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths are an invested teacher and interesting not too difficult subjects, and always the option to ask questions, but a weakness is probably the disorganization of the course (slides on canvas not in order) and strange wording in the labs.",
    "This class was a little disorganized; it was really difficult to keep track of what information we had to know and the lectures would tack between qualitative descriptions of broad principles to oddly specific chemistry with no warning.",
    "Dr. Schilling is a fantastic professor! She was very engaging and excited about the material and all of the labs were very fun and interesting applications of the material. I would say that some of the readings are very dense and hard to follow, but she is very good at explaining any questions or challenges you may have. I really enjoyed the format of lecture responses in which we were able to check in about questions or concepts and receive feedback and answers after each class.",
    "The course felt a little disorganized at times, so it would have been nice to have a more structured layout, especially with lecture slides. The lectures sometimes felt like they didn't connect to one another and it was hard to pull out the overarching themes. The content was interesting though!",
    "For many students, this is a science credit, so the fact that it is VERY laid back and informal is a huge strength. However, I came away from the course not feeling like I had internalized concepts terribly well, so that feels like a weakness.",
    "My only real issue was that we sort of sped through the 3rd and final unit. I also would've liked to have seen some more on other types of art, i.e. printing and photography! (suggest a cyanotype lab!)",
    "Fun and engaging labs. Lectures are good but something Professor Schilling goes too deep into the science which can get really confusing (she doesn't test you on those things but still). It's definitely the best science you could take if you're an art history or art major, and in general I think learning about the physical sciences with this hands-on approach is more interesting than a class about bugs or fish or something.",
    "I think the course started out on a very strong note, and we internalized a lot of scientific content in a short amount of time. I also think the lecture reflections were a good technique of making sure that we retained material from class. But, following the midterm, learning really slowed and lectures seemed more disorganized. The labs were also fairly disorganized.",
    "Strengths: I really like the nightly lecture reviews. I think they encouraged me to reflect on what I had learned and identify the questions that I still had in my mind. I also really loved lab, I think they were designed incredibly well. \r\n\r\nI think the classes where Professor Schilling asked us questions and the students got to answer the material worked very well!\r\n\r\nWeakness: A lot of the classes had what seemed like a lot of random material in them. The subjects only came together either in labs or at the end of the topic section. Some classes, however, had main take-aways at the end of the slides. I would recommend keeping those!\r\n\r\nI also think that at time advanced Mechanical Engineering concepts were being taught to us when we weren't equipped with the background to understand them. I would recommend not teaching advanced concepts without teaching the building blocks that muse be used to understand the material.",
    "One of the most fun classes I've ever been in. The lectures were engaging, Kate is great, and our labs are really fun. Only thing can be improved is... maybe change to a different classroom next semester? The pipe bursted and weird noises occurred. Can't say we weren't afraid we were going to die in the name of science.",
    "A little disorganized. The slides weren't explained thoroughly, and some difficult concepts were not explained well while we spent a lot of time on easier concepts. We had a series of guest lectures at the end of the term that seemed to serve no real purpose, given that their material was not on the final. Labs were confusing because we often didn't get clarification on the sometimes vague instructions until midway through the lab. Also, I would have liked to see more implications about the connection between material usage and artistic effect. I really enjoyed the short discussion we had on the ethics of reconstructing Tullio's Adam sculpture, and it would have been nice to have more in-depth conversations like that on the reasons why certain artists use certain materials. On the other hand, the exams and assessments were the right amount of difficulty, and I never felt like I had no resources to help me if I were struggling in the class.",
    "Strengths: builds up nicely from basic concepts to their eventual compounded applications, loved having occasional review days to go over material from different labs and units\r\nWeaknesses: unclear labs (they were so much more painful than necessary), unclear organization of material within any given lecture, very undefined last few weeks of the course",
    "Overall, I thought this was a very strong course for a non-science major. Science majors might find the material too simple. As a humanities major, I was able to keep up, though I did find the pre-labs difficult. I wasn't sure where to look for the information we were being asked to provide. Often. I did not find that the answers were in the lecture or in the readings so I ended up searching online. I wish these assignments had been more closely tied to the course material. Other than that I thought the assessments were fair and it was nice that lots of smaller assignments made up your grade instead of just a midterm and final.",
    "Strengths of the course is that the lectures were very thorough and well organized and the course structure was also easy to follow and well organized. The labs were also all very fun and engaging. One weakness is that sometimes there was too much scientific facts that we didnt necessarily need to know that was a little confusing at times.",
    "Strengths: the material was very interesting, especially if you're interested in art. Dr. Schilling is incredibly knowledgeable about the class topic and was always able to inform without overwhelming. The lecture reflections were pretty useful to help solidify the contents of that day's lecture in my mind.\r\nWeaknesses: the sporadic reading schedule made the class feel a bit disorganized -- some weeks there would be a bunch of readings and some weeks none. Not sure if it would be possible, but a more balanced reading load would make the class feel a bit more cohesive.",
    "The course could be better organized such as ways to better understand the material without just listening to lectures or discussions. The labs were facilitated to really understand concepts."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, its a fun and interesting way to earn a science credit!",
    "Fantastic science gut - you mostly talk about how art is affected by science, so things like paint properties and forces acting on sculptures. There is a mandatory lab, but it only meets every other week, and twice we just went to a museum and looked at things. Very chill, highly recommended.",
    "This class was frustrating at times. The expectations are so hard to pin down, and the final was actually pretty long and tough, but not technically. If you need a science credit, consider this course; otherwise, you might spend more time confused than enlightened. At its best, this class provided useful insight into art and how it's preserved. At its worst, this class felt like a mismatch between Dr. Schilling's technical expertise and our preparation to tackle difficult material.",
    "Absolutely! This was so much fun and a great way to learn about science through its application in art",
    "For a science credit, absolutely! If you already know anything about science\/physics, please DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!! It really isn't for you. At its essence, it is a very basic physics\/chemistry course for students who enjoy art.",
    "Yes! The teaching was excellent and clearer than most. The coursework was engaging and exciting.",
    "Good science credit for non-science people, especially if you are art \/ art history (it will feel like less of  waste of time then most gut sciences)",
    "This course is an interesting enough science credit, but I think there are better ones to choose from. Truthfully, I did not get a lot out of taking this class.",
    "Absolutely. It was a really FUN way to get a science credit and you get to learn a lot. \r\n\r\nI learned things that don't have a direct application to my life (i.e. I am not really a painter or a sculptor) but I definitely feel that the material enhanced my life. \r\n\r\nPlus the labs, like \"re-making a Pollock\" and \"Crushing David's Ankle\" are just fun.",
    "Absolutely. Event though it is a great easy science class, don't just take this as a science credit. You'll learn a lot and the things you learn are applicable.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course as a science distribution requirement - it might be interesting for art majors, but I felt like I learned a lot of ideas about different materials without going into why these facts were important and why they affected artistic behavior. The disorganization was also rather frustrating.",
    "It's a good science class if you actually care about art. don't bother otherwise",
    "I would recommend this to someone who is interested in art and needs a science credit. You don't need to know much about art to take the class, but if you're not at least interested in it you might be bored. Sometimes the class feels like a lot of work because there are lots of little assignments. We had to submit lecture reflections after each lecture and every other week we had a 3 hour lab on Fridays. But overall the workload is very manageable, and Prof. Schilling's grading is fair. She understood that most of us did not have a strong scientific background. I enjoyed the class and learned a lot!! I have a whole new way of looking at art when I go to museums.",
    "Yes I would since it is a great way to engage more critically with art and develop a more critical eye when viewing art. You also learn about crucial issues in art conservation.",
    "Absolutely! I would have taken this class even if I didn't need it to fulfill a distributional requirement.",
    "If you're a non-science major looking for a science credit, definitely, and especially if you like art. The class goes into enough detail that you really do gain a new understanding of how art works, but it's not so complicated that it's overwhelming. If you're a science major, though, you may feel somewhat disappointed with the lack of depth -- I can't speak to that personally since I'm not a science major.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to an art student in need of a science credit."
