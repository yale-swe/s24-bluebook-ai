Learning to revise is top of mind when I think of what skills I gained by taking this course. Producing a piece of writing that I feel is good, and then utilizing feedback to make it better than I thought it could be. I learned to be intentional in my word choice, and to ensure that every word serves a purpose.",
                "Greater ability to analyze personal essays for effectiveness\r\nGreater awareness of writing vivid descriptions in essays to convey five senses\r\nGreater ability to write non-conventional essays that are not simply a thesis, body, and conclusion"

            "comments": [
                "Overall was an incredible course that facilitated learning, asking questions, and genuine curiosity in the classroom. Professor Sexton was easy to talk to and had the students lead the discussion, while sitting back and guiding us in the right directions.",
                "I turned in my assignments on time. One of my weaknesses were speaking up, and this could be improved by making sure I do speak up next time I am in a class like this.",
                "Strengths: readings were perfect examples of the 5 (4, you get to skip one) different types of pieces we were asked to write, and having the choice to skip one of the 5 topics anytime in the term gave me leeway that I really needed at that time of the term.  Getting good feedback from my professor and peers on essays was crucial to improving my writing.  We all became great friends through the class. Weaknesses: Sometimes the deadlines just felt crazy.  I often submitted essays late.  Im a perfectionist when it comes to writing, so ENGL 120 was my hardest\/busiest class this term.  I dont know how to counteract this, though.",
                "Strengths- interesting readings, very broad essay topics that give a lot of room for creativity\r\nWeaknesses- some of the deadlines are too close together, and I was stressed out a lot",
                "The seminar format really facilitates great discussion among the students and the professor. The reading list was mostly very enjoyable. Feedback from the professor was excellent. I would have liked to have spent more class time workshopping student papers. Instead of one day of workshopping per assignment, two days would be better. Reading other students' work and discussing it was my favorite part of the class. Learning to critique and to accept criticism are such important academic skills that more time devoted to their cultivation would be a good thing.",
                "Great, engaging class discussions + readings\r\nVery helpful feedback on essays\r\nInteresting\/diverse essay prompts throughout the semester\r\nAnother round of essay feedback could be helpful in some cases"

                "Yes absolutely 110%. I went into the class unconfident in my writing ability but through Professor Sextons incredibly detailed comments and carefuly chosen essays I left confident and enjoying the process of writing. The class it not that much work (less than expected) and was easily manageable with the very well thought out schedule.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The workload was not that much and the readings that were assigned were pretty interesting. If you have the chance, take this class with Adam Sexton, he is an amazing professor.",
                "100% recommend, especially with Professor Sexton.  The class was so helpful and made me so much of a better writer.  It also introduced me to the wonderful book On Writing Well by William Zinsser, which I will continue to use as a tool in other writing beyond this class.  This class both challenged me a lot and reinvigorated me about writing as an act of learning and analysis.",
                "YES! The professor and class are fantastic",
                "Highly recommend this course.",
                "Absolutely! Regardless of writing ability, this course will help everybody become a stronger writer and more aware of how to write effectively. Class readings are usually enjoyable, and class always engaging."
