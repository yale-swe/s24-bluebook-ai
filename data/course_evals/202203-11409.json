                "I think it would have been helpful to start color a bit earlier in the semester. Also, more life models! Those classes really forced us to capture gesture quickly and think about the whole human form.",
                "Strengths - taught very well, if you like painting you'll love the class! Only weakness is that there are times during the semester that you have very little work and other times where you feel swamped.",
                "Strengths: I learned a lot and will probably continue to paint in the future. I acquired a new hobby.\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, I think the bar was a little too high for an intro course. I constantly felt like I wasn't doing enough which took a lot of the fun out of the class.",
                "More instruction on composition and how to paint",
                "Strengths: Beverly is wonderful and a fun instructor to have! The class environment felt very relaxed. We always had access to the art studio, so we could pretty much paint whenever we wanted to. We painted all different types of things: objects, places, people, ourselves, so we really got a good breadth of types of paintings. We were encouraged to paint outside of our comfort zones and try new supplies and styles.\r\nWeaknesses: It's easy to spend way too much time on a painting, and you may never really feel done with your paintings, which can be frustrating. Not all supplies are provided, and oil paints and art supplies are very expensive.",
                "I feel more confident about oil painting, both in terms of technical skills and foundational knowledge. I think the one weakness of this course was pacing. It was very slow in the beginning and we spent a lot of time on the basics such as color wheel, value, still life. Then we jumped from that to self portraits/figure drawing/final project, which felt like a big leap.",
                "I felt I strongly brought creative ideas towards every project I completed. I also strongly used color mixtures in my creations and never shyed away from the material. I struggled to create realistic still life images, which improved on greatly, because this was my first painting class."

                "Yes!! If you like painting or art in general, take this class.",
                "If you're an art major and need to take this, then sure. Otherwise, I would proceed with caution. I definitely learned a LOT from this class and now feel comfortable with an entirely new medium. It was fun to immerse myself in a class that had a totally different pace and environment, and I am very thankful for everything I learned and probably don't regret it. However, this is NOT a gut. I would spend just as much time, if not probably more, doing work for this class than I did for a lot of my tougher STEM classes. Also, this will not be an easy A if you take it with Professor Acha. You might even need to fight for a B or a C. She is very strict on attendance and grades harshly. That said, I've heard that the other section is very different and potentially easier in terms of grades.",
                "Yes! I learned so much from this class and Beverly made such a great environment for developing your own artistic voice. It was super beginner friendly but people from all levels can get a lot out of the class.",
                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely! If you enjoy painting or just generally being creative, this is the class for you! Be prepared to spend time on your paintings--as long as you're intentional about the decisions you make and put in effort to finish them, you'll be all set. I love painting, so this class brought a lot of joy to my semester and fun homework to balance things out.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, I learned so much about basic painting skills. I feel I can build upon these skills confidently in my own creations and in more difficult painting classes."
