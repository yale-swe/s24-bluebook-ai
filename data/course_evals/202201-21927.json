                "Monetary Policies, DSGE models, ZLB, unconventional monetary policies",
                "A systematic understanding of monetary policy, both from an analytical and a policymaking perspective.",
                "New Keynesian models, monetary policy rules and their respective advantages and disadvantages, how the Fed works and makes decisions, unconventional policies and their effectiveness, monetary policy response to the pandemic, how monetary policy works in certain other parts of the world (e.g. Europe, emerging markets), the importance of Fed communication. Also how to understand monetary policies happening in real time. I also improved my writing skills.",
                "Learned about how modern macro models work. Also learned all about how monetary policy (especially at the US Federal Reserve) operates, both from a theoretical and practical perspective. This includes how conventional and unconventional monetary policy affects the economy as well as a number of rules and consideraions for setting monetary policy."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the professor gives good topics for the papers and the mock committee meeting on the last day is a fun way to apply what you've learned throughout the course. Lectures are a bit dry, but professor English does teach well.",
                "The strength of the course is definitely professor English. he is super knowledgeable, energetic, and engaged, and does a great job conveying what he knows to the students.",
                "This course covers a wide array of topics from the theoretical formulation of the DSGE model to evaluation of the real-life implementation of monetary policies. Many insights are offered through lectures and readings.",
                "This is an INCREDIBLE course. I absolutely loved it. Professor English is a legend. \r\n\r\nOnly caveat is high workload, but if you put in the work I promise you will not regret it.",
                "Strengths: Professor English brings so much of his expertise and knowledge from working at the Fed into this course, and it's a fantastic opportunity to learn from someone so knowledgeable. The class and casual class coffees were also great opportunities to learn about monetary policy happening in real time. Papers were stressful to write but proved to be rewarding. I also liked that although the course focused on the Fed, we did have time to discuss monetary policies in other countries. Professor English's slides were also always super clear.\r\nWeakness: I wish the expectations for the final had been clearer (e.g. to what extent we should know about specific papers / specific math exercises), because the course had so much content and studying for the final & trying to remember everything from the beginning of the semester gave me a lot of anxiety. But this is somewhat a minor point because overall the course was very rewarding. I also wish the papers had been graded slightly faster to offer more time to get feedback before starting the next writing assignment (but this is a minor point because I really do appreciate the level of detail in the comments, and I wouldn't trade that for faster grading).",
                "Strengths: great lectures (at least, if you're interested in the subject) including some very cool guest lectures, Professor English is also super knowledgeable about this topic and always happy to share his views based on 25 years of working at the Fed, and the papers are a great way to dive deeper into the material from class. You also get to cover a lot of material and there are plenty of ways to engage with the material outside of class. Weaknesses: if you're not interested in monetary policy, the class will be a lot of work for not that much payoff. Some things (terminology, etc) can also be confusing at times if you don't have a background in finance. My only suggestion for improvment would be to ensure that terms like \"risk spread\" are defined as soon as Professor English starts using them (it took a few weeks for me to really understand what he was talking about)."

I took it for the WR credit, but I was excited to write the papers and the content was very interesting. That said, if you don't think central bank policy and their impact on the economy/financial markets is an interesting topic, this class will be boring for you.",
                "yes, I would definitely recommend this course, especially to Econ majors, but not only! This class gives a great idea of how the real world economy moves.",
                "If one is interested in learning deeper, particularly on monetary policy, this would be a good class to take as there is so much to discuss about monetary policy in this class. Knowledge in micro, macro, and financial economics could be helpful as the pace of the class gets quicker.",
                "YES! TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT",
                "Definitely, for the opportunity to learn from Professor English and his expertise, and to actually begin to understand monetary policy news. But the course does have a high workload (papers, problem sets, content-heavy final), so you would have to be fairly interested in monetary policy to begin with to enjoy this course. You also get to hear from some amazing guest lecturers who are experts and professionals in the field.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course if you are interested in how the Federal Reserve or monetary policy works. Also probably a great course if you are interested in finance. With essays every couple of weeks, this course is a lot of work. It also covers a lot of material and the final was very difficult. However, it's an amazing learning opportunity. Professor English is great at giving feedback and he is extremely knowledgeable about central banking. You'll gain a deeper understanding of what is going on at central banks around the world right now and a number of great facts to bring up at economics cocktail parties."
