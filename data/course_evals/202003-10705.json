                "While the review at the beginning of the course was helpful, it was a bit too slow considering it was reviewing what we just went over in the umbrella course. The course could have been a bit more organized as well.",

Also, during the first two midterms we were not allowed to ask questions to anyone except the professor.",
                "Strengths: The first half with JRDS was just about perfect. I loved how they had office hours offered pretty much whenever we wanted\/needed them. The lectures were clear and concise, and the exams reflected well what we had been taught. I also enjoyed working through the PSETs. This class in general is high value, low effort -- the concepts are fairly simple, but going through them in this manner makes you more scientifically literate. The corny jokes help you remember concepts and are not as annoying as people make them out to be. \r\nWeaknesses: The second half of the course was poorly taught and poorly structured. It was clear that JRDS and Prof Meyers did not coordinate and plan for a seamless transition beforehand -- we spent the first 5\/6 lectures going over concepts that we beat to death in the first half of class. Further, there were a few things that Meyers taught slightly differently from JRDS (for example, different variables were assigned for different statistics in each half of the class) which made things a bit confusing at times. I think the latter half of the course could have greatly benefitted from asynchronous lectures (the synchronous lectures were awkward and incredibly boring), with more clear direction. \r\n\r\nThe class is still pretty easy, but if you're a pre-med looking for a stats class take PSYC 200 or S&DS 230 instead. Don't let the \"medicine\" in the title fool you, the focus on actual medicine is extremely limited in the second half of the course.",
                "I liked how the class was very student-driven and reinforced concepts that we did not know from the previous half of the semester.",
                "This course was split into two sections, the first a general statistics introduction and the second a medical statistics application. The first half of the course was notably stronger in organization and cohesiveness than the second, though both were useful. The first half of the semester presented a large amount of information in a digestible format, and the homework assignments offered direct applications of the material. Lectures were relatively easy to understand, though it may be helpful to remove some nonessential background calculations or information to minimize student overwhelm and\/or confusion. The second half of the semester was similar to the first in that it was easy enough to understand with appropriately designed homework assignments. However, I felt that the pace of the second half of the semester was far too slow, and we spent much of our time initially reviewing concepts that we had just covered in the first half of the semester. Therefore, I think that it would be helpful to establish stronger communication between instructors for the first and second half of the semester to minimize unnecessary content overlap. Overall, however, my experience with the course was positive, useful, and readily applicable to my current interests and professional goals.",
                "The recorded lectures in 10x were great - long but they were interesting. The in-person 105 lectures were also good. They had a lot of detail, but sometimes that pace of the course was too slow and it felt like the amount of participation being asked for was artificial and excessive for the class",
                "I feel that I only learned in the first half of the class.",
                "Strengths: nice slow pace allows for thorough learning \r\nWeakness: could have discussed papers more promptly after reading them when they were fresh on our minds still.",
                "Strengths: The first half of the semester taught by Professor Reuning-Scherer went very smoothly and was enjoyable.\r\nWeaknesses: The second half taught by Professor Meyers was a bit lacking. I appreciated that he asked for our input to revisit topics that we felt needed more explanation after switching into sections, but we had trouble moving on from the review. It seemed that most lectures consisted of 1 hour of review followed by a rushed introduction of a new topic in the last 15 minutes. I appreciate the professor's efforts to ask for student feedback during the semester, but it did not seem like much changed after he received our feedback. Professor Meyers did mention that this was his first time teaching this section, so hopefully, this was just an off experience as he tried to navigate the new course.",

                "Ultimately, I would categorize the first half of the course (S&DS 100) as very strong, and the second half of the course (S&DS 105) as very weak. This is ultimately a reflection of the two different professors who taught throughout the fall semester (JDRS for 100; Meyers for 105). While S&DS 100 had no live component, there were ample, ample opportunities to attend office hours with the instructor or teaching assistants. The prerecorded lectures were also very engaging due to JDRS's humor and passionate personality. On the other hand, S&DS 105 involved a live lecture, but I did not find it as engaging. Often, Meyers encouraged students to respond through the chat option to answer practice problems. While this enabled some interaction, I believe it would have been more effective to hold small breakout rooms so that students could collaborate more actively with peers. However I thought that the discussion of medical journal entries within breakout rooms was a strength of S&DS 105, as it enabled students to verbally collaborate with peers."

Quizzes and tests were also designed well, and I did not encounter any problems during testing periods. However, the final exam was offered on a Microsoft Word document rather than Canvas, and the change in formatting (plus the requirement that we show all calculations) made for increased technical difficulty. The format of the test itself would have been more manageable if we were given more time for the final exam. The first two exams of the course allowed students 3 hours, and the final exam allowed only 2.5 hours; providing equal amounts of time for all tests would be helpful.",

A live lecture component was then introduced through S&DS 105; however, I did not find the engagement strategies of S&DS 105 to be effective. While Meyers attempted to keep the course engaging by taking advantage of the chat tool in Zoom, I felt that the class's my reliance on the chat box rather than verbal questioning caused us (or at least me) to become disengaged. Personally, I believe that it would have been more helpful to actively solve practice problems in small peer groups within breakout rooms instead of using the chat option, as the chat often became biased according to what the first few students wrote. (When using a chat option, it is easy for students to simply submit the same answer as those who answered the question first, and in doing so, they miss out on true collaboration.) However, I did enjoy breakout sessions while discussing papers, as these sessions enabled students to verbally collaborate with peers in the way I was hoping for."

Med Stats is funky because the professor insisted on synchronous lectures and a proctored exam on Zoom via a Word document where it was quite unpredictable on how to best prepare for it, as it was nothing like the psets. The only \"med\" part of \"med stats\" was learning about diagnostic test results and reading med stats papers, but that's something you can teach yourself if you're really interested.

                "While I would recommend S&DS 100 UMB to another student, I would not recommend S&DS 105 for the second half of the course. I took S&DS 105 because it was recommended for pre-med students, yet I believe that I would have learned far more concepts applicable to medicine in S&DS 103: Introduction to Statistics: Social Sciences. Whereas the piazza for S&DS 100 UMB suggests that students in S&DS 103 were tested on ANOVA concepts, we did not begin learning ANOVA until the very last lecture. While S&DS 100 was engaging and insightful, S&DS 105 involved far too much review and not enough new material, thus rendering it flat and underwhelming."
