                "I learned about fluid mechanics, diffusion, and partitioning processes and applied those concepts to real-world environmental systems such as groundwater. I also learned about the history of some global environmental issues and important figures that contributed to our understanding of those issues.",
                "I developed my ability to apply fluid mechanics and mass balance principles to mass transfer problems.",
                "I learned a lot about groundwater flow and how and why contaminants disperse through the environment, something that I think is very important."

                "I think that this course was structured really well! I wouldn't really change anything.",
                "I think this was a really interesting class, and the homework was well designed to teach the concepts.",
                "Strengths: The course was very well organized and the material was highly engaging. Concepts in this course require a high level of math (i.e. if you haven't taken differential equations or multivariable calc yet, I would take those classes first before taking this one), but Professor Meny was very good at breaking down these concepts. Professor Meny was also incredibly communicative and was willing to work with you if you had questions or concerns. The psets were hard but definitely manageable. \r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "Fun class; Meny is a great teacher; the class is a bit slow and could certainly be more rigorous",
                "This course is super organized. You will learn everything you need to know if you go to every class. The homework is a bit difficult and unclear at times, but they definitely challenge you in a good way. The exams are very fair and accurately reflect the class content.",
                "I didnt love the pset and exam structure. It seemed a little odd that what we learned and practiced on the psets wasnt on the exam. I think I understood the point (that you should focus on concepts) but I thought it was a little weird to wait until youve learned all the details on the psets to learn the concepts. I also dont feel like the class was particularly geared toward conceptual learning.",
                "This course is excellent. The material isn't naturally the most engaging, but the lectures are a great balance of note-taking and listening/theory and application/general strategies and practice problems. The homeworks are difficult but reasonable, and I felt supported through office hours and class for the difficult problems. The exams are extremely generous. Overall, the course never felt overwhelming or stressful, but I look back and realize I've learned a lot. Meny is excellent!",
                "I really liked the course overall. It was definitely a bit dry in the beginning but it was super interesting when we got to apply the concepts to systems like groundwater at the end. My only criticism is that sometimes the homeworks didn't correspond as much to the lecture material as they could have so I had to rely a lot on the TAs to understand how to do it.",
                "The course was structurally easy to follow. The toolkit for solving mass transfer problems was built step-by-step in class, in a way that was very accessible. Class notes were given in a very well-organized fashion. Early in the course, there was a class period in which we went through the steps of solving a typical problem, as might appear on the homework, with the whole class, leaving a little time for questions about each term in the problem. This was a useful practice that I haven't seen much of in other classes at Yale.\r\n\r\nThe textbook that accompanied the course was sometimes difficult to understand, in that different terminology or variable names were used from the ones used in class. A little more consolidation would be useful.",
                "Meny is very organized and makes every topic very clear. I think that his explanations of everything is great and really gives you a wholistic view of the concepts in the class.\r\n\r\nI wish that the course was more mathematically rigorous, but I understand that it is not necessarily possible with the current prerequesites for the course.\r\n\r\nI also think that the transport phenomena sequence should be considered required for this course and mass and momentum transport should be reviewed instead of taught over 2/3 of the course. \r\n\r\nI felt that I learned the most in the last 1/3 of the course, which I thoroughly enjoyed."
