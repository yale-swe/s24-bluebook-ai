                "A big strength of the class was the wide array of literature that was read. Gave a wide variety of perspective. Professor Kapustin is also a great professor who facilitates discussion well and expands on the readings.",
                "The course is truly insightful, mostly because the professor has a wealth of knowledge. The readings are hard--among the hardest of any I've done at Yale, but each seminar is a real learning opportunity. I think the class would be better restricted to people with a little more philosophical background. It is hard to jump into such complex discussions without some familiarity with process of philosophical argumentation and discussion. Though the class was rather large, the people who participated were mostly upper-level students. Also, the feedback on the essays is among the best I have received, really pushing me to think more about what I wrote.",
                "The course is strong in its syllabus, which is fascinating and prompts a high level of engagement. Our discussions were great. Sometimes, though, the reading was simply too much to get all of it done.",
                "Very interesting readings and engaging professor",
                "Diverse concepts, great course organization",

                "I absolutely would. Professor Kapustin is brilliant, and it was such a serious class in a really productive way.",
                "Yes. Kapustin leads seminars super well, and is great at guiding the class towards the main concepts. Intellectually stimulating, and I learned a lot",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in political theory (especially twentieth-century political theory) and connecting it to modern instances of revolution and political violence. Professor Kapustin is a wonderful seminar leader and also a great teacher in one-on-one advising.",
                "Yes, I never thought I'd be interested in violence but found that this topic is extremely fundamental to how our society organizes, maintains power, and bleeds into the daily functions of our lives."
