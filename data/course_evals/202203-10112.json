            "comments": [
                "Lectures are quite good; you learn a lot about how to take and reduce data. However, homeworks are all in Python, and while the course says that it requires no prior knowledge of Python, coding is never taught so you just have to figure it out yourself. If you're a Python beginner, that makes this course really challenging. I think that this course should be two separate courses -- one that teaches Python, and one that teaches all the content we go over in lecture.",
                "Strengths: you learn a lot about what researchers in astrophysics do, and the processes to interpreting data. The skills that you get from this class are very relevant to activities most astrophysics students do in the near future or already participating in.\r\n\r\nWeakness: poor structure in teaching, a bit unorganized, and inaccessible to people who are new to astronomy. There were a group of students who did well in the class because they already had been doing astronomy research for a long time, however, those who have never had python experience or were less familiar with astronomy often had to find ways to learn these things on their own. The lectures were often hard to follow because it was easy to drift off.",
                "This class gave a thorough introduction to research methods in astrophysics. However, the course was not very organized, with assignments often unclear and the significance of the material being discussed sometimes uncertain. Lectures could have been more useful and engaging overall.",
                "Strengths: application of programming to the theory described in lectures; final project was a fun experience.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: techniques for assignments needed to be largely self-learned; largely, a review of basic astronomy (even ASTR 255 delved deeper into some of the data reduction + image processing); midterm exam was forgotten about until last few weeks and sprung on last minute (lecture-focused, as opposed to rest of semester spent on figuring out problem sets).",
                "Strengths: Interesting content with applicable skills, prepares you for field research in astrophysics, Arce and Yasmeen (TF) were both super nice. Weaknesses: Concepts on psets were not explained in class so a lot of self-teaching was necessary (especially for python beginners), steep learning curve for those without experience",
                "For much of the class, there was a disconnect between what was happening in class and what we were doing on the psets. It also seemed really difficult if you didn't have a background in python already. With that said, it's a great class in that it actually teaches you the skills you need to do astronomy.",
                "There was little instruction on the skills required to be successful in the coding for this class. However, it dove into the purposes behind the coding we did and the basics of astrophysics very well",
                "Strengths: the material and content of this course was very interesting to me; it serves as a clear overview of the basic methods and data for any type of experimental astrophysics research. I appreciated the opportunities for both learning theory\/techniques and applying that theory to experimental data analysis problems through Python coding. I particularly appreciated the telescope proposal project, which gave us experience in writing and evaluating proposals for observing time, essential skills for research astronomy.\r\nWeaknesses: overall, lectures could occasionally be more engaging. Also, the coding skills necessary to complete some of the problem sets often were not really taught in class. If one had research\/coding experience the coding was relatively simple. However, for those without Python experience, it was likely quite challenging."

                "If you're an astro major, you have to take this class, and I definitely think it teaches a lot of foundations that are helpful for research (as it's advertised!). If you're not an astro major, there are other courses that will teach you more about astrophysics and less about the technical side of observations which are probably more what you'd be looking for.",
                "This course is definitely important for those who are majoring in astrophysics, however, the learning experience can be a bit difficult depending on your level of prior knowledge of topics in this course. Regardless, this course is required for anyone pursuing a degree in astronomy.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are very interested in astrophysical research. However, if you are more interested in data analysis and astronomy in general, the class is very technical and mostly focused on methods of astronomical observation. It is also not super engaging if you are not already fascinated by the material.",

I truly think that the content of the course is essential for anyone interested in pursuing astronomy\/astrophysics or doing research in the field. However, the course will likely not be particularly interesting or relevant for those not specifically in the field--there are more theory\/physics-based astronomy courses at Yale that can actually teach about space."
