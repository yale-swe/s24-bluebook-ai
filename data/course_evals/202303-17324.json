                "strengths\r\n- both professor and TAs are GREAT\r\n- a lot of material is covered\r\n- all EE classes should have TAs as the ones for this class: comitted, helpful, responsive, with a happy face at lab\r\n- everyone wants you to succeed\r\n- professor is very inclusive and tries to accomodate for everyone\r\n\r\nweaknesses\r\n- poor organization sometimes... like there was not a clear syllabus of important deadlines and sometimes HW were posted late. you didnt had any idea of when labs were happening until a week beforehand.\r\n- the final 3 labs were very hard and had crazy long reports... completely unecessary",
                "I did not like this class. I found the material extremely boring and difficult to pay attention to. The lab guides were often extremely vague, and did not quite match up with what we were taught in class. It was difficult to write the lab reports based on the lab guides, and the labs were often very tedious. One lab involved taking the same measurement 20 different times for 4 different devices, which was extremely repetitive and boring. The lectures need to be made more interesting. I found the exams hard, mostly because so much content was covered in the class it was hard to have a good enough grasp on all of it. We got almost no grades back all semester, which was very frustrating.",
                "The slides were not extremely well written, as the prof had been using Prof Tang's slides from previous years, but she actually is very helpful and good at explaining concepts in office hours, as well as in class when she would lecture on the blackboard. The material in this class is rather hard to conceptualize, as it is literally quantum physics, but not unmanageable. The labs are a bit tedious, but that is just how it is and there are not too many of them.",
                "The course structure was very effective. It followed a logical roadmap where I was able to learn about about the underlying chemistry and physics behind how transistor works, and then after building those foundations, I understood how transistors work. I think it was very effective. Finally able to learn about optoelectronic applications of semiconductors at the end."

                "Prof Liu is very good at explaining concepts and is very receptive to her students. From what I hear from previous years, it is a much better taught course with Prof Liu as opposed to previous years. Prof Liu is also a new professor, so she is also still figuring out how to instruct well, but she is clearly very passionate and knowledgeable about the subject matter. However, the course material is just pretty difficult, with a lot of complex math.",
                "If you are okay with doing some self learning, and are interested in physics of microelectronic devices, I recommend! It teaches you a bit of chemistry, a bit of quantum physics and mechanics, a bit of solid state physics, and finally how these are all applied to devices. As someone who is interested in physics and electrical engineering, I really enjoyed the course."
