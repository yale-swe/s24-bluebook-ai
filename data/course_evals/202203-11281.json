                "I've learned a really impressive amount of Japanese by taking this course! You don't realize just how much you've learned until three months have gone by and you realize it's only been three months. We learned how to do introductions, ask for things, give and understand directions, describe things using adjectives in the past and present tense, say that we have or have not done actions, tell time and date, how often we've done something, and so so so much more.",
                "I learnt how to speak elementary Japanese! I think the course was taught in an incredibly accessible and fun way & I really appreciated how there was a focus on learning aspects of Japanese that aren't typically found in textbooks",

Amazingly, I was able to have basic conversations by the end of the course, which is a lot more than I've been able to do in any other beginner language course after only 14-ish weeks. I learned a lot of useful survival vocabulary to describe people, places, and culture. I feel like if I were to travel to Japan now, that I'd be able to get around!"

                "Strengths: The class was extremely well-organized and Nishimura-sensei was an amazing teacher. The class felt very engaging throughout the entire semester and overall it was very fun. We had a lot of opportunities to speak during class (both reading as a class and conversations with partners\/small groups), which we got feedback on often. Nishimura-sensei graded all of our assignments\/tests very quickly (usually less than a day after turning it in) and we got comments on every assignment, so there was a lot of feedback on writing\/grammar as well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No real weaknesses. The daily classes and homework can feel like a lot sometimes but I think it is very beneficial for language learning in the long run.",
                "This class is really optimized for student learning! That being said, I think that this is a really challenging language class, similar to other languages at Yale. I wouldn't recommend taking five classes while doing this class unless you have a background in the material already. I think that I was consistently grateful that I'd previously studied Japanese because you learn SO many things in such a short amount of time. You spend about two weeks on a lesson, with each lesson being pretty hefty in content. It's a fast-paced class, but you definitely feel confident if you want to pursue a study abroad program.",
                "Strengths: Good foundation for Japanese",
                "It was very engaging, and I had fun doing the in-class activities, which I think are quite effective already. Maybe we could play more games like bingo, or have more unstructured conversation opportunities in class. Skits are fun as well!!",
                "This course, being everyday, really drills the language into the student. I can't think of any real weaknesses, other than the level of exhaustion this much drilling can instill in you. But that's a necessary part of learning the language.",
                "a lot of in-class practice, helpful to limit studying needed to be done outside of class",
                "Strengths -- instant feedback on all homeworks; extremely supportive peer community; expectation of fast learning speed which really pushed me to my limits but not in a stressful way; amazing teaching from Nishimura-sensee; the course textbook was helpful and had very cute illustrations; I felt like the organization of the course flowed really well. Since we had class meetings every single weekday, I enjoyed when we had special days like writing calligraphy and reading picture books at the library. I wish we had more of those! I also liked how group projects were an opportunity to get to know other people in the class."

                "If you want to learn Japanese, this course will absolutely hold you accountable to learn Japanese. Going into this class, you should be aware that the majority of your work for this class happens outside of the class and class time is spent just practicing verbally the things that you have studied. This course is a lot! But you definitely have a really good time with your classmates and the professor because you're meeting so often.",

                "Yes! Japanese is such a beautiful language and culture. I implore anyone with even the slightest interest in learning another language to take Japanese.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students. It teaches the fundamentals of the Japanese language in a fun, engaging, and approachable way.",
                "I would totally recommend to anyone who is serious about learning Japanese. The program is aggressive, but not unmanageable.",
                "yes",
                "Yes!!! I decided to take L1 Japanese after reading other course reviews which insisted that Yale has the best intro Japanese curriculum in the country. After taking L1, I honestly don't doubt it. However, I think the atmosphere of each section differs a lot-- i.e. if you take 9AM section, it appears to be a lot of first years\/first year grad students who are very serious; vs. later sections will probably feel more relaxed. If possible you can factor this into your decision-making when choosing a section. I would 100% recommend taking this class with Nishimura-sensee."
