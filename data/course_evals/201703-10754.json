   "comments": [
    "I learned how to be more analytical in writing my essay by doing close-reading. Professor Lindskog helped walk through the process of finding how certain things within a text go together or conflict in order to recognize some deeper meaning by the author. Also, in writing the essays, I was able to better utilize text to help build a thesis. This course was incredibly helpful in providing breadth regarding literature, and it allowed me to evaluate certain themes as they changed or continued through history.",
    "I learned about the major literary themes and forms in the pre-Renaissance part of the western canon.",
    "I learned how to be a more organized\/clear writer",
    "I improved my close-reading skills and learned how to connect that with the larger implication of the texts.",
    "This course improved my ability to do detailed close reading and analysis. It also improved my skills at translating the ideas formed in close reading into papers",
    "DS as a whole taught me to view the foundations of Western academic and cultural thought with a new understanding and depth. I learned how to read and write in a more rigorous, insightful way, especially in the context of my Literature class.",
    "I think I received a very nuanced understanding of the core themes and techniques of the seminal texts of ancient Western literature. I learned how to take a specific angle on a text and really delve deep into it in a paper, while still being able to understand the text as a whole.",
    "Katja is a great teacher, but she grades quite generously. I think my writing would've improved a lot more had she been more critical."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that the strength of this course is also its weakness. By covering so many texts, we have to skim (or ignore) large portions of the texts that we read. Even though professors do attempt to cover the main themes and scenes of the text, we still have to miss major points in order to stay on schedule. As a result, I felt like I missed out on some of the dialogue that may occur outside of DS that cements a deeper understanding of the text as a whole.",
    "Seminar was a good balance of student discussion and instructor lecturing.",
    "Strength: \r\n- Discussion could have been lead by the instructor to be more text-based and discussion oriented (people responding to one another as opposed to just going off on their own)\r\n- Loved when she brought in excerpts from other texts \r\nWeakness: \r\n- Wish we had discussion leads\r\n- Could have had more discussion responses",
    "It focuses on good texts and spends an appropriate amount of time on each",
    "I appreciated the time taken to delve into longer texts, although the course is an overview and thus has to remain at more surface level for much of the discussion. The reading was at a more manageable level than the other DS classes.",
    "This courses strengths essentially boil down to the texts. The books we read in DS are honestly transformative. Theyve shaped the way I think about social relationships and institutions.",
    "I thought we had some really stimulating discussions, but I think the course may have benefited from some more structure. Sometimes it felt like there wasn't much direction to the class discussions.",
    "Katja should structure and direct the class more. She would often ask us what we thought of books or what we found surprising. She had something interesting to say about whatever students brought up, but as a whole, the class felt disorganized and undirected."

   "comments": [
    "I think that as a whole, this course can be beneficial to other students by providing them with a good background and foundation to explore texts in the Western Canon. Nonetheless, even though DS instructors say that no prior experience is necessary, I felt like I was behind my peers on numerous occasions because they had prior exposure to either Latin, Greek, ancient history, or other texts. I feel that if a student really loves literature and wants to explore these topics more, it would be a great class, but students without prior experience can feel overwhelmed by section.",
    "Yes! By starting with the Iliad and moving chronologically to and through Dante, you will understand how the western canon of literature fits together.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Lindskog is brilliant and inspirational.",
    "DS is good for students who like the idea of reading, writing, and analysis, and want to impirve these skills",
    "I would recommend having Katja as a Lit professor. She led class discussion well and invested a lot in helping her students become better writers and thinkers. As to recommending DS as a whole, I think it is a good fit for some students and not for others. A genuine interest in the syllabus is one of the most overlooked but most essential attribute. I personally learned a lot in DS first semester and overall enjoyed the process.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to get a really deep sense of literary tradition, who loves to read, and who is interested in really stimulating discussions."
