                "I loved how this course really did a wonderful job introducing and demonstrated the interconnectivity of justice, gender and power.",
                "I gained a surface level covering of the syllabus's main topics. Otherwise I do not feel that I gained anything meaningful at all from this class. The class felt like we were just hearing opinions about issues, without close consideration towards arguments, and then just moving swiftly on. Given the expected authority of a professor or TF, these opinions were being taught to us like facts. This meant that it either confirmed our initial beliefs, or conflicted and so were ignored. There was no exploration or challenging of any ideas. Professor Fischel made unsupported claims, seemingly based on his own opinions/preferences, which felt a disservice given that this was my first time exploring this field, and I had expected an objective and rounded semester. Some of the TF's presentations were even more dramatic examples of this, where it felt like they had a certain view they wanted to defend and I left the lecture not feeling any more educated on the topic but instead just more aware of that person's perspective.",
                "This was an excellent course that allowed room for open engagement and learning.",
                "I developed knowledge about social issues, and their philosophical and historical roots.",
                "I learned more about gender, justice, and power, and how they interact in modern-day institutions.",
                "Ways to think about interdisciplinary content regarding the role of gender in society.",
                "I learned about so many different movements and theories behind gender, justice, power, and institutions. I appreciated learning about the laws that have shaped these movements as well.",
                "it was mostly a survey course of a lot of hot button issues (bathrooms, abortion, consent, etc)",
                "Great course overviewing the importance, history, and happenings in topics regarding gender, Justice, power, and institutions. The topics were all highly engaging and intersected the four pillars of the class nicely. Great speakers were brought in and interesting materials were used.",

                "I learn about deeper and progressive ideas, got involved in conversations ingrained in US societies. The course materials really interested me and I enjoyed reading them a lot. It is always nice to have these sort of classes, while challenging you intellectually also works a mental health recovery.",

                "STRENGTHS: Never had to worry too much about this class but learned a lot. Lectures and readings are very informative and not that intimidating if you have no background in philosophy or gender studies. Joe and the TFs are great. WEAKNESSES: some topics are uncomfortable to talk about and some lectures are intense - you should read the syllabus carefully (pretty much every trigger warning imaginable, including some gory/graphic stuff discussed in a lecture about the limits of consent)",
                "More ability for students to find readings they connect with",
                "In lecture, Professor Fischer usually spends about half of the time reviewing what he went over the lecture prior. I don't think this is particularly helpful nor engaging. I wish he would just actually lecture during the whole lecture.",
                "Strengths\r\nThe workload was relaxed and the readings were very reasonable but I still felt like I got so much out of the course, readings and sections!",
                "Such a great class honestly",
                "I don't think there's a need to recap the previous lecture every lecture, as it takes up more than half the time, and we often ran out of time to discuss the actually relevant topics. I feel like slides could be enhanced by using the space the briefly point toward key points of the lecture, rather than background information, as sometimes Joe's lectures were a bit confusing and seemed scattered. I also feel like the justice unit could be enhanced as it felt out of context with the rest of course at times.",
                "I wish that the lectures were recorded and posted on canvas.",
                "Students having to argue opposing views in section and more closely engage with arguments and course content. I do not feel that views were openly discussed at all, which I had expected to be central to the class.",

                "No weakness!",
                "Strengths: Professor Fischel does a great job of contextualizing the information. The quizzes meant I was more motivated to attend class and do the readings. Some of the readings / podcasts / videos were super engaging. Fischel also makes an effort to bring in guest speakers and share talks and discussions happening on campus, which I appreciated. Professor Fischel talks very quickly but does a lot of review, which I found super helpful. Weaknesses: some of the readings were very dense and made discussion in section difficult.",
                "too broad. but the teaching staff was incredible",
                "sometimes reading was too heavy so i wouldnt do it all",
                "strengths: interesting readings, low stress class, engaging lectures; weaknesses: class time often felt too short, sometimes low workload/stress of the class made so that many people did not do the readings/show up to lecture",
                "Strengths: very manageable workload, engaging coursework, section discussions were insightful, professor is very engaging.\r\nWeaknesses: none",

I took this course mainly for an SS credit, but even then, I feel like I could have taken a more engaging course. The course had a lot of breadth but not a lot of depth. The course also seemed to perfectly align with a book the professor was writing at the same time, which isn't necessarily bad, but it's usually a red flag and kind of showed at times... I would only recommend if you had to or if you just really wanted a gut because this is a gutty gut.",

                "yes! i took this class to get a broader understanding of social issues I was seeing in the news. the space is super inclusive, and if you have dumb questions you don't want to sound ignorant asking, the teaching staff is really good about being inclusive and talking about uncomfortable topics!",
