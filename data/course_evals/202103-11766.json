                "Skills and insights into what constitutes strong writing: quite a unique style but one that was really enjoyable to learn.",

                "Learned close reading skills, how to write more effectively, and different writing crafts.",
                "This course helped me gain confidence in my writing. I was not at all confident in my writing skills before taking this course, and I always dreaded having to do it. I think a lot of why this course helped me to enjoy writing more came from the writing style (fun, creative-nonfiction essays mostly about by own life). They were much easier to really get into than, say, analytical essays on some of the readings you might write for another English class. This course really helped me get better at writing, too. The workshops when your peers give you feedback on one of your drafts are very helpful.",
                "I developed my writing skills immensely.  Beyond just analytical writing, I was able to harness creative writing skills as well.  The strict schedule of drafts and final drafts forced me to figure out a writing process that works for me.  I learned to be more prolific!",
                "I learned how to be a better reader and writer (specifically in the genres that we studied) by emulating others and analyzing for craft.",
                "I learned to turn a critical gaze toward the experiences I've had, the places I love, the people I admire, and the general culture I live in. I learned to write creative nonfiction more intentionally and with more discipline."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths are in the essays that we read in class and the writing process - it felt very put together. Weakness in how the essays we read sometimes felt quite separated from the ones we were writing - more of a link between them would have been really useful.",
                "Very engaging and intense course. Very fast pace.\r\nSince 5 essays were written in total, few revisions were made.",
                "Strengths: Its great to learn how to write in many different situations and get that experience in the class. Also you get a LOT of feedback which is good for improving your learning. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The essays you read are up to the professor, so if you dont like the essays the class can be boring.",
                "Strengths: You get personalized feedback from your instructor on every essay draft. You also get peer feedback for some of your drafts during the workshops that happen for every essay unit. The readings are short essays and do not take very long to complete compared to readings for many other classes. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it took a little while for draft comments to get back to us, but thats also because the professor has to do them for everyone in the class so it makes sense that they werent always done right away.",
                "This course is very strong overall.  I think in-class discussions could have been stronger, as I found our discussions to be pretty quiet.",
                "The course format encourages students to get to know each other. The short readings also provide a nice contrast with other courses at Yale."

                "Yes I would recommend assuming that they are already quite interested in writing. I think it would be more of a struggle for someone who doesnt really specialise in that, but for someone who does it would be a really good course to take.",
                "If you are into English literature, definitely try it!",
                "Yes. Saraceni is an amazing professor. Shes very smart and very kind. Learning from her was incredible. I loved the works we read and produced in class.",
                "Absolutely. This course was my second favorite Ive ever taken at Yale. I gained so much confidence in my abilities as a writer, the readings are much lighter and more fun to read than other English classes in my experience, and you really bond with a lot of the people in the seminar. Overall, such a positive experience taking this course. I would look forward to it and get something out of class every time we met.",
                "Yes.  I think this course explores a genre of writing that is largely unexplored in high school curriculums.  It was really exciting to be able to figure out how to write creative non-fiction.  I think I am a more observant and present human being because of this course as well.  And I am always thinking of experiences and people as English 120 essay topics now!",
                "Yes! I'm a STEM student, so I was worried about taking this class, but I really enjoyed reading and analyzing great pieces of writing. The workload can be a bit overwhelming at times if you're a slow writer (like me), but the process is very rewarding.",
                "Absolutely. ENGL 120 is a really unique course, and its structure makes it easily enjoyable. If you enjoy writing about yourself and the world around you it would be a great fit."
