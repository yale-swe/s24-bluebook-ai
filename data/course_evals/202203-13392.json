                "Korean films and some cool insights from the readings",
                "I learned how to closely analyze films, especially in their historical context, and knowledge about famous Korean directors. I also thought that the course provided a thorough review of Korean national history.",
                "I learned about the development Korean cinema through the lens of South Korean history as well as film history as a whole.",

                "This course was such a unique but engaging one. We learned about how to connect films to their historical contexts, as well as analyze their hidden social messages and symbolism. While I have watched several of the films before, this class offered so many different perspectives on them. I also learned how to read supplemental material for important information and manage my time, as well as write in-depth analyses.",
                "a general look at korean history as it relates to korean film",

                "This couse taught me so much in terms of film studies and the history of Korea post-colonization, and gave me a perspective that I really appreciated. It taught me to analyze films critically, draw connections between different themes/figures, and understand the broader impacts of films on determining social dynamics.",

This was further enriched by widely available and well-selected supplementary readings and a great repertoire of Korean films. I came away with a comprehensive and intuitive understanding of Korean cinema and various theoretical and personal lenses to view media in the future."

            "comments": [
                "I think lectures could maybe have more context when introducing theory, and that the movies could be connected to the week's themes more; but, that's really it! It was such an amazing class.",
                "The strengths were that this class allowed a lot of discussion amongst students. Students were meant to cooperate with one another and contest different opinions they had about films, which made it much more easier and less daunting to talk in class. \r\n\r\nAlthough the film is considered an advanced course, many students weren't film majors. As a result, sometimes it was hard to keep up with the high amount of information that our professor was telling us.",
                "Thee strengths of this course were the films we watched. I was introduced to a lot of enjoyable films that I wouldn't have been familiar with otherwise. The one day lecture/one day discussion format did make the class feel kind of disjointed at times.",
                "Strengths: content\r\nWeaknesses: messy Powerpoints, unclear discussion prompts",
                "It was great to have one lecture of the week be a \"listen and learn\" kind of class and the other lecture of the week be a \"get together and discuss\" kind of class.",
                "Strengths - you get to be exposed to the world of Korean cinema and consequently learn and absorb historical/political material about the country as well.",
                "Discussion-based sections were usually productive, I enjoyed the selection of films. On certain weeks it was hard to relate to content of the readings to what we were looking at in class. Not much film analysis, more based on the cultural context of a film.",
                "One of the strengths of this course was that it let us direct many of the discussions and our level of engagement. Rather than give us a single way to analyze the films, the professor let us take over and explain what we took out of them. I also love how the structure of the course contained both lecture and class discussions; it helped us effectively engage with the material while still get a professional perspective. The only improvement I might suggest is finding a way to make more students engaged in the discussions; it sometimes felt that only a few people would speak repeatedly.",
                "strengths - movie selection was good and the discussions were great\r\nweaknesses - disorganized lectures",
                "Strengths: very low workload and interesting movies. I also enjoyed the discussions \r\nWeakenesses: The discussions could sometimes drag if no one was willing to speak which wasnt usually the case but sometimes no one wanted to speak",
                "I enjoyed the work for this course very much, which consisted of about 1 movie per week with 1-2 required readings. I thought that the class discussions were interesting, but could benefit from being a little more structured (I think the fact that the class was also held in a lecture hall affected our ability to discuss effectively.) I also appreciated the flexibility the instructors had in terms of the due dates for smaller writing assignments, as they allowed us to put more thought into them.",
                "As one of the few Korean film/literature classes offered, this class hold great importance to the students. I guess a critique would be to the broader Korean and EALL department, where this class shouldn't be the only class that offers students a chance to engage critically with Korean media. It places an unfair amount of pressure to the class. Further, while there are genuine critiques with the class, students must \"bear\" with it or not be able to take a class on Korean films. This course, while academically exciting, was, at times, poorly organized. It was especially unclear at first when memorandums were due and I think policies on what kind of readings we were allowed to engage with and the way memorandums were graded were also extremely unclear. Further, some of the content in lectures were relevant to the optional reading material which was confusing. Also, while the connections between the readings and the films were spectacular and so interesting, the concepts in the readings were at times poorly explained. I think Professor Li could do a better job slowing down the pace of lectures and making sure that people understand the terminology that she is using. It was frustrating sometimes because the T/As also didn't know how to explain the readings. However, I understand that this was Professor Li's first class at Yale and again, I think the role her class plays to students is unfairly large because of its singularity.",
                "I appreciated the balance between lecture and class discussions, and enjoyed seeing the classes' final projects at the end of the course. I also appreciated the feedback on the memoranda papers. The readings were interesting but did not always closely connect to the film for the week which sometimes made choosing that week to write a memoranda about difficult. I appreciated the reduction in reading workload, I think the final amount of reading was reasonable and overall helpful and thought-provoking. It would be great in future courses to explore not just representations of women in Korean film, but also examples of female-directed Korean movies.",
                "A really strong and well-formatted course, lectures were quite information-dense, but well delivered and interesting, and group discussions were often very insightful and lively. The readings and overall course content were very well selected and built on one another, providing both breadth and depth into Korean cinema. The assesments and assignments felt balanced and the TAs and professors were accommodating."

                "As an econ major, film studies is outside my toolbox, however, I enjoyed attending lectures and learning about film but also korean history. It was an experience branching out of my norm course work.",
                "YES YES YES A THOUSAND TIMES YES! This class is so fun and so thought-provoking. Even if you aren't a film major, you will have such an amazing time because the class is just that amazing!",
                "I would recommend this class if you are interested I taking a film class for a more historical perspective or are curious about Korean film. I wouldn't recommend this class if you are looking for an easy film credit.",
                "Admittedly, I was not expecting a course in Global Korean cinema to take this much time. There are weekly movies (plus short reflection), 4 memoranda, readings, midterm, project, and final and it really adds up. Also, the discussions can get really theoretical (i.e. linking Parasite to ideas of heterotopia by Foucault) and dense for people (like me) who don't have this sort of background. It's definitely fun if you're a movie buff, but be ready to put in some work!",
                "Yes - Korean cinema is great",
                "Yes! The course is a great overview of Korean film AND Korean history. You'll learn film analysis, and you'll also learn about Korean national history (which is wonderful because the two fields are quite tied together). You don't have to know Korean or Korean history or film to enjoy the course :)",
                "Not really. We watched a lot of really interesting films throughout the class but I don't feel like I really learned anything of substance throughout the semester.",
                "Yes. Such an amazing course with a very thoughtful and engaging professor. If you love movies, this class is definitely one you should take.",
                "I would recommend it if they were excited about at least two of the movies/themes in the syllabus and enjoy academic readings. Most of our class time is related to the readings, not watching clips or discussing the general plot of a movie.",
                "Yes! For anyone who is interested in delving into another culture, this course provides a wonderful path to do that. Even for students that have never taken a class in Korean culture or film studies, this class lets you decide what spin you want to take on the material. If you want to look at the music choices, you can do that! If you want to learn about Korean history, do that! I personally learned a lot more from taking this class.",
                "Yes! It's very interesting",
                "Yes it has been super fun and I really love Korean culture/kdramas so this was a cool way to learn more about it",
                "I think its tricky. We watched a lot of cool films but the analysis that we were encouraged to do with them didnt feel substantive. I found myself wanting to do different things with the course that i wasnt able to.",
                "I think it's a good choice if you're a film major or want to learn about Korean history together with film.",
                "Yes! This was a great course for anyone wanting to gain a crash course on the history of Korea in the 20th and 21st centuries. The class covers some of the most iconic films from this era, and you will be able to discuss some key themes that continue to effect Korean/Korean diaspora today.",
                "Again, the department needs to offer more alternatives to students. I would recommend this course to another student because it was academically enriching and interesting but it also feels as if I have no choice but to recommend this class, as it is the only one to engage Korean media.",
                "Yes, especially if you are interested in Korea and Korean history. It is a great opportunity to learn more about film if you are coming from a non-film background, or for learning more about Korean culture and history if you are unfamiliar coming into the course. I am not a film major but I really enjoyed learning about different aspects through which to analyze movies, and the course did not require extensive knowledge of things like specific filming techniques.",
                "The course is great for anyone who wants a comprehensive perspective on Korean cinema or the evolution of global cinema genres, and is relatively friendly to those with no experience in Korean cinema."
