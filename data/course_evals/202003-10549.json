I started to get over the fear of making mistakes, and it's something I am extremely grateful to have improved upon.",

                "The course is largely conversation: talking about readings or podcasts or movies. I think this made us all more comfortable being spontaneous with the language. Sometimes I wished we spent more time in a more lecture-style format to review some more difficult grammar because when it was largely up to me, I didn't understand it as well.",
                "I really liked the structure of the syllabus because we got to cover a lot of grammatical materials.",
                "Strengths: It was very interactive and engaging, with high participation from all the students. There were multiple forms of media that we learned through (books, podcasts, art, music, etc). The professor was also so amazing, patient, and empathetic to our struggles. She genuinely cared about each of us and our well being in her class. \r\nWeaknesses: This isn't really a weakness but tips on improving the skills we practiced would've been beneficial. For example, tips to read better, how to listening to native speakers with understanding, sentence syntax, how to not translate when speaking, etc.",
                "The strengths include engaging content and interesting real world and current media to investigate and topics of discussion. A weakness may be a lack of clarity at times where additional information on certain grammar concepts could be found. I'm sure the resources were there but I wasn't always clear on what they were or how in depth I should know certain topics.",
                "Solid course for developing fluency in Spanish. Most of the grammar that is covered is review, so the course moves quite fast, but the work is quite manageable."

                "I think this class was my most outstanding online. We had such a small group that it was intimate and easy to learn and grow together. I felt like I got to know the people in my class well along with my professor. We went into breakout rooms, we listened to music, we talked about everything we read. I really loved it.",
                "The break out room discussions were very helpful in this course and I enjoyed speaking in Spanish with my peers.",
                "It was beneficial that we all had our cameras on and were forced to engage, which is harder to do on zoom. Asynchronous days were not the best for engagement but I did appreciate that it gave me more time to sleep in and time manage more independently. Maybe having a small daily skill improvement assignment, like a podcast or video, with a speaking assignment to make sure we could practice every day.",
                "I thought that the virtual Zoom classes were pretty effective. I think there could be improvement with the organization of resources on Canvas.",
                "The mix of synchronous and asynchronous courses helped greatly with Zoom fatigue, but I also found that I was not consistently interacting with Spanish on the asynchronous days. The zoom breakout rooms were effective at promoting conversation in Spanish between students, but it does not compare to an in-person Spanish experience. I disliked the online format of the exams through Canvas."

It's not necessarily the most interesting course, but definitely serves its purpose of improving Spanish language skills and helps with the transition from high school Spanish to being more comfortable with taking Spanish at Yale.",
