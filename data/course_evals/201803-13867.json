    "This class was extremely boring and bland. It taught about the \"world circa 1800\" but ranged from the early 1700s to 1900s. The teaching was extremely unorganized and difficult to follow. I took this class because I needed an easy humanities credit, and although the workload was extremely small, it was difficult to understand any of the information. I never skip classes, but I didn't go to this class for 4 weeks straight because you physically can't pay attention when you go because it is so boring.",
    "By taking this course, I learned a lot about the global divisions and connections that existed circa the year 1800. It was interesting to see how the world was becoming simultaneously more connected and divided for various reasons.",
    "Good overview about the World around 1800. Talked about revolution, trade, slavery among others.",
    "This is a good survey course of what was going on in the world during 1800. It exposed me to the basic events and ideas of the world during that time -- the enlightenment, the atlantic revolutions, the triangle trade.",
    "I really enjoyed this course because we got to explore the world on a global scale circa 1800.",
    "The ability to draw connections across a variety of different places, events, and people.",
    "I learned how to approach nineteenth century history in a global perspective. I also learned how to analyze primary sources along with secondary sources. I also was introduced to the Great Divergence, Malthus, and countless other insights about the World circa 1800",
    "I learned to look for unexpected connections",
    "Writing, reading",
    "I learned how the world was connected circa 1800 and how I can apply this to the world today."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: if you want an easy humanities\/history class, this is easy. The work load is super light and the TFs are extremely helpful\r\nWeakness: one of the most boring lectures I've sat through, poorly organized, not really \"circa 1800\"",
    "I liked the curriculum but sometimes you found yourself lost in lecture. I feel as though there should have been more words on the slides.",
    "Lectures seemed a bit random - covered a lot of topics ranging from volcanic explosions to global wars.",
    "It was a bit too broad and often the themes did not seem to fit. But it is very hard to bring together a world history class. Maybe focus on a specific theme of the world circa 1800.",
    "Very brief overview. Incredibly slow lectures and lack of lecture slides that leaves students wondering what should be emphasized.",
    "Because this is a survey course, it covers so much material in a very constrained time period. So it's easy to fail to see how each of the topics are related to or connected to one another. I wish that Professor Semmel had done a better job of making connections between each lecture and making the objectives of each lecture very clear.",
    "Perhaps this is just a byproduct of the class being global history, but the main focuses were largely thematic, and it seemed that a lot of information was left out of this course simply because the subject was too broad. But the course did give a good taste of many regions in history, so it's a good intro class.",
    "I honestly learned a lot more from section than I did lectures.",
    "Sometimes, lecture would try to cover too many years at a time. Others, it was hard to determine what the theme and relevant points were. On the other hand, course assignments were very well explained and exams were fair with review sessions and a list of terms to focus on.",
    "Strengths: Interesting primary sources\r\nWeaknesses: Some secondary sources were a bit dense",
    "A strength of this course is its valiant attempt at covering the globe at a given period of time, creating a very interconnected view of history. I found, however, that the jumps were at times quite confusing, and when we discussed topics and events our discussions often lacked depth. I would recommend dividing the course up into main topics and picking an example or two of each of the phenomenons. Extensive lists of things like miles of railroads sometimes took away from the more complex flow of ideas that would require more time and careful discussion.",
    "Strength was the sections as they helped us gain a clearer understanding of the material",
    "The course was a good survey of global history, but it felt disorganized at times. The course could be improved by approaching it either chronologically or geographically, or perhaps even thematically. The course jumped back and forth in time, location, and theme without settling on one particular approach. This made it hard to follow.",
    "the room we were in caused lots of tech. difficulties that made lecture hard to follow.",
    "Strengths-great TFs, loved the sections\r\nWeakness-boring lecturer, disorganized",
    "Strengths: the material was SO so interesting! The syllabus is so well-curated and the readings are short (about 40-60 pages a week I would say) but impactful. The fact that most were primary sources was awesome. Section allowed us to do some of the in-depth, close-reading which made the lecture feel more like a seminar. \r\nWeaknesses: Lecture was admittedly not well-organized. The slides were pretty sparse which made studying incredibly difficult, especially because we focused so much on overarching themes and less on specific events, but the study guide we were given for IDs were incredibly specific. Also, Professor Semmel often lectured seemingly without a clear outline and the specifics mentioned sometimes felt like they were unrelated to the overall theme of the lecture for that day. Would appreciate more of an outline in the beginning of class regarding what will be discussed in the lecture and more populated slides in general.",
    "The course was good, but I think it could be maybe more chronological. It was tough to understand when things were happening sometimes. I really enjoyed the way each topic connected at the end, however."

   "comments": [
    "If you want an easy history\/humanities then yes. But if you're looking for a super engaging course that is really interesting, no.",
    "Yes. This was a great course to take as a non history major who wants to be more informed of world events in a broad sense.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The sections each week were very helpful for smaller discussions. Overall, the material we learned was interesting and engaging.",
    "It was a great history class for a non-history major. the workload was manageable and it was a good overview of the world during this time period.",
    "If you are looking for a gut, then yes.",
    "If you are interested in learning about the world circa 1800, or are interested in taking a global history course that is not too challenging, then certainly take this course, or one of the course in the \"world circa...\" series. The workload is very light, with minimal readings, and the concepts are interesting.",
    "I would recommend this as a fifth class: workload is very low, section attendance covers everything important, there are few assignments. Overall this is a good introductory class, though the teaching can be dry at times. Professor Semmel really shines in his lectures on Europe, but the class brought in some phenomenal guest lecturers to cover subjects with which Semmel was less familiar: this acts as a way to experience other professors to see if you might want to take their class, which is cool.",
    "Yes, I enjoyed the assignments that the class offered and thought it was all reasonable.",
    "This was a great overview of world history c. 1800 exploring each continent as equally as possible. Some of the readings were a little redundant but others, like the primary sources were really interesting.",
    "Yes, Professor Semmel does a good job of introducing students to the topic of global history.",
    "If you are considering the global track in the History major, this course is a good introduction. If not, I wouldn't recommend the course.",
    "Yes. The material was interesting and the course was set up well.",
    "yes because it is a manageable and interesting history credit",
    "Yes but its a little boring",
    "No",
    "Personally, I loved this class. It's definitely a survey course focusing specifically on the emergence and nature of global history so don't expect a lot of in-depth information about specifics. With that said, the general themes we did cover were so, SO interesting. I think the greatest strength of the material is that the 1800s were such an impactful time for the globe that any information you can glean from the lectures and the readings are bound to be applicable to other classes. I literally used some of the readings for this class in at least two of my other classes-- that's how good the syllabus was. The syllabus is so well-curated and the readings are short (about 40-60 pages a week I would say) but impactful. The fact that most were primary sources was awesome, and made it feel like I was actually practicing history as opposed to just studying it. Be forewarned, the lecture itself was very disorganized which a lot of people used as an excuse to just not show up after like the third week which is why you're probably gonna read a lot of mixed\/negative reviews for the course. But anyone who complains about not being prepared enough for the exam or not doing well on the papers only have themselves to blame because both TA's were stellar in supporting anyone who came to them for help or questions, and Professor Semmel was a good lecturer, despite the general disorganized structure of the class.",
    "Yes. The class is reasonable in work load and pretty interesting if you take it seriously. I really loved writing the papers."
