                "This course offers a phenomenal introduction to Biblical Hebrew. The homework assignments from the textbook were well-chosen and offer good practice in preparation for exams. It was helpful to have a quiz due before the next class to check understanding (with low stakes P/F grading). It was also helpful to  read the chapter ahead of class to gain some advance familiarity with the material to be covered. The class environment was also welcoming and fun!",
                "This course was advertised as an introductory course but in reality, operating at an incredibly high-level way expected coming into the class including previous knowledge and command of complex grammatical principles and language structures. The course relied almost entirely on a textbook which was very boring and hard to engage with. Additionally, the exams in this course poorly reflected the knowledge and skills learned during the class as all homework problems and practices provided context to questions that were not included in exams. Finally, this clas worked to give students a deep grammatical understanding of the language that would be useful in academia or in writing grammar books but failed to teach or prioritize the practical application of the language.",
                "This was overall a very well-organized course. Expectations were made very clear, we received a very explicit list of topics to review before every test, and each new topic was generally given sufficient time for study. It definitely feels very fast-paced and requires a lot of independent study in order to keep up, but I don't think there's any way around that. Emilie also did a great job of adapting the pace when necessary so that we had sufficient time to explore all topics, as well as taking student feedback on what subjects we needed further review on."

                "I'd definitely recommend this course to someone interested in learning biblical Hebrew. Just know exactly what it is that you'll be learning: the ability to passively read biblical Hebrew with vowel markings. I feel like I've made a remarkable amount of progress in just one semester and as someone who's really dedicated to the material I cannot recommend the class highly enough to other interested students."
