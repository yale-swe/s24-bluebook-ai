                "Too much of a focus on literature/philosophy. I wanted more of a balance between literature and history. Professor also liked to cold call students which most people didn't like. Most of the readings felt too long which dissuaded me from doing them\r\n\r\nTAs were great, the material felt beginner-friendly, and the selected readings were genuinely interesting",
                "This course is very much a \"you get what you put in\" type situation. There were only three projects (5-7 pages essays for WR sections) throughout the semester, 2 15-minute asynchronous lectures per week, and less than 100 pgs of reading per week. In my opinion, this made the class less stressful, but I still felt like I got a lot out of it. Because we got to choose our own passages to analyze for the projects, the readings technically weren't cumulative, but you have to do them for lecture to make any sense. And lectures are engaging, so that's definitely an inventive. Prof T likes to use PollEv to make lectures more interactive. She definitely has a sense of humor which was infectious throughout the class! The only thing I didn't enjoy was probably the cold calling in lecture at the end of the semester (by our canvas numbers). I kind of felt like I was playing a twisted version of bingo twice a week, but at the same time it was kind of funny.",
                "Strengths: encourages engagement, interesting reading material, good lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: leaves out what happened to the Chinese tradition after the early 20th century",
                "Strength: Very interesting course, presents material in an engaging manner, manageable readings + videos",

                "The asynchronous and synchronous lectures were very engaging. Prof T. seemed to care a lot about her students and was very understanding. I think the assignments were sometimes unclear, and felt that sometimes we weren't equipped with the skills to do the papers/assignments. In class, we really focused on historical context, but we couldn't/shouldn't do that for the papers. I felt there was a disconnect in that regard.",

                "I think the course was well organized, but sometimes the readings would be very long and sometimes theyd be very short.",

I also wish the last writing assignment wasn't changed from the previous two.

                "I think that the course could be structured with a bit more focus because I feel like we jumped from era to era without really addressing much of the in-between, making the class feel more like a 'greatest hits' compilation than a true overview.",
                "This was my favorite class I've taken at Yale. It does a very good job at following the Chinese intellectual tradition from the beginning of Chinese history all the way until the May 4th movement. Very good intro to big idea. Prof T is passionate and knowledgeable and will surely make you interested in the subject.",

                "Strengths: Great flexibility with project assignments (if in humanities section), no exams and little homework assignments, passionate prof and TAs\r\nWeaknesses: hard to follow at times especially as someone who is used to psets and streamlined learning",
                "Prof T is an engaging lecturer, and the TFs were all excellent. The workload was relatively light and the texts we read were interesting. I liked the in person format of breakout rooms and enjoyed the asynchronous lectures.",
                "I think Prof. T does a great job with lectures and encouraging participation through her \"breakout rooms\", which basically means discussing a prompt every class with the students around you. The readings were also not too long, which made it more enjoyable to do the homework. Overall, the workload is pretty light, but this class can still be intellectually rewarding with the right topics. I love that Prof. T removed examinations from this course as well, making it easier for us to focus on the texts. In terms of weaknesses, I think the writing section could have generally been a bit more organized at times, but I still really enjoyed my TA.",
                "The course is well-organized and insanely interesting! Prof T is amazing and is very passionate about the subject, which made me super enthusiastic about the content. The TAs were also great, the discussion sections were always fun and engaging and I never felt lost when writing assignments. No weaknesses, fantastic course.",
                "Strengths: Prof Lu is amazing, extremely knowledgeable, and make the extremely vast topic approachable and interesting ;; Weaknesses: I wouldn't say that there were any of this course, but I would recommend against taking it if you're not prepared to participate in class. Prof Lu tries really hard to make the coursework extremely manageable and light, but a lot of people clearly did not do the readings, and it showed in overall lack of class general discussion, which was sad since I would've loved to hear more people's thoughts.",
                "Strengths: I think the course is very well organized. You will always know what readings were assigned and when the assignments were due. Professor Lu is really passionate about her teaching and always open to talking. \r\nWeaknesses: This class can have a lot of readings at times and if you get busy and fall behind, it can get really hard to catch up.",
                "Strengths: the professor - super chill and funny, the material - very interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: teaching skills pertaining to the writing assignments specifically (maybe in section) so students know how to approach them.",
                "The strengths of the course are the material and history we learned. It could be improved by less in-class 'group discussion time and more listening to Prof. T.",
                "I was overall very pleased with the course, the strength I believe in our ability to express whatever we thought about the text. One way the course could be improved is perhaps in particular with the writing section, as I felt it could have been more useful to have writing workshops rather than just more discussion about the text.",
                "strengths- very cool subject\r\nweaknesses- sometimes didn't feel as though there was a lot of direction or structure as to how to do projects",
                "I felt like the course content was incredibly interesting. The readings chosen to go along with the course were also incredibly compelling and well-curated. The main weakness would be that the course should have emphasized the connections between different time periods and eras earlier on, rather than talking about those connections later on--right before the projects were due.",
                "I loved the lectures by Prof T, she loves this subject and the passion she has really shows during class. I also liked the emphasis being more on close-reading and analysis rather than on memorizing dates and events, though they are important to see progression and changes over time. Liu Laoshi who taught the Chinese section is truly incredible: she is so kind, understanding, and willing to help with anything at all. She does an amazing job making sure everyone in the section is engaged and has a chance to talk about their views and analysis. She is also very knowledgeable about the topics and expresses them with such high degree of clarity and accuracy in Chinese which I find fascinating since oftentimes I struggle with finding the right words or phrases to properly convey what I want to say.",
                "Good breakout rooms, section activities, lectures",
                "I enjoyed the recorded lectures online that we could watch before class, and also lectures of the class were recorded, which was helpful. We had super fun field trips to the art museum and Beinecke. The biggest con was a lack of clear feedback about the projects.",
                "Tina Lu is a wonderful, knowledgeable, and compassionate instructor who truly does all she can to ensure the class is as fun and educational as possible. I always looked forward to this class and my section for it. It's taught very well and in a way in which it's not required you memorize every little thing in this class - rather, you take from it the key insights and skills that Prof. Lu wants you to know (like, reading a text to understand why and how someone conveys their thoughts in that way). Readings were relevant, a decent amount, but you didn't have to read them to follow along in class. Weaknesses: location (Bass Center is a trek), large class size, not getting the slides after class.",
                "It was low stress, but I think the prompts for projects were very vague.",
                "Strength: really great lecturing, interesting and diverse pick of course materials, and well organized. \r\nWeaknesses: the assignments instructions should have been more clear in what Prof T. wants from her students. It's very vague and academic, and not particularly easily accessible for first-years.",
                "Professor was very enthusiastic about the material, and the material was very interesting. Discussion was promoted and the course was very engaging. Prof T always made sure the lectures were always fun and tried to frame everything as we might understand them in a 21st century lens, which definitely helped engagement"

                "It depends. The lecture content was very interesting. At the start of the semester, readings are also pretty short and manageable, although they do increase as the semester goes on. However, lecture attendance is required, and attendance is taken, so be prepared for that if you are planning on taking this class. The professor also implemented a cold calling system partway through the semester which added a lot of unnecessary stress to the class. If you take the writing section, be prepared to struggle a lot with the writing assignments. The prompts for the writing assignments are very difficult since you are required to write so much about such short passages (one of the assignments was a 5-7 page paper based on a close reading of about 20-40 words). Grading can also feel a bit arbitrary.",
                "Yes, this is a great class if youre interested in getting an intro to Chinese history & ancient texts",
                "Yes. It is a great introduction to premodern Chinese thought and not too intensive of a writing credit.",
                "YES!!! I could not recommend a course more strongly. This is my favorite class I've taken at Yale and it will introduce you to an entirely new cannon.",
                "Yes, this is a great overview course of the Chinese Tradition. It is not a super demanding class so this is great for someone who's looking to learn more about this topic if they have a heavy course load. It is one of those 'you get out what you put into it' classes so definitely create incentives for yourself to be engaged or you can easily get nothing out of this course.",
                "Yes!!! Prof. T is lovely, but it's not a gut by any means, especially for the writing sections",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! If you're looking to have a broader view of Chinese history through texts and classical documents, it's a great first course to get an overview!",
                "Yes, I think this class has a lot to offer in terms of enriching your knowledge on pre-modern China. Prof T and the TFs put in a lot of effort to make the class engaging and interesting, and there is a large focus on learning and analyzing rather than memorizing random facts. The workload is very manageable and the content is interesting.",
                "Yeah! I would recommend this course to people who want a course that can be interesting with a light workload. Especially if you're Chinese-American, I think this course can really be engaging at certain points and teach you a lot about Chinese culture that you wouldn't get otherwise.",
                "Yes. Do it. One of the best classes I took at Yale. The selection of texts was great, the lectures were fascinating and the assignments were relatively low-stress but very engaging. I also genuinely feel that this course made me a better reader and changed the way I think about historical texts. It's quite gutty if you are a good writer or have a background in the humanities, but Prof T is a fantastic lecturer and it you get a lot out of the course if you put in the work. Can't recommend enough, as a Wr or Hu credit or when you just need a good class - it was a breath of fresh air during an otherwise stressful semester fulfilling other various requirements for my major.",
                "Yes, absolutely! Took this along with my Chinese language class and it was a wonderful supplement to the course, by delving into history, philosophy, and culture.",
                "Yes! If you're looking for an introduction to EAST/EALL or just want to know more about the Chinese academic canon (ie. Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism, etc.), this is a great class to introduce yourself to various Chinese thinkers within those fields.",
                "Yes, for sure. If youre for a fifth credit, or a HU credit, Id highly recommend. It really dismantles any prejudices you might have against China and at least understand where they stem from.",
                "The class was pretty good; the assignments were three papers + mini-responses, so workload-wise not too bad. This is a class where you get out what you put in.",
                "Yep of course! Be sure that you are genuinely interested in the Chinese Tradition!",
                "yes, if you are very interested in Chinese philosophy. if you are looking for a history class about more recent events, this is not the class for you. we covered philosopher, dynasties, etc.",
                "I would for sure recommend the course to other students--no matter their major. The course content is incredibly compelling, and if you are looking for a writing or humanities credit, this class is a great place to get one.",
                "Yes! absolutely!!! It is an amazing course to take even if you are not a humanities major and I highly recommend that anyone who has even an inkling of curiosity about Chinese culture and tradition take it. Prof T is a great lecturer and the section professors are also very knowledgeable and there to support you. The workload isn't too bad, just a pre-lecture video that introduces the concepts and some readings that you prepare and think about for class. APart from that, there are some very chill short and quick activities every 2 weeks or so, but the main portion of your grade comes from the 3 projects done over the semester.",
                "Yes if interested about Chinese culture. The class is fast paced and covers a lot.",
                "Absolutely! I am not an EALL major, nor will I take any more EALL classes, but I truly believe I learned so so much from this class, even if I don't remember all of the facts along the way. I think this was a great class to get a good sense of what the humanities are like. It's so interdisciplinary, and you can take a lot out of it, especially if you aren't as familiar with Chinese history, culture, and philosophy. It's a very chill class (Hu, not Wr) and honestly just super cool.",
                "It was a good extra class. you gain how much you put into the class. The content is engaging, but its hard to stay engaged throughout the semester.",
                "Yes! I was able to engage with the texts in a closer view than I had ever before  this course focused so much on getting deeply into the writing and analysis, in a way that challenged me because I have always written with a more overarching focus. I really did enjoy learning about the different artistic mediums, such as Tang Poetry or calligraphy that was part of the intellectual tradition, rather than just philosophical texts.",
                "Yes - fun course, interesting course material, enthusiastic professor"
