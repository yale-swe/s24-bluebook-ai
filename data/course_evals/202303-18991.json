                "Strengths: The class has a reasonable workload, with three major lab reports, handouts, and very straightforward quizzes. The class prioritizes productive work, not busy work, which I really appreciate. Professor Hartman is also very responsive, and genuinely prioritizes student engagement and learning. Also, Professor Hartman's mini-lectures at the beginning of each class were VERY helpful and well-delivered. A three hour lab is also just right, and we ended early on more than a few occasions. \r\nWeaknesses: Not really a weakness per se, but one point of frustration at times was that lab report grades would be released on a Friday/Saturday, and students in the Monday section had only the weekend to incorporate feedback from the previous lab report into a new lab report, while students on Wednesday sections had more time to do so. I would much rather all lab reports are due on one day to provide all students with the same amount of time to complete the lab report.",
                "This course was taught and run super well. It was organized, and each experiment had very clear goals. I liked how the assignments were a mix of lab reports and worksheets.",
                "Strengths:\r\nThe course is well organized and the objective of each experiment/session is clear. Also, the experiments are fun and engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nNone",
                "Amaleah did a great job of relating it to the lecture and keeping it hands on and engaging",
                "Professor Hartman and the teaching fellows were the greatest strengths of this course. I have never been in a STEM classroom where I have felt so safe and heard.",
                "The course overall is enjoyable and lets you really engage with the material covered in the MCDB Genetics lecture. The strength of the course was definitely Dr.Hartman. She's extremely knowledgeable about the labwork and is quick to answer any questions/fix any issues that may be arising. The one weakness for me was the lack of structure with lab reports, but that's more due to the chem lab reports being far more structured. Also, I felt like the TA's didn't know how to help answer our questions most of the time.",

                "Strong in learning",
                "Prof. Hartman is great and some of the labs were pretty fun. I think that spending less time counting fly phenotypes and assigning shorter and more interesting lab reports would be great.",
                "I really loved this course! I think the strengths are really in how the course is organized and how clear the concepts are taught in the handouts and in class. I cannot think of ways it could be improved except for maybe more prompt feedback on lab reports.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. I felt like I got a good grasp on all of the material, the pre-lab packets were very thorough and helpful, and the actual labs were set up well to not be overwhelming but still be a good amount of work. It would be nice to be able to cover more material, which I think could be done if the labs themselves were made a bit longer (we got out over an hour early almost every week) or were simpler. Instead of covering four concepts in one lab with relatively unrelated experiments, we could cover one concept every other lab, and then labs wouldn't take four or five weeks to fully complete."

She gives debriefs at the beginning of each lab to make sure everyone understands both the concepts and the experiments before you start doing work, so you won't get confused by what you're doing. The assignments aren't difficult and the experiments are pretty cool. Low workload but still engaging.",
                "Yes! I think this is a great course to take for the MCDB lab requirement. It complements MCDB 202 very well, to the point where I actually felt that there was a pedagogical benefit to taking both courses in the same semester (something I am less likely to say about the orgo or physics lecture/lab sequences). It is a very low-stress environment with an emphasis on learning--a great course!",
                "Yes!  This course was really engaging!",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. I learned to work with different model organisms that I don't work with in my own research lab, and it really broadened my knowledge in research techniques. Furrthermore, it allowed me to apply genetics concepts to real benchwork!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any students interested in genetics or who just want to get some lab time with fun and interesting experiments.",
                "Absolutely, professor Hartman is amazing and the course is well organized and balanced. Great lab for MCDB requirements, incredibly relaxed.",
                "Yes! If someone is MCDB and need a lab I would strongly recommend this lab",
                "I would if Professor Hartman were teaching it.",
                "If you need a lab credit and enjoy genetics concepts, I think this lab is great. It is much more easygoing than chem lab, and Dr.Hartman is wonderful. The weeks we had lab reports due (of which we had 3 total) were hectic since the reports combined concepts covered over several labs and were dense. The quizzes were open-note and fair.",
                "Yes! Especially if the student is concurrently taking the MCDB 202 Genetics lecture course.",
                "Absolutely! It's a great overview of various genetic techniques without being too stressful or time-consuming. The labs did often take up the entire period and were somewhat challenging, but the workload of this course was very modest, yet I still feel like I gained a lot of knowledge from this course!",
                "This is a good lab option because it is interesting and not too much work. It is one of the only labs that actually feels like half a credit.",
                "Yes definitely! It is such an incredible class with an amazing professor where you learn so much but it never feels too stressful.",
                "Absolutely! If you need another MCDB lab course and have any interest in genetics, this is a great one. It's not super difficult, but still challenges you and makes sure that you learn. The workload isn't bad either, and your labs aren't entirely dependent on one particular thing going right like in other lab classes. I really enjoyed this class and am glad I took it."
