                "Ryan is a great instructor and facilitator! Strength is that you get to learn about many different traditions and have a group of ppl willing to discuss and share their thoughts. Weaknesses: there isnt a great flow in how the syllabus moves from one unit to the next.",
                "Strengths: Classes prioritize student insight into what makes their life worth living. Professors help facilitate an environment that is both encouraging and critical in articulating visions of the good life. Readings are manageable and interesting!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Weekly lectures felt a bit hit or miss at times.",
                "The strengths and weaknesses of this course will really be up to your section classmates and leader. I was really fortunate to have a fantastic group of students and Ryan was awesome. The discussions could sometimes become somewhat high-level, but usually, I got a lot out of seminar time.",
                "strengths: incredibly interesting readings and discussions. Prof Ryan was also amazing. And the retreat too. \r\nweaknesses: grading was actually kind of harsh. It felt very constraining to be writing essays about how you think life should be lived and being criticized for not following a specific format \/ including certain points."

                "Yes, I would say the readings in this course are vital. They will help you appreciate different perspectives that you may have never come into contact with.",
                "YES! Please take it. Great class for senior spring. Take it with Ryan. Take a look at the book Life Worth Living: A Guide to What Matters Most, it basically has a short summary about the class material (but of course taking the class is a much richer experience). Also the retreat is a highlight! This class really builds a community.",

                "Definitely  it was the perfect class for a second-semester senior.",
                "ABSOLUTELY YES. Doesn't matter what age \/ major \/ belief system you are, this course will help you think through what you believe is important and literally just how you want to lead your life. You will examine so many different belief systems and parts of yourself. The workload is quite light, but I did all of the readings because they were so interesting. TAKE THIS COURSE."
