                "Strengths: very organized and structured course, which makes it very easy to understand what the teachers want from you and how to do well in class.\r\nWeakness: Because it is very organized, you can notice the following pattern: you are expected to finish one full unit, which includes two parts, from the book every week. However, some units are very hard to cover in 5 days because of the amount of vocabulary and grammar that they have. Other units are less heavy, and you could probably finish them in about 3 days. The workload is disproportionate from week to week, which is something that can be improved.",
                "Great instructor, well organized course, good course material: the dialogues and vocabulary learned were concrete to help us learn chinese that can is used in real world situations.",
                "I think the course is overall great. However, I do not think it is necessary to have us memorize our oral presentations. This is extremely time consuming, and I do not see the benefit of simply memorizing sentences. Instead I think it would be beneficial if we were allowed to read them written as characters. That way we would still have to learn\/memorize all the tones and we would have practice speaking.",
                "This class requires extremely high engagement with the material in order to keep up, so you really improve your language skills.",
                "I think the everyday part was helpful for learning, wish we did some more fun activities though. Shen Laoshi was fantastic! Ive had her for two semesters and really think shes a great professor. Dictation did get a bit confusing at the end - was not sure of which characters to learn.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is Shen Laoshi's teaching. She is always full of energy when she teaches, and she loves sharing stories about her life to her students, but in a way that reinforces the grammatical structures and vocabulary in the chapter that we are learning for that week so that it feels like we are improving our listening comprehension skills while hearing a good story. She also is very perceptive when it comes to teaching; oftentimes, she will understand which areas of the grammar that students are struggling with, and focus on those more heavily. The class is also very organized, so it is always very clear what assignments are coming up and what are the instructions for these assignments.",
                "Strengths - textbook is excellent, as are the tutorial sessions\r\nWeaknesses- given the length of each class session, we rarely got to work on characters and vocab specifically"

Although the workload is heavy (you spend 2-3 hours on average every day studying Chinese), it is definitely worth trying.",
                "Yes, to anyone who is considering learning Chinese, take these courses at Yale because these courses are top level. You can actually learn the language, through the content that is related to the real world and will actually make you able to speak Chinese in the real world.",
