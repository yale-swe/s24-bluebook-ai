                "Strengths: Professor Bowern tried her best to make herself accessible and was generally open to feedback. It was also interesting to hear other people's final projects. Weaknesses (lots): class was poorly structured and focused a lot on the how rather than why what we were learning was important. As such, it was hard to focus in class or even show up. Professor Bowern seemed nervous when lecturing and it made things more difficult to understand. It was way too heavy on the technical side and she and the TA could have done a better job of helping us with code or making the assignments more directly related to what we were doing in class. The TA was also pretty unhelpful and not approachable.",
                "Strength is the course itself; weakness is its organization and difficulty curve. One idea: introduce stronger requirement of coding.",
                "strengths: interesting material, fascinating case studies\r\nweaknesses: we spent half of the semester on learning how to make phylogenetic trees of languages, which was a good skill, but I would have loved to delve into the other topics of the course deeper. I really enjoyed the last portion of the course on evolution of language in nonhuman primates and the piece on evolution of cognition. also, for some of the tree building\/ancestral state reconstruction assignments, the programs we were using were quite complicated and it took me a long time to understand them. also, guidelines for assignments were a little vague and I would have liked more instructions and expectations on what we were supposed to  complete.",
                "Maybe more guidance for the coding component of the class. The guidance was there, but it should be provided from the onset.",
                "For students that are beginners in coding or linguistics, this class was incredibly confusing and discussion sections did little to remedy this confusion. I felt that many of the assignments were not adequately explained and that the material taught in class did not give me a better understanding of how to complete the assignments.",
                "The lectures could definitely be improved to be more relevant to assignments. The in class experience felt disconnected from the content of the class.",
                "More historical material would improve the course, very oriented around running particular software applications",
                "The issue with this course is that it doesn't properly discuss the big ideas about language and culture nor does it properly teach you about the specific aspects of coding needed for linguistic research. It certainly attempts to do these things, and we were expected to do it in the homework, but I don't think I ever got much from the class on that front. In terms of big picture discussions, I think it would be a good idea to have a bit more structure, instead of the professor (who is super knowledgeable, but tends to get too specific) just talking, since we don't know enough to keep up with all the specific aspects of the field that she's talking about. A more involved class discussion with specific questions (and less rambling) I think would really help. Also, for the coding aspects, having an opportunity to follow a tutorial would be really helpful.",
                "Strengths: Independently pursued project-based course where you take ideas from class lectures and how to apply them using technical methods (good for students who enjoy independence and cumulating projects). General introduction to evolutionary thinking was useful. Mostly writing assignments with a handful of coding assignments. Flexibility with deadlines (e.g. 8 hours after midnight deadline, or pushed a week back when students were stressed). Final projects could be code-based or research-based depending on student's comfort\/interest.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Contrary to what the course description states, I would not recommend this course without comfortable skills in coding (R studio), as fairly intensive coding is essential for having anything to submit for some assignments. This proved to be a significant stressor for the class, as we were a diverse mix of linguistics\/evol bio\/stats\/social sci students with a varied level in coding experience. Quickly running through code in a 75-minute class at 9am was not helpful, nor were links to online software manuals via canvas. Readings were sometimes interesting but overall did not contribute much to class time; they were more for farming ideas for the final project. Optional sections had no agenda and were not helpful.",
                "This course manages to straddle the fields of linguistics, anthropology, sociology, and biological evolution beautifully."

                "No, I most certainly would not. I was taking it for a writing credit with an interesting topic, and although the workload wasn't unbearable, there are definitely much better classes out there. The class is way too technical and we spent the majority of class discussing methods rather than the evolution of language. And when it came to coding psets we were all lost since there was a) not enough (or any) discussion about coding in class and b) they had too high expectations of us even though the class assumed no prior coding background. It was difficult to focus, the readings didn't really align with what we were doing in class, and lectures were just not engaging. Sometimes the TA took off unnecessary points too. The most interesting part was the final project where we got to hear what other people were doing, not the class itself. So do not take this class - it was one of the worst classes I've taken at Yale.",
                "Yes assuming they were moderately familiar in R and were passionate about phylogenetic analysis.",
                "yes, but only if you are interested in linguistics\/anthropology\/evolution and it would probably be good if you have some prior knowledge of those fields.",
                "I would not recommend this course to anyone that is a beginner in linguistics. I would only recommend it to those who are more advanced in the subject than I am and have a basic understanding of coding in R Studio.",
                "Eh",
                "No I would not unless it improves a lot. the class is super disorganized and hard to follow.",
                "DO NOT take this class. I'd seen some mixed reviews, but decided that I would probably be fine because the syllabus said that students who've taken a linguistic class or know evolutionary biology would be fine. I took this class because I needed a WR and have background in that, but it didn't matter. This class was HIGHLY methods-based, and I think the original course description is false advertisement. We were told we didn't need to know how to code, but then a large part of the class was coding-based, and it was against normal policy to allow non-computational final projects. I didn't feel like we actually learned how to code, which was bad for doing the homework. Instead, we watched Bowern run some things on her computer and not explain what she was doing, so it wasn't transferrable to when we had to do the assignments ourselves. I've never taken any kind of CS or stats class, so if you have that to fall back on, maybe you'll be fine. I also could've paid more attention in class, but it wasn't engaging material or delivery. We were either watching Bowern run code or talk about something that didn't really tie back to anything we were doing. The qualitative questions mentioned on the syllabus were all addressed in week one or two, and the rest of the course became almost fully computational. After the mid semester feedback, where it was clear many people didn't like how computational it was, we switched back to more conceptual learning, but assignments had mostly moved on to final projects, so it didn't matter anymore. Finally, this class was not a seminar. I didn't care, but you should know it's built more like a lecture. I would never recommend a friend take this class.",
                "If you are experienced in R and are comfortable learning new softwares largely on your own, sure. Also have an idea early on of what you might like your final project to be (1 or 2 ideas), as you can tailor the assignments towards the final project. This is more of a research course than a lecture or survey course.",
                "Absolutely. Its cross-disciplinary nature should be very appealing to students of multifarious backgrounds."
