Even though American culture is a global phenomenon today, learning about its roots and its shaping literary works was a great insight. Underneath the pop culture, learning more about deeper and subtle topics of the culture helped me to comprehend my environment more rigorously.",
                "I learned about the origins of American Literature and improved my analytical writing skills.",
                "Most importantly, I learned how to write a real essay. Prof. Warner is very nice but he is also not going to lie to you. He will not let you get away with an essay that is not Yale-quality. I also learned a lot about many diverse and great American authors.",
                "I learned about critical pieces of the American canon, and different methods in which to interpret them. I also learned how to craft sophisticated essays, with nuanced analysis.",
                "An overview of some of the most important authors through American History and how to perform a close-reading of poems, short stories, and novels. Improved my confidence in my writing abilities."

                "Strengths: essays and feedback, diverse syllabus, great feedback on writing\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion between members of class was minimal. Not sure if this is a weakness since Professor Warner is so knowledgable. But speaking up in class always felt stilted. Also it was at 9am.",
                "well taught\r\nwell structured\r\nassessment structure makes sense and helps students build on knowledge and skills cumulatively",
                "No weakness.",
                "Strengths: the structure of the way Prof. Warner teaches this class in particular encourages engagement with the text, in class discussion, and his close attention to student writing and extensive feedback genuinely made me a better writer. \r\n\r\nWeekly writing responses forced me to think analytically about the text before coming to class and have an already-formulated point to contribute to discussion, which I thought was a great way to encourage engagement in the text. \r\n\r\nProf. Warner requires an office hours meeting after the first essay where he line-edits your essay with you and requires you submit a second version. It was incredible to get 90 minutes one-on-one time with such prestigious faculty teaching me how to be a better writer, to be forced to incorporate essay feedback, and my writing definitely improved as a result. It sounds intimidating but he is very kind!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of!",
                "I really appreciated the variety in the books and authors that we read.",
                "The class focuses a lot on black authors, which is a strength. It also isnt too much writing but it is efficient writing that will teach you. Sometimes, though, the reading was absurd. Like, nobody in the class was able to do it some weeks.",
                "The canon of books were quite interesting, and the one contemporary novel included was a nice touch. Additionally, the pacing was pretty good. I can't think of any weakness.",
                "The strengths were the class discussions as it was a great time to learn from your peers and Professor Warner does a great job of guiding discussion and implementing our reading responses into the discussion. The main weakness of the class, which is hard to remedy, is just how quickly we have to move through each work. However, a little restructuring could probably help feel like we're not just blowing through complex works. I wish we would've spent more time on books like Invisible Man."

Learning from so many different books, literary styles and topics related to American culture was an eye-opening experience. It provided a great insight to see and to learn the culture of this large country while nourishing my language skills to be more articulated. The learnings I had gained encouraged me as a person to be more proactive to understand my environment.",
                "Yes! Prof. Warner is really kind, and through his extensive feedback I became a much better writer and he also gave me helpful advice on my path in the English major as a whole. I really appreciated his choice in texts.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in American Literature. I learned a lot about different, important authors!",
                "I would. It is a great introduction to American Literature. Just be able to write a bit before you enroll.",
                "Yes, especially if they are looking to improve their writing skills. The readings and the classroom discussions work well to generate in-depth analysis. However, this does mean that a higher level of engagement and writing effort is needed.",
                "Yes. The course is definitely challenging (especially for non-English majors like me without much background in close reading and literary analysis essay writing) but it is worth it. There is many resources available to help, such as your professor and the Writing tutors. The weekly reading is manageable for the most part and you have a lot of freedom with your essays to write about topics that are actually interesting to you. The class discussions are really engaging and collaborative."
