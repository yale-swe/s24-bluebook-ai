    "I learned how to read more attentively and yet I still have work to do.  I learned how better to think and argue.  I learned to listen more intently. I learned how to write better.",
    "This class really provided a foundation for my other DS courses. I often found myself applying methods of argumentation and inquiry to texts outside the class. I really believe that it provides an essential conceptual basis for all writing and work in the humanities.",
    "I have learned how to critically analyze different ideas until they make sense. I have learned what are good questions to ask and which ones do not necessarily matter in order to understand the material.",
    "My ability to analyze, evaluate, restructure, and critique arguments has completely transformed this semester. Professor Charles gave us a lot of analytical tools through practical application that I never would have thought to use.",
    "I learned roughly how arguments are structured in philosophy. I learned how to evaluate arguments and productively critique them in essays. I also gained exposure to a variety of philosophers.",
    "I learned how to think and write through arguments. I thought I understood how to build an argument, and then we learned exactly how to deconstruct every step of every argument. I also better know how we base our beliefs, whether about piety or the soul or how we should treat others",
    "I developed greater critical analysis skills, particularly with examining arguments.",
    "Aristotles ideas",
    "Critical thinking and basic foundation in philosophy.",
    "How to take my thinking one step further, ask more questions, draw connections.",
    "It provides a solid foundation for philosophy or humanities studies in general."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths were the climate created by Professor Charles.  We had to discuss some difficult things to understand and some very heavy topics.  He directed the seminar in genius fashion.\r\n\r\nWeakness'?  I think we should have a \"Directed Studies Textbook\" for each of the three areas in Directed Studies. The various books and PDF's were difficult to keep track of and organize.",
    "The strengths are just the quality of the texts and the quality and proximity of the amazing professors. One weakness for me for all of DS is that there is a point at which the reading load is so great that it begins to limit itself (sort of a point of limited returns) because the assignments feel impossible. If a teacher is going to focus on 20% of the reading in class, then I feel like that should be communicated to students, so that, even though students have the option to read everything, those specific portions are studied in depth. I think this would improve the level of engagement in seminar discussions.",
    "The course gave us a pretty good foundation in Plato and Aristotle--but once we progressed from that point, it felt like our engagement grew more superficial. I know that this probably was a result of just not having a lot of time to go over material, but it felt like a significant change in our discussions and learning. On the other hand, overall our discussions were amazing and elucidating. They perfectly supplemented the weekly lectures.",
    "Professor Charles is amazing and knows exactly how to respond to our questions. There were no weaknesses, only strengths!",
    "This class does a great job of providing an introduction to early western philosophy. I think the readings are great, but some of the course (Stoics and Epicureans) felt rushed. We spent a month on Aristotle and half a week on the Stoics. Towards the end of the course, the pacing felt more rushed.",
    "The course tries to cover a massive syllabus in a short period of time and it is hard to have time to absorb the knowledge and fully understand things at such a quick pace.",
    "I want to get better at writing philosophical papers.",
    "Strength: it covers philosophers from Plato and Aristotle to Augustine and Aquinas. I improved my critical thinking skills throughout various discussions.\r\nWeakness: a bit too fast and tries to cover too many things all at once."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any incoming Freshman.  It will make you a better human.",
    "Yes. Professor Charles is excellent.",
    "Yes, I think it is a super fun course and gives a really strong base in philosophy.",
    "Yes! With the right professor, you gain an appreciation for works and ideas you probably wouldnt otherwise read with proximity to high-level faculty. DS Philosophy might just blow your mind.",
    "I felt very uncomfortable with the material in this course; I had an amazing time. I think that DS philosophy encouraged me to think about things I'd taken for granted in a new way, as well as opened my eyes to entirely new things. Additionally, my thinking skills drastically improved. If you are curious about Western philosophy, even if you are nervous or haven't done philosophy before, I think this course would be a great experience.",
    "Yes! This was one of my favorite classes at Yale and I know I will think about it for years.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was extremely well taught and conveyed a number of important skills.",
    "Yes, it is an excellent course and I learned a lot. I would just prepare the student to know that it will be a very and high and at times frustratingly difficult work load.",
    "Yes if you would like to major philosophy and potentially interested in math\/logic"
