    "I can successfully dissect a frog satorius nerve! And I feel confident recording synaptic and action potentials, even though the hardware acted up half the time. This course honestly helped me understand the material of Neurobiology lecture a lot better, which doesn't often happen with lab courses that are paired with lectures.",

   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot from this class, but it was very long and often the experiments were difficult (usually due to logistical stuff like not being able to get the machines to work properly). The best strategy seemed to be when we all watched the professor do a demonstration and then worked as an entire class to get a little bit of data. Also the first few weeks we were there way too late, like past 6:15 and that's far too much time to be critically engaged, especially when you're hungry.",
    "This course was pretty disorganized and didn't always follow its own course packet. At least it didn't feel like we had to be super organized either.",
    "I think the material is interesting, but the course is poorly designed. You spend a lot of time watching the professor do the experiments before you actually get to do them. The professors are all lovely and know a lot about neurobiology, but you don't learn a lot by watching them toy with the the tools. The biggest weakness of this course is timing. The first few classes we got out an hour late!! Very low course work, though. The weekly quizzes were disasters and we received no feedback on them. I know I failed them all, though.",
    "The weakness of the class was not enough time for the students to try the lab techniques. Often a lot of class was spent with a lecture and watching a demonstration of the lab. This could be improved by the professor doing the lab and projecting it on the screen at the same time as the students since the screen can be seen from all of the lab benches.",
    "Sometimes experiments didnt work, sitting around. Not a good lab!"

    "This is a cool lab, but it's not an easy one. You learn a lot of cool things - you dissect the nerve out of a frog, see action potentials run down a worm, etc. It's a long lab, like you're often there past 5:30pm and the experiments aren't easy. But even if after five hours you don't get any data, it's okay because you engage with the material for so long it's easy to write about what should have happened. It really helps you understand what's going on in the lecture course, which is rare for a lab. It's definitely interesting and the workload isn't bad, it's just a very emotionally draining afternoon.",
    "I think this is one of the few labs that was actually worth half a credit in terms of workload. Some labs were fun, but be prepared to spend 4 hours never getting your set up to work and not getting any data.",
    "If you're a neuroscience major, one of the other labs might be easier.",
    "No, you dont get anything out of it. Just trying to get through it!"
