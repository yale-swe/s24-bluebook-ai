                "This course provides such a unique lens to look at visual arts during that special time period. I didnt know anything about visual arts in the Age of Reason at all before I took this course. I have learned so much by the end of it, not just about art history, but also concerning larger topics such as the relationship between nature and art, truth and beauty, art and morality, the subjective experience of the beholder, the aesthetic of fragments and ruins, etc. This course has changed the way I look at the world.",
                "Writing and analytical skills! I am much better at thinking about connections between history and contemporary philosophy now.",
                "I gained a breadth of understanding and new perspective of the Enlightenment period.  I practiced looking and seeing, and interpreting through an artistic lens the academic\/intellectual progress of the period.  The way art and artists influence society and knowledge dissemination is wonderful, and by studying this period I encountered beautiful examples of the cross disciplinary achievements."

                "I think if we slowed down and discussed some of the kew works collaboratively it would improve my understanding of the work.",
                "The content is very interesting but too much is covered in each lecture. The professor should pair it down a bit.",
                "Strength of the course if the teaching staff. Professor Suthor is a very engaging lecturer and her explanation of artwork makes you look and think about art in an entirely different lens. Teaching assistants were also very good at leading discussion sections. \r\n\r\nWeakness is that the material at the beginning of the semester was challenging and hard to understand without prior experience\/knowledge in philosophy.",
                "This course is so comprehensive which I think is both its greatest strength and greatest weakness. So awesome because I feel like I learned SO much but also tough because I often felt really lost but overall I do think being so full of information weighs as more of a pro than con because I will be taking away what I resonated with most and had choices of what to engage with because there was SO much material.",
                "One of my favorite parts of the course is its interdisciplinary nature. I always knew art history is quite interdisciplinary, but I never truly experienced it by myself until I took this course. It amazingly brings together philosophy, science, and art. Our reading range from scientific treatises such as Newtons Optics and Goethes Theory of Colors to the intellectual project of Diderot and DAlemberts Encyclopedia and to aesthetic theories such as Winckelmanns Description of the Torso of the Belvedere and Lessings Laocoon. We also learn about Descartes and Kants understandings of the Enlightenment and Rousseaus influence on sentimentalism in visual art. Another highlight of this course is our frequent visits to the YUAG and the Beinecke Library. Imagine reading a 17th or 18th century primary source at the weekend, and then actually get to examine a copy of it closely during that weeks section. This courses engagement with collections in the YUAG and the Beinecke makes it so much fun.\r\nOne possible weakness of the course is that since it is organized thematically rather than chronologically, sometimes the jumping back and forth along the timeline could get a bit confusing, but this issue can get resolved during the review process. This weakness might also turn out to be a strength, since it allows us to compare artists working in the same medium or genre with one another, and so to understand the full range of artistic positions in this complex period in European art history.",
                "This class has a very large breadth and covered many different ideas in detail, but sometimes it was difficult to see how each \"module\" per se contributed to the larger overall landscape of enlightenment ideas."

                "I definitely think this is a niche course. If a student is interested in art history and strengthening their visual analysis skills then for sure. But if you're someone who is not interested in either of those things, this would be a hard class to take and I wouldn't recommend because of how dense and technical it is.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in art history or the Age of Reason. The workload of this course is quite manageable while you can really learn a lot if you do the readings carefully, attend the lectures, and engage in discussion in sections. It took me roughly 3 hours every week outside class to do the reading. Approaching midterm and final exams, Prof. Suthor also held recap sections and provided sample questions and led sections to help us get prepared for the exams. The final paper is also a lot of fun since you get to choose your own topic, including artworks you can observe in person in the YUAG, and let your own voice emerge from your writing.",
                "Great course if you are interested in art, philosophy, or the enlightenment.",
                "Absolutely.  Professor Suthor and the TA's are amazing, the lectures are engaging and the artworks are stunning."
