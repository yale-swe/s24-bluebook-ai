                "The teaching staff is fantastic and it goes at a great pace. Writing is not emphasized enough.",
                "It was just a lot of Chinese but the canvas was pretty good I think maybe putting dictation characters on canvas or weekly schedules could be good",
                "The courses strengths include weekly dialogues that ensure you know how to pronounce and use the new vocab. Weaknesses are that the daily character quizzes are usually only 2 characters out of 6 (that we were asked to memorize). This means that its easy to guess which ones they will be and not study the others. I felt like handwriting characters was my weakest skill due to my lack of urgency approaching these quizzes.",
                "I feel like my listening skills are not as honed as my writing skills. character writing wasn't really taught in the class, really only grammar was taught during classtimes and it was hard to practice other skills outside the classroom.",
                "Strengths - The course is very organized, and you'll learn a lot in a short period of time. The work is very consistent, so even though it's every day, it's not overwhelming.\r\nWeaknesses - Character writing was done basically by independent study with an expectation to learn and memorize 6 new ones a day. It would've been nice to have some amount of in-class time spent on it outside of the dictation quizzes."

                "Yes! Very fun. If youre looking to learn a language, this course is thorough and right for you. I feel like I learned to express myself better in one semester than what I learned (in other languages) in a year of high school.",
                "I would personally not recommend this course if a another student just wants to use it as a language fullfilment. however I genuinely wished to learn mandarin and so I will be committing to the language but otherwise this class was beyond challenging and often got in the way of my studying for other classes.",
                "Yes! If you're interested in learning Chinese, this course is a well-oiled machine that will have you speaking and writing short paragraphs in no time. Be prepared to commit to the daily work, but if you want to learn the language, this is the way to do it."
