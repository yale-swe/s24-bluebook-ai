                "Critical thinking skills regarding how to think about applying mutations in proteins to clinical cases.",
                "During this class, we delved into molecular motors (channels, transport proteins, pores, carriers, etc.) and how dysfunction of these motor proteins are implicated in human context. Each lecture started off with a clinical case, and then we delved into the pathophysiology and underlying mechanism of the disease, current treatment options, and the physiological principles behind the motor protein. We also read 6 papers and had to write discussion papers summarizing the figures, and discussing the paper in class.",
                "I learned how membrane proteins transport small molecules and how disruption of this cellular process can lead to disease.",
                "I feel that this class exposed me to the content I would see in the pursuit of medical or veterinary school - which is exciting as I felt that content was taught at a great depth and challenged me to see the molecular biology be applied to the diseases they cause.",

            "comments": [
                "This course was amazing. All the diseases and mechanisms we studied were super interesting and I feel that I was taken on the journey of a physician diagnosing patients.",
                "Each class starts with a clinical case and this is then analyzed to find the root cause from a molecular level and the physiology behind it is explained. I love this course format but there are a lot of protein names mentioned every class so this class might not be for everyone.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Boulpaep and Prof. Takizawa were incredibly professors and were truly passionate about the subject material. The content covered was really interesting. The exams were also fair and straightforward (they were more \"thinking questions\" and did not require rote memorization). This is also a small course (18 students) which really facilitates discussion. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There were few weaknesses in this course. The content was, at times, a bit too dense. However, Prof. Boulpaep's slides were very detailed and thorough and helped explain the material.",
                "Strengths include the Professor and the clarity of material. Difficulties include the exams (hard to practice for them) and the lack of discussion section.",
                "There is almost no interaction with students during the course, making it less engaging.",
                "The main weakness is that we do not receive any feedback or grades for our response papers.",
                "strength: clinical case are useful background\r\nWeakness: too much protein structural detail confused me",
                "Introducing the lectures by contextualizing the topic with a clinical case was very useful to understand how molecular concepts have macro-scale effects. The general structure of the lectures was also easy to follow however the slides were often full of a lot of text that made it difficult to interpret in the moment."

                "I would definitely recommend this course! This is one of the only classes at Yale that actually teach human physiology and disease beyond just a small scale level. For people who want to be physicians, this class was by far one of the most engaging.",
                "Yes definitely!",
                "Yes! This is an amazing course, especially if you are pre-health. Very few courses at Yale focus on human biology and have clinical case studies, so I would take this course if you can.",
                "Yes, it is a lot of work to study for the exams but the case studies and lectures were genuinely very interesting and fun to learn. The papers were evenly spaced and were well-selected to support the lecture content. Great for anyone who wants to go to medical school.",
                "You should absolutely take this course if youre doing anything remotely related to medicine. The clinical presentation of diseases mirrors how a medical school class would be taught. The structural, biochemical details may seem daunting but theyre more of a background than directly testable material. If you enjoyed Physiological Systems, then youll enjoy this course. Also, if you didnt notice, its taught by the professor who wrote the Medical Physiology textbook!",
                "No. Too much memorization.",
                "Absolutely, great introduction and exploration of physiology and gives anatomy overview as well. Recommended to undergrads who havent taken an anatomy class or even a pathology class. Gives good introductions to both",
                "Yes. This course has proper workload. Excellent course."
