                "I have learned how to apply the material that I learned in lecture and see these concepts put to work in the laboratory. Through the lab lectures, I was able to gain a solid understanding of the various techniques needed to carry out experiments, including titration and taking measurements.",
                "Basic lab work in chemistry",
                "This course allowed for further development of good laboratory practices and procedures and introduced students well to Yale's lab system.",
                "Applying skills I learned in lecture to a physical lab.",
                "I learned a variety of lab techniques and how to apply them to the topics I was learning in the classroom. It was rewarding to see the fruits of the experimental work and learn new skills each week. I also feel like I developed a respect for sanitary technique and how this pays off in the end even when it seems tedious in the moment. Finally, I learned how to abide by professional standards for writing reports and how to convey my results more directly.",
                "I learned how to use a few new pieces of lab equipment",
                "I learned a lot about chemistry in general with the basic principles and theories that we supported in our experiments. Also, the importance of wearing appropriate lab-wear.",
                "This course gave me hands on experience to content that I was learning in CHEM161. I also learned how to create a proper lab report through trial and error in this class. I also learned how and when to engage in independent and group work.",
                "Basic laboratory knowledge",
                "How to check significant figures and make trend-lines on Excel.",

                "I learned many lab techniques that I had not previously performed, and I also learned how to keep and maintain a lab notebook, both of which I feel will be very important in moving forward with lab.",
                "I didn't learn very much honestly, the labs very more basic than high school AP chemistry and the class took a lot of time but was busywork. The prelectures take a long time and the quizes was nice to have two attempts, but allows people to have a very high average grade. This is a curved class so the average is very high and may be curved down, which I don't think should be allowed. I think if this class was .75 credits it would be fair for the lengthy lab reports and time spent working and then having one quiz attempt so that it demonstrates students level of ability would make the class better.",
                "I learned how to perform specific experiments and different techniques used in the lab. The experiments helped me practice a variety of useful lab skills and solidify chemical concepts. I also learned proper lab attire and etiquette.",

                "I learned how to use certain lab equipment, and how to carry out an experiment with a certain degree of precision. The labs were often times not very difficult, but required attention to detail, and for procedures to be carried out very methodically. Lab reports helped me learn how to present my work professionally, but were very complicated.",

Just as well, if I were better at chemistry, I may have been able to enrich my learning of concepts, especially in the later labs, but the course turns into a lot of discussion about lab-only activities that don't enhance how I understand chemistry outside of the course. The Teaching Fellows were quite helpful in explaining basic ideas as we needed them for the lab reports, but at some points, and I believe most students I have spoken to feel this, it became a matter of not understanding what to say, asking one's TF, and then altering and writing down information based on that alone. It is not dishonest, as the reflection questions encourage this cooperation and the rest of the report must be done independently, but in terms of broad concepts, it did not feel like this space was conducive to learning much of anything.",

                "learned about good lab techniques and aided in the materials from chem 163",

                "In lab this semester, I learned how to be precise. Whereas in other classes some carelessness here and there is okay, that is not the case in lab. So I quickly adjusted and started checking even the smallest details of my work. The lab reports were incredibly tedious and the grading was so picky. And in terms of being in lab, it is very hit or miss, based on your random instructor. I loved my TF, so I enjoyed being in lab.",

            "comments": [
                "I think this course was set up well. The TFs were extremely helpful and there were always resources available to succeed.",
                "Labs were quite engaging and the reflection questions on the reports allow for collaboration,  TA's are super helpful and available, and Dr. Parr is really great at explaining things!",
                "This course was very well taught through the lab lectures and provided enough information to understand what the procedure was when it came time to carry out the experiment. In addition, I really liked how a lab manual was provided for each lab, which explained the appropriate steps we should take when carrying out each experiment. I would say the weakness in this course would be the low number of supplies available. There would be times where I felt that time was wasted in lab waiting for other classmates in my section to use the supplies needed. I think it would be more effective if each student/pair of students were provided with their own set of materials to carry out the experiments.",
                "Strengths - clear in-lab instructions and manuals / pre-lab videos\r\nWeaknesses - rubrics for labs were sometimes unclear",
                "The course is a strong introduction to the laboratory procedures at Yale and affords students the chance to get comfortable with lab equipment through relatively simple procedures and calculations. However, my biggest qualms with this course are in regards to grading. Having raised a handful of grading issues throughout the semester with incomplete responses, I find myself frustrated that the grades I received were not comparable to classmates who submitted similar lab reports. Quiz grading is generous as are policies around re-opening assignments (Dr. Parr was beyond amenable here in re-opening closed assignments for students throughout the semester). I also think that this course is great for those taking CHEM 161, however, it does not line up at all with the curriculum for CHEM 163 and I don't think it added to my learning in that course at all. Perhaps a CHEM 163 specific lab section within the Gen Chem Lab umbrella would be more beneficial.",
                "Good class, I learned a lot. A lot of work and course is only worth 0.5 credits.",
                "This course provides a strong foundation in lab work and features a wide array of experiments. You get to solidify your techniques and apply them to new experiences over the course of the semester. The pre-lab lectures and lab manuals are informative and often provide supplementary information to the topics at hand. The report-writing sessions at the end of the term were very helpful and took some of the stress off of the reports. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the weaknesses, the expectations of the first lab report were unclear. The course provided resources on writing reports afterwards, but they should have been available when all of us were writing our first reports. Also, this course and the chem lecture course were sometimes out of sync, so the lab expected us to know information we hadn't been taught yet. Finally, I wish the grading distributions were clearer because it made writing the reports unnecessarily stressful. Since the averages of the reports were generally high, it made you feel like if you messed up the slightest detail, it could move you down a grade level. Some more clarity about the grading scheme and overall expectations could have redressed some of these fears.",
                "I can honestly say that I understand next to none of the chemistry that we actually did in lab. The lab reports were often very confusing, and I was unable to answer the questions without considerable help from my TF. Very little was explained to us well, and if I was asked now to explain why we did any of the things we did, I would be unable to.",
                "A weakness was that I had never done a college lab report before and this course jumped in with the assumption that I knew how. With that being said, a strength of this course was that I felt like there were enough resources to reach out to for help. I also felt like for a course worth 0.5 credits, I did the same amount (if not more) work than I did for my higher weighted classes.",
                "I did like that this course helped my to apply concepts I learned in lecture. I'm a very kinetic learner, and being able to see and touch the concepts being described was very helpful for me. I do wish there had been more instruction on how to write a lab report - perhaps an example document or instructional video. Simply having to learn from scratch after the first lab report was disheartening. Otherwise, I felt that it was arranged very nicely to facilitate learning. The curve is a little harsh - if they don't want so many students to get an A, they should alter the content or assessment methods, not make it so that getting an A requires a raw score of 98+.",
                "The labs are really interesting to do, but the grading is just so harsh on the lab reports that it takes away significantly from the overall quality of the class. They're not difficult, just extremely tedious. I would finish most of them in an hour or two, but then need to spend 5 going over again and again, because your grade goes down significantly for missing a single digit. I highly recommend going to office hours frequently, since the reflection questions are always vague but are looking for very specific answers. The TAs will tell you what these are, but theres almost no way of knowing on your own.",
                "One strength of this class is its collaborative nature. I enjoyed working with lab partners and lab TFs to gain a deeper understanding of the chemistry concepts involved in our experiments. This class requires some time and effort, but there is a lot of support to help you through.",
                "weakness: too much work, strength: my TA was great",
                "Strengths: great foundation for chemistry lab. Also, the grading was fair since it was a different TF grading every lab report so it minimized bias. Weaknesses: wish it was a full credit class instead of a 0.5 credit class.",
                "Strengths: TFs were always willing to answer questions. The labs themselves were not difficult. \r\nWeaknesses: Points were taken off on lab reports for very minor things.",
                "I believe the course was fairly straight forward. There were many hours offered for receiving help and the assistance was helpful as we navigated our lab reports. However, I sometimes felt like certain TFs could be a little condescending, which did not help my confidence in the lab setting. Additionally, there was also a pretty significant disparity in the grading of lab reports-- occasionally I would get points off for the same answer my peers got full credit for, so maybe there needs to be a better standard enforced for reports.",
                "It can be improved by having more advanced experiments, the level of chemistry was incredibly basic, and also one quiz attempt. I also found as a Monday lab, the lab reports could sometimes have questions phrased confusingly and the office hours weren't scheduled to help us. As an athlete I have practice right after lab finishes so can't attend the Monday session and the lab is due that night. There weren't office hours over the weekend and during the week right after lab, I went to sessions but there were many students all asking for help on the previous lab due that night who were given priority so it was a waste of time and made it more difficult when working on the lab reports to have access to help as easily as other days.",
                "One strength was that each lab section was assigned a TF so they could help if needed during the experiments. Enough information and resources were provided to complete the lab reports. I also liked that we had pre-lab lecture videos to explain the lab, but they were sometimes extensively long with a lot of background information. The course could be improved by shortening the length of the pre-lab lecture videos or splitting them up.",
                "All in all, I liked this course a lot.  The one downside was that I felt that the workload was too much for a half-credit course.  If it had been a full credit, I would have felt better about the amount of work.  But Dr. Parr was amazing and made the time in lab feel very fun and productive.",
                "I really think that the way lab reports are graded is not helpful to students. The grading is so particular and picky, that this class was more about focusing on tiny formatting details than the content itself.",
                "One strength is that the TAs and instructor were all very helpful if we didn't understand a concept. A weakness is that my chemistry class with Dr. G was not in synch with the lab, and we were learning the concepts from the lab in class like a week or two after I already did the lab.",
                "I liked how the course was split into lab sections as such that it was possible to learn from my peers. I also liked how the prelab videos were informative and told us everything that we needed to know for the lab.",
                "I liked how we got to see the lab done in the prelab video. I think it would be more beneficial to see more calculations regarding the lab.",
                "Strengths: you do hands-on chemistry. Weaknesses: difficult to navigate if you've never taken a lab class. If you have Monday lab its difficult to get help in office hours. The experiments are difficult and the lab reports take a long time to complete with not very much guidance if you've never written a lab report before. The course claims its for beginners but its really not.",
                "Strengths: We had some very cool lab experiments and you learned improve time management skills immensly. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was a much greater workload than advertised. the lab reports were graded differently depending on which TA graded them. The labs often took more time to complete than other classes that were a full credit while lab is only a half credit.",
                "It's a solid intro lab course. Nothing is too challenging and the pre-lab videos explained everything needed for that week.",
                "I felt that the experiments we were carrying out didn't really explain in the lab why we were focused on the things we were recording, and then the lab reports asked us to draw conclusions based on our data and use our data in complex, sometimes unfamiliar calculations that were not very intuitive. I would leave lab feeling pretty assured that I knew what was going on, and then when I started the report I had a million questions. I also feel like the rubric punished little mistakes, so I was worried about little technicalities on my report rather than just demonstrating that I understood the takeaways of the experiment. Some strengths were that there were a wide range of experiments, so at least now I feel pretty confident in a lab setting going forward.",
                "It required full participation which was engaging and I had fun. The experiments could be challenging but were always doable and they always made sense. A weakness is how Sometimes there would be multiple labs on the same day, which had little to do with each other, that was kind of confusing. Also, there was little assistance when doing lab reports. A lot of times the TFs with office hours were not the same people grading the lab reports so they didnt know how to help.",
                "The time commitment was high when you account for the videos, lab reports, quizzes, and time spent in lab, and I feel that it is deserving of a full credit. A strength is that the TFs were extremely helpful in making the labs easier to understand.",
                "weakness: only 0.5 credits even though the work load is comparable to all of my 1.0 credit classes. Also, the curve means that you can have a 95% and still end up with an A- or B+.",
                "This course makes students stress out so much about the curve, and I believe that type of stress made me care more about checking off all of the boxes into making the lab reports correct and pretty than actually learning the material. That sort of high stress environment, with gossip about who the \"harsh-grading TFs are,\" and high averages which indicate ridiculously steep curves, really disenchanted me with my hopes for learning in the lab, making me leave MCDB as my intended major. I believe there is a serious issue with the intensity of the grading curve and how that impacts the learning environment. If that would be remedied, I think I might have enjoyed learning a bit more.",
                "I think it should be a 1 credit course.",
                "well structured but took a lot of time",
                "The access to teaching fellows was predominantly restricted to be over zoom, rather than having in-person office hours as well. However, nearing the end of the course, in-person hours were implemented, making finishing assignments much easier. Also, I soon found that having a Monday lab was a disadvantage as new lab lectures were usually not posted until Sunday, making a thorough understanding of the lab a bit difficult to reach.",
                "This course was well organized, but labs were not always graded and returned in time for people in the Monday section to receive feedback before they had to turn in the next lab report.",
                "I felt like the labs improved my understanding of lecture material.",
                "Some strengths of this course included the small group-type nature of the class where a TF oversaw a group of around 10-12 students and aided in lab work. Weaknesses may include the amount of unnecessary work the course provided.",
                "The course was very detailed but given in a form thats easy to understand.",
                "Strengths - good for learning how to do experiments. \r\nWeakness - grading (from what I have heard)",
                "The work is definitely enough that it should be a full credit. Also, the grading/expectations for lab reports werent made very clear",
                "The labs often don't take up the full four hours, but the lab reports can take time and be difficult. There are resources available to get them done and TFs were very helpful. During the labs, TFs are always there to help you out. The pre and post-lab quizzes can be confusing and difficult to figure out sometimes.",
                "A strength was the availability of the TFs and their willingness to help. A weakness was the lack of work for lab partners. I think that collaboration with a lab partner would have helped me learn more and actually discuss what we were doing it instead of just following out a set of instructions.",
                "Strengths: TFs (depending on who you get) are dedicated to teaching, Dr. Lant will help you. Weaknesses: Dr. Parr's video lectures were at times unclear, the lack of direction in lab, especially for Gen Chem I, is mildly concerning.",
                "Strengths- Have access to all the TFs and the daily discussion sections that help a lot with completing lab reports. \r\nWeaknesses- Students are not taught how to plan an experiment.",
                "Even though this is an introductory course, it is taught with little aid for those who have never had lab experience. There is a lot of figuring things out on your own especially on the lab reports. There were many times I stayed up for long hour just trying to figure out how to complete a certain graph despite being an active participant in the experiments. The quizzes are geared towards those in Chem 161. Chem163 students did not have the same education before hand to accurately answer the quiz questions without outside research/learning the content. The pre-lab videos could be much more interactive and less lengthy.\r\n\r\nThe experiments performed were pretty great. I believe they are essential when starting lab work. The lab environment was very inviting.",
                "The course is interesting overall, but the pre-lab lectures are a hassle since they add a lot of time to the already very long class time the course takes up plus the time to complete its workload.",
                "The prelab videos were too long and not useful. The lab content usually didn't match up with what we were doing in 161 so I spent a lot of time really confused about the content. My TF was super sweet and lab was really well organized. There was a good support network.",
                "Strengths: learned a lot of new information that is helpful in working in a lab (expectations for attire and note-taking)\r\nWeaknesses: pre-lab lectures were often very long and lab report grading was slightly unhelpful for future labs. THE NEGATIVE CURVE IS TERRIBLE!! Expect to work hard, but if you are at average your final grade might not reflect your true numeric value.",
                "The rubric in grading can be a little clearer, and it seems like there is too much discrepancy in grading the labs, as it is very common for students to get points off on something and others to not",
                "strengths: \r\n- engaging and attentive experiments\r\nweakness\r\n- not much guidance outside of the classtime for lab reports",
                "A strength is that there are a lot of TAs to answer your questions. However, the weaknesses far outweigh the strengths. First of all, I found myself doing a credit's worth of work for the half credit class. For example, I spent just as much time (if not MORE if I wanted to get a good grade) preparing for this class as I did with chem lecture. Second, I disliked that the labs were graded very harshly and that it is basically required of you to contact the TAs for lab regrading in order to succeed in this class when it was never mentioned to the students (personally found this irritating to find out as a first-gen student). Third, I disliked how the class is said to be \"curved down\" which makes this such a competitive course to take and overall it did not foster a sense of collaboration as I would've like to have seen especially with the sheer amount of pre-meds taking CHEM 134L.",
                "All the TFs were so helpful and friendly  they were always so patient with our many questions. I liked when there were office hours. That prevented us from wasting time on a lab report question that could quickly be resolved. \r\n\r\nI wish there were more explanations about how the lab relates to what we learned in chemistry class WHILE in the lab, instead of just making the connections when working on the lab reports. Everyone always dreaded the lab reports. They were unnecessarily nitpicky and took so long to complete - if you didnt want points to be taken off for small details.",
                "Weaknesses: consistency in grading. For example, one TA literally used a different set of rules for sig figs than I learned in Chem 161 or literally in any other class I have ever taken (or any webpage I have visited in my life). When I inquired about this, I was told that there were two different \"schools of thought\" for the sig fig rule for addition/subtraction. Also, in general, some graders graded much more harshly than others.\r\nAnother weakness: ambiguity in what we were expected to do for lab reports. I would ask my TA whether I should do a specific thing on a graph (like connect the dots between adjacent data points or include all 10 sig figs provided by logger pro) and they would say, \"maybe, I don't know, up to you\" or something like that, but I wasn't sure whether I would be docked points for choosing one way or another, and I would ask Dr. Parr and still not totally be sure, because it might seem to conflict slightly with what my TA said, or with what Dr. Parr had previously said in a pre-recorded lecture video, or with what the written instructions said, or what my friend's TA had said, etc.\r\nAlso, I was extremely worried about grades throughout the whole course, because the syllabus said that the B/B+ cutoff would be the course average grade, yet the average grades for the lab reports was consistently very high. So even though I was scoring really high scores, and I was above the average for most/all assignments, I wasn't sure if it would be enough to get an A once the curve was taken into account. It seems like this sort of class, where almost all students consistently score really high scores, is a terrible candidate for a curved grading system, because it would make people with high grades, like a 95% in the class (indicating high proficiency in relevant skills/understanding from an absolute point of view), still get a mediocre final letter grade because everyone else in the class also happened to do well from an absolute point of view.",
                "I think that this course could be improved by increasing the credit given. It doesn't make sense to be taking a course as stressful as this and to only be given .5 credits.",
                "The class is difficult for students who have no previous lab experience because we are expected to come in knowing how to use certain materials, which can be problematic because if we havent used them before, it will be harder to collect proper data.",
                "Sometimes, the video was a bit lengthy and I wish Dr. Parr could be a bit more concise.",
                "strength: the labs were cool, especially the spectrometer and electrolysis lab. TFs were extremely helpful! I recommend going to their office hours. The structure was also good. I liked doing the prelab work online before going into the lab and then doing the post-lab work afterward. That allowed us to just focus on completing the lab and allowed us to leave early on most days. I also liked the study hall sessions we had since they helped me finish the lab reports on time.\r\nweakness: grading scale. It sucks that people who had an A the entire semester grade would deflate to a B+.",
                "A strength for the course was the professor himself; Parr was exceptional during lecture, really engaging. \r\nA weakness would be the specificity of the lab reports. At times I felt as it the grading was a bit harsh.",
                "the graders were not always consistent",
                "Strengths: well organized, lab manuals were comprehensive, TAs and Dr. Parr receptive to emails for help\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: if you have Monday lab, sometimes the lab manuals/lectures aren't posted until late the night before, often the material hasn't been covered in chem161 lecture yet, and most difficult/stressful, there are little to no TA office hours available (if you go the week before, as I've done, the TA's don't have the rubrics etc yet so they can't help, and the one office hours that was on Monday was booked a month ahead of time- I emailed weeks out and could never get a meeting). So oftentimes my friends in later labs would meet with many TAs and get help on the entirety of their lab while I could not, which is stressful when the class is graded on a curve.",
                "The course is half a credit but you spend hours in lab and outside of lab working on your lab reports. If it had been one credit it would have made sense because overall I really enjoyed this class and found it interesting to see how we could approach research in a new way,",
                "Strengths: Fun labs, engaging pre-lab lectures\r\nWeaknesses: Not sure this can be changed, but I really don't understand why this is half a credit. It was more work than any of my full credit courses. Also, I thought that for the Friday lab, the 24hr window for post-lab quizzes was a bit unreasonable. People have intense extracurriculars over the weekend and on Friday night. 48 hours would make much more sense for the lab section that completes the quizzes over the weekend.",
                "The guidance on the reports was weak. Office hours were often full and I could not get off the waitlist. Often felt lost on calculations, wish there was more guidance.",
                "very clear and organized. pre-lab videos were quite long. walking through the calculations in these videos was super helpful - used as an example when having to do my own. \r\n\r\nmaybe there could be a stronger connection between the lab and CHEM 161? I get that this only makes sense if everyone takes both concurrently. \r\n\r\nstrength: communication and support. \r\n\r\ncould add a regular office hours to help with lab reports, the way it was done for the last two reports.",
                "Strengths include challenging students in a way that they leave lab with greater insight and knowledge about how to function in a lab setting.",
                "The time requirement and difficulty was as expected, and the TAs were helpful in assisting. There can be room for improvement in terms of describing what is needed in the lab reports.",
                "The prelab lectures provided a clear understanding of what would take place in lab that week, and the labs themselves were generally interesting and insightful. A weakness is that sometimes the time commitment for the lab and the lab report were too much.",
                "strengths: Prelab Videos were extremely helpful; Teaching assistants and Dr. Parr, overall, were extremely helpful and supportive throughout the experimental execution and lab report writing processes; Experiments were sometimes time-consuming but doable with the help of the manual, prelab videos, and teaching assistants/ Dr. Parr\r\n\r\nweakness: High workload felt tedious at times. For example, I understood the purpose of the pre lab quizzes, but the postlab quizzes felt a little redundant considering that we already had to write lab reports anyway.",
                "The experiments were fun and everything was organized but there was a lot of work and some of the grading was very variable from ta to ta. A little more consistency in what they were looking for would be nice.",
                "Strengths were definitely Dr. Parr and the TFs, which made lab super enjoyable and something to look forward to every week. Weaknesses are probably the harshness of grading.",
                "Towards the end of the semester, the TFs started providing in-person office hour sessions in the Chemistry building to help with the lab reports. Those sessions were incredibly helpful and effective. I just wish that they'd been offered from the start of the semester. Definitely go to as many TF sessions as you can because that's how you'll best understand what they're looking for when they grade your lab reports. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on lab reports because they make up the bulk of your grade and you need to score consistently well.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note is that final grades are determined in the context of the class average, with students who score a little above the average getting a B+ and students who score a little below getting a B. So if you have an A when the class ends but the class average is also an A, your grade won't necessarily stay an A when final grades are released. I enjoyed the class and the lab experience, but that aspect of it was frustrating and unfair. If you put in the work and earn an A, then I think it should stay an A.",
                "The time in the lab was mostly used well - it was an engaging space, and it was in lab that I learned the most in this course. My biggest suggestion involves the lab reports - the rubrics for the reports resulted in a grading system that was harsh and arbitrary. I spent much more time repeatedly going over my lab reports checking for small requirements related to format and presentation than I did actually engaging with the content, and I would not have continued with the course were it not a requirement for my major.",
                "I think that a strength is the experiments. Most of the experiments were fun to complete. A weakness is that there appears to be a grading difference with TF's.",
                "The course is overall very well-designed with the detailed pre-recorded lectures, pre- and post-lab quizzes, and lab write-ups. There is plenty of opportunity to receive support during lab. The lab reports really enable you to develop your scientific communication skills.",
                "The strength of this course is hands-on learning and engagement, however, the weakness is the amount of work that comes with the course. For half a credit, this course carried a lot more work than expected -- almost as many hours per week as my full one-credit STEM courses. Another weakness may be that expectations for lab reports were never fully reviewed. Despite this, in the grading process, these expectations were upheld and greatly impacted one's grade repeatedly throughout the semester for myself and my peers. Also, grading of the lab reports greatly depended on who was grading them -- the different graders appeared to have varying expectations -- which made it very difficult to learn from past errors and improve to get a better grade when expectations depended on the grader.",
                "The lab reports seemed at times excessively detailed",
                "Extremely confusing curve. Everyone gets an A and small differences in your grade as a percentage end up deciding entire letter differences. Also extremely unequal grading of lab reports from different TAs and extremely vague rubrics for said lab reports",
                "I felt that the grading rubric for the lab reports did not reflect student knowledge of the material. I found that the rubrics were looking for very specific answers to questions, without giving consideration to the quality/depth of knowledge of student answers.",
                "The lab reports were very long and often seemed arbitrary compared to the material. Also students in chem 163 were extremely disadvantaged because 134L is aligned to 161 but in 163 we learned completely different material. Like when we did a gas law lab we were doing organic chemistry and I hadnt studied gas laws in at least a year. Additionally the workload was too high for the credits of the class. I understand that labs cant be a full credit like other classes but the time commitment was equal to or more that my 1 credit or even my 1.5 credit class. I think the workload should be diminished either with less lab reports and experiments and/or more time to complete them. Towards the end of the semester we had some time during the lab block to work on the reports with the TAs which I found very helpful, but at the beginning I was spending ~3 hours in lab which is the same as my other classes and then spending 5+ hours on the reports.",
                "One strength of this course is the detailed information students receive prior to experiments. The detailed lectures and manuals ensure that we understand what to do for labs and conduct them without too much difficulty. Another strength is the large amount of help offered. There are many office hours available to attend and the instructor, preceptor, and teaching fellows are always willing to answer questions through email. I found lab reports easy to navigate because it was easy for me to get clarification on parts I was confused about.",
                "Strengths were comprehensive prelab information and knowledgable TFs. However, at times the prelab lectures could become tedious.",
                "One of the strengths of this course is the detail of the lab work that allows for a greater understanding of the concepts being learned in the accompanying chemistry course. The lab also helped understand the visual and hands on aspect of  the chemistry concepts that are not able to be seen in a book. One of the weakness of the lab is the learning curve of the reports that is not fully explained in the rubric. Since there are very disparate experiences of students within lab there should be more support initially rather than gradually throughout the course. The outside lab work is comparable to a full credit course; however, since the lab is only a half credit there was a considerable amount of time dedicated to the lab that seems disproportionate.",
                "The only weakness of this course is the way it is graded. I've just learned that the class average, nearly 97%, will serve as the cutoff between a B and a B+. This seems absurd to me. In what other context would obtaining 97% of possible points not be considered the highest of achievements? If the professor wants to grade on a curve, he must allow for more differentiation in scores throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths are the organization of the course the weakness is the lack of communication regarding final grades.",
                "The strengths of this course are the Teaching Fellows who made themselves available for help during the experiments and after the fact as well. The weaknesses of this course are that it requires heavy focus and attention, superseding the amount of credits it is worth. The lab report grading rubrics were also very specific and tedious.",
                "The strengths were how I developed a better understanding of a lab environment but the weaknesses were how much time it took out of my day and the amount of time I generally spent on this subject",
                "This course is a great introduction to working in a lab setting. Its biggest weakness is the amount of credits it's worth. I ended up putting more work into it than some of my full credit classes.",
                "This course was very easy to follow, but some of the lab report specifics were difficult to get help on.",
                "The strengths was the pre lab lectures as the demonstrations were very helpful when actually doing the lab in person. A weakness would be the grading, especially since some TAs were more nitpicky than others which would make it uneven.",
                "One strength is that the pre-lab videos were very helpful and included everything we needed to know about performing the lab. The TFs were also always open to answering questions and there were plenty of office hours to attend. One weakness of this course was that it was sometimes a lot more work than I would expect a half credit to be. I think this could be improved by shortening some of the pre-lab videos or having reports due the day after your lab so you aren't working on finishing a report and doing pre-lab assignments at the same time.",
                "The labs are, in general, quite easy to follow, and the lab reports are straightforward. I liked that multiple labs were sometimes included in one lab reportthis made the workload more manageable.",
                "While I understand the idea behind curving the course, I found that people who had labs on different days of the week might experience differences/advantages to having their lab on a later day (i.e. when asking TFs about questions, they appeared to be more knowledgeable later in the week). Thus, having the course curved to encompass all lab section members felt at times skewed. I also received different opinions from different TFs when asking a question, which I found confusing.",
                "Strengths of this class was definitely how well organized the course was. The pre lab lectures were easy to follow and the manuals guided us through all of the experiment. The TAs did a wonderful job at introducing every lab and helping with the actual lab. A weakness would be sometimes the lab manuals had different instructions than what we were given from the TA.",
                "This course helped with understanding general chemistry concepts and actually working with chemistry. However, lab could be disorganized at times, which led to some confusion.",
                "Its quite a lot of work for a half credit class, however, the experiments were very well-designed and engaging. They tied to the Chem 161 lectures nicely.",
                "Strengths: taught basic chemical lab skills and how to write professional lab reports. Weaknesses: workload was very high for a half-credit class.",
                "One strength of this course is that it gives you a very good understanding of how lab work should be conducted. There is also a lot of guidance from the Teaching Fellows, which is very helpful.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course is that, in a few of the labs, the quantities of reagents were so stringent that they left little room for error. So on a couple of occasions, students who made a small mistake had to start from scratch since they needed to make more of the reagents. Given that most of us have not had training in such precision previously, it would be better if the class took that into consideration, and made us produce reagents in excess to account for error.\r\nAnother weakness was that, although we received guidance on small details in the lab report, it was really hard to gauge how long they wanted the introduction/background/objectives section. It seemed that they were stringent about length while simultaneously asking for a degree of detail that would make the report longer anyway. It would be nice if there was clear guidance about the level of detail required (e.g. an example).",
                "Strengths - good choice of lab experiments and are quite organized.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - can't work with group, TAs are inconsistent with instruction, high marks for lab reports are awarded on arbitrary details.",
                "The pre-lab lectures were extremely helpful as well as the labs where we were able to work in partners. It was nice to have someone you can bounce ideas off of.",
                "One strength of this course is the number of resources available to answer and questions or clarify any points that are unclear. All of the labs are completed in the presence of a teaching fellow, who is able to answer most questions.",
                "A strength of this course is that it is well organized and leads students through a progression of ideas and skills.\r\nA drawback to this course is that the workload does not align with the number of credits. I personally spent at least twice as much time on this course than I did my general chemistry course, but this was worth half the credit.",
                "The workload was heavy for the amount of credit received for the class",
                "I appreciated that my lab TA helped me explain the structure of the lab before we actually started -- in addition to the instructor's prelab videos. I also loved that there were tutoring sessions in case you had questions about your lab report.",
                "This course could be improved by more standardization among TFs when it comes to grading band amount of help given. There seemed to be major inconsistencies between how harshly lab reports were graded. Some TFs provided much more help upfront on lab reports than others.",
                "Strength: was Professor Parr and the TAs, very attentive and helpful\r\nWeakness: More feedback on Lab Reports",
                "The online pre-lab lectures were sometimes unclear. Furthermore, when we arrived in the lab it was assumed that we already had a preliminary understanding of how to use some of the laboratory equipment. As someone who came into uni with absolutely zero chem lab background, this was very frustrating and discouraging at times.",
                "The TFs were all very helpful and provided a lot of support. Sometimes the guidelines for the lab reports were unclear and confusing.",
                "It could be confusing at times as well as a lot of work but it also was very informative and helped gain an understanding of hands on chemistry.",
                "A strength of this course is that students are able to engage with the lab in an immersive way. The course is designed for students with no prior experience and the experiments are easy to follow. A weakness is that the lab reports are sometimes difficult to complete because lab moved faster than gen chem content.",
                "The pre lab lectures were very helpful and all of the professors and TFs were always happy to answer any questions during or after lab. A weakness was the lab rubrics. Sometimes it was hard to understand what was expected for certain parts of the report.",
                "I think the instructions should have been more detailed on lab report assignments.",
                "The people with earlier lab days felt at a disadvantage as compared to people with later lab days since a lot of the time the TF's wouldn't have the rubrics by the time the earlier lab days lab reports were due. This made it so that when they went to office hours for help the TF's couldn't always help them, whereas people with later lab days never ran into this problem.",
                "I liked the structure of the course, and appreciated the available support with writing lab reports.",
                "I think the metric system is better",
                "The grade deflation in this class is concerning.",
                "Strengths: Having a TA who can help you with the lab\r\nBeing able to ask classmates questions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The grading system. Even though there were rules out in place to protect against bias, some of the TAs were harsher graders than others, so two people with virtually the same lab report would have different grades. \r\nSome of the lab report templates had words I didnt understand because of the discrepancy between British English and American English, which wouldnt be a problem if words were defined beforehand.\r\nA lot of the pre-lab lectures were entirely too long. I understand that theyre helpful in completing the lab reports because they go through examples, but it adds to the workload and I often went into lab without watching the lecture because I didnt have the time beforehand.",
                "The course gave students enough time to complete lab reports and provided lots of help if needed.",
                "The course felt like a bit of a waste of time. Four hour lab sessions are long and most people, including the TFs really dont want to be there, which makes it feel even longer. The prefab lectures were long and disorganized and would be much more effective as shorter videos coupled with readings.",
                "Strengths include the style of the pre lectures and quizzes and a weakness would be the grading system.",
                "I enjoyed how hands-on this course was; it was always interesting to come to lab and learn about different techniques. However, I felt as if the workload for this class was excessive for its credit. Even though 134L is a 0.5 credit course, I ended up working on it more than almost any other class. Lab reports seemed to have arbitrary grading standards at times and required a significant amount of time to calculate and completeoften due to redundancy and the need to type out calculation. For almost every lab, I noticed that there were \"hidden points:\" criteria which weren't explicitly stated in any rubric or instruction set, but upon asking my TF, were critical to the lab, and without which, I would have lost points. These points were confusing, and oftentimes, I found myself revising a lab report right before the due date because I just became aware of some other component or explanation that the labs required. Clarifying the grading criteria for each lab report would be very helpful and, honestly, make the course accessible for those new to STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThat clarity is also useful considering the near-obscene curve the class is graded with. The B/B+ average for the class was a 97.5%. In any other discipline or class, a 97.5% is rewarded and understood to constitute near-perfect understanding of the material. For 134L, however, a 95-97% was a B, and I'd imagine that a grade highly regarded in another discipline, such as a 94%, would be punished. To grade the class on a curve where an A would be nearly a 99% only harms students, rather than aiding their learning. To curve students down and to set the bar at nearly 100% is illogical and harmful. Personally, I don't see the need for a curve in 134La student's grade should reflect a student's performance, and a grade range skewed upward does not. There's almost 0 margin for error in this class, far beyond the point at which error reflects lack of understanding.",
                "Strengths: well-organized, routine schedule, different experiments each week helped spark some interest, very helpful TFs.\r\nWeaknesses: Lab reports are graded along a very strict rubric (losing points for very small errors), which makes lab reflection and learning not enjoyable. Additionally, sometimes lab procedures are very long.",
                "The syllabus was a little off from the actual course. Same thing applies for lab manuals. I really liked the fact that quizzes gave you two tries. I also liked how lowest scores were dropped.",
                "The teaching fellows were excellent. Dr. Parr's pre-lab videos and clear instruction overall were extremely informative, and I loved that the course was very structured and easy to follow, with clear expectations. The only way I could think of improving this course is increasing number of office hours as I was sometimes not able to attend the times at which they were held.",
                "More in-depth feedback on how our labs can be improved would be helpful.",
                "I really wish there were better explanations as to what was going on in the lab. The lab pre videos were too long and not that helpful. Many of the basic chemicals and procedures were foreign to me.",
                "Strengths of this course included the depth and breadth of different chemical techniques explored in all the labs, which really allowed me to explore how diverse and rich the world of chemistry research really is. The pre-lab videos and manuals were really great resources that helped me thoroughly familiarize myself with the lab techniques I should expect before the lab. The post-lab quizzes helped me test my knowledge of the subject further. I also was pleased with the fact that the topic for each week's lab corresponded with the content of general chemistry course, keeping me engaged with the subject and allowing me to tangibly apply what I learned from the textbook in real life.\r\n\r\nA weakness of this course was that because so many different TFs were grading our lab reports, it was sometimes tricky to know what to expect in terms of how the lab would be graded. However, there were additional resources created later in the course to help mitigate any confusion regarding formatting and other lab report logistics.",
                "A weakness is the delay in lab report grade release, which could have helped when writing future lab reports. Additionally, this course should count as a full credit rather than half of a credit",
                "This course was very well planned out and organized. The division of two tables per teaching fellow facilitated a very close and efficient lab environment. The teaching fellows were always available to help at any moment, either in lab or over email. One way to improve the course is being less strict with the lab report scores, and maybe keeping the same people grading the students every time to reduce differences in scores every time.",
                "The tf's were very helpful but I wish they had more entire group study halls.",
                "The strengths of this course were that it had pre and post lab quizzes online with two attempts. This allowed me to really understand the topics before I went into the lab because I was able to correct and learn from my mistakes. Because my lab was on Monday, it was difficult to attend office hours concerning the lab that was due because the office hours during the week were dedicated to the lab that had already been due for me. This could be improved by having more office hours available on the weekend.",
                "I believe the lab workshops that were sometimes held were a strength of this course. They allowed me to meet new students in the class and provided immense help. The TFs were very willing to answer questions, so they helped clear up any confusion I had. I believe that one thing that could be improved is more standard grading practices. Some TFs were more lenient in grading the lab reports than others, it seemed like. It would be better if we had more justification for the grades that we received.",
                "The grading between TAs seemed fairly inconsistent. The labs felt interesting and relevant.",
                "more interaction with professor",
                "One strength of this course is that the preparation for the labs, in the form of pre-lab lectures, are very thorough. They provide a nice overview for the concepts of the lab. One thing that would make the lab quizzes more beneficial is if they do not reveal the correct answers if a student got it wrong on the first attempt. I think a system where a small percentage of points was deducted for a wrong attempt would encourage students to keep trying and revising their solutions instead of just giving them the answer after they get it wrong.",
                "I feel that I had a great TA so the course was very manageable. We were guided through every step and the structure of the course was clear. My only complaint is the grading scale is very harsh.",
                "This course is a great introduction to a lab setting that is fairly forgiving, the prelab lectures are clear and make conducting the actual lab much more straightforward, the experiments are interesting, the TFs are very helpful, and the chemistry concepts covered in lab compliment those covered in chem lecture nicely. The two weaknesses of this course are how the grading on lab reports can be quite harsh at times as well as how it's unclear whether or not you're allowed to print out the lab procedure and bring it to lab with you.",
                "Strengths:\r\nA few of the TA's were amazing!!! I've listed three phenomenal TA's at the bottom - all three were so great I feel that I have to mention them here.\r\nDr. Parr's video lectures were also helpful\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe online, graded quizzes weren't difficult but very annoying... small mistakes on the quizzes can be devastating, especially with the curve... I think the quizzes were helpful with comprehension but they shouldn't be graded.\r\nLab reports made sense but the grading on them is incredibly difficult when the curve is factored in... Every week, I spent hours upon hours writing my lab report, consulting TA's, and checking my lab reports for typos and still would sometimes lose points for tiny errors\r\n\r\nHowever, my biggest recommendation would be to make the quizzes ungraded... I understood the purpose and appreciated the review, but it created a lot of unnecessary stress.",
                "Strength: clear procedures provided\r\nWeaknesses: unclear rubric/instructions on how to start lab reports initially",
                "There were many weaknesses of this course. The workload was extremely large for a half credit class and the curve was incredibly steep making it almost impossible to get an A without devoting 12+ hours to this course weekly.",
                "A strenght of this course is that it teachces many important laboratory skills and also provides students with a lot of support as they are learning how to carry out these procedures. A weakness is that the procedures outlined in the prelab lecture and guide sometimes did not match the procedure we were told to carry out in class, however this was very infrequent and not of great concern because the TFs always guided us through any changes.",
                "Strengths: good guides from instructor before labs, clear lab manuals, amazing TF Improvements: need much more clarity on the expectations for the lab reports and to please post the rubrics sooner for people taking lab earlier in the week (earlier due dates for their lab reports). Also, PLEASE make this course worth more than 0.5 credits due to the work that was needed to complete the lab reports!",
                "This course was a great opportunity to conduct experiments and follow procedures in a laboratory setting.",
                "Strengths: A lot of guidance for lab procedure\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nI had Monday Lab and there was not much guidance for the Lab reports(i.e sometimes rubrics weren't posted until 7 hours before it was due).\r\nLab reports grading was very arbitrary depending on the grader."

                "It is a prereq for a lot of classes so yes I would. It definitely is not near as horrific as everyone says that it is. It was actually a lot of fun and was probably one of my favorite classes this semester and was a great introduction to lab at Yale. But, I would only say take it if you have to. You will learn a lot and do far more work than what a half credit class deserves to assign and curve makes it the grading pretty tough.",
                "Yes, it is very useful to observe and further understand the concepts that are covered in the chemistry lecture course.",
                "Yes, it was fine. Usually required if you're in gen chem lecture already",
                "Most students taking this course don't choose to, it's required for their major or pre-med requirements. That said, if you are choosing to take this course, I'd only consider doing so if you are in CHEM 161. If you're in CHEM 163, the content does not line up at all with the lectures or material and makes for a distraction to greater Chemistry learning. It does provide a strong understanding of laboratory procedures.",
                "Yes, if they are looking to go into any chemistry or pre-med field.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It provides a great foundation for lab work if you continue in the sciences. While for many of us in the lab it was initially just another prerequisite, I'm happy to say that it became so much more than that by the end of the semester. Spending time in lab was a really fun part of my week, and I'm excited for my future labs.",
                "No. I do not think that I learned anything about chemistry from this class, and I don't think my experiences will be very helpful in the future. The amount of work given is much greater than it should be for a .5 credit course.",
                "Yes! I thought it was a very good introduction to laboratory work with an emphasis in growing rather than getting it correct.",
                "I would recommend this course if you think you are interested in chemistry. I had a change in heart on my prospective major because while I enjoyed what I was learning, I found out that it was not what I wanted to pursue as a career. This course offered clarity to what I wanted to pursue during my time at Yale.",
                "I doubt many people would be taking this unless they had to, but out of all of my required STEM prerecs, this has been one of my favorites. The workload is high for half a credit, but as someone that learns by doing, taking this lab really enriched my understanding of the content in 161.",
                "You probably have to take it if you're in this course. The labs are often fun, the lab reports are pretty bad. But I wouldn't worry too much, it's more tedious than difficult. Just make sure to go over lab reports a million times and go to office hours, and you should be fine.",
                "Yes, I very much enjoyed this class. I would recommend that anyone who takes chemistry should also enroll in lab, as it provides a place to actively engage in the chemical concepts we learn in class.",
                "only take this class if you are required to",
                "Would recommend only if it is part of their major requirement.",

                "Yes, if they need it.",
                "It's required for many majors so many people have to take it. Some friends like science labs but aren't science majors and wouldn't recommend since it is a lot of time on dull material.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It was a good introduction to performing experiments in chemistry and demonstrated chemistry concepts in a real-life lab scenario. We learned many useful techniques in lab to perform different chemical experiments. Also, the hands-on approach helped reinforce chemistry concepts.",
                "Yes!  If you're considering this course, it's probably because you have to take it to fulfill a requirement, but don't worry - you'll enjoy it anyway.",
                "I wouldn't recommend it unless you have to take it for premed or your major.",
                "Yes because you can learn new skills and if you take it with the chemistry class you can connect them and learn from them both.",
                "Yes. It's a great way to get some lab experience, especially if (like me) you haven't worked in a laboratory setting before.",

                "I would only recommend this course to a person that has to take it as a Lab requirement.",
                "no, I would not recommend this class unless you need it for pre-med which was pretty much everyone in the lab.",
                "Only if it is required for a major or the pre med track.",
                "Yes, if you need a chem lab credit. Otherwise, it's a decent basic lab class.",
                "I would only recommend this course to students who have a chem lab requirement.",
                "Yes If you like science and are willing to devote a chunk of time in your day bonding with other people about chemistry.",
                "I would recommend this course if it is required for a STEM field, but otherwise I would look for another STEM class.",
                "Yes, if you want a very basic introduction to a chemistry lab",
                "This course, by design, is necessary for a lot of STEM majors. It must be recommended to those people, but I can only begrudgingly say that, as I found it work-intense and stressful. On top of that, since it is only worth 0.5 credits, it will not help out anyone who does not take another 0.5 lab in terms of providing a Science distributional credit, so really, I recommend people, perhaps, put it off until they get through gen chem and then stagger the labs if such is a possibility. If one does not go beyond introductory chemistry, this course will not be of any help at all.",
                "yea - its a fine class but just a lot of time will be spent on the lab reports",
                "I would not. This course is worth too much time and yields too little credits.",
                "Yes, if you are committed to chemistry.",
                "I would not recommend it if a student is not required to take it. If they are, I would say it is an okay class due to the large workload.",
                "Yes, if it is required.",
                "This courses is very useful for those looking to major in chem or a chem related field.",
                "Yes.",
                "If a prerequisite yes. If not then no",
                "Yes, if you are interested in chemistry. It helps you become familiar with a lot of equipment in the lab.",
                "If they needed to take it yes, but it is too much work to take if not a prereq.",
                "You probably have to take this course anyways.",
                "Yes! There is a lot of opportunities to work in groups/pairs and so it is a great way to meet and make friends. Moreover, you learn essential lab protocol.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is a great way to have an introduction to laboratory work.",
                "I think for a general lab, this lab did a great job at being informative and engaging. The lab lectures before lab were very clear at what we need to do, and the procedures were not immensely confusing. The lab reports were also very clear and effective.",
                "I would recommend only if they need it as a prereq",
                "I would only recommend the course if they are a STEM-interested student and have not taken another type of lab course. Otherwise, I would not recommend the course because of the large time commitment.",
                "Yes, but only if it's in addition to or after Chem 161/163 and you want a good introduction to what labs are like (or if you're looking to get into research).",
                "Yes, for sure! If you're pre-med, I would say this class is very useful. Dr. Parr could sometimes be a little intimidating and very strict in the lab, you learn by being under pressure.",
                "Yes, if one were to take chemistry 161 I strongly believe that this course well accompanies the lecture and helps with the understanding of chemistry concepts. However it is only 0.5 credits but I think it should be more than 0.5 because it was still an intensive class that required several hours outside of the classtime to complete the lab reports and study and watch the prelab lectures.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless you're pre-med or need to take it for your major. Overall, it is just not appropriate to have this course be labeled as a half credit course when it oftentimes necessitates the same amount of energy as a full credit course. This, along with the fact that this class is graded based on the collective average rather that cutoffs that reflect our mastery, lead me to the conclusion that this course is strictly meant for STEM students that are willing to drains hours of their time to this class and not to those students that are simply interested in taking a lab course due to the competitive nature of CHEM 134L.",
                "If you must take lab. Otherwise, it takes a lot of time from your week. I actually enjoyed being in the lab though because I loved my TF! But the lab reports were so tedious and boring.",
                "No. It was stressful and far away and annoying.",
                "Don't take this course if you do not have to. It is not enjoyable and definitely not worth the stress.",
                "No because it is super time consuming and not much support is offered. The graders are looking for answers that are way too specific and dont leave room for student interpretation and insight in reflection questions, which essentially defeats the purpose of having reflection questions.",
                "yes.",
                "Yes, good for understanding, easy to follow along",
                "Definitely. It's a great way to get introduced to how labs work in college.",
                "I would, but with some caution. Its a great chemistry starter course, but the student would have to be willing to put on the needed work outside of class.",
                "yes but it is more work than a half credit in my opinion",
                "I did not have the best experience enjoying the course because it was one of my greatest sources of stress, and I spent so much time on each lab report that it sometimes felt like a nuisance. However, I do think my experience would have been different if my lab was later in the week, so I would recommend the course to another student with that caveat.",
                "I would recommend this course, especially if you are taking it alongside Chem 161 because it really does help to supplement your learning, but it is a lot of work for only half a credit.",
                "Yes, it is a great way to further your learning with chemistry. Conducting physical experiments that displayed the concepts we were learning about helped visual learners like myself and made it more fun.",
                "Yeah, if they're already taking CHEM 161 I think it enhances learning.",
                "If needed as a requirement, otherwise it's overly stressful over points that are not explained after being removed",
                "It's very basic. Not super exciting. If you don't need it as a requirement, don't take it. Gives you very beginner overview of procedure and techniques. Can mostly be learned on the go.",
                "Yes, I strongly recommend this class because it will prepare you to take on more challenging STEM courses and labs.",
                "Yes. It is a good way to be introduced to how a chemistry lab works at Yale.",
                "Yes, it is a great supplement to general chemistry and provides a new prospective to chemistry by being in the lab. But I would only recommend it if you need the class for your major.",
                "If you are going premed and/or want to develop skills specific to a chemistry laboratory, I would suggest taking this class, especially with this instructor. The workload is significant, but it is very doable especially if you engage with the resources available to you, such as the teaching assistants.",
                "Only if you need it otherwise its a grind and doesnt add that much.",
                "Yes, I'd definitely recommend this course if Dr. Parr is teaching it, but be careful with the smaller details on lab reports and definitely talk to your lab partner/group and check over for tiny mistakes. I had heard bad things about this course but Dr. Parr is super nice and approachable and the course itself is not that difficult if you have taken AP Chemistry before.",
                "This course provides a great lab environment, and there are lots of resources to help you succeed (TFs, office hours, etc.). I'd never been in a proper lab before this class, and I enjoyed it. However, the way that grades are determined can be frustrating since the B+/B- margin is determined based on the class average, so even if you have an A in the class, it may not stay that way once final grades are determined.",
                "I wouldn't recommend this course to another student. If they were taking it as a requirement, I would tell them that the time in the lab can be enjoyable and interesting, but the work outside the lab is difficult to get through.",
                "Do not take this course if you don't need it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student wants to learn more about Chemistry labs and become familiar with equipment.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students who want to gain basic laboratory skills. This course will give you a great foundation to build upon in future lab courses. I was able to receive great support throughout the whole semester.",
                "Yes, however, I would be sure to warn them that there is a very high time commitment.",
                "take it if you have to, its not that bad but its by no means an exceptional course. Plain and uninspiring.",
                "If required, yes. I would warn them about the tedious time consuming lab reports.",
                "Not unless its a prerequisite",
                "I would maybe for someone in chem 161 but not chem 163. It was frustrating to write lab reports on material that you had to relearn. The workload was too much compared to the credit earned. The grading rubric looked for specific details and were often hard to get on your own.",
                "Yes, this course is great for students looking to gain foundational research skills. The course provides a low-pressure environment and provides the tools to understand how to conduct research and labwork better.",
                "Yes, it was as I expected, so if another student is looking to have an introductory chemistry lab course I would recommend this.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in developing their understanding of chemistry and how the lab setting functions. This class has a steep learning curve yet it is possible to overcome the various setbacks with learning and master the content ahead.",
                "Not if they did not have to take it, unless they planned to take it credit/D/fail. The grading is too stressful.",
                "Yes I enjoyed this course and what it taught me very much.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to pre-med students who need it for a requirement.",
                "No because it took way too much out of my day and the grading system is unfair so unless they absolutely have to I wouldnt recommend it",
                "Unless this student needs it to meet a requirement, no.",
                "Yes.",
                "I would recommended it only if you need to take it for a prerequisite as there is not point in going through so much work if its not needed.",
                "I had to take this course for requirements, but I would recommend it because I learned a lot of helpful lab information that I think will be useful in the future.",
                "YesI enjoyed this course much more than I expected. I was initially worried because I'd heard lab courses can be stressful, but all the labs we do are straightforward and the TFs and Dr. Parr were always there to help.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it covers the basic chemistry that will be needed for higher levels for higher chem related classes.",
                "I would only recommend this course if it is part of your pre-requisites, unless you are really interested in chemistry.",
                "It is a useful course as a chemistry foundation.",
                "Yes, if you take first semester of general chemistry Id definitely also take this lab. The labs you perform build on the information you learn in class.",
                "I would recommend only if the student needs a good foundation in chemical laboratory skills for classes later on. m",
                "Since this course is required for the biology, chemistry, and some parts of other stem majors, all students should take this course to understand the basics of lab work dealing with chemicals.",
                "I would recommend this course if the student wishes to learn more about the chemical processes and is interested in conducting experiments and collecting data.",
                "No, unless you need it for a requirement. Would not take it for fun.",
                "Only if you were pre-med/chemistry-related major.",
                "Yes, I think its a great introduction course to take to familiarize yourself with a lab.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. This course helps students develop laboratory skills and experience that can useful for further laboratory activities.",
                "I would recommend this course to students looking to get chemistry lab experience and concurrently taking a general chemistry course. Some of the labs we did genuinely helped to solidify the concepts we discussed in my lecture. \r\nAdditionally, it was challenging enough that my ability to write lab reports with precision and attention to detail improved as well as my practical lab skills, but not so challenging that it felt impossible.",
                "It is a good course to pair with general chemistry to build a basic understanding and see the concepts in real experiments.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I was better able to understand the course material from general chemistry and the prelab/post-lab questions helped reinforce my understanding.",
                "Yes I would recommend this class, despite sometimes harsh grading, it is a relatively fun class.",
                "Yes, if you're pre-med or Science major you would have to take it, but otherwise no",
                "No, I would not recommend this course unless you had to take it for your intended major.",
                "I would recommend it only if its a requirement or prerequisite.",
                "Not unless they're in chemistry.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it prepared me for future labs at Yale and overall was a fun experience.",
                "Yes, especially if someone is planning on going into any chemistry or biology field. I learned many important skills and could apply lecture knowledge to actual experiments.",
                "Yes, especially if it is required for your major. Even if it isn't required, there are some really interesting experiments in this course.",
                "No",
                "Yes, I would. It is a very good introduction to chemistry in a lab setting and not too complex.",
                "If its with Dr. Parr or Dr. Lantz again, then yes. A lot of the labs were cool and they never actually take all 4 hours to do.",
                "I would strongly recommend the course if the student is taking chem lecture at the same time. The lab work closely followed what was learned in chem lecture that week.",
                "Only if you have to for prerequisites.",
                "Yes, only if the course in necessary for the students major or if they are premed.",
                "If a student is required to for a major or for the premed curriculum, then I would. The workload and large time commitment for the class, which makes class scheduling somewhat arduous, means that I wouldn't recommend the class for the sake of curiosity alone.",
                "Yes, especially if taken in conjunction with general chemistry  it helps apply concepts youve learned inside and outside the classroom.",
                "I recommend this course if it is taught by Jonathan Parr",
                "The workload can be quite heavy if one wishes to do well and complete every lab thoroughly, so I would only recommend this course if it is required for one's major or if one is genuinely very interested in doing chemistry lab experiments.",
                "Yes. For many students on the premedical track this course is prerequisite for entering medical school.",
                "Sure",
                "No. If you are premed you have to take this so there is no option. No one takes Chem lab for fun.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I think that this course was an excellent supplement to the general chemistry course, and enabled me to see and understand chemistry in a more palpable and accessible way, which is important if someone hasn't had much exposure to chemistry before coming to college. Many of the labs also show how chemistry is directly relevant to and ubiquitous in our everyday lives, which is also very rewarding.",
                "Yes, this course was very enjoyable and I learned a great deal about chemistry by conducting the experiments and then considering them at greater depth when writing the lab reports.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it helps us dive deeper into the course material from the Chemistry lecture course we took simultaneously. I would also especially recommend this course for premed students, because it is a premed requirement.",
                "Yes it was a great foundation and it is very interesting.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it gives a good introduction into the lab and helps to develop skills of taking data and writing a lab report.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, because it was very helpful to me. However, the curriculum did not align with that of the Chem 163 class, so it felt sort of out of place with the Chem 163 students sometimes. It would be helpful to account for this and make this clear before students enroll in the lab.",
                "Only if they need it for credit",
                "Yes, in combination with Gen Chem 1.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to gain basic chemistry lab experience or any student taking general chemistry.",
                "If you have to take it, take it.",
                "I don't think I would recommend this course to a student if they really wanted to experience lab work. It is definitely a supplementary course to in the information of 161 and 163. I think it does provide nice hands on experience for these courses but it is not a necessary course for understanding CHEM 161 and 163.",
                "Yes, I would recommend because it is great for beginners at lab.",
                "If you need this course to fulfill a major requirement you obviously have no choice of whether to take it or not, but if you're someone who is interested in gaining experience in a college lab setting and is willing to put in the work, this could be a good class for you. Definitely worth taking if you're in Gen Chem.",
                "Mostly no, unless you love chemistry lab work or need this for some sort of prerequisite.",
                "Yes, it helped supplement what I had learned in lecture and taught me how to identify and use lab equipment appropriately.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it teaches you how to apply knowledge from chemistry classes in the laboratory and allows you to develop important laboratory safety and procedural skills.",
                "Only for those who need to take it (ie pre-meds)",
                "I would recommend this course for students who wish to gain experience with using chemical laboratory equipment.",
                "If they have a passion for chemistry and stem then yes, if not-it won't be enjoyable.",
