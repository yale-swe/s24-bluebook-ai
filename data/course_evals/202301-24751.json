                "Strength: carla is kind and understanding and really flexible and although child observations can be hard to figure out at first, you really learn a lot from observing closely with attention to journal questions as a focusing lens weaknesses: i didn't usually go deep into the readings and while the breadth of guests is amazing, i found the technology/zoom distracting at times and wish the class was more active with more activities, zoom addition did make the class more accessible at times, so I appreciate prof horwitz flexibility",
                "strength is professor horwitz, her expertise and care for her students, and the weekly observations at the preschool. The class was perfect and at the end of the course she took our commentary and is always open to modifying and improving the class (even though it is already great)",
                "I loved that it was a mix between direct teaching by Professor Horwitz and guest speakers. The observation sessions also helped enhance the curriculum.",

                "My favorite part of the course was the preschool observation. The course requires observations outside of class that add to the hours per week but ultimately felt worth it to me. It's a 2 hour seminar + 2 hours at a preschool + 1 hour with an individual child = 5 hours per week, not including homework, but the homework isn't too much. The journal entries were useful for reflection and the materials exploration project was a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nThe use of class time could be improved. Prof. Horwitz is super knowledgable, but some of the classes were difficult to sit through because it was a lot of listening to her speak without much by way of visual aids, active conversation, or breaks. Adding more opportunities for us to participate, particularly in a hands-on way (like the picture sorting on the first day of class), and more conversation among peers (particularly about our observations) would go a long way."

The class itself is not too overwhelming or intensive so you can really get out what you put into the class and observations. Love EBJ!",
                "Absolutely! Favorite course I have taken at Yale! Keep in mind the 2 journals, midterm project, final essay and the weekly observation and the lecture portion of the class all take a lot of time in addition to the reading so it definitely is time consuming but the material is super interesting so the work is enjoyable to do. So I would definitely recommend taking this in a semester you can devote time to the class and get the most out of it",

                "Yes! Professor Horwitz is amazing and I appreciate her wisdom so much.",
                "I would recommend this course to students interested in (or even just curious about) children, early education, developmental psychology, etc. It's not going to serve the same purpose as Developmental Psychology (a structured overview of dev psych) but I still learned from it and feel relatively better equipped to work with young kids."
