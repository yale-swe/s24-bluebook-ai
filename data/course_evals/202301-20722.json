                "A greater understanding of game design and how art can be interactive.",
                "I learned about game design and how to iteratively prototype projects to make them intuitive for new users.",
                "I developed some rudimentary knowledge of art basics, game mechanics and purposes, and some coding. The best thing about this course is about how hands-on one can get with playing and making games, so I thoroughly enjoyed this class compared to others where you take on a more passive approach. I also learned how games work and cool terms like \"sacred space,\" and it was fun playing other people's games that they created often from scratch.",
                "I came in with some prior experience making games, but I never really made too many iterations of my hand-made cards, so this class gave me valuable experience playtesting and editing my games."

                "This course is strong for those interested enough to take it. The content is no more difficult than one would expect for a computer science adjacent course and shows physical results of students work that is rather motivating.",
                "This course is great! The course enables you to take your own design goals, apply some principles taught in the course, get constructive peer/instructor feedback, and present your final product. There is a very light reading load and I always felt excited to come to class. There are always projects to work on, but they are not too burdensome.",
                "Strength: a great course that lets you explore and get experience with game development.\r\nWeakness: its a little unguided, I wish the class was a little more involved.",
                "Strengths: fun class in a topic that is interesting. Mostly work on projects with a high degree of student control.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A bit disorganized, and I wish we went more in depth on game design (looking at specific games or genres).",
                "Strengths: hands-on, gets you think in an innovative and entrepreneurial mindset, teaches you rudimentary knowledge of art and game. Professors are very nice and teaches everything in a way everyone can understand!\r\nWeaknesses: difficult to do the last game project that involves coding. I wish that we were given more time and more instructions on how to code certain things/what we can't learn to code if we did not have previous knowledge coming in. Some of the class had a lot of coding experience, but some of us had no experience at all. I wish the class gave the opportunity to the latter to learn more coding while keeping in mind what we can't learn and apply in a few weeks.",
                "I loved the last 2 assignments (card game and prototype) and the audio walk was also very fun, but I kind of wish we got to start making games earlier in the class, maybe even cutting the audio walk for another game creating assignment (even though I did enjoy the audio walk a lot). The in class gameplay demos were nice where we played and analyzed existing games, while other activities like some of the readings and analysis of stuff like color theory was definitely valuable, but I feel like the more time we spent making games and playing each others games the better. Overall I really liked everything we did but since time is limited I would have liked to have a bit more of the game creation/learn by doing."

                "Yes. I had lots of fun making the games and websites into what I wanted them to be and enjoyed the amount of freedom that came with our projects.",
                "Yes, and especially as a first-year seminar, it is excellent to balance out a schedule that is more demanding. There is plenty of support for students who don't see themselves as artists, and there's no background knowledge needed. Great course.",
                "Yes, if theyre interested in game design. Its more engaging if you love to do it and want to create.",
                "Yes, I think it's definitely fun if you're into games and designing them, especially from a narrative perspective.",
                "If taking for an elective/fun, then yes, I would! Don't expect to learn how to code a game, but the class gives a lot of space to learn to create games (not necessarily by code) and what games mean. It is overall a fun class to experience with fellow first-year students.",
                "For sure! Its a lot of fun and just being in a class with other people who have similar tastes and also like game development was great."
