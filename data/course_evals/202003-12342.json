                "This course is extremely well taught and there is a clear plan and progression throughout the semester. Each topic seems to build on the previous topic so that nothing feels overwhelming. There were no major issue in this course that need addressing in my opinion.",
                "Various concepts, assignments cover a lot of important topics learned in class",
                "LOVED THIS CLASS super engaging, great PSETS, perfect for 2x speed watching and very fun content",
                "Veyr enjoyable, no complaints",
                "Strengths: interesting course material, interesting and clear assignments \r\nWeaknesses: lectures could be a bit dry and boring. Best lectures were when students got to participate\/play a sample version of a game with Prof Glenn!",
                "Strengths: The problem sets were constructed well and were challenging without being overwhelmingly difficult. Whenever I did get stuck I was able to go to office hours and the ULAs were very helpful. It was also very nice to have 5 late days we could use whenever we wanted. Having the lectures recorded was also great because I could watch them multiple times and replay the specific portions that were most relevant. I also liked having 3 quizzes instead of more stressful larger tests.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I liked the final project but I wish the guidelines had been a bit clearer from the beginning, especially regarding test cases and how much of a writeup we needed. There was a stressful period around October where there was either a quiz or pset due every week for about 5 weeks. I would add at least one week off in the middle so that students can regroup in case they have started to fall behind.",
                "Strengths: Psets were fair and help me learn the material, notes helped with the psets\r\nWeaknesses: The OneNote notes that Glenn likes to use are not that useful unless you watch the lecture where he writes out the notes. There are no psets based on the last few topics, so I did not diligently study them",
                "Strengths - some fun psets, professor Glenn really tried engaging with everyone in the class, the final project was a great way to explore something we were interested in \r\nWeaknesses - hard to understand some of the expectations for psets, some psets were not really based on understanding of code, I do not know how you would be able to do psets in a normal semester as you need to copy down exactly what was said in lecture to do them",
                "Lectures could be made more exciting, but this is my only complaint. Everything else about this course was great, lectures matched well with psets and there was plenty of support available to us.",
                "Strengths: Fun psets, interesting content if you like games, probably Glenn's best taught course\r\nWeaknesses: Some psets (*cough* Q-learning *cough*) involve hours and hours of guess-and-check fine-tuning certain parameters to achieve good performance. This got incredibly tedious, and there was no real learning involved there.",
                "The class was really good in that it gave the background knowledge you needed during the class. There were people in the class who had clearly studied games before, but we still learned all of the basic theory and background, which was helpful for those of us who had never learned about games.",
                "I thought the topic was really fun and the projects very satisfying to do. Professor Glenn is really knowledgeable and nice. I like the mix of approaches and techniques learned, and I was surprised at how simple machine learning is now that I've gotten to use it. Having an open final project was also really cool, I haven't had that in many of my classes before.",
                "The lectures were great! Professor Glenn isn't the most exciting lecturer you will meet (and this was also a Zoom semester), but he made the lectures interesting by varying the kind of content (i.e. including live gameplay, videos, graphics, etc. instead of just slides). The course managed to cover a lot in the semester, and also talked about the latest research which I really appreciated.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was the final project process. We had to leave feedback on video presentations made by others, but we never actually got to view any of the feedback left on our presentations. As a result, the process wasn't very useful. It would have been better if the videos were real proposals that we could then adapt in response to feedback.",
                "Extremely engaging class with class participation opportunities and examples given my professor on how to play games that we programmed. Class was a great balance of computational intelligence and gameplay.",
                "Very interesting course, however, the lectures were sometimes a little boring. The content was very interesting, but if lecture was just a little more engaging the class would be perfect.",
                "This is a very enjoyable and laid back CS elective. The problem sets are super fun to do, grading on problem sets and quizzes is very fair, and Professor Glenn is great as always. No weaknesses to report.",
                "I loved all the programming assignments. They were not only very fair in terms of difficulty but also really fun to do. Most fun class Ive taken at Yale by a long shot.",
                "The problem sets are pretty interesting and fun, however, some of the assignments suffer from being reduced to changing parameters the entire time. Lectures covered exciting material, but it was hard to pay attention to Glenn without being distracted at home. Grading remains an issue in this class too.",
                "Really cool topics, reasonable deadlines for psets\r\n\r\nThink the final project could have benefited from more structure\/an actual spec on requirementsneeded to piece everything together from lectures + piazza posts",
                "All good",
                "Strengths: Clear on what assignments are looking for. \r\nWeaknesses: office hours structure",
                "Strengths: I thought Professor Glenn taught this course really well. He explains the core concepts clearly and provides good indicators of how to tackle the problem sets effectively. Although I ended up watching lectures asynchronously, Professor Glenn structures the lectures well, and it feels like they all build on one another (for the most part)."

However, it's really easy to fall behind and just not watch the lecture. What worked in other classes was having a small, 5 point graded lecture quiz due a few days after the lecture was available. This actually forced me to watch the lecture soon after it was recorded and kept me from falling behind.",

The virtual environment may have even enhanced certain things, like the ability for some of Professor Glenn's notes to already be \"on the board\" and playing games live without having to deal with a projector. Overall, I think this course did very well online.",

You can also do all the assignments in Python, so you can get a lot of practice with a useful language. I really think this is one of the better CS electives because you learn a lot of new concepts without it being horribly difficult.",

                "Yes, if you are interested in learning about the logic and algorithms behind some popular games. However, it is definitely more math focused than other CS courses and requires a lot more exact understanding of topics in order to do psets which is not everyone's cup of tea",
                "Absolutely!! This was one of my favorite classes I've taken so far. The content is not only applicable outside of the course, but it's also so much fun and touches on several fields. Psets are not too long or difficult, and they're in Python which is great. Taking 223 may be helpful for this class (but is not necessary).",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who has any interest in the theory behind games (two player, one player, board games, video games, ...) and how to create good game-playing agents. The content focuses on game-playing but the techniques are more generally applicable, which is nice. If you like Glenn's teaching, I would say this is probably his best-taught course.",

Note that the majority of the class is concerned with perfect-information board or card games and not necessarily modern video games, although the class does touch on that.",
                "Yes. It is a nice introduction to a lot of cool algorithms and machine learning. Professor Glenn really knows what he's talking about, and he's friendly and fun. Being able to choose the language you do most assignments in is nice, I used it as an excuse to learn C++ and Python.",
                "I think the psets can be tricky. As opposed to some other CS classes, where psets can be a slow build, I felt these psets made no sense to me for a period of time, clicked, then were finished in a very short time. It depends how quickly things click for you.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in games, or even just in AI, this is a very interesting class. It is taught well and the problem sets are enjoyable and not too hard. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the subject, and it is a great CS elective if you need one.",
                "Yes- the best cs elective Ive taken",
                "Yes. This is a great course if you want to get started in machine learning or if you are just interested in games.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone looking for an easy CS elective, a fun CS course, or to learn a bit about games. There's a good amount of overlap with material covered in AI (CPSC 470), especially through the first half of the class with DFS, minimax + alpha\/beta pruning, but it's still very interesting content. The class is easy -- problem sets are very doable, and if you've taken a bunch of CS courses they'll never really take you more than 5-10 hours (every other week). There are no exams, just a couple of very straightforward quizzes sprinkled throughout the semester. Professor Glenn was great as always and his passion for games makes the course very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend.",
                "Yes. By far the best CS course Ive taken here. Maybe the best course overall as well.",
                "Yes, I would if the student is interested in how computer science algorithms apply to games.",
                "Very cool course where you can learn a bunch of new algorithms and techniques. Definitely recommend to juniors and up (helps to have Python experience, not a lot of hand holding if you can't design and implement a program by yourself).",
                "Yes, it's an interesting class.",
                "If they are particularly interested in solving games.",
                "Yes absolutely--especially if you haven't taken an AI class yet. This class touches on a lot of relevant AI topics like minimax, alpha-beta, etc., but even if you have taken AI, this class is still useful, since you spend time coding things like MCTS and Q-learning in Python. All in all, a great CS elective to take, with a reasonable workload."
