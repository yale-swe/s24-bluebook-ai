                "Strengths: The seminar meetings were structured well to facilitate learning throughout the semester. The readings conveyed the material concisely and comprehensively, and the discussion questions offered interesting ways to mull over the material. The written homework assignments did a great job of prompting more thought and reflection on the reading material. I also really enjoyed participating in the mock trial.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Jaynes lectured for most of the time. Having the opportunity to discuss some of the material more organically would have been helpful!",
                "I enjoyed coming to class and the professors lecture notes were very clear and organized",
                "Ultimately, even though the course dealt with many of the same themes of my other coursework, the level of engagement with some of the themes wasn't as robust as I would have hoped. Students often felt disinterested or felt that they had already studied most of the information in the course.",
                "Strengths: once a week seminar, homework assignments were short but meaningful and allowed us to explore core course concepts \r\nWeaknesses: class was boring sometimes, lack of class engagement in econometric analysis and very few sense checks during the math heavy classes",
                "Professor Jaynes made clear lecture notes with discussion questions that helped orient the class. He is also clearly passionate about these topics and went out of his way to share anecdotes that made many concepts more personal and interesting. \r\n\r\nThat being said, there was little to no discussion in this class. Professor Jaynes spent a long time lecturing and putting things up on the board that proved to eventually be irrelevant. We watched him do a lot of math and then were never assigned problem sets or expected to know that material in any way. It would be a better use of time to facilitate class discussion more consistently. We also strayed far away from the syllabus. Homework assignments were canceled and not rescheduled until the very end of the semester. The writing assignments were not graded like the syllabus said they would be, and we only had one of the two assigned. By the time the credit d deadline arrived (December 10th), we only had three homework grades in, the last from October 7th. That is literally two months without any grades. Moreover, the feedback we received was just a couple of sentences, even if paired with a bad grade. In my first assignment, I received a low B and only a couple of sentences of feedback. It was unclear how to perform well in the class."

                "Yes! Great senior economics seminar, especially if you want less math and more history! Very important for economics majors to understand the ways in which the economic system has been and continues to be discriminatory.",
                "Not at all. This is the worst class I have taken at Yale. Not only did I learn absolutely nothing, but I spent the entire semester unsure how I was doing in the class and receiving little to no feedback. I would sit there while Jaynes lectured for just shy of two hours about topics that were convoluted, previously covered already, or just random stories. I ended up taking the class for credit because, by the deadline, we had literally three homework grades in. That was roughly 15% of our grade. Moreover, the last graded assignment was from October 7th, and the deadline to credit d was December 10th. \r\n\r\nEven if you are interested in these topics, do not take this class. You will not learn anything, be frustrated with the lack of transparency, have no idea what your grade is, and dread going every week. Not worth it. \r\n\r\nI read the course reviews and thought I would have a different experience. I did not."
