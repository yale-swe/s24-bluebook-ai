                "I learn about the different sources of energy used by the society, and policies aim to reduce the use of energy and promote the most efficiency. I develop many insights when considering energy use, considering the environmental impacts, costs, but also impacts to the society such as unemployment and subsidy.",
                "Through preparing for the final presentation, I looked into different resources and information to know more about the buildings and their internal structure of helping the building to become more sustainable. The different systems (their pros and cons) gave me a good sense of what system should be implemented and what shouldn't be. The slides in class was also very useful, as it was my first time knowing about the Duck curve.",
                "I learnt how the way we generate and use energy has to change in order to meet more sustainable environmental standards (especially in the United States and China), and gained insight about technologies that can be used to do this. I now have a better understanding on concepts such as co-generation, magnetic levitation and pumped storage, which I had never heard about previously. I learnt how to better analyze energy systems, and make estimations, which are very useful skills. I have also learnt more about the science of global warming, solar photovoltaic and lithium batteries.",
                "I gain the better understanding of heat generating, energy policies in each country. I also developed the skills of  managing time on presentation and how to give a lecture in a better way.",
                "Exploring the impact of environmental policies on different aspects of the environment, particularly focusing on the California case, reveals intriguing insights. Additionally, the concept of CO2 capture caught my attention with its novelty. While my previous belief centered around relying solely on technological advancements to decrease CO2 emissions, the notion of capturing and recycling carbon dioxide presents an appealing alternative.",
                "The method of approach when dealing with energy related problems.\r\nDifferent methods of power generation and their strength and weaknesses.\r\nElectric, hydrogen cars and the challenges that they face.\r\nYale's power generation method(cogeneration).\r\nTypes of renewable energy and the duck curve."

                "For weakness, I felt like the professor talked too much for the lectures and did not really give chance to participate and engage in discussion. The mid term exam could have been more general and context based.",
                "Lots of useful knowledge and good to know about the key terminologies, and lots of guest lectures to listen to their advices and options. But the course is a little bit fast paced, as we need to understand and take in lots of information in one lesson.",
                "Strengths\r\n- Interesting, relevant content taught in a real world context. It was interesting to learn how Yale manages their use of energy through co-generation. \r\n- Visit to Kroon Hall was very fun\r\n- Very insightful guest lecturers, especially the talk we had about Bitcoin.\r\n- Sufficient homework/good workload, the questions helped me to better understand different concepts learnt in class. \r\n- I learnt a lot through the research I made for my presentation.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- Sometimes the lectures felt too long, maybe could be improved by having more class discussions at times.\r\n- It would have been useful to visit the power plant at Yale.\r\n- Personally, I am more interested in science, so for me it would have been more valuable if the course expanded more on chemistry and physics.",
                "I think the strengths of the course is that it really It gives us knowledge and alerts us to the looming energy crisis. The weaknesses of the class is that there are just too many things to remember and the materials are a lot .",
                "The lecture was effectively structured and presented in a manner that is easily comprehensible for students who are not majoring in the subject.",
                "The professor is very passionate and knowledgable about physics/energy and etc.\r\nJust a great class overall."

                "I will, because my friend studied AP environmental science and is planning to do environmental engineering in the future. So she would be very interested in learning more about environmental related courses.",

I came into the course not knowing much and with limited knowledge, however the explanations and lectures were relatively easy to understand and insightful. I would recommend it to all students, even those who don't have a lot of understanding.",
                "Yes i would definitly recomend this course to another student because the topic we worked on really need to be focued on by others and widely spread the situation we are facing right now. With the development of society, environmental problem has always been a factor that we need to take into account, although it is often neglected.",
                "I highly recommend this course to students who have an interest in the environment. Additionally, the professor provides a few guest lectures that contribute significantly to our foundational knowledge. The course curriculum is designed with accessible materials and a variety of examples, ensuring a well-rounded learning experience.",

                "I am planning to take Economics related courses in my uni, so possibly wouldn't touch much on environmental related courses, but by combining all the sustainable developments and systems I have learnt, it would be a good idea to merge economics and sustainability together. I will also use these knowledge in my EPQ essay, as I am writing about why institutional investors are investing into sustainable energy, so it would be very useful.",
                "I'm interested in pursuing environmental studies in college along with engineering, therefore the content that I learnt during this course was useful in that sense. Overall, the course inspired me to do more research on energy and ways in which the environment can be protected and global warming can be reduced. I strongly believe that global warming will be very significant issue in the future, and I am interested in doing engineering and work with renewable energy and sustainable initiatives in the future.",
                "So i am really interested in Bio information and Medical enginearing, so when i get into college, i am going to use the knowledge and the skills as a foundation to develope my future career, which would always remind me of energy problem around the world and pay more attention on it. Hopefully i would be attending some of activities or research in this area in the future."
