                "I learned how to creatively think for myself, what makes a musical theatre song great, and what my process is for creating. As someone who has never truly done this before, the classs workshop form and collaborative manner was effective in learning how I create.",
                "I learned a lot about the principles of composition and about what goes into crafting a musical theater song!",
                "Starting from zero, familiarity with the musical theater idiom and canon is independent work; but building on that, you get to develop basic intuition and songwriting skills as they apply to the medium. You write a song a week-- starting with just getting a sense for lyrics, or just building the music out of the lyrics, and finally both-- and by the end you get a pretty good sense of how to approach each element of that composition."

                "I think this courses strengths were the structure. Building up to writing our own fully composed pieces with our own lyrics by having smaller projects focusing on solely composition and solely lyrics was incredibly helpful.",
                "The course has exciting assignments every week. It never got old. Every class, we would just listen, read, and review everyones song. There was no formula or lesson to follow. We learned through experience, which was the best way to learn.\r\n\r\nOf course, there could be more improvement on how to compose, although this isnt a class that teaches how to transcribe music or anything on notation. Again, we learned by doing.",
                "The course was really fun and informative!",
                "This course demands a lot workload-wise, and even more if you lack foundational piano skills or familiarity in the idiom. That is not a weakness-- the course is very much doable as long as you work on those throughout the course, and have a decent music background coming in-- but all in all these do demand a lot of time and effort. Still, Josh is an amazing professor-- his feedback is invaluable, and the class environment is super open and chill. It's an intense but accessible songwriting course and in that regard there are no weaknesses to speak of.",
                "My favorite class taken at Yale.",
                "The weekly song assignments were an exciting and challenging way for us to practice and improve our composition skills. Perhaps there could have been more lessons on music theory and the craft of composition, but overall it was a fun and enjoyable class to come to every Friday."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Josh is an incredible professor who can articulate ways to improve composition extraordinarily well. I gained so much from all of the feedback I received on my own work, as well as from watching and listening to the analysis\/critiques of other students works.",
                "Yes! If you want to learn how to write for musical theatre, this is the course for you, especially if you have some experience with music and have never composed musical theatre before.",
                "Would definitely recommend!",
                "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale! But beware-- if you lack basic theory or songwriting experience, it can be quite a challenge, especially if you're coming in not super well versed in the idiom or with the piano. I came in with zero intuition regarding songwriting or composition, and by the end, I did develop enough to produce a decent final project, but this class really demands your A game to get through assignment to assignment. It's definitely a challenge worth taking-- the class is amazing and you learn a lot from both Josh and your peers-- but be warned that things might be quite difficult if anything happens over the semester to throw you off your game. Still this class provides an invaluable experience for any aspiring composer\/songwriter, and it should definitely be on your radar.",
                "I'd recommend the course to anyone excited by the idea of composing and performing a song every week, or looking to build experience in songwriting"
