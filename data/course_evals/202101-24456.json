                "Yes, if you need to fill your language requirement or are genuinely interested in learning Chinese and connecting more with your Chinese side as a Chinese-American. This class is a lot of work so be prepared to consistently spend an hour or two a day on reading quizzes, dictation, homeworks, studying for tests, essays, oral recordings, etc. Chen Lao Shi is super nice, helpful, and a fantastic teacher. Her slides are amazing and if you pay attention, you will more than equipped to learn a lot and do well. This is also a great way to forge a connection with other Chinese-American students and bond over our similar experiences. This was super practical stuff I was able to export in my own life with my family.",
                "Yes! Chen lao shi is amazing.",
                "Yes! This course is very intensive, but you learn so many characters and aspects of Chinese culture. The class discussions are very enjoyable as well because the teachers create a calm but fun environment.",
                "Yes! Great for any student interested in Mandarin, particularly regarding reading and grammer.",
                "Yes, I think if you want to learn Chinese as either a complete non-Heritage novice or a heritage student who only knows a couple of phrases and sentence. It doesnt matter what level you start at because you will definitely improve by the end of the year! And visiting Asia anytime afterwards will make this experience all the more worth it."
