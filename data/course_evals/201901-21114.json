    "I learned about the complexities of the Second World War, how one front affected another, how ideology determined strategy, and how to evaluate various claims about the reasons for Allied victory. More importantly, I learned how to write a 20+ page research paper, where to look for sources, how to craft an argument, and how to tie that argument into ongoing debates in the field.",
    "Overview on World War II",
    "I feel as though I was taught a comprehensive view of the second world war.",
    "I learned a lot about the Second World War. The readings and discussions were very well organized and informative.",
    "I think that I improved my writing and research skills, especially in the field of international history with which I didn't have much experience.",
    "The course explored the history of the Second World War on the global stage. We analyzed the military flow of the conflict, the war's social and economic ramifications, and its context in the interwar and postwar orders. You are taught how to write and research history in a serious way.",
    "I learned a lot about the global theater of the Second World War, from the perspective of all of the players (rather than just a European perspective).",
    "This class was very insightful and I learned out to write a proper research history paper."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - this course encourages participation, is well organized, and invites you to be excited about the material. Frequent check-ins about the research paper ensure you are on the right track throughout the semester and get the most out of the project. Professor Johnson ably leads discussion and, with his command of facts and figures, injects ideas and statistics into the conversation. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Wish we met more often!",
    "Amazing course - no weakness. Very interesting reading and course content and great discussions.",
    "Class was a good combination of Professor Johnson \"teaching\" us and student contribution. Readings were interesting and the final project is broken down in such a way which ensured students actually invested and produced meaningful pieces of work at the end rather than a rushed paper at the end of finals period, for example.",
    "The course was great overall.",
    "It was kinda just awesome.",
    "The course does an excellent job at  covering the conflict evenly across the globe. It captured not just the facts and history, but the personal narrative, excellently. You learn not just what happened in the war, but also about the experience of fighting it. It teaches you to become a more effective writer and historian, and strategist.",
    "I think maybe some more in-class small quizzes to keep people engaged with the material so that there is incentive to review it might be helpful.",
    "Strength: Prof. Johnson is very knowledgeable and invested. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The course didn't seem obviously well-suited for a seminar format.",
    "Strengths was Professor Johnson. He was very engaging and all of the students were happy to be in class."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student, although unfortunately for Yale Professor Johnson is moving to Notre Dame next year. I felt as if I learned something new every class. The readings were fascinating and never felt like a chore. The research project provides a great opportunity to learn about the job of a historian. The workload is fair and not overwhelming. Whether you consider yourself a WWII expert or novice, you will learn something and will have no trouble participating in discussions.",
    "Yes 100% - one of the best classes I have taken at Yale",
    "Yes. Gives a broad overview of what actually happened militarily, politically, socially, economically, and strategically during the war.",
    "I would. Professor Johnson is a great teacher and the class was very interesting.",
    "Absolutely! Although too bad it won't be offered again. Professor Johnson is fantastic.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, if they are interested in twentieth-century history, global affairs, military history, strategy, or diplomacy.",
    "Absolutely would recommend; Johnson is a great professor with a wealth of knowledge and a serious commitment to making sure students get helpful feedback.",
    "Yes very interesting for anyone who likes military history."
