                "Professor Evans is a great lecturer and I always enjoyed going to class. I really liked that each homework assignment had you do a little bit of work for your final project, and that there was a focus on learning and understanding, rather than memorizing facts for an exam. I did wish that the homeworks related a bit more to the lectures.",
                "I really enjoyed this course and also enjoyed the small quizzes that Professor Evans included in his lectures! The topics were interesting and very relevant to planetary health concerns we see being addressed in the world today.",
                "I really liked this course and I think Professor Evans was the course's biggest strength. He is such a cool and interesting person who is clearly an expert in his field, so listening to his lectures were always cool.",
                "Strengths: low workload, interesting content if you remain engaged, a cool project that teaches you some fun and interesting things about a specific geologic location. \r\nWeaknesses: low engagement from me and (I would guess) many students in the class. Most students, I imagine, were taking the class hoping for a relatively easy science credit, which is unfortunate but a reality because taking a full load of difficult classes is not easy to do.",
                "Strengths - easy problem sets, well-balanced workload, amazing professor\r\nWeaknesses - lack of clarity from TFs, too many students in the class",
                "Strengths would be that its not to hard to get lost. Questions on the PSETS guide you through and the TF's help you understand if you ever get lost. The PSETS are basically mini parts of the final project. You might not fully understand the stuff you are completing but its an easy-ish class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Evans is super passionate about the topic and has well put together powerpoints often with cool pictures included too. Weaknesses: Homework sets didn't really relate to a lot of the things we learned in class so it was hard sometimes to really pay attention in class when it won't connect to the homework all that much. Also the readings from the book chapters often weren't helpful or particularly relevant to lectures.",
                "weaknesses - the class size made it impossible to engage\r\nstrengths - content and Dr. Evans",
                "knowledge",
                "The lectures were interesting. The homework assignments didn't always feel relevant to the lectures.",
                "Amazing SC credit! I actually feel like I learned a lot despite the low workload. Professor Evans really cares about his students and wants them to learn without the stress of testing. Every week worked a little towards the final assignment which great during finals period.",
                "Great course material and project",
                "The professor is great and lectures aren't dry. The structure of assembling information over the whole semester to put into our final projects is a smart one, and I appreciate that. However, there were many weaknesses to this course that left me quite disappointed. Firstly, the homework assignments were totally disjointed from our lecture content, and were stuffed with wordy and extremely confusing instructions. Thus, I had to go to office hours pretty much every week, and many times the TAs also didn't understand what the questions were asking and admitted that they were poorly written and told me to ignore the questions and just answer questions they asked me in the session. It felt like nothing we did in the homework could actually be applied to the topics in class, and the only helpful aspect was the portfolio sections. As for the final project, it was explicitly advertised as being non time intensive, because it was just us assembling information we've gathered over the course of the semester, but it was by far the longest and most stressful of all my finals this semester. It consisted of three separate parts, an essay, a presentation, and peer feedback on the presentations. The information needed to create the essay and presentation was more than what we gathered over the fall, so I had to do a significant amount of research in addition to compiling the whole semester's work into two separate formats, and the three assignments ended up taking twice as much time as any of my other finals. The amount of time required to do this made it thoroughly unenjoyable and spoiled any exciting aspects of the geology that I was learning about. The workload for the final was frankly unreasonable and the course would be drastically improved by cutting either the essay or presentation part of the final.",
                "Strengths: you get to participate in a semester long project on a city of your choosing. Weaknesses: there was one problem set that required a lot more understanding and I was pretty lost on it after going to office hours, but other than that all of the problem sets were pretty straightforward.",
                "Professor Evans is so energetic, and brings his genuine passion for geology to every single class meeting. He was such a highlight of my semester, and I couldn't recommend taking a class with him moreespecially in this low stakes, introductory environment.",
                "Strengths: We covered many different important aspects of the Earth, so there must be a few topics that you are interested in. We're not tested on the material so we don't have the pressure to memorize the facts, which I think is good for the learning process. I also learned how to use Google Earth and some other datasets better. The course is very structured so it is a systematic introduction to the earth sciences. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Since it covers so many different topics, I only find a few that I'm interested in. Because they are not tested, when I'm not interested I just stop listening and paying attention, maybe I lost motivation to study? This is bad on my part, but still, if I were to pay attention in class compared to those who didn't, I would hope I can get rewarded by gaining a few more points on the grade. I actually hope there is a section so I can engage with the course material in a smaller setting.",
                "Strengths: Professor Evans is super engaging and fun, and does a great job at making complex geological processes sound accessible and interesting. For such a huge lecture class, he does his very best trying to get to know each student's portfolio location. Psets were well-designed and relevant to the lectures, and the instructions were incredibly clear.",
                "Strengths: exceptionally committed and engaged instructor",
                "Strengths: Professor Evans is a great professor! You can tell he is very passionate about geology and wants his students to learn\/succeed.",
                "The strengths of this class is that it was an incredibly relaxed way to pursue a genuine interest in an introduction to the Earth sciences. I learned actually applicable information about the physical world that we lived in, and class was incredibly enjoyable because Professor Evans is literally a comedian and is beyond funny. There are no weaknesses to this class except that if you are a serious science major you will think this class is not serious enough for you. But for non science majors, this is one of the best classes you can take.",
                "I loved everything about this course! Highly recommend to really anyone and everyone at Yale.",
                "A huge strength of this course was the fact that we had to do part of our final project for each problem set. Were it not for this, I have no doubt I would have been overwhelmed at the end of the semester. The problem sets are also a strength in that they really help reinforce the topic we covered the week prior and they're a reasonable length. No weaknesses.",
                "The greatest pro is David Evans, who is hilarious, endearingly nerdy, and ceaselessly passionate. I feel like he was dealt kind of a tough hand, since most of the kids in the lecture didn't share his burning love for geology, but he really worked with what he had. That said, one weakness was availabilitythe closest thing to office hours was a weekly breakfast, which was great fun if you could make it, but he didn't really have a hand in logistics of the assignments. It was all TF's grading things, and at times I felt like their decisions were arbitrary or downright contestable. TFs also held their own office hours, which you had to pre-schedule over zoom. The time slots would inevitably fill up shortly after the release of the homework, and if you needed clarification on something you could either try to grab Evans after lecture (which normally worked great, unless you had another class) or accept that you were out of luck. Finally, the homeworks themselves were at times unexciting to say the least. I literally spent time pouring over a map of the Grand Canyon rendered in neigh illegible 144p and arguing with a friend over whether the shade of purple we were seeing corresponded to the Redwall Limestone or the Temple Butte Formation. At no point during this exercise did I feel I was in any way becoming a better geologist. Finally, it seemed like the course staff were determined to make this not a gut not by covering harder material or testing us in literally any way, but rather by occasionally blasting kids with what felt like hilariously outsized penalties for minor mistakes on psets.",
                "if you like the subject material it is interesting. if not, it can be an absolute joke and you can get nothing out of it.",
                "Lectures were engaging and I appreciated the emphasis on how each topic had relevance to our lives, portfolio project was also a great idea that unified the course. I do think that a section or some discussion element may have helped the course.",
                "The course was enjoyable and the workload was highly manageable. Perhaps more could be done to encourage attendance in lectures.",
                "There could be more quizzes in the course.",
                "While the classes were always interesting and Professors Evans was a great lecturer, I felt that the homework sets only tangentially related to what we were learning in class. I feel like it might've been more effective to have sections once a week instead of having a third lecture to attend on Fridays.",
                "Some of the language on the Psets is pretty ambiguous and makes some of the work a guessing game where you have to do extra work to make sure you aren't penalized for not understanding directions.",
                "Overall, I enjoyed EPS 110  it was a great overview, and we got through a ton of content over the course of the semester. The homework sometimes felt disconnected from the lectures (while not usually particularly challenging, they often required outside research as opposed to relying on info we learned in class). However, this outside research aspect was also something I enjoyed when it related to our portfolio projects; at the beginning of the course, getting to pick any location we liked and spend the semester researching it was a creative and fun way to apply more general knowledge to something specific. It was also satisfying to combine small pieces of information we gained from homework assignments into a greater presentation and paper as our final.",
                "The greatest strength of this course was Professor Evans. He cares tremendously about the success of his students and makes an effort to make opportunities to engage with his students to consult on their \"portfolio locations\" and answer questions.\r\nHomework grading was usually delayed due to the large size of the class. However, this meant that one could not correct some of the mistakes of some of the final homeworks while preparing for the final presentation and paper.",
                "The strength of this course is the engagement with your own chosen locations geography throughout all the homework sets and Into the final project. The Teaching fellows were helpful during the homework assignments. The amount of information given in the lectures was a little overwhelming and some of the concepts were hard to understand from the small amount of time spent on them.",
                "The prof was very engaging and the material was fairly interesting.",
                "A lot of information but pretty fast. PSETs lagged behind lessons.",
                "Strengths: problem sets are completely doable, Prof Evans is friendly and TAs are helpful and responsive. Weaknesses: lectures not recorded, material is truly not that interesting unless you are actually interested in geology, problem sets have very little to do with lectures.",
                "This course was amazing. Just wish the class size was a little smaller to have more one-on-one engagement with the professor.",
                "Strenghts: The professor is great at teaching and is truly passionate for what he does.",
                "The greatest strength of this course is undoubtedly Professor Evans and his enthusiasm! As odd as this might sound, he understood the joy in geology and has a gift for helping students share in that joy. At one point, Professor Evans mentioned that his primary objective was to inspire students to be curious about the natural world, and he did a great job.\r\n\r\nThe greatest weakness of the course, in my view, is the lack of any sort of graded assignments aside from the (very easy) problem sets and the final project. I know! Not necessarily what you expect to hear from a student, and I'll be the first to agree that Dynamic Earth's accessibility is much of what makes it such a special course. The lack of accountability for command of the material though, did make it hard to focus at times, especially when I faced demands from my other courses. Having a quiz or two thrown in, even something simple, would have given me a reason to sit down a review the material on occasion.",
                "This course covered a lot of ground in a semester, and sometimes it felt that certain information wasn't relevant or was difficult to remember in the long term. Because there were no exams, it was sometimes hard to tell which topics we should prioritize over others. That being said, I also appreciated that Dynamic Earth's final project allowed us to focus on the specific aspects of geology that interested us the most.",
                "Could have more office hoursusually only had limited hours on Thursdays and Sundays (HW due on Monday nights). The office hours were sign up basis for 10 minutes, so it could be hard to get a time slot. Also wish that the homeworks were posted sooner.",
                "I think having recorded lectures could have helped me retain information better (though that is a personal preference). I appreciated the small, participation quizzes in the lectures because they were fun and engaging ways to learn about the subject.",
                "This course is interesting, but it meets three times a week, which seemed unnecessary.",
                "Strength: No final exams were great and this class wasn't stressful\r\nWeakness: PSETs felt random and not particularly useful",
                "Strengths--one of the best structured courses I've taken at Yale. The final project is developed through the course of the semester rather than being a big task at the end. Psets are designed to be manageable and of relevant interest to you, rather than purely arcane geological details. \r\nWeaknesses-none",
                "Strengths: 1) Professor Evans is definitely the highlight of this course! 2) The Final Project is very interesting and meaningful because it allows students to develop better understanding of places in the world of importance to them. For me, I learned a lot more about my hometown. 3) The weekly problem sets covered one or a few aspects of the Final Project, which allows the workload to be spread out throughout the semester.",
                "I enjoyed the lack of tests and exams. I felt like i still learned from the class without having the stress that those can cause. The class being a lecture rather than a seminar made it harder to know  the teacher, but the office hours available helped.",
                "Strengths: i love professor evans!! Also i love the structure of the course and how it is pretty much the same workload throughout and not crazy hectic around finals \r\nWeaknesses: I think instructions on HW sets should be more clear. There was a lot of confusion on where to find information or what exactly was being asked",
                "Lecture was very interesting and easy to follow. It was much more enjoyable to just absorb information rather than trying to figure out what is relevant and what is not to completing the assignments. The office hours could be more fleshed out i.e. more TFs or two types of office hours (one general one where TFs can circulate answering general questions and one one-on-one office hours for more specific questions).",
                "Strengths: Really interesting and applicable topic, good lectures, HOC Evans was great and engaging, you learn so much\r\nWeaknesses: It was sometimes hard to get a slot at TF Office hours",
                "Dave Evans is a great professor and I found the content interesting (I'm an EPS major), but something about this course didn't quite work and I'm not sure what it was. Maybe the lack of pressure to retain information (no exams, easy psets) made it harder to focus? Maybe the emphasis on breadth rather than depth of knowledge made the class less meaningful? (Maybe being surrounded by literally hundreds of classmates doing other things during class was distracting?) On paper and in theory, this class is really good, but in practice it was very difficult to stay engaged despite good teaching.",
                "Very engaging lectures and interesting homework assignments. Attendance was graded but only taken once a week, so if you went to 2\/3 of the lectures one week and happened to miss the one with attendance, you got no credit for the two that you did attend.",
                "Homework was very manageable and the final project was not overwhelming."

                "Yea, workload is very manageable, and the content is interesting.",
                "Yes. As a non-STEM person who just signed up for this course to get a science credit, I really ended up enjoying it. It was manageable and accessible and the content was interesting.",
                "YES a great, interesting class with a fun prof and not too intense worklad",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning about geology and related concepts.",
                "This is a good class for people who are interested in geology, who need a SC distributional requirement (like me), and who wouldn't mind doing PSets a week leading up to a (cool) final geological project on a destination of choice.",
                "Yes! If you pay attention there's some truly interesting stuff to learn and take away with you. Professor Evans really cares about people finding geology interesting and getting excited.",
                "Yes, its a great science credit.",
                "If you want a low-workload science credit, sure. If you want to gain a deeper knowledge of the content, sure, but you have to make sure you stay engaged with the course (which many students seemed not to do) and perhaps take the lab, which is smaller and involves closer interaction with Prof. Evans.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student who is in need of a science gut.  If you really want to learn about geology\/are considering majoring in EPS, I would avoid this course only because it is over-crowded with kids who do not take it seriously.  That being said, I think there is a lot to learn in this class should you choose to do all of the reading and note-taking.",
                "YES! An easy and possibly not easy science gut. Except Majestic D likes to say its not a gut. I'll give him that doubt because you won't really know your term grade during the semester that much until after the project. There has not been a single chem major in my class so please keep it that way. There will 100% be times you will not understand something but TF's help you through. Overall, I did not stress over this class. (ATTEND CLASS DAILY FOR PRIZES HE HANDS OUT). Also David is pretty busy but willing to help anyone out. Have fun on his field trips.",
                "If you like Earth science, sure. Otherwise probably not. It was a huge class and a gut but have a I think the structure will change a bit for next year.",
                "Yes, good way to get Sc credit done for a humanities major.",
                "Yes, even to those who will not be pursuing a career in geology. The content is relevant for other fields as well, and also great even for enhancing your general knowledge",
                "yes",
                "If you want an intro to geology, it's good at that. I would highly recommend taking it with the lab component, you'll get a lot more out of the course that way.",
                "Definitely! Professor Evans is amazing and the psets each week don't take long.",
                "Yes. Informative and fun class",
                "No. The information was disjointed and made both lectures and homework feel like a time-suck. The final was a shocking amount of work and definitely not at all like it was advertised. This class became more and more tedious as the semester went on, and the fact that my final, consisting of three separate parts, took longer than the finals in my major and all of my classes this semester, made me deeply disappointed in the the class and its content.",
                "I would recommend this to another student if they are interested in Earth Science or are in need of a science distributional requirement.",
                "If you are looking for a low workload science credit.",
                "Yes! Take this course, Professor Evans is genuinely one of the best you will come across at Yale.",
                "Yes, if you need a light workload but also interesting science credit. You do need to do a lot of work and ACTUALLY have a solid grasp of the course material in preparation for the final essay and final presentation. So I would suggest taking the class if you are genuinely interested in the subject matter. Take the lab section if you can, I'm not personally in it but I've heard good things about it. They have field trips opportunities and touch rock samples to analyze. This is also a really great introductory course in the EPS department, Prof Evans said you can take any EPS classes after this class.",
                "Absolutely. Great science credit where you will actually learn some fun knowledge about the Earth and geology. Workload is very manageable, even though the final pset and presentation took a little longer.",
                "Yes, especially if they were somewhat self-motivated",
                "Yes! It's super fun. Beware, it is a lot of rocks (I went into it thinking it would be a more holistic planet class w\/ more elements of atmosphere and weather... it's LOTS of geology but still very fun and interesting).",
                "I would totally recommend this class to a non-Stem major. This class was the best possible way that I could've pursued my Science distributional requirement because I actually learned some science but it was not stressful, there is no exam, no quizzes, and only one weekly P-set which actually is interesting and facilitates learning. Also the instructor is so funny that lecture is not a bore at all. Also the subject matter is actually interesting, coming from someone who generally does not enjoy science classes.",
                "10000%!!!",
                "Yes! But, to be clear, you need to devote time and energy to this course every week in order to learn and stay on track. The course itself is less stressful than other courses can be and since you have to do part of your final project as part of the weekly problem sets, your workload towards the end of the semester for this course is relatively lesser than it would have been otherwise.",
                "If they're genuinely interested in geology I would; the course provides a good introduction to a wide variety of topics in the field. If they aren't (and are just looking for a science credit), I think this course may become pretty dry pretty quickly.",
                "If you're looking for an easy credit, then kind of; the course really didn't require too much work, but it also feels like there's some randomness in what your grade is between how confusing the instructions are and how mistakes might be interpreted. It's like the homework could be tricky, but not in a way that working harder or paying attention in class would help with. If you're legitimately interesting in pursuing geology, I have no idea if this is the right entry path. For what it's worth, I didn't see many geologists in the class, so I imagine there's some other intro sequence you should be on instead.",
                "dont take this if you want an easy science class! if you are not interested in it at all it will be boring, the work will be super annoying, and you will feel like you wasted a class! that's real time and money! if you are actually interested in earth science which is a very small portion of people who usually take the class, then take it, David Evans is engaging and nice and really cares about the subject. but, given how easy it is, it can become just a joke and you wont know how to do the homework or the final project",
                "Yes, I would recommend this to anyone hoping to get a foundational knowledge of geology. I personally found it really interesting as someone that went into the class with little to know background in the field, I feel that the portfolio project was also a great way to bring in personal relevance.",
                "Yes. For a non-science major, this is a not too overwhelming class that will still provide you with useful knowledge about the world around us.",
                "Yes, it was a fun way to learn about geology.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in earth science! Dynamic Earth has a fair workload, so you have to at least be committed to the subject, but it is a fun course and you learn a lot by studying your portfolio location throughout the term.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who desperately needs a science credit, but there are definitely more intriguing courses out there, especially if you've taken any form of AP or regular environmental science in high school--you'll probably know most of what is being taught already. Despite that, there are some days where everything is super awesome, and you'll be amazed by what the planet does to help us or, sometimes, destroy us.",
                "Yes!",
                "Taking this class was one of the best decisions I ever made.",
                "Yes, I would recommend EPS 110! It's absolutely a helpful overview\/intro course. Lectures were engaging, and even if earth science isn't your favorite thing in the world, it will still inspire an appreciation for earth history and simple everyday landscapes that, prior to the course, you may not have given a second thought.",
                "Yes if interesting in learning more about how earth processes.",
                "Yes, what you learn is very cool.",
                "This is a decent course, but it's not as much of a gut as you probably think it is. Particularly, the final project requires a decent amount of work. It was very hard for me personally to feel interested in the material, but I think someone who is more interested in geology would enjoy it.",
                "I would recommend this to someone who is looking for a science credit and wants to learn about Earth's functions and how it impacts our lives.",
                "Yes! Professor Evans is a wonderfully engaged teacher who, despite his eminence as a researcher and academic, is great at explaining complicated concepts in simple terms, and demonstrably cares about the students in Dynamic Earth. This class is a great way to develop a basic understanding of our natural world and how it came to be, and I would recommend it to all prospective students.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class! If you just want a science credit, this is your class. If you're interested in geology, I also think this is a great class to take. Not everyone engages with the class that much, but I did and I learned a lot. Getting to focus on the geology of a certain area is super interesting.",
                "If you are looking for a fun science credit, absolutely take this class! You definitely get out of Dynamic Earth what you put into it.",
                "Yes would recommend!",
                "Yes. The class was very straightforward and a really good introduction into geology, a science that people don't talk about enough.",
                "Sure, but I'm not sure if there is much to takeaway from this class",
                "Take this course for David Evans. Lovely guy and passionate lecturer who doesn:t believe in swamping you with work.",
                "Absolutely! It's an excellent way to tick off a science requirement that's not too arduous but still quite stimulating. You'll learn a lot of interesting details about your hometown and how it came to be.",
                "Yes, absolutely! Professor Evans is an amazing instructor and a wonderful person. He is super knowledgable about geology and his teaching makes the lectures interesting. Although Dynamic Earth is a big class with 250+ students, he tries his best to make it engaging.",
                "Yes. There is some work required but not much (~1-2 hours per week). You can still learn from the class though, so it is a fun gut class.",
                "Absolutely! It was a wonderful Sc credit for me and was actually engaging even though I am really not academically interested in geology or any of the hard sciences",
                "Yes! This is an engaging intro EPS course that is fun and useful no matter your major or prior knowledge in the discipline. Prof Evans and the TAs were all wonderful, and you definitely come away from the course with a sense of appreciation and curiosity for earth science.",
                "Yes I would because the professor is really great and you learn a lot in a less stressful environment.",
                "Yes! It's very accessible to people who aren't STEM majors and it was really cool to do the portfolio projects.",
                "No, it's boring.",
                "Definitely recommend. Interesting material and very little work. Great extra class to add to a semester.",
                "Yes! This was a great science credit for a non-STEM person. I learned a lot about geology and the earth but wasn't overwhelmed by the material and found it very manageable as someone with no background in earth science.",
                "If you are interested in geology then absolutely. However, it is really easy to become disengaged and fall behind if you are not staying on top of lectures.",
