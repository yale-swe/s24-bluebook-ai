   "comments": [
    "I learned to appreciate Early Music and play an Early Music instrument. As a class, we performed 2 concerts in the Beinecke.",
    "I accrued the knowledge that Zadok the priest was composed by Henry Lawe and sung for court coronations for English royalty.",
    "I really appreciated the opportunity to sample very beautiful music and perform it throughout the semester. This class was a highlight of my week to get to do something different than sit in a class listening to a lecture. I enjoyed the engagement with arts it allowed.",
    "I learned about the Gran Tour, renaissance instruments, and how to sing in various languages!",
    "Early music history",
    "I learned some new music theory. I learned about the sackbut and the some other old instruments. I didn't know there was a difference between a viol and a baroque violin.",
    "I learned about the performance of early music -- specifically in my case, in vocal performance.",
    "How to play the viola de gamba, learned about early European travels, learned about Medieval music, musical temperaments",
    "I learned so much about music performance!",
    "I learned how to somewhat sight read music. I learned about early music and how different music styles came about.",
    "I got to play the Viola de Gamba, I literally learned how to play a new instrument.",
    "I developed my sight-reading and performance skills",
    "Great fun playing Early Music Period instruments (or vocal)",
    "This was the coolest class ever. I learned about Renaissance music, the Grand Tour, and how to play the recorder! This class was incredibly fun and rewarding.",
    "My knowledge of musical techniques from the renaissance era greatly developed with this class. I really enjoyed how thorough this class was in explaining everything surrounding the music that we performed - the science of tuning and temperament, overtones, the historical significance of certain pieces and musical figures. All in all,  felt that  learned a great deal about early music n this course.",
    "I developed a wide knowledge of renaissance music, as well as a knowledge of the culture at that time. I also improved my technical singing ability and music theory throughout this class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Incredibly enlightening to learn about early music. Low workload, high pay off.\r\nWeaknesses: The final was on history, which we didn't really cover during the semester. There was a study guide, but it didn't fully prepare us. So not sure how class did on the final exam.",
    "This course is amazing. Favorite course at Yale.",
    "I think the course was very good at meeting students where they were at. We produced musical performances I was proud of, but it was low stress and very relaxed. Grant made the music accessible and was willing to meet with students to explain more about his excitement for the pieces.",
    "This is the best class for anyone who can sing or play an instrument. Where else will you have the opportunity to casually learn and perform music from the renaissance or hear instruments that are hardly in public circulation anymore? The music is incredibly fun to learn, and each concert has a neat central theme that unites all of the content, and classes are fun to attend!",
    "Nothing, great course! Would maybe like more 1-on-1 time",
    "The selection of music is great. I'm not sure how the course can be improved. I really like it.",
    "Great fifth credit class! It was fun being able to spend 2 hours a week just doing music, plain and simple.",
    "It is such an amazing course. Professor and TA are strengths! I would only recommend maybe a little more one on one time with the viols or actually it was good when we split up into two groups to rehearse just because there were a lot this year.",
    "Strengths: Interesting music, good engagement\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the material was more commonplace\/introduced before the study guide before the final.",
    "I think this class was really fun and the performances in the Beinecke were great.",
    "This course is amazing.",
    "Very engaging. Would like to learn more about the pieces themselves",
    "Strengths: the most fun Yale class I've ever taken, I learned how to play recorder, Grant is nice and is a great conductor, I learned so many interesting facts about Renaissance music, the concerts were SO cool-- we performed in the Beinecke and the audience was always packed, also the food at the reception after the concert was delicious \r\nWeaknesses: none",
    "I honestly do not see any weaknesses in this course. I found that even with only one rehearsal a week, we put together a finished product that was really high quality.",
    "The class is extremely interactive; the 2 hour weekly class is extremely hands on, and the music played is really interesting and enjoyable."

In all, I really enjoyed it. Strong thumbs up for a good 5th class, or a good arts class if that's important to you to have on your schedule",
    "Absolutely take this class! This class is not work or time intensive, but you will learn so much about history and music, performance, and even language pronunciation.",

THIS COURSE IS AMAZING AND SUCH LOW WORKLOAD AND IT IS SO FUN TO LEARN NEW INSTRUMENTS AND PLAY MUSIC TOGETHER DURING CLASS AND THE PROFESSOR AND VIOL COACH ARE GREAT!! YOU ARE MAKING A MISTAKE IF YOU LIKE MUSIC AND DONT TAKE THIS COURSE. IT IS SUPER LOW WORKLOAD TOO AND YOU LEARN STUFF SO IT CANT GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS.",
    "Yes! Great way to learn about music with little stress",
    "YES!!! It's the best way to take a class that is low-stress but you're also learning a lot. This class is the best fifth class.",

    "Yes, it is a great course if you like singing or playing a instrument.",
    "If you are a musician you have to take this class. Unless you hate history or hate choral music. Being a cellist and getting to play the viola de gamba was an experience like I've never had before.",

    "absolutely!! It is a true privilege to take any class with Grant.",

This course, despite only having class one day a week, puts out a simply amazing product during performances. This course is at the same time easy, stress-free, fun, and also incredibly productive.",
    "Yes. I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in music history, or wants to improve their musical technique."
