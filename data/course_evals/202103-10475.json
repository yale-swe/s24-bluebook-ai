                "The readings were long but very interesting. The order of topics discussed from week to week was really well organized and everything flowed well together, but it is sometimes difficult to parse the chronology of what happened, since discussion of new topics tends to double back on previous topics. Discussion sections mostly took place in the Beinecke/medical library looking at original materials, and it was really cool to engage with these significant historical treasures. Exams are very fair, and there are only two assignments (short 5 page essays) and you get to pick the topic/due date for each. The only weakness was that Prof. Dal Prete was sometimes tactless about or oblivious to more sensitive topics and lecture was occasionally a little uncomfortable, but it didn't come from a place of malice. Some of the readings were difficult to find on Orbis  the prof should have just provided direct links in the syllabus instead of making us search for them. Sometimes he goes through the slides too quickly before there is time to read/write down/even see everything on them.",
                "I would love to have even more trips to the beinecke and medical library and especially more demonstrations of old scientific instruments. Being able to choose your own deadlines for the two essays is a strength too.",
                "This course was extremely memorable. Lectures were interesting and section meetings were very engaging, especially when we visited the Beinecke and Medical Library to look at documents we discussed in class. Professor Dal Prete also performed several live demos, such as using a model of Galileo's telescope and astrolabes to tell time. I sometimes had difficulty finding reading materials in the library for each week in the course, but that was not a big deal.",
                "great professor, instruction, and fun sections",
                "Few weaknesses",
                "The strengths of this course are the passion of the Professor and the clear message it is trying to convey. It is very clear what the overarching theme or thesis of the course is and how it is true. The weaknesses of this course come from the specific nature of the material in each section. Because the course covers such a wide time scope, but the topics in each unit are very specific, it quickly becomes a course of just memorization. In addition, I believe using section to present personal research papers was a misuse of time that could have been used for discussion of complex course material.",
                "Some of the readings were too specific and not engaging. Otherwise class was great.",
                "strengths: very interesting subject and topics. professor very passionate. weaknesses: way too much reading, which got repetitive. a little difficult to understand the professor. sometimes the professor provided a summary of lecture, which was super helpful, as lectures could feel a little rambly.",
                "It would be helpful if the lectures were more focused on the readings.",
                "Strengths: interesting topics\r\n\r\nweakness: Each week was a different topic which did allow for lots of topics but there could be some discontinuity in the lesson plans"

                "This is a fun history course that doesn't require any previous knowledge and challenges preconceptions of \"the Renaissance.\" Low workload, really well organized lectures, and mostly well organized readings and slides. Sometimes tactless when discussing sensitive topics.",
                "Absolutely. It's a great use of Yale's resources to be able to literally hold a letter from Isaac Newton, to look at the stars through a gallilean telescope, or to look at old atlases of what life was like 100s of years ago. This is a good class for anyone interested in science, medicine, technology, history etc. because it really makes you rethink the past and present in terms of who influenced the trajectory of the world as we know it and why. It totally flips history as we know it on its head, but in a well laid out, intentional, and thought provoking way.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Especially as a student of the sciences, it was so insightful to learn where our modern system of scientific inquiry comes from. This course helped me unlearn some misconceptions about history that are fairly common. Between the visits to the Beinecke and the quality of the lectures, I think this course is definitely worth taking.",

                "Yes I would. Interesting course",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they had a specific interest in ancient history with specific foci. The course, while interesting, has little application to anything outside of the course itself.",
                "Yes i would recommend this course.",
