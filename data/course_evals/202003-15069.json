I was able to learn a bit about how memory was formed at a neurological level, but the most interesting part was the formation of memory at a familial and cultural level.

                "This class was so good! Dr. D and the TAs created an environment that was very open and honest and allowed us to intellectually engage with the materials on a deep level while also creating really funny discussions that I looked forward to. They worked really hard to adapt the class to COVID and did so very successfully (see more on that below.) They were patient and generous with their time in relation to the completion of projects and assignments and all the readings and subjects were chosen carefully and were interesting and conducive to discussion.",
                "Strengths: really nice and laid back setting, made for a really productive yet refreshing class after a long day of Zoom, by far one of my only classes that I really wished was in person; the professor (Professor Davis or \"Dr. D\") is so understanding that we are students and cares about his students\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes it can get a bit fluffy, but thats just thats how seminars are",
                "No weaknesses. Strengths were Dr. D and Kavya and Camille, who were so engaging during seminar conversations and so willing to guide the conversation in whatever direction we naturally took.",
                "Strengths: I loved the teaching team! I was quite vulnerable during this class because I felt so comfortable. The people in my class were also great! I enjoyed our deep discussions and how we truly were able to just learn from each other, challenge each other, and grow in our thoughts and analysis. We were also able to do our projects in any medium of our choice, and that was so great as a person interested in art and multimedia work!\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes class could be a bit stagnant if the material was overly complicated, which happened maybe twice over the whole semester.",
                "The course was extremely well-taught, accomodating of pandemic circumstances, and provided a good balance between theory and examples."

                "The three main assignments of the course which initially were all going to be essays turned into more flexible projects that allowed people working virtually to approach the topics creatively and make use of the resources available. I thought that was really successful. The discussions themselves were very successful, a large part of which can be contributed to the style of facilitation by the professor and TAs. The readings were often ranked by priority which was very helpful during virtual learning when sometimes it is not possible to complete all the work by class time. Overall, I think this class was my most successful in terms of adjusting to COVID-19.",
                "Course did probably the best out of all of mine in terms of making COVID as least sufferable as it's been. Whenever something comes up (ex: an artifact from antiquity that relates to the subtopic of memory we're discussing that week) professor or TFs would screenshare for us, they'd do the same with videos, pictures, etc.",
                "I think the whiteboard activities were essential in idea formation and having access to people's ideas as well.",

                "I absolutely would. All the topics and units layered together in really interesting ways and after discussions I often continued to talk about the topics with family and friends. The projects really allowed me to engage with the material in ways I wouldn't have normally, and I feel like I learned a lot.",
