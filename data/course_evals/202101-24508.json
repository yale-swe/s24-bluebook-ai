                "The strength is the mastery grading system which allows multiple chances. However, towards the end, it is concerning that your grade may be greatly affected if you can't achieve the last couple masteries. Additionally, the amount of assignments due every week was difficult to manage with other classes, but the professor was generous and understanding, so that allowed the workload to level out.",
                "I think the professor and his grading system were strengths. I believe that mastery-based grading forced me (in a way) to relearn the material that I wasn't understanding instead of accepting my fate of getting a bad grade. The professor was a big strength because I felt comfortable approaching my professor and was engaged in class because he was able to make the classroom environment good."
