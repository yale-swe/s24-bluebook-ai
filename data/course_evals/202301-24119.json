                "I might suggest more active floorwork during class time, as staying focused on taking in information and having discussion for most of a four hour class was pretty difficult at times. However I did really appreciate the freedom in discussions to take them wherever was most interesting to usit led to a lot of really interesting and beneficial discussions about the state of American theater today.",

                "Yes. if you care about art or theater this will open your mind.",
