            "comments": [
                "Strengths - some concepts were interesting\r\nWeakness - very long zoom session, felt like a lot of pointless work, kits were pointless, very stressful, harsh grading every now and then",
                "PLAs were graded harshly; maybe indicate expectations another time? 166L also felt a bit harder compared to 165L in terms of the conceptual part of understanding the lab but that may be just me.",
                "Strengths: The course was put together very well. The best possible experience for a virtual lab.",
                "Strengths: easy to navigate and does not demand or consume too much of your time. Weakness: grading is fairly subjective and based on your TA, and feedback from labs was not given in a timely manner. We received feedback on our PLAs after all of them had been completed, and points had been taken off for the same things on multiple reports (something that could have been fixed in later assignments had the feedback been given earlier).",
                "This course was very effective in promoting the interpretation of equations and the meaning of the various variables therein, but it often felt as though the equations themselves, as well as the experiments used to demonstrate their applicability, were simply invented from whole cloth, and had no application outside of the narrow realm of basic science pertaining to electricity or optics. The hands-on component with the kits was often equally frustrating, as concepts which had seemed so simple and fundamental in the course videos proved extremely difficult to recreate in real life without any guidance.",
                "Strengths: This course was set up in a way so that students had plenty of opportunities to ask questions to their TFs and get the help they need to work through each of the labs.",
                "strengths: manageable workload for assignments, low stakes if got things wrong, geared towards learning\r\nweaknesses: had to do experiments without knowledge of concepts sometimes\r\nareas for improvement: more instruction",
                "I really appreciate that the instructors seemed responsive to student feedback, and that the policies in this course were clear and did not cause me any unnecessary stress. One way this course could be improved is if it did not occasionally run ahead of my non-lab physics course. However, I appreciate the detailed explanations in the lab handouts, which I'm sure were made with this in mind.",
                "Given the circumstances I felt that this course was structured well. I appreciated having the kits to do the PLAs, and also only having either a lab or a PLA each week but not both was very helpful.",
                "Strengths: I think I learned more from this course than my actual physics course. The lab handouts were so well written and clear. Weaknesses: This class was SO much work. I understand that a virtual lab is very difficult but honestly it was hard to learn this way. I hope they won't have to do online again.",
                "This course ran much more smoothly than PHYS 165L. Not having a PLA every week was way less overwhelming.",
                "Strengths: The teaching staff really catered to their students' needs. Specifically, Professor Barrett and Professor Cahn were very understanding and prioritized their students' learning and well-being. They designed the course in a way that facilitated learning but also considered the challenges evoked by the current pandemic. Every time I spoke with Professor Cahn, he was able to clarify my concerns and explain the concepts in a way that was easy to understand. The lab videos were fun and engaging due to Professor Cahn's enthusiasm and love for teaching. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps Professor Cahn could hold weekly office hours. My TA wasn't great at explaining lab concepts, so I often had to schedule a meeting with another Professor to fully understand the labs.",
                "The course material was hard to understand because a lot of it was not introduced in lecture. The TA also did not give good explanations on what we should understand before doing the lab. Also, the PLAs did very little to further my understandings of the material covered in lab.",
                "The labs are fun and informative. There is no weakness of this course.",
                "They got better by the end of the term, but some of the beginning labs were far too long for the time scale. I did like the PLAs where you could experiment by yourself though.",
                "Actually loved the PLAs. They took a while but I feel like I learned the most by doing them. Keep doing those, I'd say",
                "As the course was online, it was difficult to connect with peers if there were questions that arose after lab ended. Additionally, being on zoom for 3 hours was very draining. However, the class was very well formatted for online learning and easy to follow. Prof. Barrett was incredibly helpful and very excited to teach, as was my TA.",
                "I think the labs were very interesting and I learned a decent amount, but the post-lab assignments (PLAs) didn't help much in understanding the material.",
                "by nature of virtual labs, the labs were much less engaging as it largely consisted of watching videos of someone else do a lab; this also made the labs much easier imo; fewer but more engaging post-lab activities (compared to PHYS 165) which I liked",
                "Seems like a solid curriculum with a solid staff. Would be better in-person.",
                "I think the lab focuses too much on format and less on getting a good understanding of the physical concepts. I think a better balance could be struck between the two.",
                "The PLAs being cut back was great because I learned something, yet didnt feel too overwhelmed by the material",
                "It's a lot of work/writing esp for a virtual semester where we can't actually do the labs.",
                "weaknesses - lab handouts were often long and convoluted, was sometimes hard to get adequate help due to  zoom  formatting, but really  appreciate the  effort all the teaching staff put in to help us!",

                "I believe that in person labs will be better than online learning, but this lab format still did well despite this weakness.",
                "The strength of the course is the professors, they know what they are doing and are willing to help.",
                "The professors and TFs were every engaged in trying to conduct this course to the best of their abilities. For a virtual lab, theres only so much one can do to provide the actual experience.",

                "This was without a doubt one of the most well-run and taught courses I've ever taken at Yale, and in STEM no less. Everything about this course was great, with the one exception that I wish it aligned better with the physics lectures, but this was not a constant problem.",

                "I definitely enjoyed how interactive the labs are and I appreciated how the teaching team adapted the labs for a virtual format.",
                "Strengths : professors enthusiasm and dedication\r\nWeakness: disparity in tas",
                "Strengths: instructors and TF were very helpful and easily available, encouraged working with peers since we always had a constant lab partner and then were rotated to work with a different lab group each week, grading was pretty quick and straightforward, no final exam, we were allowed to skip one PLA when it was our break day, pre-lab quizzes were pretty straightforward, professors communicated very frequently and organization of the class was pretty clear \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lab handouts were often confusingly worded and even my TF was often a little confused as to what they were asking, some labs felt really repetitive in terms of constantly watching videos and then plugging numbers into LoggerPro, lab notes are extremely tedious",
                "I think the professors made the most of the difficult situation this semester.  Not ideal to be taking a lab online but I still feel like I got something out of it.",
                "The workload made it hard to stay engaged and curious",
                "This course did very well with organization and keeping the students informed about the course. I don't have any improvements for this course.",
                "Strength: the enthusiasm of most of the instructors and TAs are unparalleled! They really try to make it entertaining and flexible for a wide background of students\r\n\r\nWeakness: Well, the experiments are pre-recorded this year so the students really did not do much hands-on work, sometimes it felt like there did not need to be a synchronous portion at all. Though I would also agree that this was made a lot easier than having to set up the experiments by ourselves in person.",
                "-",
                "I think the lab was generally well organized and geared towards learning.",
                "I thought the course was generally too much per laboratory session and the TA was unhelpful. I thought its strength lied in the take-home practical activities.",
                "It is hard to administer a lab online, but I think that watching the videos during class and getting to plan a post lab assignment ourselves after class really makes up for the lack of hands on learning that comes with a virtual lab. I think the class is well planned out and structured, and the expectations was very clear from the beginning.",
                "The course taught a lot of different aspects of electricity and magnetism, which gave a broad view of the field. The course provided ways to work with data, so we can explore certain concepts first-hand. The teaching team was very receptive to changes and questions. With that said, sometimes the material seemed beyond the scope of the class, and it may take a couple of weeks to fully understand the material (like Fourier transform). The post-lab activities did not feel like it added very much to the learning experience. Sometimes the labs were quite long and couldn't be finished during the session, so there are certain parts of the lab I did not fully understand.",
                "Strengths: Instructors are super involved and helpful, and really want to help you learn!! Lab reports can be somewhat tedious though.",
                "Strengths: The way the instructors changed up the course this semester to reflect a lighter workload was extremely considerate and made the course more enjoyable for me. I felt like I could complete the assignments and still feel engaged with the content instead of just submitting assignments nonstop.",
                "The strengths of this course is that the assignments were fair, had good grading, and really were structured to help us learn. Also, being able to work in groups was very helpful. Also, the TF's and professors were all very supportive.",
                "I think that we missed some content by only having an actual lab every other week (due to the break days).",
                "strengths- professors we're fun and engaging\r\nweaknesses- lab handouts we're sometimes disorganized and confusing",
                "The instructors worked incredibly hard to make this course a positive experience during this semester. Overall, I think the course was organized well, but the labs around the middle of the semester were often excessively long and it felt like there were portions that were a bit repetitive. I do really appreciate how much care went into the course though! \r\n\r\nAlso, it was frustrating that points were taken off on the labs due to small non-conceptual errors (ie. showing work for simple steps). The overall grading scheme in this course is difficult since most students do very well on labs, so even minor deductions can lead to a less-than-desired curved grade. One way to get around this would be to grade the write-ups (the one page summaries) more harshly, which I think would actually benefit the students by rewarding those who put in the time, even if they may have made a few small errors in their lab notes.\r\n\r\nWish it was 1 credit!!",
                "This class, in my opinion, was very poorly set up. I don't think the virtual labs were helpful in learning any actual physics, but understand that there were few options with COVID.",
                "strengths: very helpful and understanding teaching team",
                "strengths: the kits were helpful for COVID, the videos and resources were very thoughtful\r\n\r\nweaknesses: this class is very difficult to teach online - hopefully it can be taught in person next semester",
                "Strengths: instructors obviously cared a lot about students, feedback was clear, PLAs were a good compromise and helped recreate some semblance of normalcy",
                "This class was helpful in how it gave me a somewhat hands-on experience working with components of circuits and the tools to record measurements. However, sometimes it fell out of sync with the corresponding lecture, which made it harder to understand what was being discussed in the background.",
                "Strengths: the professors and instructors are very supportive, and are always eager to help students. Instructors try to make demonstrations, lab handouts, etc. as understandable and engaging as possible, without compromising the quality of the material. The course did suffer from being a virtual lab, since the students were unable to perform most of the experiments, but the instructors tried their best to make up for this via take-home lab materials and activities, which were interesting.",
                "The videos and assignments were very well though out and detailed. It helped me learn a lot of the concepts well. The sindeYkits were very fun to use and I am glad they were implemented.",
                "Strength was much higher flexibility and administrative care than last semester.  This sequence was a huge success because it took all the short comings of last semester and combined them with the high points.  Great care was taken to not make the same mistakes twice and the instructor level teamwork was phenomenal.  \r\nOnly weakness was having all the supplies takes up volume, but it was a necessary tradeoff to staying virtual.",
                "This class did not align with Physics 171 coursework very well. I did not feel that there was much support from staff during lab hours. The PLAs were a nice break from Zoom lab during break weeks, but they were actually quite time consuming.\r\n\r\nI really appreciated the weekly emails from the lab professors and Professor Cahn's kit delivery, though.",
                "Definitely harder online but they adapted it pretty well. Course was interesting and a fine lab course.",
                "I think that this course was as good as can be expected from a virtual lab course. It was easy to get help during the labs and labs were modified well to accommodate the virtual environment.",
                "The strengths of this course definitely included the instructors, TAs, and their willingness to engage with us through a difficult online semester. It is my own fault for not engaging with the course enough.",
                "The strength is the lab design. the labs did help students explore the concepts from the physics lecture series. The weaknesses are the instruction (and the boundaries crossed by instructors), the lack of respect for student time, and the confusing nature of the PLA assignments.",
                "Compared to last semester, there was more transparency. There were a lot more reminders and information being sent out constantly on how the course is progressing and what all we need to do or be on the lookout for. A weakness would be the lack of collaboration within a breakout room. While it was not completely silent, cameras off, muted, it was somewhat difficult to collaborate with the Zoom format since the labs could be mostly done by oneself, so everyone's pacing is different.",
                "While in person learning would've been much better, this course was optimized for online learning and the efforts made by the course heads were appropriate and effective.",
                "plas were stressful and annoying - the weeks that were plas should've just been break weeks for everyone",
                "A strength was the organization and clarity of the lab handouts. It was somewhat tedious and hard to focus when the labs were extremely long but the second half of the semester was much better than the first. I also appreciated how they accommodated our break weeks with a smaller workload.",
                "Standard lab course; curve was quite harsh",
                "Weaknesses: stupid grading scale. This class was curved downwards at the very last minute because too many people scored As and high scores. This was such that someone who scored a 95% received an A- and 93% received a B+, etc. To improve the class, do not do this and invalidate students' hard-earned scores.",
                "A major strength of this course was the flexibility, especially with the lack of labs during break weeks, allowing a bit of a reprieve every so often. I don't think the course itself had many weaknesses, but there were sometimes where the answer to a certain part of the lab or conceptual bases for experiments wasn't always clear, making it hard to complete the experiment.",
                "Strengths: learning science, the DIY labs were also fun and some of the most learning I did.\r\nWeaknesses: it did get kind of stale and repetitive after a while of looking at the lab steps and then following the directions.",
                "This class was pretty terrible. It was so repetitive, and labs crammed in so much stuff that it was all about getting it done rather than learning. This semester there was certainly less busy work than phys 165L which was a major improvement, but the labs themselves were much worse, and much more boring."

                "The virtual lab activities were for the most part fairly simply laid out, though in some cases the proscriptions necessary to complete them seemed arbitrary, with no basis in prior work. The lab videos for the course started out just as engaging and interesting as last semester, but by the end were serving to actively lower my engagement. The virtual lectures at the start of lab were rarely useful in any real sense, and felt cursory. The mandatory use of the kits in a highly unstructured manner often led to dead ends and frustration, as it felt as if we were provided no support but expected to generate results on par with those created in the highly structured lab environment.",

I think it was very well done. I feel that I do lack knowledge of what to do in a physical lab. However, I think this is owing to the virtual format, and the intructors did a good job of trying to make up for this by providing us with great opportunities to have hands-on experiences using our lab kits. I just chose not to take advantage of them because there were easier alternative assignments.",
                "I thought that the virtual labs were pretty effective at replicating the in-person experience, but obviously you learn more when a lab is hands-on. Occasionally, the setup was not entirely clear, so I might have appreciated different angled videos, more photographs, or things like that to appreciate what was physically going on. I enjoyed the post-lab activities more than I expected, although my self-directed learning wasn't the most efficient.",

However, because there was very little guidance about how to use the equipment, and it was much faster and beneficial for us to choose a virtual PLA option, I did not interact with the physical equipment very much at all this semester.",

The distribution wasn't well planned, and it was at very random times so if you didn't check your email fast enough it didn't work. In general, the videos were good and helpful, but a couple were unclear.",
                "PLAs were lovely and helped me learn the material best. It was hard to truly understand circuits, however, just by watching them. Which isn't the fault of the teachers or anything. It's just more difficult to do that over zoom.",

It was easy to know where class materials were located and how to access them. \r\nHowever, I wonder if it would have been more helpful to do the lab on your own (during the allotted lab period) And then to meet for 30 minutes after lab to check answers and address any questions.",

They did the best that they could, but there is no question that the virtual version simply cannot compare to the in-person lab. The videos of the professors performing the experiments were somewhat effective, but I never walked away feeling as though I could reproduce what they did just by observation.

                "The breakout room format was very effective. We got to interact with students to work on the lab. The TF rotating around to breakout rooms was extremely helpful as we always got our questions efficiently answered. The format of having lab sections on weeks with no break days and post-lab activities (PLA) on weeks with break days made lab less stressful compared to Phys 165L. LoggerPro and videos was the best they could given the pandemic, so at least we could learn and analyze actual data. I did not find the post-lab activities to be a particularly useful learning experience as I often had inaccurate data collected or spent a lot of time thinking about what to do and if I had the materials to complete the PLA.",

Assuming that students only utilized this within reason, this could help make the course structure a bit better.",

This semester, a lot of the work we did felt like busy work and the labs often drastically varied in length. Going into the lab, you wouldn't know if it was going to take you 45 min or >5 hrs. Last semester, the labs were much more consistent and the relevance of what we were doing better explained.",

Physics lab as a whole suffered from the virtual format (not the instructor's fault, this was just by nature), but the instructors tried their best to make up for this in a variety of ways, including trying to describe what would happen in-person, shipping hands-on lab materials for out-of-lab activities, etc.",

                "I think that the adaptation of the labs for a virtual format was very successful, as all the information and demonstrations were conveyed in a clear and interesting way. The at home portion of the course (PLA labs) was helpful for getting more hands on with the course material, but the suggested areas to explore lacked variety towards the middle of the semester.",
                "This course was a rare example of a course that was better online. the strength of this course is that the online format allowed convenience and flexibility for an otherwise tedious requirement. The choice this semester to only have PLAs on the weeks when there were no labs was better than the first semester. The PLAs were also more interesting than the ones we completed first semester. However, the PLAs are incredibly time consuming. In order to do an experiment that would earn us full points, we needed to put in significantly more time htan instructors seemed to understand. I was spending upwards of 6 hours on each PLA. This was what was necessary in order to get enough on the page to get full credit. In addition, the expectations for the PLA were completely unclear, and with TAs that often were more than a month and a half behind on grading, it wasn't sufficient to be expected to wait for feedback on previous assignments. (I had actually completed all of the PLAs before I got feedback on the second one). In addition, the sindykits were completely unnecessary. I did not use any of the objects that we were given. Instead, the objects took up a significant amount of space in our small dorm rooms, and we were required to retrieve them with close to zero notice (we'd get emails from Professor Cahn that said things like \"I'm outside on cross campus now\") which was incredibly stressful. It should be made clear that these kits are not essential so that students could choose to not pick them up, or we should have been given more notice about when the pick up windows would be. Finally, class communications could have been significantly more clear. I often had to email my TA or meet with other students in the class in order to puzzle through what the emails meant. These emails were unclear, wordy, and inconsistent. They were slightly improved from first semester, in which we truly could not figure out what was required of us, but still, instructors should attempt to write more concise, clear emails.",

                "It's required so it doesn't really matter. Overall, it was too hard for students who aren'g going into physics as a career even though the instructors cared.",
                "Yeah! Really felt like a 0.5 workload class. Hopefully they still have PLAs. I feel like I learned a lot from them :)",
                "If you need to take a physics lab, you should take this class. It is a fair amount of work, however, it is well organized and you can learn quite a bit. That being said, if you do not need to take this class for your major, I would not recommed it.",

                "Yes if necessary.",
                "Yes? It's not bad for what it is. I appreciated that they stopped doing a practical exam this semester and that the workload was more manageable than the last. This class is not hard but also not fun, and the 3 hours + spent every week were not the most enjoyable.",
                "this semester with the break week-PLA set up was much less stressful than last semester when  we'd have multiple assignments due on the same day",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student that needs to take a physics-lab course. This class helps strengthen the concepts from 181/201.",

                "No. Do not take this course if you do not need it for a requirement. It's a waste of time. Literally. I learned absolutely nothing and the laboratory manuals are so ambiguous. Lab notebook, write ups and PLA's were so time consuming. I learned very little for the amount of time required to do well in this course.",
                "If this person is interested in Physics, I would suggest this class to them.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who needs to take it, but I cannot comment on taking it as an elective since I never actually got to perform the experiments.",
                "Yes! Deciding to take 166L instead of 205L was definitely a stress reliever for me. I was still able to learn and apply physics lab concepts while better managing my time.",

It is not necessarily very hard, but it is pretty tedious and dry at times, but this may largely be due to the fact that it's incredibly hard to adapt lab activities to the online format. If you need it, I think the course is pretty reasonable and it is nice if you're able to collaborate with a friend on the lab notes and report.",

                "This course is probably mandatory if you are reading this, so just enjoy it as much as you can! The main debate is probably between this and the 205L, which would really be better paired with at least 200/201 and or for people really interested in Physics (and a bit of programming).",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It is a great way to understand and apply the courses taught in the intro physics classroom. The labs are very engaging and are a great supplement for PHYS 171/181.",
                "I would recommend this course if you want to learn more about electricity and magnetism. The course mainly focuses on these topics, and you explore key concepts with data and think about applications. The teaching team cares a lot about students. However, this course sometimes felt long with some confusing concepts.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student looking for a physics lab class. This class was low stress while also being a great learning opportunity. I developed my understanding of physics concepts without ever really being pressed for time or worrying about what my grade would turn out to be. I also enjoyed the collaborative nature of the class and the emphasis on succinctness.",
                "I would recommend this course.",
                "You probably have to take this course. Overall it is pretty solid! But some of the labs are pretty long and grading can be frustrating.",

                "Would not recommend if you do not need it.  It is fun, but it takes a lot of time, and the topics have high disparity in intellectual demand. So if you don't like/aren't good at a particular concept, you have to learn it to a high degree anyway.",
                "If they need to take it as a requirement or really enjoy circuits.",
                "If you need a lab or the distributional credit. Fine course just likely are other courses that would be more interesting if your looking for a \"fun\" course.",
                "I would recommend this course because it is useful for contextualizing what you learn in physics (and because it is often required :) ).",
                "No, but if you're reading this, you probably take it regardless. ALSO, IN SPRING 2021, THE GRADE CUTOFF FOR AN A WAS A 96.05 & FOR AN A- IT WAS A 93.0. Pre-covid, the curve is more realistic, but everyone did better during the online semester for obvious reasons. Take this into account if the course is still online when you're taking it. Good luck friends!",

                "I would recommend this to any student pursuing a career in STEM, as it teaches you basic physical principles and how to properly create an experimental setup and take precise/accurate measurements. It also teaches you a lot about how to take skewed results into consideration and how to deal with adverse events. Overall, it is an excellent course to learn more about scientific protocol in the lab.",
                "sure as a credit d, it's fun sometimes. really cool techniques and it's fun to work with one's hands!",
                "I mean if you want to take it for fun- don't. It's not that exciting. But since most of us are here for a requirement it's not the absolute worst. Just try to use your resources and get out of there as fast as possible.",

                "Yes.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you are taking physics concurrently or like lab work. As far as STEM labs go, it is not too taxing, but I wouldn't take it on a whim unless you really want a more hands-on approach to physics.",
                "No, unless they have to. It's one of those classes that really makes you think a lab should be worth a full credit, because the workload of this is equivalent to a class. But the bad part is that the work is boring and repetitive and you don't learn much from the labs."
