                "Although I'm hoping to major in English, I hadn't taken any formal literature courses that required me to do frequent analytical writing since coming to Yale; I felt quite comfortable writing analytical papers in high school, but felt out of practice, so this course was a great way to resharpen my writing and analytical skills. Professor Barasch gave excellent feedback that was immensely helpful in improving my subsequent papers, and the engaging in-class discussions helped me practice and further develop my literary analysis skills.",
                "I learned how to approach reading epics and novels and gained confidence in my ability to read any text. Worked on connecting and seeing the evolution of the epic through the essays and in class.",
                "I most appreciated the historical context provided by the professor each time we began a new book.",
                "First and foremost I studied six texts foundational to the whole of Western literature learning how the selected texts connect among each other and how they have influenced other literature. Additionally I learned skills of close reading and literary discussion as well as synthesis in the form of papers and discussion posts."

            "comments": [
                "Easily the greatest strength of the course is in its being a DS-lite. If you are interested in European literature and want to get at the classic texts of that tradition without necessarily committing a year of your life to DS, this is definitely the way to go. It goes without saying that the course content is always interesting, and you never run out of things to talk about in class. The specific curriculum is really well designed not only because of the importance of the texts, but because of the way they really do interact with one another. I must say, however, that this strength can sometimes be a weakness: this course is A LOT, and these books are so dense that sometimes engaging with them for the roughly five hours of in-class time really don't begin to cover a fraction of their importance.",
                "Strengths: My class size was quite small -- only six students! This facilitated excellent discussions and I got to know my fellow classmates very well by the end of the semester. The class is essentially just discussion of the texts we read, so what everyone gets out of the class is subject almost entirely to student participation; nevertheless, discussions always seemed to flow quite easily.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As many have likely noted previously, the workload for this course is immense. That's not particularly a problem; I don't consider workload to be indicative of a course's quality or lack thereof, but I felt that the breakneck pace at which we often went through books prevented us from spending as much time on them as I would have liked. We had six class periods on Ulysses -- more than any previous book -- but it still wasn't enough to even scratch the surface of the novel. Perhaps that's just the way the course is meant to be structured, but I must admit I found myself wishing we could have spent more time discussing the texts we read.",
                "Strengths of this course were the outstanding reading list, small class size, fully discussion based, and great professor. One thing that could be improved is more writing advice before the first essay rather than after.",
                "I was surprised by how disjointed this course seemed. While it attempted to provide an overview of the nature of the European epic tradition, it did a very poor job examining the subject holistically. The six texts in this course by no means comprise all of the European epics that exist, even if we ignore those written by non-white non-male authors. Ultimately, I understand the basic reasoning behind the selection of the six texts that we read (for example, there's already a separate course on Paradise Lost), but this course needs to do more to justify the choice and make it a meaningful academic experience. There was minimal effort to link the texts to each other/truly examine the progression and development of the epic, even though the course is organized chronologically. Other than the essay prompt for Ulysses, which suggested comparing it to the Odyssey, there was very little intertextual discussion. I am not sure why the essays were not all structured as comparative essays; it felt quite pointless to write a paper on a single text, especially since we read them very quickly (and had to skip huge sections in some). We also barely discussed the evolution of literary style and its role in the epic. This course should be marketed very differently, since I felt most discussions were dedicated to analysis of white male mediocrity and impotence. The most enjoyable part of this class was the brief introductory lecture that the professor gave when we began a new text. During discussion, I felt that I gained very little insight into the texts from most of my classmates. The professor mentioned that this course often attracts non-English majors, which was the case for our class, but some of my classmates' comments were borderline offensive, and I felt he should have stepped in on those occasions.",
                "The courses main strength emerged from the sense of interconnection maintained by Professor Barasch with each successive book, no distinct weaknesses"

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, no matter their discipline. Obviously the workload is challenging and it should therefore not be taken as a throwaway 5th class, but if you are looking for a good WR or Hums credit and actually want to engage with the material, there really is no better way to go.",
                "Absolutely! I'd say for anyone interested in literature who didn't participate in Directed Studies, this course is a great introduction to some of the seminal texts of literary history. The texts themselves were quite well-selected, as it was easy to see parallels between each text that we read; the chronological approach, especially, allowed us to see influences of previous authors in the works we read after them, which was, beyond the analytical benefits, very exciting. Seminars are usually shaped by the students and professors in them, and this course was certainly no exception, but I still felt like the quality of our texts naturally facilitated good discussions and intellectually rigorous inquiry, so I wouldn't be at all surprised if a student with different interests and a different professor had a similarly positive experience as I did.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to another student as you can read 6 of the most fundamental texts in literature and it is a rewarding course with fun and varied discussions.",
                "This would be an enjoyable class with some key changes to the syllabus. These are very interesting texts, and it is wonderful to study them in an academic setting; however, there should be a stronger emphasis on comparing them/building an overarching narrative for these specific texts that goes beyond \"the European epic.\" I would not recommend this class unless that issue was addressed. To get the most out of this class, you should obviously do all of the readings, but it is not difficult to get by without doing them. It would be nice to take this course during a semester with a very light load. Classroom engagement depends heavily on the class composition.",
                "Yes I would certainly recommend this course to anybody even remotely interested in the long history of literature and its development across time. It was incredibly rewarding to read the stories that so deeply inform our storytelling today."
