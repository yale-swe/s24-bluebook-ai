The overarching question we grappled with was what actually constitutes \"Islamic architecture\"? Why do we classify certain buildings as Islamic architecture? Prof. Rizvi used a very expansive definition of Islamic architecture and included in the course the past several centuries of buildings in Muslim-run countries, built under the modern and post-modern conditions of colonialism, globalization, and secularization, all of which blur the distinctions between Islamic and non-Islamic architecture.",

Knowledge of how those past traditions in Islamic empires continue to inform architecture, and how architecture in the most recent decades/centuries in Islamic architecture has developed. To gain this understanding also learned fair amount of history (at least compared to my prior ignorance) of central and western Asia as well as Northern Africa.\r\nGained skills in close analysis of buildings and writing in architectural analysis and Art History more generally.",

                "lectures were hard to follow because images lacked labels and the slides did not have text that helped to guide what themes and points were being made. Felt like there were too many monuments covered, and not enough time spent on each one. Felt very rushed through each building, rather than pausing to discuss deeply the intricate elements of each one. Lecture felt more like it was about the history of islam rather than about the actual architecture of the course.",
                "very good in the whole history of Islamic architecture and could be better if there would be some in depth discussion into certain topics sometimes",
                "Overall I thought it was a good and interesting course. I would've liked a little more context and history for some of the buildings we looked at. A lot of the times it was assumed we knew or we'd just go straight into the buildings, and I would've liked to know a little more about the dynasties etc. surrounding them. I also wish more stuff was written on the slides, because often the professor would say someone's name really quickly and I'd miss it or have no idea if it was important and how to spell it. Also, maybe fewer readings. However, overall I really enjoyed this course and thought it was really interesting to learn about a lot of the things we looked at.",
                "This course is a great way to get exposure to an interesting field that a lot of people haven't studied before. Since the class is an intro course and involves multiple writing assignments, I wish there had been more instruction on how to write about architecture, or how to build an argument around built spaces.",
                "Strengths:\r\nCovered a wide range of architecture which allowed us to develop a more general architectural vocabulary and history (even if this necessarily came at the expense of some depth). Even covered 20th-21st architecture, which is great as it provides you some tools to think about current buildings and projects. Assigned readings from actual academic journals, which both meant they went into greater depth which was interesting but also revealed what academic Art History looks like, which I think is useful to see in an intro class. I think the memorization format of the midterm is plus, as I am convinced that actually having to commit buildings and some major points about them to memory is pretty important for being able to draw connections and have insights when considering later material. Lectures were always clear and highlighted important context to the architecture which demonstrated how it reflected different interests or goals throughout time.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI think lectures and sections could have used a little bit more formal analysis of buildings and using that to jump off into discussions relating to context. I think this is useful first because it helps students with no experience in architecture better understand what they are looking at (and just gives them the vocabulary to do so as well), and also because it helps ground the discussion surrounding the architecture.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. The assessments were fair and not overly long. I enjoyed the detailed descriptions of the monuments during class. One thing I would change is making the lecture outlines a word doc formatted using the built-in outline format. That way students who take notes on a service like google docs could much more easily copy and paste the outline into their own notes. Also, please write more on the slides. Images with no surrounding text make the slides basically useless when reviewing for an exam.",
                "This course had very interesting material and I liked the combination of live section and discussion section. I wish we focused a bit more on the history and timeline/chronology of things just because we would cover such huge time periods and it was a bit confusing at time to keep everything on track",
                "The strength of this course is that the material is easy to engage with. Sometimes the readings were a bit dense though.",
                "Weakness: there is a lot of material covered in the first half of the semester, too much for a deep understanding.   \r\n\r\nStrength: The Professor is engaging.  Her lectures are fast-paced but include story telling and great images.  The second half of the semester covered contemporary architecture.",
                "strength - topic; history and architecture \r\nweakness - unclear direction for materials vs assignments",
                "I liked that this course covered a wide array of times and places. I also enjoyed the lecture format and thought Professor Rizvi was a great lecturer. I would have appreciated a little more time at the end of classes for questions, but was able to ask those in discussion if there wasn't time in class."

I happened to be already very interested in Islamic architecture before taking the course, as I have traveled to Spain and Morocco and seen examples of Islamic architecture in both countries, so this course was perfect for me. But I think anyone interested in history, art history, architecture, the Islamic world, ancient times, medieval times, early modernity/modernity/post-modernity, colonialism, and/or urban planning would like this course. It truly covers all those topics and more. Please take it if it's being offered!",

                "It's an interesting introduction to the topic, but definitely be wary of its nature as a survey course. The course moves through a lot of buildings in a way that inevitably sacrifices depth for breadth. It was great to be exposed to so many cool buildings, but I often found myself wanting to spend more time on some of them, and feeling like I wasn't sure what to take away from the lecture as a whole.",
                "Yes. An excellent course which nicely blends History and Art while still providing the tools to think about even modern day projects and how they reflect on the past. Also a pretty good course for a first exposure to architecture, as built up a vocabulary to use when analyzing and thinking about buildings, as well as providing the crucial practice in applying analysis through essays.",
