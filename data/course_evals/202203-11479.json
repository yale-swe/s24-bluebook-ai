I had little coding experience before but now feel comfortable with the command line and in R, which are hugely important skills. I also learned so many other interesting things I didn't expect, from sea cucumber feeding to the use of AI in the field.",
                "I learned so much about how to read and use phylogenies and how to create my own. I feel like this class has opened up a whole new realm of science for me and also allowed me to critically evaluate them when I come across them in literature.",
                "I learned quite a bit about both the conceptual underpinnings and applications of phylogenetics",
                "I learned a tremendous amount about the theory underlying current phylogenetic inference methods and about the practice of applying these methods to real data.",
                "A theoretical understanding of phylogenetics and their advantages/weaknesses, plus a deep exploration of the computing behind phylogenetics! Learned the basic skills of R",
                "This class was incredibly helpful in teaching technical phylogenetic skills and the rationale and inner workings of each method. I learned so much and will most likely return to resources from this class for years to come for future analyses.",
                "I learned a lot about how to infer, simulate, and interpret phylogenies, and I also got more comfortable using R and the cluster to run phylogenetic analyses. Now I feel like I actually understand what the programs are doing when I am running analyses. We also learned about different models of evolution and inference methods, like maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods."

            "comments": [
                "This course is amazing. The perfect correspondence between the textbook readings and the lectures really helped to reinforce new material. Professor Dunn's lecture style is straightforward and well-paced. This class is accessible to students with many different biology backgrounds, and I think the student presentations and final projects really emphasized this diversity and helped us all learn from each other.",
                "There are no weaknesses. This course was designed for learning not assessment, which is rare for a STEM course in my experience. What we learned was highly applicable to research and very interesting. The format was wonderful because it was based mostly on psets, which gave us code we can apply to outside research too, and a final project which was an amazing opportunity to work on a little piece of original research.",
                "Overall this course is hard to improve on. You learn a ton in a stress-free setting, everything you learn is highly practical and interesting, and you get to pick a final project that is interesting for you. The one thing I would change would be to allow partial credit on the quizzes, as these can be somewhat stressful due to the point scheme (1 question off on a 2-question quiz means you get a 50%).",
                "I found the lectures and labs to be very useful in learning the material. The choice of using Professor Dunn's own book to structure the course worked well, given that it allowed for a nice flow and gradual build up of the material, followed by applying these principles in the labs. \r\nA weakness I had with the course was the student presentations in the second half of the course. I found they were often so technically focused that they often went far over my head, given that we hadn't covered many of the techniques used in the papers in class, and that they took up far too much time that could have been used more productively.",
                "I thought there were two major strengths in this course. The first was the presentation of the lecture in class - I thought Professor Dunn was outstanding, and his lectures were engaging and easy to follow, especially since they mirrored the presentation of the material in the textbook. I also thought that the exercises were extremely rewarding, since they taught me how to implement phylogenetic analyses and provided me with example code which I will be able to reference in the future. The only weakness is that Professor Dunn has not finished writing the last few chapters of the textbook - I found the textbook to be an extremely useful resource.",
                "The course is really independent, which could be a huge strength or a huge weakness. It worked really well for me, and I feel like I got a lot out of the course! Some of the assignments take a while and be tricky, but they don't factor into a huge portion of your grade so they aren't too stressful. I feel like I got a lot out of the course, and feel ready to do independent research using phylogenetics!",
                "The course covered a lot of information which sometimes felt over technical and fast paced. I learned so much but sometimes got lost in the details.",
                "I really liked the way that the course was organized. On the first class of every week, Professor Dunn gave a lecture on the weeks topic, and on the second day we would start work on the pset, which was an analysis in R or the cluster related to that topic. I really appreciated the balance between theory and practical skills, and I feel like I learned a lot about both. Professor Dunn explains things in a really clear way. For example, learning about simulating evolution on a phylogeny before phylogenetic inference made inference so much easier to understand. Also, he is writing the textbook for this course as he teaches it, and it is really useful and easy to read. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness of this course in my opinion is that we spent a lot of class time on paper presentations. I think there were more students in the class than usual this year, so we had people presenting every week, and I felt like it took away from time we could be covering the methods on the psets more in depth. I think that discussing the papers as a class instead of having people present on them would have helped me stay more engaged with the papers."

                "Absolutely! I learned so much and gained practical phylogenetic skills.",
                "Absolutely. This course is low stress but at the same time you learn an immense amount, which is the best combination. If you want to do research in an EEB lab, this is a perfect class to take because it brings you to a level in the field where you both understand the concepts and can use them yourselves. The difference in what I could accomplish in my research from the start of the semester to now is remarkable. It is also highly enjoyable and interesting. Plus, it is nice to take a lecture course that still allows you to get to know your classmates and to learn from them!",
                "I could not recommend this course enough! If you think you are slightly interested in phylogenetics, you should absolutely take it. If you don't think you are, you should still take it because you will be by the end of the course.",
                "I would recommend it to other students if they have a clear idea of what they want to get out of the course. It is a bit too specific of a course/topic to recommend broadly, but if phylogenetics is already of interest to someone the course would be a perfect fit.",
                "Absolutely. If you have any interest in understanding phylogenies (or making them in the course of your own research) then you really must take this class.",
                "If a student was interested in phylogenetics, computing, or any biological research, then yes!",
                "Yes i would definitely recommend this course to another student!! It was very organized and taught me so much. Professor Dunn really cares about his students and wants them to succeed",
                "Yes!! This was one of my favorite classes Ive taken at Yale! If you are interested in phylogenetic biology or use it in your research, it is definitely worth taking. Because there are no tests, I felt like I didnt need to stress out about memorizing everything and could focus on what I was most interested in. Also, the final project was a great opportunity to practice applying what we learned in class to answer my own questions.",
                "Would highly recommend. The professor is very engaged and does a great job of explaining the theory and practice of phylogenetics, especially in areas where it might be initially hard to understand."
