                "I learned to dive into complex philosophical arguments by taking a creative, logical, and deliberate approach. Many of the texts we read necessitated a multidimensional thought process where we considered counterarguments and previous authors to arrive at a conclusion. I learned to navigate very verbose paragraphs with challenging philosophic arguments to construct my own outlook of the world and synthesize the ideas of multiple thinkers.",
                "I learned to work through quite dense texts and ideas on my own and with peers. I learned to understand philosophy with historical empathy but also to critically evaluate it. And perhaps more than any other course I took this semester, I thought about the works we read in conjunction with how I want to live my own life, which is always one of my goals.",
                "This course develops some of the most critical and foundational philosophical comprehension skills that enable students to work with current material while also serving as preparation for the philosophical texts to come.",
                "Creative approaches to discussion and essay building",
                "This was my first ever philosophy course and I am now considering majoring in philosophy. I learned how to read beyond literary appreciation, for logic; I learned how to evaluate logical arguments, how to present, clarify, and defend my own ideas in class conversations and in writing. I learned so much and am so grateful!",
                "I learned about the various classical arguments of philosophy and how to construct a philosophy paper.",
                "This course helped strengthen and shape the way I think about logical reasoning, both in general, and how it pertains to broader human concepts like life, death, and knowledge. I learned how to decipher the difference between an argument being correct and being logically sound within the context it was made, and a host of different philosophical views upon which many contemporary approaches to the human experience are based. It was a genuinely interesting course, and challenged me to approach argumentative analysis in ways I have not before."

            "comments": [
                "The course establishes a foundational introduction through Plato and Aristotle before moving to other thinkers that either propose adaptations or radically different approaches to their philosophies. I enjoyed reading the diversity of Aristotle's writings from the Ethics to the Metaphysics because they touch on so many different topics with an overarching theme. In short, the course is well structured and the reading is chosen strategically. The only weakness was with certain lectures that got lost in the details of a very specific logical argument and had to speed up to make up for lost time which made for an imbalanced review of the material.",
                "The course was fantastic. The progression from Plato through Aquinas felt properly contextualized, and lectures were wonderful to situate ourselves in tough material. Since I do not know much ancient philosophy outside of what we read in class, I cannot say in an informed manner whether the texts we read were the most important to have read, but they certainly seemed that way to me.",
                "Extremely strong and formative class discussions during which students shared a host of different theories from a host of different backgrounds.",
                "The weakness of this, as with any DS course, was that there sometimes was not enough time to complete in-depth discussion of all the material because of sheer volume. That said, Prof. Grimstad is WONDERFUL and always has the most interesting parts picked out to discuss.",
                "The roundtable discussions are phenomenal and Professor Grimstad does a great job of making the books accessible. Reading is dense, but always worthwhile. Great intro to philosophy for those who have never tried it before.",
                "Honestly, this was my favorite out of all my DS courses and I don't have much to say for how it could be improved! Like all DS courses, I do think it could benefit from moving a bit slower and diving more in depth, but I know thats the structure of the program.",
                "The two discussion seminars supplemented with lectures were extremely helpful in understanding the texts and allowing us to discover weaknesses and strengths in each unique argument. Although all. Reading was very interesting, the reading workload was quite heavy  I have found that most students in DS find philosophy reading to be most challenging.",
                "I think this course covered many of the foundational thinkers very well, and the ways in which we examined the different philosophers ideas on corresponding topics, such as death, made it organized and easier to examine points of view across time periods and texts. Although I understand there is a lot of material to cover in a limited amount of time, I do think if we had been allowed more time to think about each text before moving on to the next, we would have been able to think more deeply about the arguments made, and gain a better understanding in general."

                "When paired with other DS courses, I would definitely recommend this course because the ideas covered in the class don't get lost in philosophical analyses. Reading Plato and Aristotle in H&P at the same time as philosophy makes the experience even more enriching and automatically introduces a sense of applicability to the philosophic concepts.",
                "I absolutely loved this course and would recommend it highly to everyone. While working through the ideas of these philosophers was tough at times, looking back on the semester allows me to see the great reward it held - not only did I gain understanding of the underpinnings of Western philosophy, but I gained practical skills for engaging with and enjoying difficult texts.",
                "The DS philosophy course is an extremely valuable opportunity to read some of the most foundational philosophical texts with an incredible system of faculty and peer support.",
                "Yes!!",
                "Yes!! Professor Grimstad is amazing. Work is challenging but manageable.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in thinking about fundamental questions of human existence, about what it means to think and learn, about how to understand fundamentally different perspectives and work together to synthesize differing ideas into a common understanding. My favorite class of freshman year so far!",
                "Yes! It was extremely interesting being able to trace the evolution of philosophical thought, since philosophers would frequently reference (sometimes explicitly) their predecessors.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Because of the texts we read and studied together, I am better equipped to understand a whole new host of writings and ideas in countless fields of study. It is certainly rigorous, and if a student cannot devote the time to the texts, it might not be worth taking. However, I had a great experience discussing my learnings with my peers and a very enthusiastic professor."
