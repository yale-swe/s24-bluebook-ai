The experimental techniques are not very difficult and the experimental plans are easy to write up. Overall, this leads to a strength of the class being a rather low workload and intellectual challenge, whilst still remaining engaging. Not sure if there are any distinctive weaknesses.",

Although, I still find it very unfair because of the time commitment that the lab courses require that it is only half of a credit. Throughout the whole semester this course took on average double the time commitment to assignments than the lecture course.",
