The course definitely felt a bit juvenile at times, with all the modules shouting at you to \"plan\" and \"strategize\" your studying, rather than cram like a normal student, but it really does help you actively think about what kind of studying works best for you.",
                "I haven't taken a calculus course since junior year so this was a helpful refresher on derivatives and integrals. It felt like a lot of the course relied on pattern recognition which I'm admittedly not good at but maybe I improved?",

            "comments": [
                "A huge weakness of this course is the fact that the quality of your instruction is a bit of a lottery: there are multiple instructors, some of which are ridiculously amazing, and many of which are either lackluster or plain bad. Always ask upperclassmen who the best teachers are, since making a good choice will increase the quality of your experience exponentially. The teachers are swapped around extremely frequently, since they only get three-year contracts, strangely, but Mihai and Rachel were definitely the best 115 professors during my time.",
                "In my opinion, the problem sets were simply way too hard to do independently without googling for answers (especially since they were graded for correctness). Office hours were helpful but it would often take 30 minutes just to get through one question since my instructor (Mihai) had other students to help. There were also peer tutor sessions but they didn't fit into my busy schedule so I was never able to go. I think it would be great in future years to have the peer tutor hours better advertised and more often. Since many students use gcal, it would be great if they were on a sharable gcal too.",
                "This is one of the most well-organized courses I have taken at Yale. It was really nice to know exactly what assignments I had each week and expectations for exams were very clearly communicated. Additionally, I appreciated the balance of lecture and group practice that happened in each class. This is really small, but I think a crash course on unit circle trig would have been really helpful at the beginning of the course.",
                "I did not find the concept checks helpful.",
                "Overall ok course",
                ".",
                "Strengths: the way the lectures were structured were very easy to understand, the psets were fair with enough time to do them, the office hours were very helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the pre-class mini quizzes felt like a waste of time, and the module where we learned about someone using calculus in the field was not very helpful",
                "I loved the setup. At times, the explores hadnt made sense to me, but otherwise, it was extremely fun to learn new methods for calculus.",
                "This course has a lot of information to cover. As a result, it moved very fast at times. The course did not center around or fully encourage student learning and understanding.",
                "I did not feel like this class was engaging and did not get much out of it",

Not that it matters--I don't think anybody takes this course for fun. Take it with a studious friend and choose the right professor, if you can, and the experience will amaze you. The content really is interesting, even if it isn't always as applicable as multivariable stuff like in Math 120.",
                "It's hard to say because Math 115 really is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the material is super useful but on the other, the class is fairly difficult especially if it's been a while since you've taken Calculus. While I learned a lot, much of the learning happened independently as class time was fairly limited.\r\n\r\nAlso, this course is a (useful) time sink and there really isn't any way around it. Most of the material relies on pattern recognition so your grade ultimately comes down to how much you come into the course knowing and how much you grind.",
                "Yes. Although I feel like most people take calculus for a reason, if you are looking for a quantitative reasoning credit, this course is well organized and you will cover a lot of math and feel much more capable of creative problem-solving with numbers after taking the class.",

                ".",
                "Yes definitely, the work is very doable and the tests were very fair considering what we learned in class. I found the math interesting since it was taught well (by mihai)",
                "I would, if they had to take it. Even if you dont, you learn so many strategies and problem solving skills and new ways to think of problems.",
                "I would not directly recommend this course. I think it covers a lot of interesting material; however, the course is organized in a way that seems to have an assumption that the student has already been exposed to the material.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this to students who are not yet at the multivariable calculus level. Students interested in taking the calculus series should take this course.",
                "No, unless you ave to take it for your major don't take it, its boring, unengaging and most ppl I know credit d failed it."
