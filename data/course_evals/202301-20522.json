The stories we read were also more complex than previous classes and included more advanced themes, so my reading comprehension definitely improved."

                "Strengths: , the class structure, no final, readings were excellent for the most part\r\nWeaknesses: Repetitive",
                "I really loved the course overall, the professor was super supportive and the texts were really interesting, in addition to helping advance my grammar and vocab knowledge. One way it could be improved is by spending more time in class talking with classmates, and less time listening to only one student talk at a time.",
                "Excellent text\/movie selection, everything we read felt interesting and like it was helping learn Chinese. Sometimes pace is a little bit quick so its difficult to absorb all of the vocab.",
                "I really enjoyed small group discussions during class and getting to practice new grammar structures so that I could formulate my questions and clarify what I didnt understand. I thought the structure of assignments was generally well designed except for a few days when we had multiple things due at the same time, for example a written reading reflection and watching a new movie. I found speaking in front of the entire class intimidating however especially when asked for general commentary on a text wed just read. The only part of the course I found unreasonable was when our teacher expected us to have memorized the texts. Even though they might only be three pages, just reading to understand might take several hours. I was not able to (nor do I think anyone in the class could) recall from memory who said exactly what when, how a certain character was described, etc.",
                "One strength of this course is that the topics we learn about through the chosen texts are very complex and relevant to today's society. This lead to very interesting and engaging conversations where we were able to address topics from many different angles. During class, we had both large group discussions as well as conversations in small groups, which maximized our speaking opportunities.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course is that assessments and projects piled up on each other at times. I think it could be good in the future to have these assessments a bit more spread out, such that there is more time to invest in preparing for each one."

                "Yes, but only if that student really enjoys taking Chinese and can devote extra time to really learning the absorbing the class materials.",
                "Yes definitely! Very fun and an excellent class to practice Chinese.",
                "I mean its the only option for this level of the Chinese non-heritage curriculum. So I guess?",
                "Sure, although the class is kind of required for upper-level Chinese courses if you haven't tested out because it's part of the sequence. If you take it, you should 100% take it with Ao Laoshi.",
                "I would recommend this course because it pushed my Chinese language skills to the point where I don't feel limited in my ability to discuss certain topics. This class has really given me the vocabulary and grammar to be able to discuss a large range of topics. I plan to study abroad in China, and this class made me feel very prepared."
