    "I developed my korean speaking and comprehension skills. I gained insights into korean culture through guided activities and personal study.",
    "This class was a continuation from L2, so I learned new grammar, phrases, and advanced my Korean speaking skills.",
    "More advanced grammatical structures than L2, conversation skills, vocab",
    "Korean culture\/language",
    "I improved my Korean speaking and writing capabilities.",
    "Korean language, culture, and history through speaking, reading, and writing practice.",
    "My Korean writing, speaking, listening, and reading schools all improved thanks to Professor Choi. Moreover thanks to the cultural readings, my practical Korean cultural knowledge also increased as well. A big insight I took away was that Korean grammar, when compared to English's grammar, seems much more intricate but in a good way. For example while English may only have one major grammatical construction to express \"but,\" in Korean there are multiple nuanced ways to do so.",
    "I learned more vocabulary to use when traveling, how to use informal speech, and how to write using indirect quotation.",
    "You learn intermediate level Korean. Compared to L1 and L2 Korean, this class covers much more conversational speaking, but reading and writing are still  focuses of the class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is very intense. Hours of study are necessary to succeed.",
    "One of my favorite parts of this course is how interactive it is, not only with Professor Choi, but also with the other students in the class. I really enjoy doing partner work, and the group project at the very end is very good! Overall, there weren't any very strong weaknesses that wouldn't apply to any general language course at Yale.",
    "Strengths: we got to talk a lot in class which was great. I really want to improve my conversational skills so that was really helpful. The vocab quizzes were a little stressful but really made us learn the vocab. I also really liked learning folk tales, songs, advertisements, and other things from Korean culture\/life. I liked how low key the oral presentations were.",
    "no weaknesses",
    "I thought this course was very effective in teaching Korean. I overall would not change anything, except for having more emphasis on learning relative clauses in Korean.",
    "One strength is the communicative approach of teaching. Rather than just lecturing to us on Korean grammar, Professor Choi highlights the essentials and then has us practice with each other by making our own sentences. Being able to talk Korean with my classmates made class time enjoyable because of how creative our answers could get. Another aspect I would deem a strength is the individual grading sheet. Professor Choi of course keeps track of each student's individual grade, but the self-grading sheet allowed me to see my own progress in the class and motivated me to work harder to achieve my language goals. One way the course could be improved could be implementing more writing exercises. Many writing exercises included only creating example sentences based on particular grammar we had learned in class. If I were able to write in a more practical way like for example keeping a journal in Korean, that would be great. In fact, I think that's a great idea. If every week students were assigned to write at least a little each night in Korean, then I'm sure their Korean would markedly improve. We could start off small by writing half a page each night in a journal and then slowly building ourselves to be able to write multiple pages. We could write about anything and it would be good practice writing in prose\/narrative form too.",
    "Some strengths include advancing vocabulary, practicing diverse forms of speech formality, and encouraging constant practice with partners and groups to experiment with dialogue.\r\n\r\nThe syllabus and assignment completion chart were slightly confusing in that it was hard to understand what was due on which day (I was always ahead or behind). Therefore tracking assignments was difficult when it was unclear when they were due. Making the syllabus more clear, and matching homework assignments directly to the days where we learn new content would be more helpful to organize our learning.",
    "I really appreciated that this class studies more conversational scripts and dialogues than earlier Korean classes. I did feel, however, that the class was a little disorganized. I feel the curriculum could be better arranged to accommodate learning. For instance, grammar lessons sometimes felt randomly ordered, and review, too, felt randomly included."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes! Korean at Yale is taught exceptionally well, but requires constant engagement from the student.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes - if you wish to improve your Korean and have taken L2 previously or similar level elsewhere",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this course to students that want to improve their Korean language skills.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student because this is a great way to improve one's Korean. I do have to say that one's own language improvement largely depends on the individual. If one is diligent and has a high level of self-discipline, studying every night for at least 30 minutes to an hour is crucial to improving. Simply going to classes and listening in to what Professor Choi has to say just isn't enough. And if there are students who may particularly master quickly course material, then I would recommend learning supplementary materials on top of class materials.",
    "Yes! For non-native and native speakers hoping to advance their fluency in Korean, this course is very helpful!",
    "Korean is fantastic to learn, and I would encourage anyone who took L1 and L2 to continue learning it. The only problem is that classes under the Korean department at Yale do not seem to be as organized and conducive to learning as classes in more popular departments like Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, and French."
