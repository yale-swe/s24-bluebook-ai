   "comments": [
    "The biggest strength of this class was its small size. The engagements with the instructor were very high. I also got lots of feedback.",
    "Strengths: professor, class readings, guest speakers, assignments, \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish this class was more highly advertised so more students could have taken it",
    "This course's main strengthaside from teaching students how to communicate effectively through writinglies in its professional focus. I only expected to learn the fundamentals of writing in the context of the financial services system, but I took away so much more. I learned how startups pitch ideas to firms, how companies formally propose new initiatives in writing, and how to effectively analyze a firm's financial performance. But above all else, the speakers added a unique layer to the course that I was not expecting. They were candid about their experiences and came from a number of different professional backgrounds. We hosted a lawyer working for YIO, a doctor in a healthcare startup, and other speakers who had very interesting things to saywhether that be about finance or importance of writing well beyond college.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint about the course has to do with the organization. It is natural for courses to deviate from the original syllabus, however, I felt like there was not enough forward planning once changes were made. Assignments were described in detail last-minute, speakers were chosen without student input, and the Canvas sign-up for office hours did not function as intended."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Engl 121 is always popular, but somehow this class had a small size that allowed us to receive constant feedback. The workload is light as the readings are not dense at all, but do expect to write a lot. I love all the topics of assignments, so I enjoyed writing for this class.",
    "Yes! Yes! Yes! Best class for learning writing skills that will be applicable to business or corporate strategy!",
    "Yes. This was a great class for anyone looking for a slightly different writing course. It's not just for students who are interested in finance so don't get scared by the name. I would say anyone generally interested in business would get a lot from this class, you read and write a lot of different types of professional writing which is helpful for whatever you do in the future. Prof Klemann is wonderful, would definitely recommend a class with her whether this one or another.",
    "It depends. If you're interested in finance post-graduation like me, I highly recommend you take this course. Coming to class was always exciting because the professor and I were passionate about the inner workings of the financial services industry. But if you hate finance\/economics then do not take this class. You will only get out of it as much as you pour into it. If the material is boring for you, this will feel like a waste of time."
