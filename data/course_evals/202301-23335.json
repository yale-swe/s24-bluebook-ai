                "I have always been interested in crime, but this class really allowed me to explore that interest and engage in really awesome material. I learned a lot about criminology and theories that lie behind every crime.",
                "I developed a deep understanding of the origins of modern criminology, its evolutions, and its implications. I learned how to tackle a sociological problem from various answers to find an explanation.",
                "I learned what the true definitions of crime and deviance are- as well as the factors that distinguish them both. This whole semester, I was able to learn about different sociological and criminological theories and methods that were established to justify why people do and do not commit crime. The course is very interesting, and I am happy that I took this course.",

                "The professor really cares about the subject and continues to provide ways for students to earn points via reading quizzes, lecture quizzes, etc. If there were any questions about the course material or course standards the professor was very candid and open. There is a lot of content that is covered in the course which requires students to be engaged.",
                "Strengths: Interesting topics that are not too complicated to understand, manageable workload, good structure.",
                "I really liked the way this course was set up with the slides and discussion sections. Sometimes though, things got a little off track and we would end up discussing non-material topics, which was definitely interesting, but it could be helpful for the class schedule to be more disciplined. It could also be improved if there was either a final paper or final exam at the end, not both.",
                "I really enjoyed the way that this class was taught in lecture and in the discussion sections.",
                "Strengths: material was very interesting, sections were good\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures sometimes felt monotonous",
                "I do not like that the professor assigned our final, 10 page essay on the last day of class. This gave us less than 2 weeks to complete it, which may not seem bad, but it is considering the other finals you have to study and prepare for AND the fact that we had a final exam on top of that. It should be either or. I also did not like the restrictions we were given on our essays. It made them worse in my opinion. Also, another issue I had was with timing of when certain assignments were due. The extra credit quizzes were due on 3 o clock for most of the semester, which is inconvenient considering that the quizzes were being submitted for class the whole next day and that we have other classes during the day. Also, many people dropped out of the course at the beginning because the professor expressed that no technology was allowed, when he really meant that no phones were allowed and they technology can be permitted for notes only.",
                "I really appreciated how this course was structured, as all of the different theories pieced together nicely and the transition from one to the next was very understandable. My only critique of this class would be a request to add more applicable examples, as it is sometimes easier to distinguish between the theories when they are applied to real-world scenarios. However, I know that criminology is the study of crime at large, not the study of individual cases, so I can also see how this could serve as an overall detriment."

                "I think if you are interested in sociology or how structures in society can lead people to commit a crime then I would recommend this course. The professor is very open to student input and overall tries to facilitate a welcoming learning environment. I would not recommend this course as a gut social science class though.",
                "Absolutely! I took it because I'm a huge Criminal Minds fan, and wanted some insight that could help me analyse the TV-show further, and this was a great introduction to that! Very happy about the class, and it was super interesting all the way through! I would in particular recommend the class to Scandinavian students as the professor is Swedish and the references he brings are sometimes fun to connect to Scandinavia.",
                "Yes, I would recommend others to take this course. The course material was super interesting and the professor was super cool.",
                "Only if they were interested in the subject, it is pretty niche and not everyone would enjoy it. It is a really great class for sociology majors though!",
                "I would recommend this course to someone else that is interested in learning more about criminology or about why people commit crime. I definitely recommend sociology majors to take it, especially to fill the intro course requirement.",
                "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student, not only because the material and teaching were clear and manageable, but also because the topics are highly applicable and will serve as a good foundation across many different humanity and social science courses\/majors."
