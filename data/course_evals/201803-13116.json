I think it the course could be improved by offering more modern criticism as reading material in addition to the works of major English poets."

    "Yes, anyone can take this class. I didn't think I would like Middle English literature, but it ended up being much more engaging than I thought. The way the course\/professors work make everything interesting and fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it exposes you to literary greats and it provides good foundation for reading material in other English courses.",
    "Yes! I personally never thought myself a fan of Old English literature, however, Professor Saraceni made this class extremely enjoyable, intellectually engaging, and made me much more appreciative of the beauty behind this time period's texts."
