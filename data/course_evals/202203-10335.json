                "Gained a much deeper understanding about what contemporary German society is like for immigrants from Turkey and Syria. Improved my grammar and writing skills and public speaking skills.",
                "I learned about social issues in contemporary Germany, including immigration and racial dynamics.",
                "Listening, reading, writing, and speaking skills in German. Grammar concepts like punctuation, adjective endings, etc.",
                "Better understanding of modern German politics and improved vocabulary and comprehension of German texts",
                "I was introduced to many aspects of the recent refugee crisis in Germany, and I was able to develop a multifaceted perspective on the issue from the variety of sources presented. My speaking greatly improved through the casual atmosphere\/low fear of judgment present in the classroom. My knowledge on the covered grammar topics was bolstered through the easy-to-follow slideshows and frequent practice worksheets (with group collaboration).",
                "I really improved my ability to read German (and quickly!) as well as speak automatically. I expanded my vocabulary and practiced different grammatical formulations.",
                "I have improved to speak in fluent German. Previously, I have learnt German in many different formal settings, but what I lacked the most was the full practice of the language on a frequent basis in a subject that was intellectually stimulating. This course has provided me with exactly what I needed. I became much more comfortable speaking German, learnt more about the refugee\/migration situation in Germany, and enjoyed having intellectually fulfilling conversations with amazing peers and an amazing professor."

                "If you want to improve, you will but if you are just kind of there, this course will not push you to improve much.",
                "I really appreciated the variety of assignments we had, there was a great balance of speaking and writing tasks and a wide range of topics ensured it was interesting the whole time.",
                "I think the course could be improved by including more practice in actually advancing our knowledge and command of the German language. However, I understand that Yale may restrict this for L5 courses. Liese, as in other courses I took, was great this semester and is clearly the biggest strength.",
                "Strengths were that the course was extremely well organized and assignments fit well into preparing for class and\/or practicing concepts learned in class. Feedback was given clearly and promptly, and we did a variety of activities that made class very engaging and interesting. No weaknesses!",
                "This course involved a variety of activity types, including interactive lectures, Quizlet Live, group and individual worksheets, group speaking presentations, individual speaking recordings, short\/extended responses, and I could probably think of more. I really appreciated having this variety because each day of class could be understood by each type of learner\/fit an individual student's needs well. This course also presented several types of media (films, documentaries, short videos, articles, etc.) which was great to learn from and again fit to different learners' needs. Another strength was the relaxed atmosphere of discussion participation: students were able to decide how much to participate without fear of not answering 'enough' questions, because discussions were open and flowed from one topic to the next. I cannot think of any significant weaknesses to the course.",
                "Strengths: compelling course content with different perspectives included (it felt pretty balanced), great proportion of new information and review\/practice, not too many long assessments, and great instructor!\r\nWeaknesses: the workload dramatically picks up once you start reading the book which can be unexpected and surprising, there could have been more emphasis on the political aspects (for course continuity), and there was minimal time spent on Afro-Deutschen that could be expanded.",
                "The biggest strength is having Prof. Liese for sure. She is an amazing professor who knows exactly what to do. The course was very structured and well-organized because of her great teaching strategies. I enjoyed having this course in my schedule because she knew how to strike the perfect balance between having an enjoyable course, while allowing us to practice speaking in a safe vibrant environment. No apparent weaknesses."

                "Yes - Liese is amazing!",
                "I would recommend it, especially if it's taught again by Liese! Just take anything she's teaching honestly. Workload is very manageable and you get feedback almost instantly, allowing you to quickly learn from your mistakes. Liese is also available outside of class hours for questions.",
                "Yes, the course was really interesting and informative for improving German skills and learning about contemporary Germany.",
                "Absolutely! This course is a great way to continue German at Yale and is highly engaging.",
                "Yes, I would. This course seems to have a greater overall level of emotional connection\/interest than some of the others, due to the subject matter as well as format of the course. It led to a more cohesive and engaging environment. Especially for an 'intro' L5 course (the first L5 course I have taken).",
                "Yes, definetly",
                "Yes! A great intro L5 German class and low pressure environments to practice German.",
                "YESSSSSS. 100%. I would recommend any L5 course with prof. Sippel."
