I became more familiar with the entire human body and understood body mechanics a little better because I saw which muscles move which joints, etc. I learned to use contextual clues to identify certain specimens. I also learned how to handle human bone specimens with care.",

                "This is a great course. No suggestions  except it would be kind of entertaining if there was a true final where one had to assemble an entire human skeleton from its constituent bones.",
                "Professor Sargis does warn you beforehand that this course has a flipped-classroom formatand that's not for everybody. I would be curious to see how this class would unfold if it were taught in a regular lecture class, or separated into a lecture and lab class. I think student would actually learn more that way. Or, split the class into two semesters and go more in depth into each module. Just that there's so much information and I think realistically we go through the material too fast. I really enjoyed the background lectures but we never got to explore the material further after the lecture itself which seemed like a waste.",
                "I absolutely loved this course, I think the self-guided learning and the class setup works really well for the content",

The class is not very structured during lab time, so students can go at their own pace to learn all the content.\r\nWeaknesses: The box of bones they give you for taking home is suuuper heavy to carry back.",

                "As a senior, this class was truly one of the highlights of my Yale experience. While there is a lot of content you are responsible for, it is all a) very interesting and b) laid out very clearly. Prof. Sargis does an excellent job of making sure you know exactly what is required of you, and what is not. He also answers any and every question you have about the material in a clear, interesting, and fun way. The logical setup of the class means that there is very little stress  although the tests require lots of memorization, you know exactly what you have to memorize, and just showing up to class each day gets you >80% of the way there. Besides that, it is incredibly interesting to learn about human osteology, and even cooler to get an introduction to it by handling real human specimens. No other class can provide this kind of immersive experience into such a fascinating topic and get away with making it fun and stress-free.",
                "I would recommend this to another student if you are (relatively) good at memorization and need a science gut. Pre-meds, this class is also for you to get a head start on the anatomy that you'll need to know anyway.",

                "Yes I would. It's a great course. I don't know how to explain why other than it's awesome to learn about your body by using actual specimens. And to have this count as an Sc distributional requirement,, that's just great."
