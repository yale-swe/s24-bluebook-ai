                "I think quizzing students on readings via Kahoot is not the best way to assess students. There is a participation grade, especially in seminars, because that itself already represents how much students have read the weekly material to engage with the course. I didn't like how the seminar time itself was mainly a lecture, with sparse opportunity for students to talk and actually SHOW that they did read the material, and instead have that be assessed with a quiz that was not perfect in its execution. There were times where I couldn't get in the room for a bit, or when I couldn't click on an answer which I presume is because of poor connectivity issues at home, so I would much rather have a mid-term assessment instead of weekly Kahoot quizzes. Besides, students should have a chance to ask questions, go through that week's material, and better understand what the readings were about\/their significance AND THEN be assessed. I frankly have never seen a format in which students were assessed before they had a chance to go through the materials with the professor. And again, if the point was to make sure we did the readings, then use section time to evaluate how much we've read by measuring our participation!",
                "This course fell short in the discussions for me. I would have loved to engage more critically with the assigned readings, but the readings themselves were carefully selected and interesting to read. The Kahoot quizzes each week were also frustrating as they were only reading checks but not useful in better understanding the readings since the questions mostly revolved around minor details of the studies."
