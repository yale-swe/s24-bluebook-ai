    "How to read and critique economic research papers.",
    "interesting course",
    "I have learned how to think critically about different economic research papers. I have also learned about a variety of topics related to US history from an economic perspective.",
    "Ability to read and analyze econometric papers.",
    "I learned all about American history and the pros and cons of various economic situations.",
    "Covered a broad range of topics from slavery to the Great Depression to fertility rates. The whole course consisted on readings for each topic which he would discuss in class.",
    "How to analyze research papers",
    "I learned a new perspective on history. Prior to this class, I had not considered specific events (Civil War etc.) in the context of economics. I also think that this class helped me think more critically about methods of study.",
    "Got a really cool understanding of American Economic History from colonization to roughly 1970s.",
    "Reading economic history papers, evaluating and critiquing economic history papers, learning about the history of the United States through an economic lens.",
    "History",
    "I learned more about various kinds of economic history research.",
    "I learned about several notable events in American history from an economic perspective.",
    "Introduction to quantitative analysis and implementing these techniques to examine social and historical changes.",
    "I learned to understand the tools economic historians use and how to write critical papers. I also learned a decent amount of economic history.",
    "Significant knowledge on what particular events cause the american economy to follow the path it did throughout history.",
    "Overall, through taking this course I learned a great deal about significant economic aspect of American History, econometrics, and various research conducted by economists.",
    "In this course, we learned about various different topics, selected by the professor, in the development of the United States economy.  We were taught about different empirical methods used to conduct economic research and what kinds of scenarios these methods are most appropriate in.  We also read many economic research papers not only to learn what the conclusions of the results were but to have a chance to critique them and think critically about how to write a good economic research paper.",
    "A detailed knowledge about the history of economics",
    "I think the biggest skill I learned was how to analyze and evaluate an economic paper.",
    "critiquing research papers and an economic view of american history",
    "I learned about big events in America's economic history",
    "How to analyze economic papers, actually pretty useful.",
    "Evaluating economics papers, learning about the economic history of the US",
    "I learned to look at historical events from an econ standpoint and isolate effects of policies or natural events.",
    "I learned the historical context and methods behind major papers in economics, and how each of the authors added to the collective body of academic work throughout their time.",
    "ECON 182 was a course that allowed me to examine American history from a different lens that challenged my current understanding of the mechanisms and effects of events with which I was already familiar. I developed the skills to analyze and critique economic papers that researched historical phenomena.",
    "ability to apply econometric tools to historical and some contemporary socioeconomic phenomena",
    "This course, of course, taught me a lot about the economic history of the United States, from its first days as a growing economy to modern trends such as women's labor force participation. Even more so, however, this course trained my ability to apply the economic principles and econometric practices I've learned in a theoretical context to real-world historical economic questions, allowing me to really develop an economic analytical framework for problems I encounter in the real world."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "lectures very clear and thorough",
    "This course is great! No changes!",
    "Weaknesses: It can be a lot of work since it is 3 papers, a midterm, and a final exam. If you spread out the papers throughout the seamster you should be fine.",
    "Need prior knowledge of econometrics. Should have mentioned more.",
    "I loved the last few topics we discussed - I thought that they were fascinating. \r\n\r\nI think that just timing wise, there were some topics that we rushed through but were featured heavily on exams.",
    "This course was super cool! I really liked it. The material was engaging without being too much work. \r\n\r\nThe only problem is that the grading scheme for papers was so TA dependent. \"Nice TAs\" would give out more As for papers than \"mean TAs\" so it really depended on who happened to be assigned to grade that topic which is a bit ridiculous and not particularly fair.",
    "The material is slightly boring and repetitive. The whole course is centered on 11 different topics throughout US history, but each topic is just reading\/discussing the methods and findings of various econ history papers. The critiques get a little repetitive and lecture can feel like paper summaries.",
    "Bring back Prof. Lewis. Hes so wonderful, really cares about his students, and covers a lot of American economic history in a single semester.",
    "Good class",
    "The material is interesting but just very high in volume; if we spent more time diving into the papers, models and economics, students would feel less pressured to make this a last-minute memorization course.",
    "Strengths: decently interesting material, clear lecturer\r\nWeaknesses: talking about slavery\/race in America when there are very few non-white non-Asian students in the class is uncomfortable",
    "I really liked it! I think it's more work than the average econ class, but honestly didn't think it was too bad. Maybe the midterm could be removed and the final could be made longer?",
    "I enjoyed the class, however didn't have much prior experience with empirical techniques and econometrics. I found it hard to critique research papers when I wasn't sure what techniques were used and why in the first place.",
    "It was overall a very good course.",
    "Very good at making quantitative, math-heavy research into easy to understand, qualitative material. Professor Lewis does a good job of explaining the math that is behind the research that allows to have this historical knowledge of what caused what in American economic history, but  it is not necessary to the course in any way shape or form. No real weaknesses that I could see, other than maybe a bit more guidance on the papers.",
    "Overall, the strengths of this course were that it allowed students to learn a great deal about American Economic History through a lens of research. I think it could be improved a little by cutting the research papers down a little (maybe take one out per unit) and focus more on background for the periods as well as the implications of the research. We discussed the researches conclusions but I wish we discussed more what this meant more for America in the long run. Additionally, this class could be improved by having each student's TA grade their papers. Overall, I felt grading was somewhat inconsistent across TAs and by having the same person grade a students work that student can better learn what the TA is looking for.",
    "I think one big strength of the course is that the material of the course is interesting and the workload is not too overwhelming.",
    "A weakness would be that the papers were not that interesting and often lacked a clear focus or explanation. They were also not that approachable, even from someone who has already taken econometrics.",
    "the papers were challenging because some of the papers were hard to come up with original critiques for. Also I know many of the students, myself included, felt odd having to critique these papers because we were not qualified. When I used critiques mentioned in class my grade was penalized. The questions on the midterm and to some extent on the final exam were also phrased in ways that made it hard to understand what kind of answer was wanted.",
    "This course has a lot of dense content, so if it were broken down a little bit more it would be easier to process.",
    "More interactive, seminar style would probably be a lot better but all in all still slightly engaging.",
    "More feedback",
    "The material in this course is very interesting and every topic was substantial",
    "The strengths of the course was the instructor. I felt that Professor Lewis's teaching was incredibly engaging. The biggest weakness of the course was engagement -- the students weren't as engaged with the course because it was a large lecture, and it is an aspect which could be improved.",
    "Very dry because only look at papers\/studies. Could be spiced up a little or taught a little more enthusiastically with more variety.",
    "Strengths:  ability to apply what you've learned in other economic courses in real-world and historical settings\r\nWeaknesses:  material is somewhat dry and depends on your level of interest in topic (e.g. Civil War\/Reconstruction, Great Depression, health standards\/fertility, etc.)",
    "I thought the teacher's enthusiastic presentation of each lecture was a big plus. The material can be admittedly a little dry, but the right lecturer can make all the difference. He also made sure that all the materials and assignments were organized, something I've really learned to appreciate here at Yale. Lastly, the ability to choose which 3 of the 11 topics to write your essays on was a BIIIIIIIIG plus. I would not have learned as much nor have been able to write essays as well if that option was not available."

   "comments": [
    "yes but its a visiting prof who teaches so it depends on the prof. this years prof (joshua lewis) was excellent.",
    "Yes, it is very interesting and considers many perspectives.",
    "Yes, if you want a writing credit and an Econ credit. It is super doable and relatively interesting.",
    "No.",
    "Yes. I thought it was very interesting in content.",
    "Yes most definitely, especially if you are an Economics major, this is a really nice way to get a writing credit. It may seem like a lot of work on paper, but if organize your semester it is quite relaxed, because there are no psets. It is also just a cool mix of history and economics and gives an interesting introduction to a new sector.",
    "Yes, if you are looking for a relatively relaxed writing credit, especially as an econ major.",
    "If Prof. Lewis ever comes back, definitely take this class if you need a WR or Econ credit. Interesting, lots of variety in content.",
    "Yes!! I loved this course and learned so much both in terms of general economics, econometrics, and American history. Ive taken two WR already and hate writing, but the course more than made up for that! Professor Lewis is an outstanding Professor. It was my favorite class and I was actually sad every time when it ended. It wouldnt be the same with a different Professor, and I think they alternate for the course so maybe look into that though.",
    "Good",
    "Its really dry  unless you can sit through straight history lectures, I would not recommend taking this for a WR. Also you need some in-depth understanding of statistics so dont take this if youre just a history major.",
    "Yes because it's an easy writing credit.",
    "yes! if they were interested in econ, especially since we covered a lot of regressions and models",
    "Interesting class, good writing credit.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. Just make sure you get Professor Josh Lewis, as CourseTable made it seem as though a different professor has taught the course over each of the last few semesters. If you get Professor Lewis, you'll be in good hands. If not, you never know.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, particularly one looking to get a writing credit and Economics credit. Overall, I feel I learned alot.",
    "If you are interested in the economic history of the United States or are an econ major that needs a writing credit, then definitely.  Otherwise, I would recommend shopping it and trying to feel it out a bit.  It is definitely not a good fit for everyone.",
    "I would recommend this course if you need a writing requirement or need it for the Econ major. Professor Lewis was great, but I don't think they've been as good in the past, and it is a rotating professor.",
    "Decent writing credit for an econ major.",
    "I would recommend this course to other Econ students who need to fulfill an elective credit. The course content is somewhat interesting, and the workload is manageable.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, this course and simple and interesting",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, if they're looking for an elective as a history major. As an economics major, it is not as related to the specific practice of economics and you might expect, but only conceptually related.",
    "Yes, definitely. It's a great course for people interested in history or economics, or both.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the subject. If not, it is very dry.",
    "a good course to pick if you need a WR credit and\/or ECON elective",
    "I would recommend this student for two reasons: 1) I believe every econ major should have a basic understanding of economic history, and 2) I have yet to encounter a course that allows you to practice applying economic theory to the analysis of real world problems as much as this class."
