One of the best parts about the class was being able to read academic papers from the field and be able to critique them in class. I don't think this is often done in many S&DS courses, and I appreciated the chance to do so. The final project was a good exercise in how to tackle data science questions in the \"real world.\" There was no fixed process, and as a result, I did feel pretty lost at first. However, as Professor Svje mentions, there isn't necessarily a set process laid out when practicing data science. We also did spend time talked about approaches, so in the end, my partner and I did feel we had a direction to go.",

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course are many: Professor Savje's lectures and discussion sections are always insightful, the papers he assigns are interesting and useful, and the topics students learn about are important and often under-discussed in introductory statistics courses.  The final project is also a ton of fun.  I can't think of any major weaknesses, other than that the course is obviously quite challenging.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Prof Savje has great insights and cares a lot about student learning- he provides lots of feedback on your assignments and is very quick to answer questions\r\n- Discussion based statistics seminar - not many of those around\r\n- Material is very interesting and Savje really helps you get the big picture idea behind topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Discussions were sometimes hard to manage if the class didn't understand a reading well\r\n- Occasionally, the lack of specificity in the class was frustrating - almost would've like to cut out one of the topics and sit with the other topics for a bit longer\r\n- Psets varied in difficulty and some weeks' assignments would unexpectedly take much longer than other weeks",
                "I think the course was very broad, which was good, but there were definitely times where I lost track of what we were doing. I personally think this course could benefit from meeting twice a week for shorter periods. Professor Savje's vast knowledge and teaching style were definitely strengths, as were the insights of my classmates.",
                "The readings and discussion were not very engaging",
                "This course was great for practicing various analytical skills. I think that it would be beneficial to spend more time teaching the more technical parts of the course. I sometimes struggled to connect the theory and the code for certain units.",
                "Strengths: The academic journal reading assignments for the discussion portions along with the discussion was a highlight. Speaking of, another HUGE strength was how dedicated Professor Svje is to making this class a good experience for students. We were strongly encouraged to provide feedback along the way, but also specifically around midterm. He responded to our anonymous comments substantively and for those suggestions he didn't implement, Professor Svje provided justification (in an email to the entire class with general comments on the feedback form). I think the class also does a good job with the final project in terms of providing students with an opportunity to carry out a data science project with less structure than you might see in other classes, which in some ways, mimics the \"real world.\" Professor Svje also did a really fantastic job with giving feedback on all of our projects, including the final. It was clear he looked at each one line by line, and that specific feedback was super helpful in the learning process.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I do feel that discussion could have been improved (I think sometimes the points students wanted to discuss didn't quite align with what Professor Svje wanted us to get out of them, which resulted in him leading discussion and \"fishing\" for answers that we just weren't giving, even after multiple attempts. Personally, I do feel that this stymied the flow of discussion (and I think also discouraged some from speaking up). However, after listening to feedback (as I mentioned in the strengths section), Professor Svje did try to guide our reading so we had a chance to think about these key points prior to discussion. This was implemented later in the course, so I didn't really get a sense of if this approach improved things. It also might have been an issue of Zoom).",
                "Discussion section would be used to talk about the papers but oftentimes it felt long and drawn-out. At times it felt like the recorded lecture coupled with discussion section wasn't necessary. Because discussion section was open-ended or it would involve Professor Savje asking one person a question it felt like either the conversation was dominated by one person or just wasn't useful. Additionally, although the course only recommended a 100 level knowledge of statistics, if you hadn't taken multiple S&DS courses, the textbook didn't help much in providing knowledge on how to code."

                "I thought having discussions on Zoom was challenging in terms of engagement and participation (especially because of the Friday afternoon time slot). In response, we eventually implemented 5 minute breaks, which I personally found to be very helpful. We didn't try any methods for engagement in the Zoom discussions beyond Professor Svje actively leading discussion. I think in the future, if this is done virtually, having breakout rooms might be nice a) so everyone gets a chance to share their thoughts on a given topic AND b) so that students can get to know each other a little better. I think the second point is especially important because we needed to find partners, and the usual casual before/after-class conversations weren't really possible. I think this also would have translated to a better classroom community for discussion.",

                "Yes--you will gain an immense amount of intuition as to how to do statistical and data scientific analyses properly, intuition that you don't really develop in introductory or intermediate S&DS courses.  Professor Savje is also excellent.  Be warned that the workload can be intense, but it is never unmanageable or unfair.",
                "Yep!! If you want to get a good sense of the main questions in statistics from a more critical viewpoint, this course is great. If you want something more specific, you may want to choose another course. If you want to feel more comfortable reading stats papers, this class will definitely help you approach reading papers. This class also gives you a much better sense as to how stat analysis is done beyond school work, in a way a stats course in the S&DS department would not do.",

                "Yes, I'd recommend this course. It's a great way to bring together stats and data science techniques and put them into practice in projects and in critique and evaluation of academic research papers. The format of the class alternates between lecture and discussion each week, which is a great way to switch things up continually. The final project felt unstructured to me at first in terms of approach, but that's by design in order to simulate exposure to a \"real world\" data science problem, where there isn't necessarily a \"right\" approach. Professor Svje is a great strength of this course in that he provides very detailed feedback on assignments and is clearly dedicated to making sure students have a good learning experience (i.e. he was willing to implement changes to the course throughout the semester based on student feedback). Many of the techniques and skills we went over weren't necessarily \"new\" if you've taken other statistics courses before (R coding, causal inference frameworks, regression, etc.), but it was a good opportunity to be able to really solidify them in terms of overarching frameworks and apply them to social science questions.",
