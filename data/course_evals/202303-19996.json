There were plenty of essential topics that I enjoyed, which I would have only been able to explore through taking this course. Overall, this course showed me how I can apply knowledge from previous mathematics classes to an Economics context.",

                "I think while some of the lectures were definitely well-motivated, some others seemed to be more disjoint from the other topics, which could be confusing at some points. It would be helpful to preface each topic with more examples, and also cover more specific examples with numbers to help reinforce the theoretical material.",
                "The topics and lectures were well planned out. I think this course could benefit from moving quicker at the start so we could spend more time on the later topics.",
                "Very well-organized and helpful for facilitating learning. Very clear lectures and extremely helpful sections and office hours.",
                "The course provided very clear feedback all the way and the problem sets were useful for understanding the concepts covered in class. I felt like I learned new knowledge and was supported by the teaching assistant throughout. I think the course would have been better if the examples from class were explained better.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Muratov's teaching help me understand the difficult concepts covered in the course, TA Nicolo was very helpful with Psets and his weekly section helped solidify my understanding and show examples of various concepts discussed in the course, weekly Psets helped reinforce my understanding, depth and breadth of concepts covered\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "The strength is the material. The concepts covered in the course are advanced and interesting. \r\nThe weakness is the lack of active learning during the lectures. I wish there had been more student participation."

I do think that this course should have more prerequisites than it currently does: some of the units are much more accessible having completed Analysis and at least concurrently taking a course in probability. At the very least, students should be reasonably comfortable with proof-based mathematics. That being said, although this course is very challenging, it's also incredibly interesting and I am very glad I took it!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who has taken an introductory course in microeconomics and is looking for more rigor.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in microeconomics. I wasn't a big fan of micro after 115, but became completely fascinated after this class. The content is challenging but really interesting. Oleg is a clear instructor who cares a lot about the class, and Nicol is the most amazing TA one can ever hope to encounter.",

                "I would recommend this course. It made me feel like I was engaging with microeconomics at a greater level than I would have had I taken Econ 121. Further, Professor Muratov was very kind, as was the TA Nicolo.",
                "idk. as an applied math major, i find the material itself kind of boring, but it might just be my bias towards econ. it seems like a lot of formalism for some obvious insights. although there are some cool tools we picked up along the way."
