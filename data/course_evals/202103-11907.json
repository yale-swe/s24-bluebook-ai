You start off with a basic introduction to vectors with things like the dot product and cross product followed by cartesian and vector equations of planes and lines. Then you'll move into partial derivatives, local and absolute extrema, optimization with Lagrange multipliers, and other related material. Beyond this, you're basically learning all material relevant to the major theorem's of the course: Green's Theorem and Stoke's Theorem. This will include line and surface integrals (both scalar and vector), double integrals, triple integrals, and more.",

                "The preclass videos I feel like were meant to teach the material when I would rather learn it much more in depth in person.",
                "Lectures were sometimes boring and repetitive from the videos assigned for homework. Would have been better to see more problem solving in lecture, especially for the harder sections of material.",
                "This course moved very rapidly and was taught in 12 small sections. My instructor was a graduate student who I didn't think did a good job of teaching material and wouldn't explain concepts very well. During a week we had a guest instructor, they made much more sense and I understood the lessons she taught much easier. I found that I had never taken a multivariable calc class before and about half of the people in the class had in high school, making it frustrating since they had learned much of the material and I was struggling to learn it at such a fast pace. I felt that the pre-class videos and work was lengthy, though good to get a brief introduction and the problem sets had very difficult problems that were harder than what we had done in class. I thought I didn't get enough repetition solving problems on the homework, since the problems were often lengthy and difficult and it made preparing for exams difficult. I would have liked to have a large lecture hall taught by one experienced professor so everyone is learning equally and getting fed the same content, or having one experienced lecturer's class recorded and posted so that I could go back and listen to them teach in a different manner. \r\n\r\nI am on a varsity athletics team and on days I missed class it could be difficult to learn content. I found I could get the class notes and watch the introductory concept videos but I didn't have as good of an understanding of the material or ability to ask questions. My instructors' office hours were during practice and the only help I could get was from peer tutors during their sessions mostly geared towards the homework. I would have really appreciated a recorded class to be able to both have when missing class for athletics and to be able to go back to and watch since I didn't like my instructors teaching style and would have liked to learn the content again, or get additional clarification.",
                "Good materials on Canvas (relied a lot on the videos posted).",
                "The videos and pre-class quizzes were useful tools to prepare before class, but I wish there was greater variety or flexibility in office hours, as I was almost always unable to join due to conflicting obligations.",
                "Strengths - There is lots of help available from the peer tutors, and there are enough resources given so that you could learn all the material well on your own. There are also lots of other students taking math 120 so it's easy to form study groups.\r\nWeaknesses - Because we had to watch the pre-lecture videos and complete the quiz before each class, it was hard for me to motivate myself to go to class because it felt like I learned everything in the videos.",
                "Strengths: The course covers a lot of important material for future courses at Yale, and there are a lot of resources for help if you need it. In my experience, the course instructors were good, and there are many great online resources if you need a different\/better explanation of a topic. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't think there are many, but the material is not always easy to wrap your head around. I was also not a fan of the problem sets given during the same week of our midterms and final, but they were technically relevant to the exam, so I understand why they had us do them.",
                "weighting the problem sets more and decreasing the material covered on each one, ie less topics per problem set and more problem sets, would help with learning the large amount of material",
                "Strengths: wealth of resources (videos, multiple practice exams, structured review sessions), well structured\r\nWeaknesses: at times, a bit too slow-paced",
                "Strengths: Material was useful and interesting\r\nWeaknesses: Pacing was weird, i felt that our lessons plans were usually a week ahead of the psets",

                "No. Taking an easier math class if possible is probably better because the grading can be harsh and without a curve it seems more difficult.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in math",
                "No, I thought it was run poorly, I would say that it is mostly instructed by teaching fellows and many people already know the material making it tough to learn it for the first time. I know this is a requirement for many majors so many people have to take it but if someone wanted a math class for fun I wouldn't recommend it.",
                "Yes, as I found the work to be challenging and rewarding. Besides, many STEM majors require some form or other of calculus.",
                "Yes. Over the semester I learned a lot that helps with my physics classes, and I feel more confident about calculus in general after taking this course. For a math major skipping 120 and taking 302 instead might be best though.",
                "Yes, to an extent. I think you really have to enjoy math to take this course. I found the information we learned fascinating, and although they aren't an integral part of the course, the proofs behind certain equations were really interesting and certainly help a lot when trying to apply the material to problems. I have heard from other students, however, that the lack of applications integrated into the course made the course somewhat boring and difficult to understand, but basically all higher-level math courses at Yale are like this, so this is good preparation. The course is definitely manageable, though, and the workload is not high (standard PSET every week). John Hall also posts great videos covering the topics relevant to each class with your instructor (who may also be John Hall) that I would recommend watching before each class. You are 100% expected to remember material from Math 115\/AP Calculus for this class, though, so if you're deciding between this class and Math 115, that's something to consider. I will say that I think some students struggle to adapt to MATH 120 because moving from single-variable calculus to multivariable calculus is a pretty big step as the third-dimension introduces a whole new way of thinking on top of the material you're learning in the class, but this process is inevitable, and it's very satisfying once you begin solving problems on your own. If the class is a requirement for you, I wouldn't worry. You will have to put effort in, but I would not consider this one of the more challenging math classes at Yale (I'm saying this in terms of relativity to higher level math classes, though).",
                "Yes! I'd recommend this course, even if you have taken multivariable calculus in high school. This course is very, very well structured, and there are so many resources provided to help with your learning of the material. You will leave the course having not only understood how to do the calculations, but also the why behind them.",
                "I would recommend this course if they need it for a class or the major down the road. But for fun, I would not recommend it. The psets take up a lot of time and I feel like the overall experience depends on the teacher.",
                "I would recommend this course to students that plan to continue taking math at Yale."
