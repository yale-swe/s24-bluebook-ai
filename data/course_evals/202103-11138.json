                "I improved my writing and speaking skills in Spanish by learning more vocabulary and grammar in Spanish.",

                "Greater grammatical and cultural knowledge of Spanish and Spanish-speaking countries.",
                "Reading, writing and speaking in Spanish",
                "basic spanish skills and improvement. mostly grammar and tenses",
                "This course helped develop skills useful for using and understanding the Spanish language.",
                "First of all, my reading and writing in Spanish have become better. The course involved intensive study of vocabulary, short passages and in-class compositions. These tasks and assignments have helped me to practice the most basic skills a Spanish learner needs. The pace of these tasks is designed well so that I never felt overwhelmed by coursework or pressure.\r\nMy speaking has also become better, and this has a lot to do with Prof. Pilar's \"No English\" policy in class. She encouraged us to think in Spanish in class and respond in Spanish whenever we could because relying on English translations will not be efficient. I still struggled a little bit in this aspect because I am still a beginner in Spanish and I am already used to thinking in English, but it's getting better. Another very amazing activity this course included was LinguaMeeting tutorials. I met with a coach online 6 times in this semester to enhance my understanding of specific topics I've covered in class. It provided me with additional opportunities to speak Spanish to someone who could correct my mistakes. What's more, LinguaMeeting offered an environment in which beginners like me did not feel embarrassed for making mistakes, which was essential to my speaking training. I hope this feature could be kept in this course for future students, as I myself have found it more than useful.\r\nMy listening certainly got better, but not as much, and I guess that has a lot to do with my relatively lack of use of this skill in my life. I don't have many friends who speak Spanish, I don't consume a lot of Spanish media. Prof. Pilar said that listening would take far more time to develop and I cannot simply rely on classes. I would have to actively train my Spanish listening in everyday life and I think her advice is helpful."

                "Very engaging which helps most for learning the language.",
                "Strengths- Professor was very kind. Lots of different activities in class- presentation, play, etc. \r\nWeaknesses- Significant amount of daily work. Sometimes the instructions on weekly activities wasnt super clear.",
                "they prepare you to take a test in spanish, but the focus is not always on how to speak well. It can also be a very stressful environment, with everything counting for a grade. overall i do not think this stress helps us improve. more review for things and how to piece what we learn together would help.",
                "The strengths of this course are the ease of using the textbook and Supersite for homework. The accessibility of these resources help students better study for the class. This pace of this course can be a weakness. The course moves extremely fast, making it very easy to fall behind and very difficult to catch up if you are behind.",
                "The greatest strength of this course is that it is nicely paced. It is neither too fast nor too slow. A lot of materials and subjects are covered in the class, but students still have enough time to absorb the knowledge fully. Particularly, I believe the asynchronous Wednesday is necessary. With that, I could make sure that I have understood materials covered in the first half of the week and prepare myself for the latter half. It makes sure that we have time to organise whatever we learnt in class so that we won't forget too quickly.\r\nClass engagement was also fantastic. Everyone knew each other in this class and we enjoyed all sorts of classroom activities, especially the finally project Pic-Nic. We read this Spanish play script and we acted it out, with our own modifications. It not only was a practice for our reading, but also for our speaking. It also brought us closer to Spanish culture."

                "Yes, spanish is important to know.",
                "I would. Spanish is a widely used language in the world and studying it will definitely make people more equipped in every way. This course is a very good starter for people like myself who want to systematically study a foreign language and become proficient. It is challenging, but not too much; it is intensive, but also engaging and fun; and most importantly, Prof. Pilar is a very good teacher who is always ready to help students. I believe others would like this course as well."
