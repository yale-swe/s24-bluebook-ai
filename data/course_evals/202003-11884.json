                "Strength: the classes exposes you in a great variety of different theories, and types of  data and dat representations\/ interpretations which allows students to make their own conclusions and think about the studied material. Very interesting material and the last studied collapse cases give you an understanding of more modern sociopolitical events. The instructor is also great.\r\n\r\nTo improve: sometimes the lecture was too long to keep being concentrated all through it. Having some more interactive elements like the multiple choice questions feature integrated in zoom or having a 5 minute break in the middle of the lecture would be helpful to refresh our concentration.",
                "The class was extremely informative. Professor Weiss is a fixture in the field of collapse and Near East research, and his insights are great. I think the course could be improved by the use of clearer presentations. While Professor Weiss has great commentary throughout lectures, the presentations are rarely as informative.",
                "I thought that there were too many student presentations. But Professor Weiss is a great professor who cares about his students",
                "The course material is really interesting and I enjoyed Professor Weiss providing his expertise. Plus, making student presentations was enjoyable. But, I found the course reading to be a little too much. Properly doing all the reading in some weeks was frankly impossible to do while balancing my other classes and commitments. And, many of the papers were difficult to read and highly technical. While the topics they covered were interesting, I found it hard to enjoy doing the reading. The course also felt a little disorganized when it came to things like the presentations - I felt like we were always a little behind there. But overall, I enjoyed the course.",
                "I would have liked to have read the papers before they were presented on, instead of after.",
                "I thought the course's material was well organized and Professor Weiss is clearly an expert on the subject. However, the lack of an enrollment cap combined with individual presentations each week took up the vast majority of class time. Having a smaller class or removing or shortening these presentations would have made each class more interesting and insightful.",
                "95% of the course was just students presenting based on the readings for that week. I would have preferred to have been lectured by the professor, since he did not lecture at all, with the exception of the first two weeks.",
                "Strengths: I appreciated that we read a few differing pieces on the definition of 'collapse' to preface actual societal collapse cases. 'Collapse' was an unfamiliar term to me before taking this course and it was interesting how quickly my understanding shifted with each work we dissected. Professor Weiss and our TA were also very forgiving and considerate of the circumstances for this year.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The biggest weakness of this class is the method of delivering presentations. Once we had past the introduction to proxy data and collapse definitions, every class was set up so that we sat through 3-5 presenters for a single collapse case. We often ran out of time, so the number of presenters per class only increased with the semester. My issue with this system is that this course meets only once a week, meaning that students were meant to listen to similar accounts of collapse within a near 2 hour period. We all read the same papers for the presentation day, but only really talked about them in section a week later.\r\nIf you didn't complete the readings on time, then it was trickier to follow the presentations. I therefore wonder if short reading responses graded for participation only would help with this problem.",
                "The course, beginning with an overview of various theories of collapse throughout the years and then continuing with a brief survey of major collapses, is a great introduction to this field. Many of the readings were quite interesting, but do suggest a one-sided perspective. I would have liked to see more diversity in the assigned readings, with more articles writing against the purported major role that climate change played in societal collapses. Further, the course was not very well organized. Professor Weiss suddenly changed the class format from seminar to lecture\/discussion section, which resulted in the lectures in the second half of the course being exclusively student presentations with very little input from the instructor.",
                "A wide variety of theories are covered, and students are encouraged to look critically at all of them to draw their own conclusions."

                "There weren't many pandemic-specific accommodations made outside of the virtual lecture format and virtual discussion sections.

                "None felt particularly geared toward it, it worked reasonably",
                "There were no practices put in aside from using Zoom. A couple of the earlier lectures were recorded, before it was decided that recorded lectures would only dissuade students from showing up to live class.\r\nSection made use of breakout rooms in Zoom for mini discussions.\r\n\r\nI would suggest for future classes, that face cameras be turned on. I know this probably sounds annoying for students who have yet to take this class, but without this forced \"engagement,\" you'll inevitably distance yourself from the class and its material. Even if face cameras are not mandatory, I would have liked to have done some form of student introduction after schedules were finalized. This class was technically a seminar before it morphed into a lecture, and I believe introductions would foster some semblance of a class vibe.\r\nWe never used the raise hand function and barely used chat in Zoom. It wasn't guaranteed that Professor would see a raised hand in a video either, so we had to unmute and jump into the conversation for questions. This makes participation a bit tricky for those who are either more quiet, or who don't have cameras on and are thus harder for Professor to identify."

                "Yes. The material is really interesting and Professor Weiss is a fun lecturer. He's clearly an expert in the field and hearing his perspective on topics is pretty cool. The required workload is also pretty low. There is an insane amount of reading, but luckily you don't really need to do it very thoroughly unless you are making a presentation. The course could be better organized. But overall, the material is interesting and it's a pretty low-stress class.",
                "Yes! It was so interesting to see the different directions everyone took their presentations. It really felt like the class had something for everyone.",
                "I would definitely recommend it to anybody looking to learn more about past civilizations' collapses. You don't need much background knowledge to get a lot out of the course, and you'll come away with a strong understanding of collapse literature and the importance of paleoclimate research and proxy data.",
                "Yes! It was a very interesting class for me since it is the first class where I learned about paleoclimate data.",
                "Yes!! Professor Harvey Weiss is a real character with some very strongly held beliefs on the topic, but also a deep knowledge of the scholarship on the issue and that makes for a super engaging class. Most of the class was taken up by student presentations after week five, but they covered such a wide array of topics and Prof. Weisss interjections and questions kept it spicy. Do not go into the course of youre expecting a serious course that will unpack the implications of climate change, but if youre willing to go along for the (often quite fun) ride and learn some very fascinating archaeological perspectives on societal collapse the class is amazing.",
                "I would, but I would make them aware that much of the course is just students presenting, which may be disappointing to some who wished to hear the professor lecture.",
                "Perhaps in a live setting, I would. I was among the students without their cameras turned on, and it sometimes felt a bit sad that the class had to be held in this format. Professor Weiss is personable and understanding, but as with the class style, his own personal style felt stifled by a sudden need to teach classes online.\r\nThis is a manageable class for people of all majors. You won't have any grade certainty for the entirety of the semester, and that may influence your decision to take the class. It is low workload for those who have stressful schedules, but I barely had any sense of how I was doing, which was its own source of stress at times.",
                "Yes. This class is great for students with an interest in environmental studies and past societies. It provides a different viewpoint to the mainstream perspective and I encourage students to exercise their critical thinking and analytical skills when thinking about the various theories.",
                "I would recommend this class to students interested in how societies function and especially the interplay between society and the environment. Some background in environmental science, or at least understanding graphs from that field, is helpful, but not required if you are interested."
