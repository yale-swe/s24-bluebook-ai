    "This is a really solid junior seminar! Learned a lot about testimony, memory, and uses of testimony and memory in history.",
    "I learned how to advance argument, to analyze a text, and how to understand historical conditions.",
    "How to critically think and analyze historical texts.",
    "A thorough look at the causes, course and consequences of the Holocaust. Deep analytical study of the ways in which we remember the Holocaust today and how the event still touches our lives.",
    "Historical research, writing, evaluation of opinions."

    "Professor Dean does an amazing job of facilitating class conversation during seminar and making sure readings are accessible.",
    "I could not improve this course!",
    "I thought this course was really great! The readings were interesting and related to each other well. I think the one thing that would have been helpful is more feedback on how to improve in the class.",
    "Strengths: readings, workload (not so low that people disengage, not ridiculously high for the sake of being so, as is the case in some junior seminars), narrow focus of the course, Prof Dean (cares so much! and extremely knowledgeable, of course)\r\nWeaknesses: we'd typically have a really strong conversation for the first half of the meeting, then get kind of caught up in some minutiae and stay there for the rest (while sometimes interesting, it did mean there was less discussion later on each class meeting)",
    "Strengths-very open discussions, great readings assigned, the Professor was great",
    "Strengths- engaging material, engaged professor, helpful topics of conversation",
    "Engaging and insightful readings supplement classroom discussion wonderfully. Professor Dean is very knowledgeable and structures productive and interesting classroom conversations.",
    "Strength was the how in depth we delved into the readings\r\nWeakness was that the productivity of the class depended on the involvement of the students, which meant class differed greatly from week to week"

    "Definitely!!",

    "yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It was amazing.",
    "Yes! I really enjoyed the readings and discussions. Super interesting.",
    "Yes! If you're interested in issues of memory and history (tbh, all history majors should be required to take a course that deals in memory studies), or if you're interested in the Holocaust and want to study it from a different perspective, or if you're just looking for a solid junior seminar with a rigorous but not insane workload.",
    "Yes I loved it!",
    "Yes, because of the material",
    "This course is a must-take in my opinion, even if you are not particularly interested in studying the time period in which it takes place. It is incredibly important to process and discuss the event in order to understand it. The class is one of the most engaging that I have ever taken part in and Professor Dean is brilliant\/able to foster highly productive and insightful discussions. I always looked forward to this class and to doing the readings that accompanied it. 10\/10.",
    "Yes, because it allowed me to understand more about memory as a field as opposed to historical knowledge"
