    "I learned about the function and structure of songs in musical theater. Additionally, I got to create my own and I loved it!",
    "There's a lot to get out of this oneoverview of musical\/song structures, writing opera librettos, Michael's industry knowledge, etc. Definitely use the course as an opportunity to workshop your stuff if you're currently working on a project. (Michael let me skip some assignments and instead bring in materials from my musical).",
    "how songs are structured, the strictness of rhyme for musicals, how to adapt something into a musical, how to properly format scripts to be read by theaters",
    "I learned a lot about musical theater and opera. We got to see a lot of excerpts from shows and also got to learn a lot about collaboration with other writers and how to get started as a writer in the theater world.",
    "lyric writing, crafting a libretto, musical theatre song structure, myriad examples of career advice",
    "SO much.",
    "Learned about musical theater song styles in terms of structure and feel and got to practice writing them. I learned so much about getting a theater production done out in the real world and loved getting to hear from and work with the visiting artists."

   "comments": [
    "I would have liked even more writing assignments so that I could get even more concrete feedback and apply my skills. The guests that came into class were amazing industry professionals.",
    "Michael is brilliant and understands the field super well, so use him as much as you can. But because the class is made up of such a varied group of people  YSM\/YSD students, theater people, non-theater people the pacing is all over the place. There might be 2-3 weeks where he assigns nothing, and then suddenly one week where you have to bring in two original lyrics and three ideas for a musical. The course title is also misleading, since a lot of the time the grad students aren't interested in writing \"conventional\" musicals, and this year we spent as much time on opera as musical theater.",
    "I liked the class but I felt like there was a strange mix of grad students and undergrads. Professor Korie tended to direct a lot of the teaching toward the grad students so it felt a bit frustrating for the undergrads. I liked how we got to practice writing lyric first songs and I also really enjoyed the guests.",
    "It was overall an incredible course. I learned more than I thought I could.",
    "Classes were relatively unstructured. I would have enjoyed in-class exercises and workshopping songs rather than spending so much time watching video material, although this material was very helpful to have as a resource but could have been watched as homework or individually."

    "Absolutely. Michael Korie is a great teacher and a really interesting person. He gives invaluable advice to creators of theater and opera. We got to listen to musical theater and opera as well as the works currently being developed by our classmates. I had a lot of fun listening to Michael's stories as well.",
    "If you're involved with Shen stuff, absolutely take the class. If you've done any musical theater writing, then you'll be sitting through a lot of review (e.g. AABA format, I Want songs, etc), but it's worth it for the workshop opportunity\/Michael connection (and connections with the guests he brings in e.g. Georgia Stitt, Craig Lucas). If you've never done lyric writing\/aren't studying theater, you'll learn a lot about the craft and the field. He's accommodating to different skill levels.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is ready to give a high level of work and intellectual engagement to this class. It requires a lot of self-motivation, and in order for your work to be creative and genuine, it takes a LOT of time-- to write a song each week! I think if my engagement had been higher I would have had a better time, and I regret it highly; this semester was a very difficult one and I wish I had added this class at a time I could have given more to it. \r\nI would definitely recommend this class to a student ready to meet grad students and industry people and make friends in the industry of Broadway and opera. You have to be ready for it, though.",
    "yep! i've never written songs before and an not a theater major. it was super fun. seriously don't stress about your grade; the most important thing to Michael is that you learned something and improved!",
    "if you're interested in lyric writing for musical theater, take the course!",
    "absolutely",
    "Absolutely. If you are interested in writing for musical theatre, this is a workshop-style way to hone your skills quickly with great feedback. Michael Korie has been an excellent teacher and facilitator of discussion amongst the students.",
    "If you are interested in any part of the creative aspect of theater and musical theater, Michael Korie provides wonderful insights and great comments!"
