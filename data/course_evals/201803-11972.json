   "comments": [
    "I learned the preterite vs. imperfect uses, present and imperfect subjunctive, future tense, conditional. A lot of grammar covered as well as readings.",
    "I learned a fair amount of Spanish grammar and developed speaking, reading, writing, and listening comprehensions skills.",
    "it strengthened my Spanish writing skills",
    "Spanish",
    "Improved spanish skills",
    "Spanish L3 was a great course for improving speaking, writing, and reading abilities in Spanish.  There is an understanding that you know most of the basics but they are reviewed briefly. The speed of the course picks up fairly quickly towards the end of the semester as more readings are assigned as well as may different tenses. The class does not have many standard exercises for learning the various conjugations as most of the material focuses on differentiating when to use the tenses which is nice as it reduces the amount of busy work but demands that effort be put into the class on your own time.",
    "How to speak Spanish with a special focus on grammatical structures.",
    "I developed my reading and writing skills immensely while also learning relevent vocabulary.",
    "How to understand, speak, write and read Spanish, as well as some culture of the Spanish-speaking world.",
    "In this course I was able to focus on my speaking and fluidity in the Spanish language due to the course's focus on transforming an elementary understanding of grammar into a more advanced understanding of usage and speech."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: this course is very well organized--the Spanish department does an excellent job at setting everything up in the syllabus with assignments and expectations. Even though you meet every day, the workload is manageable. We read several short stories and a novel, as well as watch some videos and movies in class. I found the class very engaging.\r\nWeakness: not very many weaknesses. I would say that reading the entire novel in one week was a bit much for me.",
    "I overall think this course is pretty solid. It gets us to learn the Spanish grammar well, we develop different kinds of skills, and offers good opportunities to learn about different Hispanic countries. One thing that I didn't love, though, is that we had been reading this 1-2 page short stories, and then suddenly at the end of the course we had to read dozens of pages in Spanish per night from a novel. I think perhaps the pace that we read the novel should be slowed down a little bit.",
    "I understand students have this class everyday, but I think having sometimes 2-3 hours per night is too much.",
    "Weaknesses: It is every day, and the readings are not helpful. There is too much of a focus on grammar.\r\n\r\nStrengths: It isn't too hard",
    "Better cultural information",
    "The everday structure, while taxing and sometimes stressful when other classes' workload increases, is very helpful in ensuring you do not forget the material right after it is learned. The coursebook is nice as it has everything needed for readings consolidated into one place, however the organization of the grammar and exercises is terrible. There is also not a clear table of contents which makes it difficult and frustrating to go back and look for sections when studying.",
    "I think a weakness of this course was the lack of speaking practice. I thought a strength of this course was the way in which grammar was taught.",
    "There is an equal focus on all skills of the language, which helps to develop all of them at a similar pace (i.e. I felt like my reading skills and writing skills were around the same level). I wish they would make L4 a three day\/week class, because I would take it if it wasn't every day.",
    "This class is interesting enough for someone who already has a very high interest in Spanish and has the internal motivation to learn. However, for those without the same level of interest, it can be difficult to form a connection to the material. The course lacks a well-rounded cultural curriculum and focuses heavily on arbitrarily chosen topics."

    "Yes! Spanish L3 was a very good course for me, I found it less intense as L2 since a lot of it at the beginning was a review which was helpful.",
    "Yes, it's a solid course that's not too hard, and if you need to take it then you need to take it.",

    "Yes!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, especially the specific professor I had, Deborah Symons!",
