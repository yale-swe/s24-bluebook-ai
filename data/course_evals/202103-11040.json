                "This was a great course to better understand France in a very honest way, discussing social, political, and economic topics that have shaped France and will continue to shape France in the future.",
                "I learned about French culture and politics, while developing my written and oral skills in French.",
                "I learned a lot about issues in contemporary France on a wide array of themes. This course is oriented towards improving spoken and conversational French, but there were also many assignments that helped with improving written French. The class also teaches a lot of new and relevant vocabulary.",
                "French culture and society through news articles, background readings, films, and even music. We discussed many of the ideas and controversies that are central to French culture, such as religion, racism, immigration, family and sexuality, the French education system, French language diversity, etc. I greatly improved my oral French through in-class discussion and the 2 oral exams. Short essays also helped me become a more confident writer.",
                "French oral and writing",
                "Very little: the readings, the conversation, and the writing prompts were all painfully boring. Part of this comes from the nature of the class you can only talk about France for so many 9am classes. In effect, the class is a glorified AP French because you spend the whole class comparing France to the US or other French-speaking countries. I think it was just upsetting because I took the class with a goal of improving my conversation in the context of film, but the grading distribution and the focus of class-time rarely makes this the case. Written assignments make up the bulk of your grade, such as in-class essays and weekly writing assignments; the class size is bound to be large because there's always high demand, which means there are few opportunities to speak; every person in the class has to give a 40-minute long presentation, which means you spend one class a week listening to a presentation; the discussion questions we talked about in class were always extremely bland (i.e, from this list of dates about the evolution of environmental laws in France, which was your favorite?); and we watched very few films!!! I bonded with classmates by complaining about how much of a waste of time the class felt.",
                "My conversational French improved. I learned about various issues and topics having to do with France and France-speaking countries.",
                "I furthered my understanding of french by learning about french culture",
                "Understanding of French political culture and themes through vocabulary and readings.",
                "better command of spoken and hearing french",
                "How to write better in french!",
                "I learned a staggering amount about the culture, politics, and history of France, its regions, and the Francophone world. I further developed my speaking and writing skills, in addition to gaining a large body of vocabulary around current events and controversial issues. I had the opportunity to do comparative analysis between the USA and France, which gave me a better understanding of both countries. This course prepared me well for experiences in France and further study of the language and culture.",
                "I learned so many things about France's culture including on topics of healthcare, family, sexuality, the environment, politics, the geography and agriculture, just to name a few! I learned how to read, speak, and listen to French better, and now know many things, including lots of statistics and new vocabulary, that I'll never forget."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Variety of French media, readings, films, etc. Good opportunities for discussion and debate.\r\nWeaknesses: There was some discussion of Francophone countries but it could be interesting to learn in a more systematic way. Course was more writing-heavy than anticipated.",
                "All of the assigned readings, films, etc. for this course are very relevant, but sometimes the class discussions lack structure and there is not enough time to talk about everything that might be relevant for the exam. I would have liked to spend more time learning about some of the issues from the perspective of other francophone countries and potentially spend less time talking about laicite. Although it is a very pertinent topic, it felt like we talked about it much longer than any other issue.",
                "Strengths: The topics were really interesting and the films that were assigned were really enjoyable. I appreciated the diversity in terms of assignments (weekly short responses, two written exams, two oral exams, one presentation, and several mini-presentations).\r\nWeaknesses: There are way too many readings. We rarely got to discuss all of the readings, which was frustrating because a lot of students spent a lot of time reading, and then the readings weren't even discussed.",
                "Strenghs: Madame Pinzka makes class super engaging and I always enjoy listening to her input to many of the topics we're discussing. I liked the variety of class materials that ranged from films to news articles. I felt the format of the oral exams were well-designed and didn't feel repetitie. For example, for the second oral exam, the 15-minute presentation was a good opportunity to synthesize knowledge and vocabulary from the semester, while interviewing a French-speaking person felt much more informal and fun. Weaknesses: sometimes I felt like there were too many readings and we wouldn't have enough time in class to discuss them all, but it would be hard to know before class which materials I should focus on. The student presentations were also a little too long at times.",
                "Strength: the materials are mostly interesting and well put-together\r\nWeakness: sometimes it feels like a lot of work",
                "Strengths: the movies we watched were great. I would have liked it to even be more film-centered. \r\nWeaknesses: Tons of homework. Sometimes 8 articles to read, a film, a writing response, and 200 new vocab words.",
                "Strengths: well-structured syllabus, engaging course, thoughtful professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very hard, difficult to receive constructive feedback, especially on pronunciation and grammarneeds a review of grammatical concepts",
                "Strengths are the vocabulary and reading material. Weaknesses could be the structure of discussions. They could be outlined clearer.",
                "very good training of oral skills.",
                "loved the different topics. a ton of homework though",
                "The readings and movies for this course were chosen well, and the emphasis on discussion in class was excellent. In fact, I think this course could be improved by having even more emphasis on in-class discussion; for example, maybe some of the small-group discussions could be replaced with more whole-class discussion, as I benefitted a lot from hearing the opinions of a large number of my classmates.",
                "I wish that this course could be broken into 2 and taught across 2 semesters because that are SO many interesting articles to read, we simply didn't have time to touch on them all during class. I would have liked to cover more of the them during our discussions. Apart from that, I think that the class was really amazing and wouldn't change a thing."

This class focuses more on societal topics and current affairs, which felt refreshing after reading all the literary works in L5 French. Very interactive and engaging, and Madame Pinzka is such an approachable and energetic professor.",

I still felt pushed to improve and do well and learn though.  The content was never boring - we even watched  a few  films that were super  interesting. The course does a great job also of including the francophone world that isn't just the mainland of France."
