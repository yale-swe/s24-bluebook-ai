Its hard to fully describe everything that I learned and the skills I picked up from this course cannot be put into such few words. My project focused on the UN and Afghanistan and was led by the amazing Dr. Andrew Wilder. With his insights and guidance we produced a report for the United Nations with recommendations for how they should continue their assistance mission in Afghanistan. Beyond learning the context and history of  both the United Nations and Afghanistan. Dr. Wilder introduced us to over 50 individuals who we interviewed and spoke with to gain insights on this space and this topic."
