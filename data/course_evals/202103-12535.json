Also the sheer level of knowledge that Professor Darnell has about the grammar system and Egyptology was evident in the relaxed and encouraging manner in which the class was ran thsi semester. A weakness of the course was that there was sometimes a lack of structure in the course. It was difficult to try and keep up with the grammar that was just expected for us to learn on our time outside of class. It was difficult to take notes on learning to recoginze the grammar structures covered because we mainly discussed the topics as they came up, which would have been helpful for future retention and work.",
                "Professor Darnell is an expert of the field and shares many spectacular stories to provide a broader understanding of Egyptian culture and history. The class is incredibly fun and interesting. The reading of the texts presents a good environment to review Middle Egyptian grammar while extending familiarity to new Standard Theory terminology. The difficulty of the class is largely determined by the student, facilitating learning by establishing a low stress setting in which additional resources are given for further exploration. While being less structured than expected, I found this to motivate intellectual curiosity and as an added advantage to the class. The midterm and final assessments were fair and helpful to gain practice with reading and analyzing grammatical forms. Overall, the course was an excellent seminar-style continuation of the Egyptian language sequence.\r\nThere were no weaknesses.",

                "I found it perfect! I really enjoyed the informal discussions of the texts along with working through the translations and grammatical details in class. I thought that the exams were very fair and very useful in terms of learning; they were not that easy but, with time, doable and extremely worthwhile in terms of learning. I also appreciate the level of detail we went over the reading in."

At times that work assignments can be a bit much, but overall I thought that the pacing of the course was great and Professor Darnell was fantastic and it is clear that he truly has a passion for Egyptology that he wants to share with others.",
                "Yes! This is an excellent continuation of the Egyptian language sequence that focuses on expanding knowledge of the grammatical system, introducing terminology from Polotsky's Standard Theory, and practice reading. We were able to see a broad selection of Egyptian literature, which is all quite fun. Professor Darnell makes the class super interesting with the inclusion of many stories about Egyptian culture and history. It is rewarding to apply your knowledge from L1/L2 to more texts in the original. Definitely take this class!",

                "absolutely, super fun class!",
                "Absolutely! If you enjoyed L1 and L2, then I strongly suggest taking this course. You'll gain a deeper appreciation of the Egyptian writing system and really understand how to read hieroglyphic, including how the grammar is interpreted in different theories."
