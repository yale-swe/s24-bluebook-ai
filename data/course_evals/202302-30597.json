The readings offered profound insights into contemporary US politics and society, all while being reasonably manageable in volume. With the help of Professor Vogel and Elyse, I also improved a lot in writing philosophy papers and argumentative essays in general.",

                "I really enjoy how the course includes political aspects in many part of the materials. But unfortunately, the more the class continues, it became less philosophical and more leaning into political beliefs; sometimes I feel cornered to answer questions as right and wrong, even though in philosophy you are allowed to have personal approach. I have a hard time understanding the class and I also felt like the class turn into a competition every discussions.",
                "The equilibrium between students voicing out our interpretations and Professor Vogel's teaching struck a perfect chord. Both facets of the course were very informative and thought-provoking. Our teaching assistant, Elyse Boldt, was also extremely helpful and knowledgeable. I think her assistance was also a great part of the course's value. \r\n\r\nWhile the course itself was exceptional, I would say that sometimes the discussion on one or a few of the readings becomes so heated that we no longer have time to discuss the other ones. Probably lengthening each class would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: insightful class discussion, thorough feedback in assignments, and very helpful teaching staffs\r\nWeakness: the clarity of expected outcomes in assignment, I think? it was hard for me to wrap my head around the explanation about assignments and its expected outcome"

The readings draw from not only past philosophers but also contemporary media outlets, and the discussions frequently refer to the societal and political situations of a variety of nations.",
