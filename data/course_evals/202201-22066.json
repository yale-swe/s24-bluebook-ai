                "The course covers many techniques and has mini projects, which is a strength.",

                "The course is definitely good practice for micropipetting, plating bacteria, working with light\/phase contrast microscopy, etc. I appreciated how the course reinforced techniques by having us perform most of them multiple times. The lab reports never felt overwhelming but were a good way to consolidate all the information.\r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, the course organization definitely stood out. Lab handouts typically weren't posted until the morning of the lab, leaving us in the dark about what we'd actually be doing. Due dates were also somewhat poorly communicated, and it was difficult to get in touch with the instructor over email. Additionally, I felt like the last third of the course (\"medical microbiology\"), while somewhat interesting, was fairly similar to the middle third in that the goal was still to identify bacterial isolates. I think introducing more techniques or setting different goals would've made for a more engaging conclusion to the semester.",
                "The class was extremely poorly organized. Due dates for assignments were changed or announced sometimes days before, or changed even after the initial due date had already passed. Lab protocols were posted at inconsistent hours, sometimes only shortly before the start of class periods, or not at all. No guidelines or rubrics were provided for assignments until well after mid-semester, and it was difficult to contact the teaching team.",
                "This course was well organized for our learning. Professor Wertz was always available to provide his knowledge and help and I learned so much through this course. One thing, however, is that I wish assignment due dates were posted earlier as they were often posted very close to the deadline."
