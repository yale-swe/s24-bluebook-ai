                "I learned the deep history of Afro Asian intimacies across three centuries. My specific education in Caribbean ethnopolitics was insightful.",
                "This class addresses such an important topic and one that I have wanted to study for a long time; I was thrilled to see it among the offered courses this semester. The readings are long and difficult, but well-selected and woven together such that by the end of the semester I really felt like I had surveyed the field and was able to understand current scholarship with much more depth than I otherwise would have been. Professor Chan Tack's own research interests and background played a large part in this; she is clearly passionate and knowledgeable about the subject matter and it shows.",
                "Breadth and depth of understanding of processes of racialization (and its intersections with other elements like gender) and Afro-Asian collaboration\/conflict in various local contexts.",
                "I developed a keen appreciation for and understanding of the political, social\/historical, and theoretical issues\/ideas surrounding Afro-Asian relations and race as a whole. The course may seem niche, but was the perfect vehicle to interrogate and deconstruct race as a product of historical power and processes. We tackled many seminal readings on politics and race, as well as specific histories (e.g. labor\/culture in post-colonial Caribbean), and specific issues (e.g. Asian-Black coalition building) that all contributed towards a more holistic understanding. It helped me further explore my place in US politics and social justice and think critically about racial solidarity."

            "comments": [
                "The curriculum was engaging and well structured. I believe classroom discussion could be more standardized.",
                "The course had a significant reading load, which sometimes made it difficult to engage with all the material to the depth I would have wanted to. Because the course only met once per week, it was also difficult to get to all of the readings during each class period. I would suggest increasing the number of class hours and the number of credits for the course, so that there is more space to engage with all the material. I wouldn't suggest reducing the workload because all of it felt so valuable and important.",
                "Strengths: excellent set of readings (I've sent them to my friends), invigorating class discussions, Prof Chan Tack is a highly supportive instructor and very responsive to students (e.g. reduced heavy reading workload when we were having trouble managing). I repeat, Prof Chan Tack is *AMAZING* SO YALE PLEASE BRING HER BACK",
                "The overall content and structure of the course was extremely powerful and engaging, featuring well-planned readings that progressively deepened and enriched conversations on history and various theoretical issues. The earlier readings on academic issues and theoretical approaches to race help you understand the middle readings on historical themes and issues and then the later readings on specific histories\/communities and issues like coalition building today. However, the course reading load was relatively high and often haphazardly communicated\/adjusted throughout the semester, mostly due to the course's infant status. It would be great to better organize the location of the readings and the syllabus more. The class discussions, although frequently long and unstructured, were generally engaging due to the students in the course and the teacher's input.",
                "The strengths of this course are the professor and the wide range of readings that are done. Professor Chan Tack is gracious, understanding, and generous, and she cares deeply about all of her students. She is more willing to listen to students and their feedback on the class, and always engages so thoughtfully with students in discussion."

                "Yes, for anyone who wants to bridge their knowledge of ethnic relations across Asian and Black peoples, this is a great opportunity.",
                "Yes definitely! The course was fascinating and laidback; the focus really seemed to be on learning both independently and as a cohort. The atmosphere was supportive and collegial and I really enjoyed class time.",
                "Absolutely. One of the best courses offered in the ER&M and Sociology departments. Gives you a really rich understanding of Afro-Asian relations, its history, many different examples. You also gain a robust understanding of the different ways groups are racialized and how gender and class intersect with those experiences\/processes. Super interesting stuff, definitely take a look at the well put together syllabus if you are even remotely interested in these topics.\r\n\r\nAlso, Prof Chan Tack is one of the most brilliant and cool and kind professors ever so I hope she comes back to teach again at Yale!!!",
                "I would highly recommend this to students with a strong interest or background in exploring race and politics, especially from the lens of Black\/Asian relations, history, and solidarity in the US. It has a broad scope and difficult concepts, but lots of points of entry for different students and is a truly fascinating course.",
                "Yes! Sadly, Professor Chan Tack is not returning to Yale, but I hope she will one day so that more students can have this wonderful experience."
