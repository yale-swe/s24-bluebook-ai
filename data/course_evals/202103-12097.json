This could be improved with slightly more structure and overview of some referential material, but the class itself is ambitious in scope which I appreciated. In general, the subject material is very interesting but the nature of the writing requires lots of time spent decoding and contextualizing. This makes it rewarding when you finally piece the concepts together, but additional context or brief overviews of chapters could streamline the process. The class was also smaller than usual with I think was a downside, since it would have been easier to unpack with a slightly larger group. But also with too many people, it would be hard to work through things in a meaningful way. The flexibility given for presentations was particularly nice."
