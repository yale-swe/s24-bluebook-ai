                "A strength of this course is how students are immersed in learning ASL through ASL culture. This feature of the course made it extremely interactive, making it easier to learn the language. One weakness of the course, in my opinion, is the requirement for attending a certain amount of events and logging the hours. While I understand the motive, I think the requirement falls a bit flat in terms of accessibility. There is a certain privilege in assuming that all ASL students have expendable time outside of class. Many Yale students come from low-income backgrounds, may pay for their education themselves, and need the time outside of class to work students jobs. Outside the realm of \"time is money\", students, whether working or not, do also value the rest time they are allotted outside of class. Yale is an extremely taxing environment to be in for 9 months. Rest is necessary. Requiring a certain amount of hours for event engagement may create resentment towards the ASL program instead of community.",
