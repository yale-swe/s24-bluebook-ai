Also a great deal about curation and all that goes into curating an exhibit for a museum.",
                "Knowledge of modern art movements, specifically Alexander Calder; museum curation and collarboration",
                "I learned how to look at art in a more thorough way, using the context of the artists and the time period, and I learned how museum exhibitions are organized.",
                "I learned so, so much from this course.  Not only how to organize an exhibition and think about a work in a larger context, but also how to think more deeply and critically about contemporary art.  I learned about a lot of different disciplines and jobs that come together to create an exhibition, which was really fascinating for me, someone who is interested in going into curation\/the art world.",
                "I learned a lot about biomorphism, Alexander Calder, and other modern artists. The class also pushed me to consider objects from the perspective of a museum visitor, and to think through many of the questions curators face when considering how to display works of art."

                "The primary strength of the course is definitely Prof. Mark Mitchell -- though it's unclear whether this exact course will be taught again in the future, he provides such a unique and rewarding experience in any course he teaches. As the curator of the art gallery, he 1) makes available incredible resources and connections available to students (e.g., trips to West Campus, tours of the gallery, conversations with conservators, photographers, and other curators, etc.), and 2) provides a unique perspective as a museum curator, as opposed to an academic art historian. Prof. Mitchell created an incredibly welcoming and inclusive environment that allowed for interesting discussion among a group of students with a wide range of experience in art and art history. Not necessarily a weakness, but a caveat of the course is that it likely would not be described as a \"traditional\" art history course. The class definitely emphasized the curation of an exhibition with an associated focus on visitor experiences rather than the intricate details of art history, so that's something to be aware of before committing to take the course.",
                "Such a great environment for learning and discussing about the topics at hand and it was always a joy to go to class. The readings were always so much and I would often skip some of them.",
                "The hands-on nature of this course and Mark's expertise were a really unique and fun experience. Going to the gallery and to West Campus was really exciting and I feel I got a lot out of those aspects of the course. \r\n\r\nThat being said, there was a LOT of reading in this class that either felt redundant or entirely unnecessary to class discussions. Week-to-week readings would often say similar or the same things, and we would rarely refer to the readings in class, so as a non-art history major I often found myself not doing the readings at all.",
                "This provides unique opportunities for students to learn about the art museum and speak with curators and conservators. I wish that our clas discussions were more dynamic and varied in structure.",
                "This course is extremely strong.  I loved it so, so much.  I think it could be improved with even more time in the gallery, although I really did cherish our roundtable conversations, as I learned so much from my peers.",
                "The discussion style of this course, along with the fact that it's structured around a real material exhibition made the course very engaging."

                "Absolutely! It was wonderful getting to learn from and hear the perspective of a museum curator rather than an academic art historian. Even as someone with little (effectively no) experience in art or art history, I found the class the manageable and incredibly rewarding. Though it's likely this exact class will not be offered in the future, I cannot recommend enough any class taught by Prof. Mitchell!",
                "Absolutely. Even though this is a one time course, I loved it so much and the discussions in class with Professor Mitchell is a highlight so far of my Yale education.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I recommend this course to anyone slightly interested in modern art.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course.  It has been one of my favorite classes at Yale.  It was absolutely incredible.  I learned so much about art analysis from the course content, but also from the incredible students in my class.  Their insights were insanely intelligent!  I learned so much from hearing them and my professor talk.",
                "Yes, I would! It offers rare access to Yale collections and to discussions with a curator about developing an exhibition, which felt special and valuable.",
                "Absolutely, especially with Prof. Mitchell! You'll actually learn what goes into exhibition design and planning, which I feel like doesn't happen in many other history of art courses."
