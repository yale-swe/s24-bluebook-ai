                "A LOT of different things Ive never heard of before: shifters, modality, wave functions, etc. This class has definitely added another layer of what worlds and possible worlds and how to view them or analyze them.",
                "This course was not helpful. My essay writing skills did not improve. The readings, although some were interesting, were not cohesive and many were not discussed at all.",
                "Learned about the anthropology of possible worlds. To clarify - as stated in the syllabus, this course isn't about possible worlds per se, but about how people interact with possible worlds. For example, we spent a lot of time focusing on how we use language to discuss possible worlds - like how a \"proposition\" (a true/false statement) can be viewed as a set of possible worlds where the proposition is true. - In other words: this isn't really looking into anthropology in other worlds, but about looking at anthropology through the view of things like what it means to be 'possible' or 'necessary' and how possibility/necessity etc are used by people to shape worlds, and such. You do have a lot of interesting readings though, like a lot of short stories by Ted Chiang, which are interesting to read.",
                "I learned a great deal about modality, some of the ideas underlying the concept of possibility, and a new lens of analysis for literature!",
                "I learned how to think about linguistics and literature through the lens of anthropology.",
                "I learned about different frameworks for viewing the world using possible worlds logic (ie linguistic modality)",
                "I was introduced to part of the wide range of fields/ideas that is anthropology. Some of my favorite topics to learn about were the frameworks for talking about a world, the design features of language, and looking for anthropology in some interesting science fiction stories.",
                "I had never taken an anthropology course before, but this class was far beyond what I expected anthropology to be. The anthropology of possible worlds is not the typical look at distant civilizations that anthropology or ethnography often seem to be. This class opened my eyes to a new way of viewing language, interaction, and reality. It's almost impossible to encapsulate what this class teaches in few words. I don't even think the syllabus does the class justice, but instead of needing to look at ancient or distant cultures to find differences between me and another, I can look just at my neighbor, whose unique ontologies fill a universe with worlds.",
                "I learned about linguistics and a different aspects of anthropology, often times pertaining to the imagination and modality.",
                "I learned a lot about how to approach papers that are, on the surface, quite difficult to understand. This class focuses on an interesting way of thinking about people's perspectives, but honestly there is not much practical use with the information learned in the course. I saw it as an interesting thought experiment every class!",
                "I was given a toolbox of technical terms to evaluate perception. The main concepts were ontology and worlds, how they are defined, and how the interact."

                "Strengths: very manageable workload, professor and TA are extremely chill and approachable for questions of ANY sort \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: kind of wished there was more time for actual discussions and not always just asking the teacher questions",
                "This course is not really a seminar. Students address questions to Professor Kockelman, and he will answer (taking anywhere between 5 and 15 minutes to answer each one). However, several times, Prof. Kockelman did not answer the question that was being asked at all. No students conversed with each other, so there was not good discussion about possible worlds, instead there was just Prof. Kockelman's view and research. This course was very much advertised incorrectly, and it was not an interesting seminar that was an ease into linguistic anthropology. This course would be improved by having more discussion and readings that were all discussed and contributed to the greater ideas of the course.",
                "The content is interesting. The class made me think a lot about what it means for something to be 'possible' or 'necessary,' and it does give a new lens to look at the world (through possibility/necessity/etc.) With that said - the class makes use of a lot of mathematical logic, and though it's introduced,  it can be confusing if you aren't already familiar with logic. Discussions tended to have a lot of professor management, and could have been made more seminar-like by having more inter-student discussion. Some of the requirements for assignments was also unclear - for example, the most common assignment was to take notes on readings for class, and the notes were restricted to have only 1 page limits, which (1) felt arbitrary and underspecified since 1 page varies by formatting and (2) felt restrictive since it limited what we could put down. (They had their reasons, since they wanted to emphasize concision, but still.) - overall the class would have benefited from more student discussion and clarity in assignment expectations.",
                "I thought this class had a really excellent range of readings (I loved the sci-fi and the Kathleen Stewart) and I appreciated the open format of classes, but I felt without a structure or order to the conversation in class it was sometimes easy to get lost. I appreciated when we started ordering questions into groups toward the end of the session, that helped!",
                "Strengths: The fiction readings were really good selections to apply the concepts to.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough direction for assignments. More discussion would be better than a Q&A session during class. Questions piled up and some people's questions would end up being way far removed from the current conversation. Made class hard to follow.",
                "The readings were a strength of this course and covered a variety of fields. However, our discussion was sometimes lacking direction and class time was often spent just asking questions for the professor to answer directly instead of discussing the topic with each other.",
                "The course had some interesting readings but I felt like the succession of content was disorganized and often times I was unsure how to engage with the readings in the context of the course. The seminars were also poorly facilitated - they were essentially Q&A sessions with no guiding logic and I would have liked to see more structure in the course generally. I also think more time could have been spent at the beginning of the course laying down the foundational ethos / pedagogical aim of the course since this could have given more structure and significance to what we were learning. Often I felt lost and detached from the readings, however interesting they might have been.",
                "The discussions and readings were extremely interesting and thought-provoking. The class could have been structured a bit more clearly, though, so that we could track our progression over the course rather than just bouncing from topic to topic.",
                "I liked how the class covered a wider variety of topics, and the discussions allowed a lot of freedom in what we could talk about and what questions might lead to. For a summer class, this was one of the more reasonable workloads. I also really appreciated the breaks during the 3 hour classes, but even with those, the second half of a class could sometimes get tiring. \r\n\r\nFor some readings, I found a lot of enjoyment in also reading up about the author/anthropologist. Perhaps the beginning of class could be spent on a short explanation of who the author is/was and an overview of their works?",
                "Despite this courses awesome base concept, it can sometimes be a bit dry. It's difficult to learn some of the concepts or, at least, difficult to keep adding new vocabulary to the same concepts. It can feel repetitive, but honestly, it isn't.",
                "More discussion and less lecturing would probably be nice. And zoom makes it hard to have a steady flow in conversation.",
                "The class was very much formatted as a question and answer session with the professor rather than a discussion (some of the best discussions occurred in the chat, which made it hard to pay attention simultaneously to what Professor Kockelman was saying at the time). The strengths were the really fascinating readings (most of the time) and the cool people that a wacky class like this attracts!",
                "The grading for the reading notes felt inconsistent, but the general course layout worked well for summer session and course engagement. I also get like I got a different class from what I signed up for. The actual course was a lot more invested technical anthropology."

Students address questions to Professor Kockelman, and he will answer (taking anywhere between 5 and 15 minutes to answer each one).

No students conversed with each other, so there was not good discussion about possible worlds, instead there was just Prof. Kockelman's view and research. This course was very much advertised incorrectly, and it was not an interesting seminar that was an ease into linguistic anthropology.

                "This is a fairly interesting course, though you may have to take some time to understand concepts like \"possible worlds logic.\" (In my opinion there is a soft math-logic requirement, I think I benefited from having some basic familiarity with mathematical logic.) - That said, I know that there were a bunch of people who were really confused throughout the course, and this was understandable, since the discussions aren't always formatted well and don't always clarify things in the readings. - All in all, I enjoyed the course and found it very interesting, but cold be confusing at times.",
                "Absolutely, especially if you're interested in the idea of worlds!",
                "No. The professor isn't very good at explaining the concepts in simplified terms even when asked. He gives lots of roundabout responses to questions and manages to not answer the question anyway after 20 minutes of listnening to him talk.",

                "Yes, I would probably recommend this class. Some of the readings were genuinely interesting, and some discussion sections led to fun questions and tangents. The wider scope of the class, and the more humanities-focused people that I met in it, helped me find some new interests in language and linguistics.",
                "I would recommend this class. I think professor Kockelman has a wonderful and creative personality, and I think the course material is full of talking points that keep me interested a month after the class ended.",

                "I would only recommend this course if the student likes to think abstractly--otherwise, this class will be painful.",
                "Yes! Prof K is passionate about the subject and can provide a wealth of genuine, well-developed perspectives. Just realize that you will deal more with technical anthropology (how we define a world and how those definitions interact)."
