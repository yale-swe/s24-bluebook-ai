    "I learned about the philosophical and psychological accounts of emotion, which is a fascinating topic in and of itself. But what I gained most from the class was the ability to use different approaches (psychological and philosophical) to inform one another.",
    "Great background on the topic, working up to the present.  The presentations in particular were helpful in learning how to lead productive discussion without overpowering other people or hiding behind visual aids.",
    "This course developed my ability to engage with challenging philosophical text and understand complex arguments.",
    "In this class, we read and discussed myriad philosophical theories about emotions. We got a brief sense of the history of this area of philosophy as well as an in-depth examination of contemporary thinking on the subject. We also honed our writing, arguing, and presenting skills (as is the nature of a philosophy seminar).",
    "I learned a lot about how to engage philosophically with cognitive science papers. I felt I was provided with a good overview of emotional philosophy over the years as well.",
    "I learned how to examine the human psyche philosophically, and how to use seeming counter-examples to refine a theory. It was also the first time I put forward a really new theory, and even if it may not be fully developed, I felt that that was an important step."

   "comments": [
    "At the beginning, it sometimes seemed like we tried to cover too much material. The instructors would make handouts and we would often not get through much of them, especially if there was also a student presentation that day. However, the instructors were very responsive to feedback and it wasn't really a big issue. The handouts were very helpful. I enjoyed many of the readings and appreciated that they weren't particularly long, which meant I was genuinely able to do all of them thoroughly. The combination of philosophical readings with more scientific readings was very interesting and conducive to understanding and evaluating how the philosophical principles applied in real life.",
    "The discussions were well facilitated and the instructors were dedicated and caring and very nurturing. The workload was also perfect---enough to challenge you and keep you actively engaged, but not too stressful.",
    "Strengths: Great discussion, David in particular was very helpful in clarifying students comments so we could engage with what one another meant to say instead of getting caught up in misunderstandings.  A very reasonable workload meant that enough people did the readings so that the conversation was interesting and engaging.  The required abstract was very helpful in planning and writing the final paper, especially because we got feedback on it.  I genuinely felt like David and Juan were interested in what we had to say and that they cared about the class.  Amazing, incredibly intelligent professors.  They made themselves very available for meetings and helped talk through material before presentations.  I cam into this class a little overwhelmed and they were enormously helpful in making it an enjoyable, valuable experience.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it would be nice to have a little more structure to the overall trajectory of the readings for the course but what we did have was very helpful.",
    "The course was heavily focused on in-class discussions which improved my ability to articulate ideas and salient points in a concise manner. I believe the course could benefit from weekly reading responses to ensure students are engaging with the material correctly and gleaning pertinent ideas from the texts.",
    "Because this semester was the first time it was offered, the beginning of the class was a little bit unfocused and the discussion was lacking. However, as the class found its rhythm, class discussion improved greatly and the conversations became more interesting. This class is largely what you make of itif you read the material and are interested in participating, it will be a very fruitful experience.",
    "I came into this class wanting more of a philosophy class, and I think by the end I felt like it was more focused on cognitive science. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, but I think that it should be emphasized early on that this class will be more cognitive science based than it lets on.\r\n\r\nStrength is excellent instructors!!",
    "strengths: interesting material, good class setup, great teachers, lots of support, a meaningful but not immense workload\r\nweaknesses: it was hard to keep all the different authors and theories straight"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Very interesting readings that weren't too long, which meant I could read them thoroughly and made talking about them in class easier. Both instructors were responsive to student feedback and they made handouts for each class that were really helpful for understanding the material and facilitating discussion. I really appreciated the combination of philosophical reading with more scientific reading, and it was really helpful for evaluating and understanding the philosophical arguments.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially to someone who is interested in an interdisciplinary approach to philosophy and psychology.",
    "Yes, absolutely.  Both of the instructors were invested and helpful.  The readings are of a reasonable length and the discussion was generally lively, productive, and enjoyable.  The workload is manageable, but still engaging.",
    "Yes, this course exposed me to material I had little experience with prior to taking the class and expanded my knowledge of the intersection between philosophy and cognitive science.",
    "Yes! For someone who is interested in this type of philosophy, this class is a great seminar. However, the class is focused on really one thingwhat are emotions and what implications do different definitions have?so if you are not that interested in this, it might get old. It is also cool in that it incorporates psychological points of view towards the end of the course.",
    "I would, but only if they are really interested in cognitive science. Most of the students in the class knew a lot of cognitive science already, so I felt a little disadvantaged in our discussions.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Though at the beginning I had my reservations, it turned out to be a great course whose style was unlike any other courses I had taken, but nevertheless excelled (the style was all seminars, with 2 papers and no exams). It gave me the freedom to think deeply about questions and write papers that actually were deeply thought-out and meaningful, rather than just written to be done with or to get a grade."
