                "This course is a great way for ER&M students to convene and learn together! It was really exciting to learn about my peers' projects and hear their feedback. \r\n\r\nI think the course could be improved by adding emphasis on the peer review and collaboration, and decreasing the amount of time spent on basic writing skills. At one point, we were placed in \"reading groups,\" but never met with those groups again to discuss our projects together. A model that focuses on students' actual projects would also be more inclusive of students who are not writing final papers, and it would be possible to direct students towards the writing center/textual resources to cover citation practice, the basics of writing a research paper, etc.",
                "I think the class was helpful in having the opportunity to learn about peer ER&M student thesis, though I think it would be beneficial for students to have projects that help build towards the research and writing in a more substantial way. Instructions for assignments were not always clear and were sometimes not given in writing with rubrics being provided only after assignments were graded.",
