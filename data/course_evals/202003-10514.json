Exams were representative of our learning and the Professor (Farina) gave us very clear feedback and a lot of help to hone our skills. Very charismatic Professor, made the course so interesting. I especially enjoyed the lessons on culture (film, holidays, food, etc) because it gave me a real taste of the country. No weaknesses."
