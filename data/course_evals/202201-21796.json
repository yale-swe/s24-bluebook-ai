This course taught me a significant amount about the field of economic history, which is something rare at Yale. We were exposed to some of the most recent seminal papers in that field, and discussed the broader implications on our understanding of American history. In terms of material, I would best describe this course as similar to AP US History, but with much more of a focus on data. Still, I felt that nothing in this course was extremely rigorous, and it certainly did not require having any background in economics.",

                "The course has very little historical analysis. It is simply reading different economic papers and discussing the theoretical framework that they have applied to a historical situation. The papers are incredibly dull and specific, and often the assumptions they make in order to build a model are so ungrounded in reality that it leaves questions about the utility of their findings. \r\n\r\nThe course is rote memorization of the conclusions of a few authors. The economic analysis is often very narrow, and topics are chosen seemingly randomly. There is not really an overarching historical theme to the course. \r\n\r\nTruthfully, this course frustrated me to no end and bored me to death. I regret selecting it.",
                "Very very boring subject material.",
                "I think the class is far too focused on the historical part of it. The parts of class that cover the economic processes is interesting. The rest is dull. Very dull. This is just a history class for 95% of the class. Some people might like that, but I hated it. Hated it. The readings were ridiculously long. There was no need for that. No need. Some of them, like the Fogel piece on railroads were horribly uninteresting. They also weren't talked about enough in class. 80% of the grades ( midterm + final + critical essays) were about the readings alone but you wouldn't know if you went to class.",
                "I think the course is well-taught and does a really good job covering the limited methods we have to study economic history, and their benefits and drawbacks. I think I would have enjoyed a bit more of a zoomed out view of American Economic History as well, as often the course could get quite specific into papers that had interesting methods but didn't seem super consequential in the grand scheme of things. But, many of the papers covered were of great importance as well.",
                "About as good of a Writing credit as you can get, but the final was pretty boof.",
                "Strengths: I think it has interesting material; my TF (Taylor Rose) was really great and engaging in discussion section; it is very accessible for people who are not familiar with economics (although I think it does have intro micro as a prerequisite - it should not though, it really does not require it at all)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Your experience in this class is very much based on who your TF is (I happened to get lucky there); I think that lecture can be a bit dry at times (would certainly only recommend this course to someone who was already quite interested in the subject)",
                "Strengths: it covers a broad time period\r\nWeaknesses: incredibly boring, sections were a waste of time and differed tremendously between TFs, and I wondered a lot of the time why these historians were even doing their research because I don't know why they asked the questions they did.",
                "Essay prompts were somewhat difficult to fully write about and the number of readings caused my engagement to go down. Fewer papers would have made me more likely to do them.",
                "Although this is a survey course, It would be better if Professor Jones had attempted to distinguish the connections between papers we analyzed. Instead, it felt like most classes were disconnected.",

                "I liked the wide range of topics we studied. Sometimes the reading load was too much.",
                "The strengths were the sections, I think lectures could sometimes we poorly structured by theme, when we fell behind in the schedule",
                "This course had excellent TFs and an excellent lecture format. I did not find any weaknesses with this course, as it was my favorite this semester.",
                "Strengths were lectures and the slides, weaknesses were the usefulness of sections to p sets and exams.",
                "Strength: Not too much work needed.\r\nWeakness: Not a lot of interesting material learned.",
                "The course does not require you to keep up. You simply must memorize all the information right before the exams. Also, engagement is very very low",
                "Strengths\r\n-Discussion sections with Taylor Rose were very well structured. He gave us excellent feedback on our writing. \r\n-I appreciated how the course made sure to emphasise the economic history of all groups (especially indigenous people) instead of sticking only to white history. However, the racially exclusionary nature of the New Deal and 1950s suburbanisation/Highways could have been addressed more. \r\nWeaknesses\r\n-This wasn't really an \"Economic History\" course, but more of a \"Randomly Chosen Papers in Economic History Course\". Instead of actually teaching the big concepts, narratives, or debates in the field, we go into pointless detail about the approach, methodology, and finding individual paper. For example, instead of generally learning about how the 1918 influenza pandemic impacted the US Economy, delved into the minutiae of one particular paper that dealt with whether influenza exposure of babies in utero. Half of the lecture slides every week would just be screenshots of some paper's tabulated data that no one was going to read (or was even required to read). Every single bit of my studying for the midterm and final involved re-reading these papers, instead of actually reviewing any concepts. \r\nInstead of actually learning the broad ideas of Economic History, we became hyper-well-versed with a small number of specific questions from the papers. Going forward in the course, scrap the obsession with reading papers and deal more with theory.  \r\n-Very little actual discussion of economic or economic history theory. We would only deal with scattershot concepts if they came up in a paper (eg. I am weirdly familiar with the monocentric city model, just because one paper discussed it and we were therefore tested on it). But we didn't more generally discuss how urbanisation or highways changed the economy at all. \r\n-Lectures would randomly finish one topic halfway through, and then pick up the next topic. It was jarring not to just have one lecture on one topic. \r\n-Assignments were poorly designed and rarely relevant. The critical essays asked us to discuss how a particular paper . For subsequent assignments, offer students the chance to offer more original opinions instead of clinging to one paper. Or, at the very least, make sure that the topic prompt is actually related to what the paper discusses. \r\n\r\nSuggested improvements\r\n-Better, differently designed assignments\r\n-Less obsession with academic papers\r\n-Better, clearer structure to lectures and course progression\r\n-More stringent economics/econometrics prerequisites before taking the course, especially in macroeconomics. A lot of time was wasted touching on things like the AD-AS model. If students came in with this knowledge, macroeconomic parts of the course (particularly the new deal) could be treated better. If the course does insist upon reading academic papers so closely, students should be required to have the econometrics background to actually understand the methodologies (particularly regression and diff-in-diff). I happened to come in with this background, so I found the material completely unchallenging. \r\nThis should be a more specialised, less survey course with a completely different approach. As an economics and history double major, this should have been a course right up my alley, but turned out to be one of the weakest courses I've taken at Yale.",
                "There are a lot of readings sometimes not as helpful to learning the material. The density of the readings might discourage students from taking it even though it is an amazing class with so much interesting material to learn",
                "The requirements for the class are straightforward and the workload is pretty light. The readings and lectures are boring and the sections are not helpful.",
                "Well crafted curriculum",
                "The lectures were interesting, but the sections did not add anything to the course. It was more like reviewing what had been said in the lectures.",
                "Strengths: straightforwardness\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lack of insight, slow pace, emphasis on papers with un-interesting conclusions\r\n- I think the entire slavery discussion was not good. There was a weird focus on \"efficiency\" without putting into context what that actually was referring to, which was simply production efficiency -- i.e. would have production been more efficient under free market conditions. I don't think this is an interesting a discussion, and there was a lot of time spent on this. This discussion was justified under the context that this was critical in deciding the viability of slavery. I think this conclusion is wrong. The viability is more a measure of the wealth of the people controlling the system (non-slaves) and so greater production efficiency would not be relevant to the non-slaves if the benefit of greater efficiency went to slaves. \r\n\r\nThe professor was un-inspiring, and I question the to some extent her intelligence (relative to the bar I would expect for a Yale econ class)",
                "The course is a comprehensive survey of American history through the lens of economic development. It provides a great introduction to important papers and research in American economic history. It also challenges students to critically analyze economic literature to provide actionable improvements. The themes of race, infrastructure, and markets (among others) help to link all of the different topics of study.",

                "Yes, but only if they have a real interest in the American Economy, History and Social Science methods. The lecture was solid, the assignments not too difficult or long although numerous, and overall the material was interesting. If it's something you want to learn about it, go for it, but I think it would be boring otherwise.",
                "I would like to preface this whole review by saying that I am a history and economics dual major. I only start with that because, given the name of the course, it might seem obvious that this class would be right up my alley. However, as a history/econ major, I am not sure if I would recommend this course to another student in my position. The way I would best describe it is by saying that this course is light on history and light on economics, and I dont think it does a particularly good job at either. The history component of the course felt like a standard survey American history course taught anywhere, and Im not sure if I took away any novel information. On the other hand, the economics portion of the course certainly taught me more, but it was extremely light: no modeling, no math, etc. As a result, much of the course was spent reading economic history papers - but only ones that lacked any rigorous economics. Now, I would like to explain myself when I complain about lack of rigorous economics because that might sound annoying or petty - let me tell you, I love taking non-rigorous courses. But the problem that I found was that, in this course, by avoiding all discussion of more complicated topics in econ/history, I felt as though I did not gain a serious understanding of the inner workings of the techniques used by economic historians. On top of that, I think the material would not interest everyone, as everything we talked about was somewhat specific and niche within econ history. Its like, we spent so little time on each topic that I didnt feel satisfied: 1 paper on slavery, 1 paper on WW2, etc etc. So, to conclude this long review, I would say that only take this course if you are seriously interested in the material and know what you are getting into. Its not necessarily an easy class, so keep that in mind.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. It was mind numbingly boring, and most of the time, the things we studied were not interesting. I was extremely disappointed too, because I love history, and I love economics, but this course was just reading dense research papers.",
