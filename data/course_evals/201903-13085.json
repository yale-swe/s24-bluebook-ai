    "Great and thorough review of French grammar. New vocabulary and literature analysis.",
    "My French speaking and writing ability improved during the course of this class. I also learned an immense amount of new vocabulary.",
    "This course definitely helped me strengthen my sense of French grammar, specifically with regards to the smaller intricacies of the rules, and I feel I also added a nuanced collection of vocabulary to my repertoire. Furthermore, being able to discuss various texts and films in French was useful and invigorating.",
    "A better understanding of French grammar and reading abilities.",
    "After this course, I feel confident about my grammar. The entire course is a great L5 grammar overview, complimented by reading different works and learning about aspects of culture. Now I feel that I have a solid grammar foundation in order to proceed to more advanced classes to focus more on speaking and reading.",
    "I developed my listening, speaking, writing, and reading skills in French. I also read and watched a variety of French texts and films from throughout the centuries developing a better understanding of French culture and history.",
    "This class if you want an intensive run through of French grammar."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: how comprehensive the course is, and the variety of works we read\/watched\r\nWeaknesses: the shear amount of material was overwhelming. I'd think some of the more minor grammar components (concession, cause, etc) could be left out to allow students to really solidify their understanding of the main grammar points (tenses, pronouns, etc).",
    "This course gave plenty of opportunity for oral French practice owing to discussions on diverse topics in class time. I appreciated the emphasis on literary analysis, although I would've liked to have been able to study a more diverse selection of Francophone works (from across the Francophone world). I also think it would've been nice if the oral exams could have been presented in class (instead of solely for the professor), as I would have liked to have heard my classmates' opinions on the studied works.",
    "My biggest gripe would probably be having to use a 20 or so vocabulary words\/phrases during the in class essays. For me personally, I would just try to use sentences that would incorporate as many of this vocabulary terms as possible to get the most amount of points. Nevertheless, this course was very interesting and I enjoyed discussing the readings and books.",
    "Strengths: This course contained a strong balance of grammar\/vocab practice and engaging texts to which we could apply this practice.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: During some lessons, grammar became the sole focus and we were left with little time to discuss the text or film with which we were currently working.",
    "I think the course sometimes required a lot of individual work to understand the grammar, which was challenging. It is definitely a heavy workload, so students have to be engaged. It will definitely improve your french though!",
    "Strength: the breakdown of this course. Very well-designed homeworks that combined grammar and other assignments. I think that really helped my learning. Weakness: sometimes the assignments can be clustered, which could be overwhelming.",
    "One of the biggest strengths of this course were the small class sizes and the many opportunities for one on one interaction with the instructor."

    "I definetely would recommend if you would like to improve your French skills. I think it's a great foundation to go on to take more advanced classes, or to just review the grammar!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I feel like my French skills greatly improved and I learned a lot along the way in an equally challenging and supportive environment.",
    "Yes, if you want to get better at speaking and especially writing French and being grammatically correct."
