I feel that I have developed so much as a vocalist and performer and it is all thanks to Professor Lalli and Sara."

                "I love the performance aspect of the class. I had only previously taken versions of the course during pandemic lockdowns, so the ability to sing in real time and learn from each other made the class even more fulfilling.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lalli is amazing and just so knowledgeable and supportive. I wish more class time were devoted to singing instead of presentations.",
                "Strengths: one on one coaching with Prof Lalli and Sarah Kohane, frequent low-stakes performance opportunities. \r\nWeaknesses: unnecessary weekly assignments that don't actually count towards your grade.",
                "This class is so fun, engaging, and valuable. It is certainly one of my favorites I've ever taken and I would really change nothing. I love getting to hear everyone sing and I found the Drop the Pin quizzes to be helpful in expanding my knowledge of vocal repertoire."

                "Yes! This class has a great community aspect - you will make friends. Lalli and Sara Kohane are also world-class teachers, and the opportunity to work with them so closely, even as a non-music major, is remarkable.",
                "Professor Lalli is just the best. The improvement every student made over the course of the semester was completely evident in the final concert. He is always there for you to answer your questions, listen to you perform, and discuss music. He is truly one of the most supportive professors I have come across at Yale who cares about his students and their individual musical journey so profoundly. He navigates the tricky terrain of supporting students perform in front of their peers, helping them work through their issues, aiding them as they undertake challenging repertoire, and giving them appropriate feedback. This class is a yale institution in its own right.",
                "Definitely take this class! It doesn't matter if you're a beginner, intermediate, or advanced vocalist. If you take Professor Lalli's class you will grow so much as a singer, instrumentalist, and performer. Also pianists! Please take this course, it is a great way to strengthen your skills and also collaborate with other artists! The description may be a little scary, but I promise it is a really great space for musicians at any skill level.",
                "Yes yes yes I would take this class every semester if I could. Professor Lalli is a gem and I am so grateful to be able to interact with him so frequently. I loved the course so much I will take MUSI 325 with Lalli next semester."
