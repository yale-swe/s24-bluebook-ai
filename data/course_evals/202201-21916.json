                "I gained a deep appreciation of several seminal modernist novels of the 1920's. I learned what modernist novelists were responding to, how they were in conversation with each other, and what made their works so powerful.",
                "I learnt about the modernist movement, and about how it found expression in different novels and writers.",
                "I learned an incredible amount about how to thoughtfully analyse and parse through a novel in the context of a larger canon. Professor Cleary did an incredible job of always bringing us back to bigger ideas and themes of modernism, which meant that I always left class feeling like Id gained a greater perspective.",
                "I developed my ability to appreciate the structure of a novel as a reader and fellow creative beside the author. Many questions in the seminar pondered the choices of the author, such as a location change in a novel, or a formatting shift, which, whether intentional or not, contribute to the impression of a given book. These structures in such masterpieces as To the Lighthouse and Ulysses are crafted, though could easily be missed without the diversity of perspective and interpretation present in such an intellectually vivid classroom as Professor Cleary's. Difference of interpretation was crucial to the success of this class; this allowed for various readings of these great novels, not just structural (think psychological readings, the standard thematic readings, readings that detect the author's or a character's nostalgia)."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Cleary puts so much time and effort into the class. He asks fantastic questions, both for Canvas reading responses and in discussions. He absolutely knows what he's doing. And the books on the syllabus are incredible - who wouldn't want to read Hemingway, Joyce, Faulkner, and Fitzgerald? It's also a wonderful experience to simply listen to Professor Cleary read passages from the books (especially Ulysses). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The workload is high. There's usually 200-300 pages of reading for each class, and the reading is often dense modernism. To be clear, the workload is totally worth it! But you have to be able to read fast, and it definitely helps if you've read the books before.",
                "The class was exciting because it covered so many books. Sometimes, I feel like we could have gone at a slower pace, I wanted more time to linger on certain books. Perhaps having more meetings in the week might have made this possible, without sacrificing the breadth of content.",
                "Joe Cleary is really knowledgeable about modernist literature and asked probing, interesting questions during class. Hes probably the greatest strength of this class. The syllabus was also strong, although I might either change some of the first readings or change the due date of the prospectus to give students more novels to consider for their prospectus/final paper.",
                "Strengths: The breadth and depth of material was phenomenal; every seminar felt like just the minimum amount of time required to get into the depths of the novel for the week, with not a hair of extra time. Professor Cleary's discussion-mapping felt like enough guidance for such difficult books, but not so much as to lead the class to a definitive answer (a few times, one answer could subvert the standard interpretation of a novel in the Western canon!).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps the curriculum could be trimmed down for a more thorough exploration of such longer tomes as Ulysses or for lesser known stories like Passing or The Last September. Or maybe I just wanted more of the class...",
                "Prof. Cleary delivered the most detailed and helpful lectures--I was able to learn so much of the theoretical and historical background of the texts that I would not have otherwise known if I merely read the texts on my own. Prof. Cleary also encouraged us to connect different seemingly-unrelated texts and think across the entire course. I was able to get much more out of this course beyond the novels and class discussions. That being said, we covered 9 incredibly dense novels in 12 weeks (only 3 weeks on Ulysses and one on Faulkner). I understand that the course (or a Yale course like this, in general) does need to cover such a large amount of material in such a short span of time, but I certainly wish that I could've had more time to read, and the class could've dissected the novels a little more. In addition, (for whoever is taking this course in the future) do try to read some of these books before entering the class--it will help you plan out the 20+-page term paper in advance immensely. If you don't, you might have no choice but to write your paper on one of the books covered in the first few weeks."

                "I would absolutely, 100% recommend this course, especially if they are interested in any of the books on the syllabus. I am a senior English major, and this might've been my favorite class in all of my time at Yale. The books are incredible and Professor Cleary is amazing. It is high workload (lots of reading every week, plus 7 reading responses throughout the semester, plus 2 essays) but it is completely worth it. You learn so much about modernist novels, and for me it was so much fun to revisit the works I'd read in high school (like Gatsby) and see how much I was missing.",
                "Yes, the subject matter is very exciting. You should definitely take this class, even if you are not an English major, as long as you love reading and want to do it for a class.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, especially English majors and those who enjoy literature from this period.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Cleary was a wonderful teacher and the course materials were fantastic  they are books I will return to throughout my life, and our discussions brought clarity and vitality to every text.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wishes to challenge themselves and their ability to understand and become intimate with a novel. If you think yourself a deep reader already, take this class to prove yourself wrong, and to get better! The workload is hefty, but the more you put into the course, the more you get out. And, on a grander scale, you get Yale College credit for reading a book each week... that's a sweet deal...",
                "Yes! Definitely take this class. Professor Cleary is an excellent professor -  one of the best I've had. The books we read were all good and it was facinating to explore them in the context of the 1920s and modernism as a whole. Modernism is such an interesting, complex idea/time period and I definitely got a better grasp of it from this class."
