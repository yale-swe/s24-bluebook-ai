We read interesting journalistic pieces, practiced our writing, and discussed various aspects of journalism. People in class were very experienced in journalism (as for college students) as well. Brill can be intimidating at times, and the workload is on the heavier side, but the class is worth it. If you put in work, you will get a lot from it.",

I really enjoyed being able to go really in-depth on a topic of my choosing and work with an article over the course of multiple months, plus the classmate profile is such an interesting (and sort of odd but totally worthwhile) assignment."
