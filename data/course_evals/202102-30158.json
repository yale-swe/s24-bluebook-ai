Learned about multiple different styles and forms of playwriting and how those trends are connected to each other as well.",

                "This course offered a wonderful breadth of skills and knowledge when it comes to reading and analyzing plays, especially through the lens of close reading. Professor Robinson shone a new light on each of the texts we read, often contrasting two texts together in a very insightful way to reveal new readings for plays that have been over-performed.",

                "Most of all, I enjoyed developing an understanding of how differentiate between interpreting literature broadly and interpreting theatre, and how to manage the complexity of the many variables in a play when trying to understand one."

                "There were no weaknesses which I found in this course. The informal blog posts were a fantastic way to see how other students interpreted the texts and the class discussions were lively and engaging. The fact that the two papers which were due had no specific topic and the freedom of choice which we had in itself reflects on how this course encourages perception",
                "This is more a symptom of the brevity of the course, but as someone who was doing full-time work on top of the copious amounts of material being covered in class, I found myself struggling to keep up with assignments in a timely manner. Yet, the material offered an expansive view of playwriting that I previously hadn't been exposed to.",
                "Strengths- Overall course structure. For as much time as I put into this course, I never really felt overwhelmed or frustrated. This was also the first course Ive taken where I felt like the discussions on Canvas were used extremely well. By using our discussion posts to facilitate the live discussion section, Robinson really tailored the course to our classs interests while still covering the material he wanted to in the recorded lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Sheer quantity of material. The class isnt over-the-top difficult, but if youre working or doing research full time, it can often be difficult to finish all the readings. Its not really something that can be changed but especially when a particular day has very long plays assigned its just something you have to plan for. I also wish there was an easier way to access some of the texts, as some are on the Canvas site, but others have to be purchased and some were straight-up unavailable on e-readers, so I was unable to get them in time to actively engage with the discussion in class. I worked full-time while taking this course and the nearest bookstore or library is quite far from where I live so I didnt have time to go hunting for the texts if they werent available somewhere online.",
                "This course is really great!",
                "The syllabus was very well balanced! Was very much expecting to come into this course having to read a bunch of work by dead straight white men, and was pleasantly surprised by how often we were reading from playwrights that broke that mold, even in the earlier part of the class. Discussion posts and section were always fun and riveting.",
                "I just wished we had more time! But that's less a weakness of the course and more just a consequence of doing this over summer.\r\nProf. Robinson is absolutely a strength - engaging lecturer and discussion leader.",
                "Strengths: cool course!\r\nWeaknesses: conversation was a bit meandering in class, and the content of the prerecorded lectures felt as though it was meant to be read and not listened to (not meant to be read aloud, if that makes sense, and so the density impacted my understanding of things).",
                "I loved how passionate everyone in this class was about the material!",
                "video lectures are way too long",
                "I think most students enjoyed the lectures, readings, and discussions, but the lack of instruction and feedback on written assignments - the primary source of the grade - communicated that students were expected to already be very proficient in those areas. The experience of the course itself was good but I don't think it was a friendly course for students outside of the humanities/english/theater majors because the essays account for most of the grade and there is no instruction/little feedback on them. The essays seemed so disjoint from the rest of the course that it didn't make sense to me for them to account for the majority of the grade and the lack of instruction/feedback made them more stressful for those not already extensively experienced with essay composition and theater analysis.",
                "I truly do not see many weaknesses to the courseit moved fast, but at a good pace. The work was reasonable, and the reading was engaging, if sometimes a bit heavy on days when three plays were to be read (but understandable for a summer course). The course's main strength resided in Professor Robinson's wonderful facilitation of nuanced and engaging discussions.",
                "I really enjoyed the reading and the discussion elements, as well as the pre-recorded lectures which helped to guide our discussions. Though I felt that sometimes our discussion sections could be more varied, perhaps with the occasional viewing of supplementary materials or use of \"break-out rooms\", but that's only a minor note.",
                "Great selection of plays, with several unique, relatively unpopular choices reflecting the professor's deep knowledge of modern American playwrights who have valuable and powerful things to add to the canon of works you might expect to study."

                "Yes, Professor Robinson was very receptive to student engagement and facilitated a great learning environment.",
                "Totally! Its the kind of class that you get out what you put in, so if you do the readings, actually think about the plays, and participate, youll have a really great and intellectually stimulating experience. This is not a high school English course where youre expected to memorize every excruciating detail of the play and regurgitate it back. If youre interested in reading some modern classics of American drama, as well as a few hidden gems, its a solid humanities credit and a great way to fulfill the dramatic literature requirement for the TAPS major.",
                "Yes, Professor Robinson is wonderful!",
                "Yes! Would highly recommend to anyone who maybe didn't have a strong theater educational background up until now and is looking for a way to shore up their knowledge of playwrights that constantly seem come up in discussions about American theater and its history. Between the plays themselves and Marc's lectures, it's a wonderful learning experience!",

                "no, this course is interest-based",
                "Yes, if you're an english/humanities/theater major. You should already be extremely comfortable with no prompt/little feedback/heavily weighted essay writing. If so, it should be a low stress, engaging class with a kind professor, but again, don't take it if you're not extremely confident in your writing ability.",
                "I think if you want to read some interesting plays, then this class will do what you want. It's not the most engaging, and you can get by without reading everything. I think you should only take it if you're already interested in some of the plays on the syllabus.",
                "A good survey of American theatre: you read great plays and look at how theatrical concerns and sensibilities changed over time and between artists. Take it if the subject interests you!",
                "If you're interested in and have some preliminary knowledge, yes. If it is completely new to you, probably not."
