                "A much more in-depth understanding of the atrocities faced by North Koreans. More importantly, a better understanding of religion: ultimate transformation or reorientation.",
                "I learned how to think deeply and reflect on the readings, many of which were quite emotionally difficult to read due to the intensity of the content and the terrible experiences that the authors, who were North Korean defectors, went through in order to escape the country. I also developed skills important for being part of honest, open conversations with my peers during classtime!",
                "This course taught me a ton about how to think about the lives and experiences of people who live in a world that feels so different from my own. And more specifically, it should me how to identify with people I initially thought I couldn't relate to. This course was also extremely powerful because of the wide variety and complexity offered by the many memoirs we read and discussed. Our professor also brought in amazing guest speakers who provided wonderful insight. Highly recommend this course to anyone and everyone!",
                "This class was truly a gem. We met once a week and discussed a different book in each class. I learned so much about North Korean defection, Juche Ideology, the current state of political affairs, and so much more.",
                "The course gave me a great opportunity to rethink about the true meaning of religion. I learned to bring religion to my life, and also learned a lot about North Korean culture and religion in North Korea.",
                "I learned a lot! I previously didn't have much knowledge of North Korea, so all of the stories I read were new to me. We learned about the history and current state of North Korea through many defector stories, books, and films. We also learned from a few very interesting guest speakers.",
                "Learned about ordinary people's daily lives in North Korea by reading defectors' memoirs and novels. Developed a new conception of religion.",
                "This class deeply taught us to look into and think about the reality of North Korean life outside of what is simply told in media. By reading memoirs from people who had been in, and ultimately left the country, we were able to gather information on an otherwise largely blind topic from the best sources possible.",
                "I read a lot of memoirs from North Korean defectors.",
                "Thinking critically about Western assumptions and biases!",
                "I learned the importance of evaluating histories from country outside of a Western-perspective, and just how connected all people are through the way Professor Kim aligned his class.",
                "I learned a lot of information about North Korea and their version of religion, Juche. This class is incredible because you get a lot of insight into a region of the world that is rarely talked about in media, let alone deep-dived into.",
                "The history of North Korea, the religious ideology, meditations on the meaning and purpose of religion, facets of north korean culture",
                "North Korean refugees, the complexity surrounding the North Korean situation, a lot about human suffering and human nature in general.",
                "Coming into the course, I had very little knowledge of North Korea and what I was getting myself into. This course made me reflect a lot about my life, as we read memoirs of crazy escapees experiences.",
                "Understand religion in a new perspective. And you can really understand where North Koreans' mindsets come from.",
                "I learned to view North Korea in a different perspective.",
                "This class introduced me to a new way of looking at religion.",
                "I learned much about North Korea's society and culture. In addition, Professor Kim went beyond simply talking about North Korea and strove to make the class an experience from which we could draw life lessons and look at our own lives. He strove to make us think more about the influences on our life and what things hold meaning for us.",
                "I was able to learn a lot about the psyches of the people living in and entangled with North Korea. I got to critically analyze knowledge production surrounding a place like NK, and consider how what we know and dont know influences our narratives surrounding places like NK",
                "I learned so much more about life in North Korea and what it's like to live as a North Korean defector. I became so much more knowledgeable about the situation. I also began to think about religion (and life, in some ways) in a different light! This was an amazing course.",
                "Learned SO much about North Korea, its politics, culture, history, regime, etc from the memoirs we read.",
                "I gained a rich, multidisciplinary view of North Korean life and culture, packed with fascinating historical details\/stories, as well as overarching political forces, themes, and ongoing issues in North Korea. The course touches on, but is much less concerned with historical red tape and realpolitik than it is with humanizing North Korean life, culture, and suffering, which is often sensationalized in Western media. It helped me understand how the North Korean dictatorship is a global issue created and perpetuated by countries around the world, and can teach us lots about problems of contemporary activism, scholarship, and politics in the US. It is also a deeply spiritual and philosophical course that emphasizes individual experience and invites students to reorient the ideas of religion and ideology to reimagine their own lives."

            "comments": [
                "The 50-person seminar-style worked surprisingly well. When Professor Kim did lecture, it was captivating. It be the first and only time that I wished the professor would lecture more!",
                "Strengths: ample opportunity for student participation, safe environment to talk about sensitive topics\r\nWeaknesses: the readings were mostly about North Korean defectors, which is indeed important to learn about, but I would have liked to have more readings focusing on other aspects of North Korean life!",
                "The strengths of this course are both the professor and the course content. Our professor did a wonderful job of setting up engaging conversations that pushed us to think more deeply about experiences and interactions we may take for granted. He also put together a strong course selection that offered wonderful and nuanced ideas and perspectives.",
                "The student presentations were really great and the structure of the course was good too. Every class flew by and the guest speakers were also amazing. One improvement could be technology, though it is not relevant to course content itself. We had a large class of about 60 students so we needed microphones, and sometimes they didn't work and the audio on the big screen often didn't work too, but we always found a way and it was okay!",
                "Professor Kim is an amazing instructor. He provides a lot of great resources, including readings, presentations, movies, videos, and guest lectures. The discussion sessions are engaging and everyone gets to voice their opinions through Canvas and in class.",
                "Strengths: Hwansoo Kim is amazing, and I really enjoyed listening to all the guest speakers. Weaknesses: The large class size made it difficult to have a meaningful discussion every time, but I also wouldn't have been able to take the class otherwise.",
                "The books chosen are great. The assignments are flexible and tailored to each student's interest. Writing discussion posts helped me reflect on my readings.",
                "The class is run incredibly well. Being a fairly large class for the type of course it is, it was sometimes a class where it was what people made of it. That being said however, both Professor Hwansoo Kim and other students did try to get the entire class involved!",
                "I love this class. It really facilitated learning and thinking.",
                "overall the class was very excellent and professor Kim is a kind and generous professor. He encouraged engagement, however, as a seminar there were 50 people in the class so it made it hard to speak up sometimes. I think it would have been great if we did more breakout sessions in class or moved around to speak with more students rather than who we sat next to everyday. Other than that I really, really enjoyed the course.",
                "This class presented interesting perspectives through the reading of memoirs. The class was a bit too large to facilitate inclusive discussion, though",
                "Strength of this course was definitely Professor Kim, who is amazing and so invested in student learning\/experience. He single-handedly made this course well worth taking. \r\n\r\nPotential weakness could be some of the student discussion leading-- most were great, but discussions could sometimes get lukewarm because of the variable quality in questions.",
                "Professor Kim is amazing, and this could have been one of the best classes at Yale. However, the class was just too big, and it felt watered down at times... because of how big the seminar was. It became this way because professor Kim is a very very nice person who doesn't want to cut down students.",
                "Professor Kim is definitely one of the best parts of this course; he is empathetic, engaged, and clearly passionate about this topic.",
                "The class was well organized and professor Kim was super passionate about his teaching.",
                "The course was very good: the professor was engaging and the content interesting. The professor worked hard to bring in some really fascinating guest speakers who had unique experiences that they shared with us and for just that the class was worth taking. I wish the class was structured more as a lecture rather than a seminar, as I very much enjoyed the too-few lectures by the professor more than the student discussions.",
                "Strengths: all of the books and movies showed a very wide range of lives and experiences, which gave us a very rich understanding of life in North Korea.",
                "There were always very lively discussions facilitated by Professor Kim, and it was very insightful to hear what others had to say about the readings each week. It was a very reading and discussion based class, so the pro was that there wasnt really much work to do every week, however the readings were quite long sometimes and hard to get through everything (a full book most weeks).",
                "All strengths: professor was amazing, material was great, learned so much, and the guest speakers were absolutely amazing.",
                "The course's focus on defector memoirs made it a really manageable and approachable course for students of all backgrounds. Prof. Kim's deep insight, the class discussions, and the order we read the memoirs were all paced\/formatted really well. The course was expanded from a smaller seminar to meet student demand, so at times, the discussion aspect of the class felt a bit diluted and hesitant. The student presentations often didn't have time to hear from all the comments from the class. However, the discussions as a whole were great and worked well with the longer class meeting time. We also enjoyed some truly incredible speakers from North Korea, which was a genuine highlight of my Yale career."

                "Yes. Any class with Professor Kim is worth taking. Even if you are not interested in North Korea or religion, Professor Kim's insights on life are more than enough reasons to take the course.",
                "Yes! This course is very eye-opening and encourages you to challenge your perception of religion, North Korea, and more.",
                "Yes, I think everyone should take it! The memoirs we read were absolutely amazing and the perspectives they offered on North Korea were priceless.",
                "Yes! This class is incredibly interesting and Professor Kim is amazing at facilitating great discussions and thought provoking ideas. The content is all incredibly interesting and has the power to radically change your perspective on the human experience in our world.",

                "Hwansoo Kim is an amazing professor and everyone should take a class with him -- I learned so much every time he spoke in class. This course is not just about North Korea but about broader perceptions of religion and spirituality, and I came away from the course with a broader vision of how people define meaning in their lives. This was definitely my favorite course this semester and one of my favorites at Yale. The guest speakers, including Joseph Kim and Monique Macias, were also super interesting.",
                "Yes. It is important to learn about North Korea beyond nuclear politics.",

                "Yes, this class was one of the most fulfilling experiences I have had during my time at Yale. Professor Kim is an extremely engaging speaker, and his short lectures during class often were informative beyond the scope of the class. Without exaggeration, this class was genuinely a life-changing experience.",
                "Please take this course if you are even mildly related by the topic! Its a memoir a week, but they are so enriching to the human mind and I often got through whole books in a couple of hours. There are a lot of traumatic stories but the class also forces you to think about your positionality in the world.",
                "Yes! It is so interesting and Professor Kim is so kind and contemplative",
                "Yes. I believe every student should take this course as it is relevant to the world and recent world events. It also gives a greater insight into human suffering and human nature, which I believe everyone should think about.",
                "Yes! But make sure the class isn't too big this time.",
                "Yes! Great class",
                "Yes, very much so. You will gain so much insight into North Korea from doing the readings.",
                "Would absolutely recommend! Prof. Kim is wonderful and really cares about his students and what he teaches. He makes sure each of us are prepared for the final project and it really helps engagement with the material.",
                "Absolutely! Its a one-of-a-kind course that will expand your thinking of the world but also of how you perceive your own life in your own nation.",
                "Without a doubt! This is one of the most interesting classes I've taken at Yale. If you have any interest in North Korea or religion, you will love this course.",
                "Yes! Professor Kim is very nice and tries to accommodate for everyone in the class. The discussion and readings are also very interesting, and students get to learn a lot more about the details of North Korean society and the presence of religion there beyond the surface level as it is portrayed in most western media. If youre interested in east asian studies or Korean history in general, I would highly recommend this class.",
                "This class is amazing. If you don't take it you should drop out of yale.",
                "Yes, but be warned that the material could be VERY, VERY difficult to read\/watch.",
                "I would because we read a lot of books that had perspectives on life in North Korea that completely shifted the notion that I had in my head before the class.",
