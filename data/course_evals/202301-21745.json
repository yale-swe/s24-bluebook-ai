                "In-depth analysis of American musics, from ragtime and jazz to go-go, reggaeton, tejano, and K-diasporic music.",
                "Music appreciation, knowledge, and history of different genres of music and how communities form surrounding music.",
                "Learned a lot about the historical, social, cultural, economic, and political implications behind different genres of 'American' music. I also learned how to be a more active listener of music.",
                "I learned how to critically think about the intersection of history, culture, and sound from music all around the world. This course allowed me to explore genre and music from regions around the world I would have never listened to. Professor Baa was an incredible lecturer and taught us about the importance of the history behind the creation and migration of the music and how it rose to fame. Overall, I became skilled in not only the historical side of music, but also learned how to distinguish various sounds and musical elements that were representative of the various genres we learned about.",
                "I learned so, so much about all of the genres that we studied in this course. I had never even heard of many of the genres that we studied and now feel proficient in all of them. From the social context and political consequences to the technicalities and instrumentation, I learned soooo much.",
                "Learned about American music genres that are often overlooked in academia - go-go, reggaeton, music of the K diaspora, and tejano.",
                "we learned about the development of four main genres (tejano, reggaeton, go-go, and music from the Korean Diaspora). we also learned about Tin Pan Alley, Sousa marches, jazz, blues, and the social \/ economic \/ political contexts of each of these genres.\r\n\r\nessentially, we learned what it means to be American through the lens of music",
                "I learned about music around the country, but the class is really about place. We learned about music I had never heard of, and Professor Baca made connections to music that we had all heard of. I have not taken a class at Yale where I have learned more. The material is so applicable to the real world, the environment is welcoming, and the readings--though relatively uncommon--are excellent.",
                "I learned about a variety of music genres in America, including blues, Jazz, reggaeton, Go-Go, tejano, and korean-diasporic music. I also learned about the process of cultural transmission across decades and cultures. Along the way, Trevor also taught us some music theory based on the class' background.",
                "This course was primarily focused on exploring 4 genres of music: gogo, Tejano (Texas-Mexican), K-diaspora, and Reggaeton. For each unit, we learned about the cultural background of this musical genre, important\/notable figures, along with unique\/distinctive musical features.",
                "The biggest takeaway for me was that I should strive to be more open minded and explorative about discovering new music because there really is so much gold out there. I also learned about how genres form and shift... there's really nothing random about why a group of artists or listeners start gravitating towards a particular kind of beat, instrument, structure, melody, or lyric...",
                "I learned how an overview of American musics which gave me skills to do my own investigations on where music forms come from. This class taught me how to truly listen to music and hear all the specific parts that make it; most importantly I learned to understand the ways social implication can be heard in the music.",
                "Analytical listening skills with respect to a variety of styles of music, writing, insights into the history associated with many different areas in which the music we studied originated, interconnectedness of many forms of modern popular music",
                "Learned a ton about the histories of Ragtime, Blues, Jazz, Reggae, Dancehall, Reggaeton, Dembow, and Go-go. The class also focused on more than just the genres but the social, political, and cultural contexts that each of the genres developed in.",
                "I learned how to listen to music better to understand how it fits into geography and history.",
                "This has been my favorite class at Yale thus far. I had never taken a music class before but Trevor's class made engaging with the content very accessible. I enjoyed coming to class every single day and learned a lot about the different genres that the class dives into.",
                "So much - this class is amazing and Trevor is the best.",
                "I learned about various regional musics and how the migration of instruments and people played a role in the formation of the music. I learned how to listen more closely and identify components characteristic of various music genres."

                "This class is one of the best classes I've ever taken. It treats each of the genres with care and respect, which is important considering that they were made by and for people of color. The lectures are interesting, the music is incredible, and the readings\/assignments are fun and worthwhile.",
                "This course is one of the greatest I've taken at Yale -- you gain true knowledge that's applicable to all forms of music and entertainment with minimal stress over grades. I cannot recommend it enough and see no flaws to it.",
                "Format of the course with reading responses and listening quizzes alternating every other week is conducive to learning! Having a clear breakdown of classes and their corresponding topic was great as well! Professor Trevor is most definitely the biggest strength of the course. He is so well-informed on this topic and very apparently has a passion for teaching this subject and teaching in general.",
                "Honestly, this course was one of the few course at Yale I can truthfully say was geared towards learning and exploration, rather than just learning material for examinations. This course was designed to make its students want to come to class and the lectures were just as informative as they were enjoyable. Each topic we covered in the class was supplemented with sufficient information, graphics, sounds, and cultural background that made us immerse into the music we were learning. One of the best classes at Yale!!",
                "There are no weaknesses. This is my favorite class I've taken at Yale. Professor Baca created the most wonderful, pleasant, and engaging classroom environment. He is the best professor you will find at Yale who truly cares about the material and wants us to care about it just as much.",
                "Strengths - everything! It's truly a perfect course that any music lover would enjoy :)",
                "strengths - Professor Baca!!!! he is such a role model human. kind, understanding, compassionate, and a phenomenal story teller. he creates an unforgettable classroom environment and meets each student where they are. the flow of the course went really smoothly too. and the listening quizzes helped me keep up with the music while not being too stressful. we had short summary papers and a final paper. very manageable. I also loved the readings.\r\nno weaknesses that I can think of. this is one of the best courses yale has to offer",
                "Strengths-A wonderful classroom environment, engaging material, passionate professor. It felt the most like the type of class I thought I would get to take at Yale. Professor Baca is great.",
                "Strengths: SUCH an interesting, engaging class, Prof. Baca is a treasure, you learn to appreciate the intricacies in modern pop (and how the songs playing at Toad's relate to, say, Jamaican pop)\r\nWeaknesses: a few more songs of the K-diaspora unit would have been nice",
                "Strength: Trevor is one of the best people you could possibly ever have as an instructor. Not only is he extremely passionate about the material he teaches, but he is extremely nice and understanding to all his students. He's an expert on the course material not only from an academic\/research standpoint, but he's traveled basically everywhere around the world, so he's really experienced these musics first hand, and it's awesome - it really shows that he loves these musics rather than just knows a lot about these musics. He's always up for a conversation whether it's about American Neighborhood Musics or about life as a college student, aspiring musician, whatever, and he really cares about how you're doing! I'll always be grateful for this course and how much I learned from it.",
                "I really loved the listening components of this class and the low stakes focus on learning about these different music types. I especially appreciated when there were video components because I found it a bit difficult to fully engage without any visual component. I struggle with auditory processing so I would have found it immensely helpful to have some sort of visual learning component as an aid throughout our class lectures.",
                "The strengths are that the content is so interesting and fun! Professor Baca is also a very engaging lecturer. One weakness is that Professor Baca doesn't typically use an visual aids which I think would be very useful for some students.",
                "Very good class size and classroom community, Prof. Baca is incredible, very engaging material and music",
                "Prof. Baca is a great lecturer and the class overall is amazing. The music is great and I found myself listening to so much new music from this class even after it finished. The music genres we studied were also incredibly interesting. The only thing I could say to improve the course is add some more time for class discussions. All in all a must-take class!",
                "This course was great overall and I learned so much about each genre we dove into. My only suggestion would be to listen to a few more songs during some of the lectures to have a reference point for what is being discussed.",
                "Only strengths! Listening to Trevor talk is the most entertaining activity - no matter what he is talking about, the whole class is always locked in.",
                "Everything - this class is amazing.",
                "This is the best course I've taken at Yale! The teaching style is really engaging and I wanted to show up for class every day because it felt like more of a discussion rather than a boring lecture. It does a really good job of teaching something completely new in a fun and educational way."

                "Absolutely take this course. Dr. Baa is a wonderful instructor and cares for all of his students. His goal is just for you to enjoy the music and learn -- very few professors at this university capture a balance between desire for student learning and recognition of the fact that we are all just people at the end of the day, not robotic students.",
                "Oh absolutely! Professor Trevor alone makes this course worth taking!",
                "100%. It is difficult to find classes at Yale where you can sit down eager to learn and not have to worry about being pressured to compete against your fellow classmates for grading purposes. MUSI 378 was a space where students can forget about the stress of daily life and walk in for an hour and fifteen minutes knowing that during this time you will learn so much and listen to great sounds from all over the world. This being said, in no way was this class a walk in the park. The information and music we had to learn was difficult to comprehend at times and doing so required hours of studying. However, the class and material was super enjoyable and Professor Baa made the difficult material very enjoyable to learn.",
                "YES! 1,000 times yes. I have already told everyone I know to take it. Best decision I have ever made is taking this course.",
                "Trevor Baca is as talented as they come. He is one of the great professors on campus that combines his passion for the subject with knowledgeable instruction of the material.",
                "Yes! 100%! Professor Baca is the kindest Yale professor I have ever had. The content is neatly organized and digestible.",
                "YES!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've talked about this course to everyone in my life. It literally taught me how to listen. I have such a newfound appreciation for music in general. I am forever grateful.",
                "100%. This class accomplishes everything a class should. I learned a lot, my strengths were celebrated, and I listened to some great music. It made me think about music as a cultural output differently. I have already recommended this class to many of my friends, and will continue to throughout the year.",
                "This class is a must-take at Yale. The material is so fascinating that you'll be showing your friends the playlists and connections your learn in class. The class also draws people from a variety of music and non-music backgrounds--you'll learn as much from your classmates at the end of the semester. Trevor is one of the best professors I've had at Yale. He's incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about a wide variety of topics, connecting elements in a fascinating way during lecture. He clearly cares about his students and treats them as adults; I've never taken a class with a better learning environment!",
                "YES!!! In my time at Yale, I have taken many courses where I have dreaded attending the class itself. And if I was in class, I would very rarely be engaged enough to even remember what was on the slides. With this class, however, I would almost always show up 5 minutes early, plant myself in the front, and be eager as a beaver to listen to Prof. Baca speak. His passion for music, especially the musics in this class, is palpablenot to mention, infectious. And he masterfully weaves together a history course, a music course, and an ERM course, facilitating learning and still managing to cultivate a kind, inclusive environment. If you listen to music, and you like feeling happy (so everybody, hopefully), you should take this class.",
                "Yes a million times. Take it especially if you are addicted to music and want to do something creative and non-traditional for your final project!",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student as Trevor really cares about student learning in a low stakes environment, which is really refreshing at Yale. The course content is incredible and Trevor is always willing to continue discussing anything students are passionate about.",
                "100%, this class was fun and engaging. I learned so much!",
                "I wholeheartedly recommend this class -- it is truly the best class I have taken at Yale. Professor Baca is incredibly passionate, intelligent, kind, and fosters a really uplifting community within the classroom. The music that we studied and the associated histories were all super interesting and the songs were great! But most of all, Prof. Baca is an absolute gem; his style of teaching and the environment he creates in the classroom is what really makes this class so special and unique, and my experience in American Neighborhood Musics really inspired me (especially as a graduating senior). Definitely take this class if you have the opportunity!",
                "Absolutely! Prof. Baca is a great professor and he treats students like people, which I feel is actually rare for professors. Also, the music selection was great and there were so many trends and motifs from early music from the course that showed up in more modern music, which was cool. The class also had such a friendly atmosphere and relaxed vibe that made it a class I would not skip even though attendance was not taken. It was a great class and is a must-take!",
                "Yes, you should definitely take this course because you learn about a critical part of our world and world cultures  music. Additionally, you not only learn about the specific genres, but how to approach studying and understanding a new genre.",
                "Yes! Please take this class before you graduate - it will change your life especially if you have not yet taken a music class at Yale.",
                "Yes, it is incredible. TAKE IT.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course and I have been recommending it to everyone I know. It is so fun to show up to class knowing that you are learning a lot but also are respected by the professor and the other students it was a very safe and awesome environment."
