                "The course was fun and engaging. The professor was also very kind. No immediate weaknesses come to mind.",
                "The class activities are great because of the ability to connect with classmates and learn more about Italy while practicing the language. I think that the asynchronous activities could be more engaging, perhaps with more explorations of Italian culture like history and music.",
                "strengths: small class size and engaging prof. practiced a lot of conversations which helped immensely with conversational fluency\r\nweaknesses: course overall seemed too by the book and a race to finish the textbook as opposed to giving space and time to internalize the material. could have benefitted from more creative projects",

I definitely feel more confident about my Italian skills coming out of L4, and the class was so much more relaxed and fun than the lower levels. It's also really nice being in a class where everyone is choosing to take it, rather than taking it because they have to  great energy every day.",
                "I would, I enjoyed the class a lot and felt like I picked up the Italian language quickly.",

This class is similar to L3 and is mainly review of topics already learned in L2 with more in-depth study. You will also get to learn about Italian culture through music, poetry, and movies.",
