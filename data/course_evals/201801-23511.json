   "comments": [
    "Really awesome insights into how China governs itself, and it peels back the mask of domestic operations in a very sharp way. I would absolutely never have encountered any of this outside the class. Prof. Mattingly is also very talented at dissecting complicated research.",
    "The course provides a very interesting look at how the Communist Party has been so successful in China. It covers everything from the country's economic growth to what challenges the government will face in the future.",
    "I learned about the current climate of Chinese government and also how to think critically about this kind of scholarship.",
    "It's a class about the internal politics of China!",
    "Developed an interesting, nuanced, much fuller picture of domestic politics and governance in China.",
    "I learned so much more about Chinese government and politics, but also about the specific methods the CCP uses to repress its citizens. I also learned that experience does not equal teaching prowess. That is to say that Professor Mattingly is an amazing professor despite this being his first year teaching.",
    "This course blended current events with political history in a really engaging way and I learned how to look at the political system of another country analytically."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There should have been more time spent into getting some of the basics of China, such as the relationship between the CCP and government, and the general history of the country.",
    "I think it would benefit from a short midterm case study-like paper, and a slightly shorter final paper. It was hard to keep engaged mid-course.",
    "The strength of this course would be the selection of reading material and style of class. Each week involved a reading response, and Professor Mattingly made it a point to weave in people's reading responses so the discussion was relevant to the questions we had and what aspects we wanted to discuss. The weakness of the course is that it is focused on domestic politics. I think it would be helpful to have a weak or two focusing on China on the international stage.",
    "This is a great course. The readings are super interesting and Mattingly runs a really well organized and engaged classroom. The workload isn't too tough. Write the paper early and Mattingly will give you great feedback. Some of the books were a little dense but c'est la vie in political science and Mattingly is aware of that. Big negative is that not everyone is super engaged but that's the territory with seminars. The reading responses mean more people that usual do the reading which is nice.",
    "Strengths - Prof. Mattingly was always organized and it was clear he was passionate about the subject. The class structure was done really well, and the readings were all in conversation with each other.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Discussion was sometimes difficult with so many people in the class. Reading responses were good, but sometimes discussion in class seemed too broad\/general, instead of focusing on the argument of the paper per say.\r\nI think the final paper was probably weighted too much, and I would've appreciated another intermediate assignment, because otherwise there were only reading responses.",
    "Strengths - professor is clear, leads fantastic, compelling discussions, is not rigid, can change his mind, includes everyone, is knowledgeable, thoughtful, available. Topics are relevant and interesting. We made ample time to discuss current events, which was awesome given everything that happened in China this semester. The seminar was very interactive as well, it wasn't solely focused on the readings. The people in the seminar were amazing and I felt they really contributed to making it a great class. The reading responses were really helpful exercises, I think they helped me become a better critical thinker. I think giving more 2's than 3's was good. At first many students were worried about the impact this would have on the final grade, but then receiving a 3 is so much more meaningful, and I became much more motivated to write and read better to attain that.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - some of the topics felt somewhat repetitive, although this could also be a strength because repeated exposure reinforced learning. The only thing I truly didn't like about the organization of the course was that we wrote on pieces of white paper somewhat sporadically and then had to keep them. I think it would have been better to ask students to purchase a notebook, rather than writing on printer paper, and then regularly have some time for written reflection in these notebooks at the beginning of the seminar, so we can then reference them later if we so choose. I also think that the in-class readings didn't needed to be printed out but rather posted on Canvas for access later and also to save paper, but this is nit-picky.",
    "Very thoughtful discussions, reasonable attendance policy, and an amazing professor. Too many good things to say honestly.",
    "I appreciated how the discussion-focused classes allowed student perspectives to be the priority."

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommended. Prof. Mattingly is a phenomenal professor doing absolutely fascinating research on China. He is well-connected and brings in high-quality materials. I thoroughly enjoyed the discussions, which were very insightful. As a senior,  it was cool to be in a class that totally intellectually humbled me again. People who fail to read the material-beware.",
    "Yes, if you have an interest in Chinese politics, Communism, or just China in general. China continues to grow in importance internationally, yet the news that Americans receive is very filtered leading to biased and misinformed ideas. This class explains the mechanisms of how China maintains stability, grows its economy, etc.",
    "Yes, 100% whether you have experience with China or not. I didn't and really enjoyed the course.",
    "If you are interested in Chinese domestic politics, yes. If you don't have any prior experience\/knowledge about contemporary China, than you might consider a more general survey course.",
    "If you're at all interested in China, take this course, if anything just to have a class with Professor Mattingly, who is a wonderful teacher. I've taken two classes with him now and have gained and learned so much from both of them. For someone who is so young, Professor Mattingly knows a great deal about China and teaches with experience beyond his years. He really prioritizes his teaching and his students and you can absolutely feel this as a student in his seminar. He also creates a comfortable environment for everyone to contribute, even if you're normally shy, like I am. In seminars, I often feel intimidated when expressing my opinions, but I feel like I literally became the section asshole in this class, that's how comfortable I felt! This semester was the first time this seminar was taught, but we had a really diverse and interesting mix of people from whom I learned a great deal. I just loved this course.",
    "Yes, Professor Mattingly is going to be a star. Get in early.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in China who has some prior experience studying the country."
