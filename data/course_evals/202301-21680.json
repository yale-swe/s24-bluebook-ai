                "From L2, I was able to learn comprehensive basic Kiswahili grammar, including noun classes, locatives, and relative markers. Practice in the class almost every day in a low-stress environment contributed to me being more comfortable with speaking the language. Readings as well as essays have also helped me gain an elementary literacy in the language. Most importantly for me personally, learning from this class helped me converse with my dad more in Kiswahili, which also helped me learn the language better. I also recognize from this class onward that I want to take Kiswahili classes for the rest of my time here at Yale."

                "The course is very engaging and requires a lot of participation but was very fun overall. It could have been interesting if we watched more videos of Kiswahili speaking.",
                "The strengths of this class are many. The way the class is structured which focuses on learning the grammar rules of the language and practicing those roles subsequently helps one gain an understanding quickly. Learning grammar rules also becomes an effective means to learn vocabulary as well as other semantic nuances and features of Kiswahili (e.g., proverbs, spoken vs. written). Another strength is in the readings, which explore different aspects of East African culture while incorporating grammar rules learned beforehand. Extensive practice between peers also helps facilitate a low-stress environment, where one becomes more comfortable with their classmates and the language. One major improvement that can be made to the class is the inclusion of more vocabulary into the lessons, as at times, since grammar took precedence, some basic vocabulary topics were overlooked."

This was mostly due to the professors teaching style, the classs low stress environment as well as the effective retention and comprehension of Kiswahili, all which made the course extremely satisfying for me. If anyone is interested in learning Kiswahili at Yale, I would definitely recommend taking at least L1 and L2."
