   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Analysis of complex issues in education management and leadership",
    "Learned to grapple with complex issues in education, leveraging evidence effectively and crafting rigorous arguments.  Strengthened leadership and teamwork skills.",
    "This course gave me an excellent overview of key challenges in the US education system today. It also taught me about attempts at innovations to help mitigate these problems, as well as the importance of leadership in creating change and reform in the education system.",
    "This is a great course. This class forces you to confront many educational issues from a practical and policy perspective rather than from a theoretical\/abstract lens as is done in many other educational studies courses. This course also helped build your leadership skills. At times, the class was run as a professional development course. Richard Lemons is an educational consultant and has decades of experience in the field. Seeing how he approaches problems or how he tries to help schools improve is very informative.",
    "Learning to look at problems in a more complex, but straight forward way (if that makes sense). You have to mean what you say\/think in this class, which I found valuable in a seminar setting where its easy to say whatever and get away with a participation grade.",
    "A fair-minded view of public education and a better understanding of how the levels of teaching (instructional core, school, district) interact.",
    "Learned about working in a group, leadership, school improvement through case studies of various schools and districts, mostly around the country but also globally.",
    "This course is helpful in framing todays education reform conversation using real people and relevant case studies, and gives students the language to discuss the nuances of these topics.",
    "A greater understanding of the educational system and how culture, economics, politics, etc. play into its success or complicate its work. Improved my analytical skills through the case method and elucidated the problems in educational practice at large."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Prof. Lemons is an exceptional educator. The only weakness of the course is the fact that due to its high demand, very few Yalies have the opportunity to take it.",
    "This course is truly unusual and outstanding.  Professor Lemons and the community of students are the highlights of the course, as they drive rich discussion about interesting topics in education every meeting and through the project.",
    "Dr Lemons is an outstanding professor and has incredible experience in the education field. Classes are engaging because we partake in individual reflection, small group discussion, and full class conversation. Students who take the class are quite passionate and interested in the subject matter. The semester long project and final presentation is a great learning experience and highlight of the course. Be prepared to work hard if youre going to take this class. I think the reading can be brought down a bit of a notch.",
    "Best course! Professor Lemons makes class extremely engaging and provocative.",
    "Strengths: Richard Lemons is a great professor. Being able to learn from him and his experience is amazing. The case system we use in this course is also great. We do many small group activities where you pretend to be in a position of power (superintendent for example) allowing you to both practice different leadership styles, discuss your ideas with many different people, and give you a feel for being a policy maker. The best part of the class was the capstone project: spend the entire semester working with a group to develop a presentation for superintendents from across the state. Only this course will enable you to develop real policy proposals that could actually materialize into laws for an educational issue that you identify.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think Prof. Lemons accepted too many people into the course. It made it really hard to have fruitful discussions as too many voices were involved. I think that was the largest problem with the course. Moreover, I think that we often didn't dive into class wide debates about the cases we read. I would have liked to have more debates about differing opinions rather than just discussing the facts of the case.",
    "There could maybe be a bit more time in class to discuss the case, but otherwise it was very well organized, from the individual class structure to the semester-long pacing. Should be a few people smaller!!",
    "I think the class was a bit too large. It didn't feel like much of a discussion since a reasonable person would participate once or twice and spend the rest of the time listening. I absolutely loved how Professor Lemons used different activities each week to engage us.",
    "Strengths: readings were very interesting, the focus on leadership throughout the class brought a necessary element for understanding educational leadership, and also our own leadership styles \r\n\r\nWeakness: the class size was slightly too big. Its a seminar, and should remain under 18 students for the most productive class discussions",
    "Prof. Lemons is an amazing, inspiring professor who fosters a great learning environment for students to engage with the cases and always offers enlightening insights into whatever we may be discussing. I think the case method is fantastic in both making the class seem very applicable and real-world focused, but felt that occasionally discussion did not delve as deeply into the cases as I would've liked - making the class smaller (closer to 16-18 than 24) might have allowed for deeper discussion even though I appreciate Prof. Lemons' seeking to make the class open to as many people as interested as possible. I also think more guidance could have been provided with regards to the semester-long educational improvement group project to aid both student understanding of what they should do and also in making our work as efficacious and applicable as possible, especially when made publicly accountable through our group presentations to superintendents\/education leaders across Connecticut.",
    "Almost entirely strengths, the one suggestion I would have is a little more guidance on the modeling\/diagrams for the final project."

   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "Absolutely take this course!!  It is truly unusual and outstanding.  Professor Lemons and the community of students are the highlights of the course, as they drive rich discussion about interesting topics in education every meeting and through the project.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to a student who wants to get a grasp on some of the main challenges facing our education system, and what some of the attempts have been to help work toward solutions. If you want to get your hands dirty and put in hard work, youll get a lot out of this class related to leadership and reform in education systems.",
    "Yes! Best class I've taken in my 3.5 years here. If you want to know more about education policy and issues in the United States, then take this course! I knew nothing coming in, but the readings were extremely interesting, the class discussions were great, and the semester-long project was extremely rewarding. Take this class!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is a different but more rewarding experience than most other Yale courses. This course gives you the best glimpse into educational policy making at the district, state and national level.",
    "Yes, 100000x over. You learn so much about yourself and the material that will always stay with you",
    "Yes, definitely. You should be prepared to do a good amount of work, both for the weekly case but also for the semester-long project. It's a cliche, but you get out of it what you put in.",
    "Absolutely. The semester-long project is the type of intense research and collaboration that I look for in all my Yale courses.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in learning about the education system, and anyone interested in the continued wellbeing of the U.S. needs to have a good understanding of it and how the improvement of our society or any system within it can only occur with change throughout every system.",
    "This is genuinely the best class I have ever taken at Yale, if you have ever had any interest in the field of education take this course"
