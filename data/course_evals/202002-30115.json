   "comments": [
    "Through our class readings and discussions, I developed a strong grasp of First Amendment philosophy and case law.  The reading responses and exams helped sharpen my argumentation and legal writing.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of first amendment analysis, as well as the history of speech in America. As an aspiring lawyer, I thought this was a fantastic introduction to law and hope to take another one of Karen's seminars at some point.",
    "Learned more about the cases behind First Amendment law and more on how to apply it in everyday life.",
    "I developed comfort in dissecting court cases, wrestling with their implications, and challenging their rulings. \r\n\r\nWe really unpacked the implications of The First Amendment from the time of its framers in the constitution to its ever-changing role in digital fora, which in some ways have supplanted the public square.\r\n\r\nGiven its negative valence, the First Amendment often limits the government more than it actively safeguards individual dignity.\r\n\r\nI discovered the tense and constant paradox between inclusivity and free speech built into First Amendment legislative history, in which a saturation of speech is much more favored than chilling hate speech.\r\n\r\nWe also learned about defamation\/libel laws domestically (and compared it to elsewhere), censorship of art, prior restraints on the press and commercial speech, true threats and its distinction from advocacy of (radical) ideology.",
    "I learned to think about multiple ethical considerations with regards to free speech, and I got to explore the different models and tests used to balance free speech rights with the other needs of society and obligations of government. This gave me a new appreciation for the delicate balance courts aim to strike.",
    "I learned a lot about First Amendment framing, protections, and limitations. We talked a lot about fundamental First Amendment cases as well as decisions rendered by lower courts.",
    "I had never really even dipped my toe in the water when it comes to talking about law or the Bill of Rights, so it took a few classes, but I now feel so much more comfortable discussing things in legal terms, and understanding the differ perspectives lawyers have to take on. I think something that has also resonated with me from this course is that what your heart believes ethically is not always the way a case will play out, because cases are not determined by the ethical reasoning, it is who can relate their side to the constitution more, which I found fascinating.",
    "practice reading cases and formulating legal arguments",
    "Learned about the complexities of the First Amendment and the many complicated precedents and exceptions to precedents in American and international free speech jurisprudence.",
    "History of the First Amendment, First Amendment jurisprudence and theoretical frameworks\/doctrines.",
    "A comprehensive understanding of the status of the First Amendment in the US as well as a nuanced understanding of when speech is with\/without value and when a government may be ethically obligated to prohibit or protect speech.",
    "I learned how to read\/what to look out for when reading court cases\/opinions.",
    "First Amendment issues, insights into the US legal system.",
    "I became substantially more familiar with judicial doctrine surrounding First Amendment issues of free speech from the mid 1900s onwards.",
    "-Reading and close analysis skills \r\n-knowledge about First Amendment Law\r\n-discussing the law",
    "I learned so much about the First Amendment and how it applies to scenarios in real life. This course was an excellent way to gauge my interest in the field of law. I learned to think critically about how the First Amendment applies to issues of speech and censorship, and I left the course with a more nuanced understanding of subjects such as hate speech and speech on the Internet.",
    "Knowledge of the first amendment and how to apply it to everyday life skills.",
    "I gained a foundational understanding of the first amendment and the legal philosophy\/controversies surrounding it.",
    "I learned some legal vocabulary and how to form arguments in a different way. Professor Goodrow was also very good at allowing her students to think for themselves rather than guiding the thinking. I really enjoyed the class and her perspective.",
    "I learned the limits and extent of the what First Amendment protects and how to evaluate the morals of the some limits of the First Amendment.",
    "I learned how to better argue and write using legal terminology and based on a way of thinking that aligns with legal doctrine. I developed a better ability to read and understand legal documents and courtcases.",
    "I really learned a lot regarding the precedents related to the First Amendment and had great discussions with students.",
    "I learned how to give my opinion on tough topics and discuss with a small group.",
    "Enhanced first A knowledge greatly"

   "comments": [
    "This course was truly fantastic, owing to Karen's and the teaching staff's deep investment in our learning.  I am in awe of how intellectually exciting our class discussions were, and I wish we could continue them through the year.  I am immensely grateful to Karen and our TFs.",
    "I sometimes wished that the class had been more explicitly legal and less abstractly ethical, or at least had made more of a connection between the two. To my mind, as the practical application of morals, ethics are inseparable from law, and I didn't always feel that was clear. When our midterm asked us what we thought about hate speech, and not at all about what the law dictated, it felt like I missed an opportunity to show how much I had learned about the first amendment in favor of the chance to share an opinion I could have defended before the course. I love Karen, and my TF (Allison) was similarly wonderful. Especially as illiberalism creeps deeper into the mainstream of our institutions, I was grateful for the chance to learn about this subject matter.",
    "Strengths include the robust discussions that were held; weaknesses were the quantities of pages in certain articles assigned.",
    "Strengths: \r\nBoth small section and larger full class discussions. \r\nThe narrow focus on the First Amendment\/free speech is a topical issue for both college students entering a world of critical discourse and for citizens in a country facing dual-narrative media, which we contextualized in very recent cases! We discussed the recent case of U.S. v John Bolton, in which the Trump Administration tried to prevent the publication of his ex-National Security Advisers political memoir.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the only one that naturally comes to mind is that as a large course online, full class discussions were at times difficult to participate in, as we had ~66 people on the call at once.",
    "One strength of this course was how we were encouraged to question courts' decisions. Because the overarching question was \"Is this ethical?\" in addition to \"Is this legal?\", I was encouraged to criticize courts when I disagreed with their decision and was able to develop my own ethical and legal standards.\r\n\r\nHowever, the amount of reading in preparation for each class could have been spread out more evenly, especially considering the Monday-Wednesday schedule. This schedule meant that we had either one or four days to do typically equal amounts of work between classes.\r\n\r\nAlso, it was sometimes unclear who could be speaking during the large-group discussions (just the members of the relevant small group(s) or anyone interested in speaking).",
    "Strengths: Covered a lot of cases, examples, and hypotheticals. Class and section discussions were fascinating. Midterm and final exam were open-ended and enjoyable to do. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, the amount of readings felt overwhelming and it may have been more helpful to go in detail about a few cases rather than talk briefly about many cases.",
    "I thought there was too much reading at the beginning, but I see now that that was crucial to having a background of cases to refer to and add into discussion. I thought it might have been good, for beginners like me, for there to be a quick explanation of how one gets sued, like the legal process behind that, and how these things get decided in court, like with a jury and what not, but I understand its a 300 level class and maybe I was the only one without any background in all of this. Other than those things, I really loved everything about this course, my group discussions were fantastic, and I do feel like I learned so much in such a short period of time",
    "i think it was a great course, the professor was amazing. i wish that lecture had a tad more structure, or that legal vocabulary and terms were covered at the start of the course",
    "Well organized and run discussion groups\r\nGood TAs\r\nEngaging professor\r\nA bit heavy workload and readings",
    "The breakout sessions were facilitated extremely well and both the readings and reading response prompts supplemented class discussion well. I would say the one thing to note was that the size of the class really undermined our large group discussions. Because the lecturer and TAs were always trying to make sure that everyone was heard, we rarely delved deep into the topic at hand and had to move through the discussion questions relatively quickly.",
    "The biggest strength is Judge Goodrow; she was phenomenal.  The only weakness was the online format.",
    "It was a lot of readings, but I liked the format of the course (short lecture, small group discussions, bigger group discussions). It also definitely made me thinker about the issues of free speech and the First Amendment. I didn't get any feedback on my midterm or final, though, only the grade.",
    "Its overall an extremely engaging course. Readings could be more feasible.",
    "Although it was strange to take the course online, it was organized in a way that maximized class discussion. Very engaging, insanely interesting.",
    "Strengths: The class and accompanying readings had a consistent focus, lectures were informative, and the professor\/TA did a good job of making a 3 hour 15 min block as engaging as a 3 hour 15 min block can realistically be.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The types of readings assigned could have been more varied without weakening the tight focus of the course. For instance, in the readings dealing with true threat\/fighting words doctrine, several legal cases were assigned that differed minimally in relevant aspects of form (core issue, outcome, judicial reasoning, applicability, etc.). Having several of these relatively redundant cases replaced with readings on the philosophical justifications of and\/or contemporary debates surrounding true threat\/fighting words doctrine would have led to a more informative and engaging class. I would have also been happy to see readings offering more heterodox views of the First Amendment; for instance, an author willing to challenge originalist interpretations or even the \"marketplace of ideas\" would have been a refreshing contrast to what we mostly read.",
    "Strengths: Karen is amazing, great TAs, adapted well online with a lecture, section and then group discussions, very engaging \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes A LOT of reading that isn't always discussed. Some weeks I would have liked to have focused on fewer readings. no feedback so no indication of how well you are doing.",
    "This course worked really well as an online class, and everybody worked together to ensure that people had a chance to speak when they wanted to. One weakness, which is specific to the Summer Session, is that some weeks there was a really high volume of reading that made it more difficult to deeply interact with the material. I also wish that we had received more feedback on the essay assignments.",
    "strengths are the breakout rooms and the weaknesses are the low level of student engagement during the lecture part of the class",
    "The online format does not lend itself to a course like this. That being said, Professor Goodrow is an absolute pleasure: she is warm, charming, accommodating and most importantly of thoughtful intellect.",
    "I was not a fan of the Zoom situation we were all in. I took this course so that I can get an insight into how Yale if at all is different from Columbia University so that I can better choose a grad school. But overall the class was great the individual groups is where I had the most engagement.",
    "I love the discussion in this class. Everyone was so insightful, and Karen is excellent at leading our conversation and provoking our thoughts. I think the lecture would be more intriguing if it includes some slides or images.",
    "Strengths include how engaging the professor and TAs were, the discussions that were not afraid to go off on interesting and relevant tangents, and the subjects of most of the readings.\r\nWeaknesses included some of the readings being somewhat redundant and less engaging, and that it could be difficult to decipher the exact subject matter we were responsible for knowing.",
    "I think that the only weakness is the remote learning mode itself.",
    "I loved class discussions but I did not enjoy the homework assignments and the tough grading on those."

    "This course was truly fantastic, owing to Karen's and the teaching staff's deep investment in our learning.  I am in awe of how intellectually exciting our class discussions were, and I wish we could continue them through the year.  I am immensely grateful to Karen and our TFs.",
    "Absolutely. I love Karen and wish more people understood the history and practice of speech regulation.",
    "Absolutely, if one wants to learn more about the nuances and rationale of the Constitution.",
    "I would absolutely recommend First Amendment and Ethics of Law to anyone regardless of major because as a college student it is extremely important to contextualize the clash between diversity and inclusion within free speech doctrine both on campuses and in the world beyond. I am undecided and this was my first political science course at Yale, and the ethical debates I engaged in have definitely  inspired me to want to take more (and potentially major in it)! Its so interesting to learn about where are legal frameworks falter and how theyve weaponized throughout time to forward certain political\/partisan agendas.",
    "I would recommend this course because I think it promotes active discussion (even during the large-group discussions) and encourages students to question their previous beliefs by playing Devil's Advocate.\r\n\r\nThe cases selected for reading also provided a vartiety of circumstances in which the First Amendment was invoked and demonstrated how wide-reaching its impact is, showing students the scope of the issue.\r\n\r\nHowever, the price of the course (over $4,000 for 10 classes, so more than $100\/hour) felt excessive. Given that the class was designed as a seminar course with about a quarter of the students it ended up having (about 60 students total, so over $6,000\/hour), I feel like the course could have been made much more affordable. This is more a criticism of the tuition rates for the summer session than this course specifically, however.",
    "Yes. Professor Goodrow is a great instructor and her perspectives are fascinating. The class content and structure is interesting, and I learned so much about the First Amendment.",
    "I definitely would, I have already been telling my friends and family all about it. I think, especially right now in politics, it is important for young people to understand how the justice system works. Or even just how basic rights get played out in court cases, but I feel like I understand how civil rights get fought in court now. I think it would interest many people that are interested in political science, ethics, or law.",
    "Definitely yes. The course if very thought-provoking and engaging. It inspired me to think about a lot of questions.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in law to any degree please take it!",
    "Yes I would, especially if that student was already interested in these topics. If a student was not interested in the subject matter, their engagement may be lower, but the course would be interesting regardless of the interest in law; very applicable and relevant to all.",
    "Yes - Judge Goodrow is a fantastic discussion facilitator, and I can only imagine that the class is even more fun when it's actually a seminar. This course is a really great introduction to constitutional ethics and the content is very relevant to contemporary issues.",
    "Definitely! This is a really great class for those with any interest in the First Amendment or US law in general.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in law and issues regarding the 1st Amendment! Also, even if you're not interested, I think it'll make you think deeper about the issue of free speech.",
    "Absolutely",
    "110%.  This course was incredible and Professor Goodrow is an engaging and kind professor to have at the helm of discussions.  Do be warned that there is a lot of reading for this course if you take it over the summer because the 14 week semester is turned into 5 weeks.  But, all the reading is purposeful and interesting.",
    "As a summer credit, yes with minimal reservations -- you learn a good deal about a relevant topic from an actual judge, and its structure accommodates the accelerated pace of a summer course well.",
    "Yes! Incredibly interesting and great professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend, Professor Goodrow is an amazing teacher and the discussions are great.",
    "Absolutely! I loved taking this class and think anyone interested in law should look into it.",
    "yes.  This class was one where I learned a lot and enjoyed going to class as well.",
    "I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANY POLISCI, EP&E, HISTORY or HUMANITIES MAJOR! Its enjoyable, low stress, easy grading and the topic is intellectually exciting!",
    "Definitely. I was able to engage and learn a lot even when I did not have any background knowledge of law.",
    "Yes, because it is a somewhat basic but fascinating exploration of American free speech doctrine, an issue that affects people every day in everything we read, say, and do. When the class is at its best, it addresses this issue in a way that relates to our own lives.",
    "I would recommend this course to any students who is interested in politics.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot and it is very relevant to daily life."
