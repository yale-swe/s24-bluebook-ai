                "CAD! You do lots and lots of computer aided design and become very familiar with Solidworks and learn a lot of cool tricks to it. Kind of feels like an Excel course where you know the basics of excel, and this teaches you some of the more powerful aspects of Excel. Very chill course as well which was nice as you got to focus on learning the things you wanted and didn't have to do a bunch of annoying busy work that makes you dislike a subject.",

                "Great course. Love Doc A. He makes you care about what you're doing after removing the stress of grades. Guaranteed A if you go to class, complete all the assignments. Assignments have a HIGH degree of freedom; you mostly design stuff that you think is cool or would be useful in your life.",
                "Dr. A is a fun lecturer to have, class is almost like a stand up comedy set with all the prepared jokes he has. When he's not showing how to do something and you're working independently you'll often get to just talk to him during class and he's a free resource for advice on any engineering project. I think towards the end some of the classes were more just working in your project, which while some people might like the extra time, I wish we could have had lessons so I could have improved my skills since I was already working on my project at home.",
                "The assignments were pretty good, encouraged creativity. The grading scheme (everyone gets a 100) was super great as it made the goal of the course actually learning the package, instead of just gunning for a certain grade. You definitely get out what you put in. You can phone it in on most of the assignments and still get a 100 so it's up to you how much effort you want to put in. The MATLAB assignment was pretty dumb, we essentially did the same thing in ENAS 130 and I'm not sure why they insist on keeping Professor Long's kind of tangentially related assignments in all of these courses.",
                "This course is great because there is the freedom to design models that interest you a lot of the time because the assignments offer you that independence. That way, the class is tailored to all kinds of students. I think I would have enjoyed doing more practice examples in classes rather than using class time for my final project.",
                "Strengths: very supportive of learning and understanding",
                "Doc A is an absolute legend. I was cracking up most of all the classes. Dude could have been a standup comedian. So nice and really cared about us. It's mastery-based learning: (ie no late penalties), and very lenient grading. Super strong all around. Shows+ that you can learn things without having to stress and spend loads of time and have a good time in class.",
                "This is a mastery based course that gives a great introduction to solid works",
                "I appreciated how this course allowed me to use my creativity while building my SolidWorks skills.",
                "Strengths: the class starts from very basic CAD and advances you in a linear and easy-to-follow manner.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there were a few classes that were straight on lectures from Doc A with no hands-on CAD component, and I struggled to pay attention during those.",
                "Strengths: emphasized learning and lots of flexibility to try things out on Solidworks\r\nWeaknesses: MATLAB part was a little confusing and limited",
                "No improvements. Well organized and entertaining class. Projects were rewarding.",
                "you really learn how to CAD quickly, but most of it could be learnt on youtube. I wish we had more individual projects where we could cad fun stuff.",
                "Strengths: Mastery based learning took a lot of the pressure off, while incentivising me to actually put in full effort in completing all of the assignments. Although I complained a little bit during the course about how many assignments there were, it was actually really important for my learning because it helped me practice and actually face the steep learning curve. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt the MATLAB assignment where we had to perform coordinate transformations on a house was a little out of place, and could have been taught better. I was a little lost and I think so were some of my classmates. However I understand that this portion was developed by a previous professor and I felt that Doc A put his full effort in trying to help us with it."

                "Yes this is great even for non stem majors looking for a distributional",
                "I thoroughly enjoyed attending this course and feel like my Solidworks skills improved a lot during it. It was not the most rigorous course I have ever taken, but that is not necessarily a bad thing, as it did not cause me unecessary stress.",
                "Would highly recommend it. Very fun elective and useful too whether you go into industry, or if you just like to design stuff on your own. Mastery-based learning, great professor (the Coast Guard Academy professors are all kinda great), cool content, and you create some very interesting projects throughout the semester. Definitely shows the fun side of mechanical engineering and I would be sad to graduate without taking this course.",

                "Take this course if youre an engineer, you really gain skills.",
                "if you want to learn how to cad and have  alow-workload course, for sure. the prof is amazing, he is super funny and helpful. i just think the material is a bit dry.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are transitioning into engineering from a different background or simply anyone who doesn't have any experience with SolidWorks but wants to learn it properly and ASAP. I think the same thing probably could be learned from YouTube tutorials but it's hard to have the discipline to go through them intensively and it's useful to have people to be there and direct you when things go wrong.",
