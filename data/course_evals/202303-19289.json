You learn a lot about optics, ray tracing, different types of microscope and what types of experiments you can use each one for. The course also taught me how to prepare and give a job talk on a research project -- while it was definitely difficult to prepare and talk about research that you haven't conducted, the experience of giving a job talk has taught me so many skills that I would need going into the future regardless if I end up pursuing a PhD.",
                "Lots of fundamentals about light microscopy (both theoretical and practical/technical). We got to learn so many more basic techniques and very advanced ones. It was cool to learn from so many different instructors about their specialties and got to see the cutting-edge of microscopy and how we can implement it in our current/future research. We also got to improve our scientific communication skills.",

                "The strengths were that we had really committed professors -- shoutout to Joel, Joe H. and definitely Joe W. -- who made the course interesting and fun. I would say I also loved the rotating guest lecturers. I typically don't like that style of teaching, but for some reason, it worked for this class. It was cool to learn about spinning disk, lattice light sheet, etc. from different faculty members who specialized in those areas rather than reading off of a textbook. The course was also highly interactive given that we only had 9 students, so it definitely fostered learning and asking questions. The strengths are so strong that it overpowers any weakness I may have had in mind.",
                "A great course overall! Strength is in having Dr. Wolenski as the primary instructor and getting to learn from so many different advanced microscopists. The first half of the course felt much longer and was more challenging when trying to build a strong foundation in many theoretical aspects governing microscopy. It may be helpful to have some more worksheets to make sure students thoroughly understand basics like Kohler illumination before moving on. However, building this strong foundation really helped in the second half of the course when many of those concepts were applied in more advanced ways. We got so much microscope time in this course (and on lots of advanced microscopes and doing very cool experiments). Another strength is in the caliber of all the instructors we got to learn from! Overall a very positive experience",
                "Strengths are that you're highly engaged with the course since it's such a small class and Wolenski is pretty hands-on.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses is that the grading scheme could've been clearer. It was very much a \"vibes-based\" grading system where if the professor thought you were smart through a holistic evaluation throughout the semester, you got an A. It's less about the solid midterm/final grades."

                "100% would recommend this course! I will have to say this course up there in my list of favorite courses to take at Yale. While the course had a relatively low workload (no psets etc.), I would say the content and everything we do in class were intellectually stimulating. I ended up wanting to learn more -- I wanted to know how the optics behind a certain technique works. I would recommend this to any student intending on pursuing a PhD in the biological sciences because hey, you need microscopes to look at cells. And even if you don't want to pursue a PhD, just take the class, it's highly fun and highly rewarding.",
                "Yes yes yes! Definitely take a course with Dr. Wolenski before graduating! You get to learn a lot of cool microscopy techniques and I had no idea how they could be applicable to research before taking the course. We had access to so much technology and so many experts in the field. The first part of the course felt a bit more challenging and required building more foundational knowledge, but it was really important to build that base before moving to the more advanced techniques. This course also introduced us to a lot of microscopy knowledge and gave experience that we would not have access to otherwise.",
                "Yes, but be prepared to work hard. Even though it's a 9 person course, the grading is not lax and you are very much graded against your classmates."
