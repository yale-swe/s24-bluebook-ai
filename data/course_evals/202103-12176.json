Significant improvement in language ability in a relatively short time.\r\nWeaknesses: Course load was very high and the intensity of the course sometimes made it difficult to retain new information and stay motivated.",
                "Strengths include the dedication of the instructors to their students both in teaching and in providing them with a safe & warm learning environment. The small classroom sizes foster a great environment to both practice repeatedly and get closer to your peers so as to feel comfortable practicing with them outside of class.",
                "More character writing in class",
                "Very organized; amazing professor",
                "I believe that the course load is too much, stoping most students from continuing the language even though it is very useful on",
                "Strength - Incredibly interactive, meets everyday, focuses on speaking ability over memorization of characters\r\nWeakness - Heavy workload but you do learn!",
                "Strength: The course is amazing in teaching beginners to speak Chinese well. Course is well-facilitated to make sure each student is improving in reading, writing, and speaking. Ao Laoshi is amazing and so sweet!\r\n\r\nWeakness: Grading scale (being over 100%) was a confusing system to understand. The vocabulary for daily quizzes sometimes did not align with what was presented on the weekly schedule.",
                "It is a brilliant course  the teachers, the curriculum etc. all great.  The one thing I would improve is making the homework less frequent/less lengthy (e.g. halving the number of presentations).\r\n\r\nAo Jingjing is an INCREDIBLE teacher."
