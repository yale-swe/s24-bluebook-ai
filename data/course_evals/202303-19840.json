                "developed the cultural and conversational aspects of language learning",
                "Taking this class, I have seen a great improvement in my Spanish speaking skills. Unlike the previous levels which were more about learning the vocab and tenses, this class is focused on applying them. We had a discussion based on different topics such as Latin American arts, politics, and nature as well as group class projects, which expanded my Spanish knowledge, experience, and confidence and helped me become more fluent in a Spanish-speaking setting.\r\n\r\nParticipating in this class has markedly enhanced my Spanish-speaking abilities. In contrast to earlier levels that primarily focused on vocabulary and grammar acquisition, this course emphasized their practical application. Engaging in discussions on a variety of topics, including Latin American arts, politics, and nature, alongside collaborative class projects substantially broadened my understanding and fluency in Spanish. These activities not only expanded my linguistics competence but also boosted my confidence in communicating within Spanish-speaking environments. For instance, there is an aspect of the course called experiential learning, that enabled me to learn about every life and struggle in Spanish-speaking communities. Also, in one of these experiential learning which was a screening of a film of the story of an Argentinian photojournalist, Eduardo Longoni, I had enough confidence to ask a question about the topic though I was not completely fluent and eloquent in the class discussions and seminar enabled me to do so. The interactive and diverse nature of these learning experiences has been instrumental in elevating both my language skills and cultural awareness. This course has expanded my interest in the language and now I am considering proceeding with the Spanish course though I have completed the Yale language distributional requirements.",
                "I learned new grammatical structure and fixed errors in my conjugations.",
                "My Spanish improved. It was mainly my vocabulary and speaking skills that got better, but I noticed improvements in my ability to read, write, and listen too.",
                "I learned many new aspects of Spanish culture through a lens of art and language. I gained a lot of new insights into how to hold conversations with peers in Spanish and present our knowledge in the form of plays and video recordings.",

                "strengths: interesting topics, projects reflected student learning\r\n\r\nweaknesses: Needs more concrete lessons on grammar and vocabulary",
                "One of the strengths of this course was the emphasis on active participation in class discussions. This approach facilitated real-time language practice and helped in understanding diverse perspectives on various topics, enhancing both linguistic skills and cultural awareness. The opportunity to ask questions and clarify doubts was invaluable, as it made complex topics more approachable and understandable.\r\n\r\nHowever, the course also presented challenges, particularly during discussions. Finding the right words to express complex thoughts in a new language was sometimes difficult. To improve this, the course could benefit from more structured language support, such as vocabulary lists or phrases related to the discussion topics, which could aid students in articulating their thoughts more effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, while the course was effective in enhancing communication skills, additional support materials and diverse learning resources could make it even more impactful for students at the intermediate level.",
                "The strengths of this course were Professor Baffi because she helped us learn new vocabulary and grammar, without using traditional methods of reading from a textbook. I enjoyed learning the language through cultural connections, especially the art unit because it was interesting to see how language could influence urban art. The only thing that could be improved was that there was nightly homework that sometimes took a while to complete.",
                "It's a really well-structured course. The content is engaging and interesting, so much so that the daily homework rarely feels like busywork. I appreciated the focus on Latin America's history and politics. One thing to improve is the manner in which the 5 projects are structured. They comprise a massive portion of the final grade, but we rarely had much time to do them. Big parts of each project would often be assigned over a weekend or during the week, and the overall turnaround time on the project was usually a week or less. That made it difficult to produce high quality work. That was okay because a recognition of that seemed to be factored into the grading. But it was also a little disappointing, because it would have been nice to have the chance to really produce something I was proud of. Other classes don't really give you the opportunity to do that with assignments like the projects, which were creative --- making a film or a website, etc.",
                "This course allowed students to be immersed in the Spanish culture, which allowed our language and vocabulary to grow. However, I wish there were more assignments that allowed students to focus on their grammar and tense-structures.",

The course is structured to provide a balance between challenge and accessibility, making it suitable for those who wish to improve their Spanish skills without feeling overwhelmed. The class's focus on practical application of language through discussions, group projects, and interactive tools like jam boards makes it particularly effective for students who thrive in a dynamic and participatory learning environment.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the instructors enthusiasm and commitment to student understanding contribute to a supportive and encouraging atmosphere. This course is ideal for students looking to enhance their Spanish proficiency in a setting that emphasizes real-world language use and cultural immersion, without the high-pressure environment often associated with language learning.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's important to note that while the course is not overly challenging, it still requires active participation and a willingness to engage with the material and classmates. Overall, for students interested in developing their Spanish skills in an interactive and supportive setting, this course would be a great choice.",

However, if you are looking to improve your grammar skills and sentence structures, then I would not recommend this course."
