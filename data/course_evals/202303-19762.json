                "- learned software such a blender, unity, meta for the oculus\r\n- experimented with a wide range of representation, including VR, photogrammetry, BEEM lab in the architecture school\r\n- learned about digital artists and their differing methodologies and philosophies\r\n- lots of hard skills in terms of 3D modelling and rendering were gained",
                "The tools we used are Blender, Unity, and VR headset. They're pretty complicated technical softwares, but Alvin so meticulously stepped us through the basics and even made customized PDF tutorials for some special functions depending on students' projects' needs. He also often stayed after class to help me debug. I really appreciated how half of class time was dedicated to learning technical skills and the other half was dedicated to looking at artists who work with 3D modelling, VR, and other forms of immersive or technological art. It's perfect for class meeting twice a week for just 2 hours. So there was never a boring class or a class that was too long. I don't think I would've learnt half as much as I did without Alvin.",

                "Strengths: Alvin's willingness to help, explain patiently technical skills, and give artistic inspiration. Well-organized with a class Discord server where Alvin communicated regularly and put reminders, clear syllabus timetable and deadlines and items to submit, well-timed technical classes vs. artistic classes vs. critiques\r\nWeakness: Need a TA to ease Alvin's burden of helping so many students debug. Also, this class needs a part 2 or to be split into 2 otherwise too much content too fast limits the feasibility of projects. Some more feedback during project progress critiques so they don't seem like they're just for keeping us on track.",

                "Yes! Especially if you are into 3D modelling or are looking to get into it (this is essential to the course as it is in the name). Also what was great about this course is that students came from all different departments such as art, architecture, engineering, film studies, CPAR etc... so everyone had different perspectives and ideas on 3D modelling. In the end, everyone's projects were unique to them and that is a beautiful thing.",
