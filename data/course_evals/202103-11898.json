Great introductions and connections between the various theorems that we'll be using for the rest of our lives (at least those of us in STEM!)",
                "I learned a lot about multivariable calculus and 3D space in general. I also learned how to persevere in this class, some of those problem sets were pretty tough. I also learned I'm not really a fan of math.",
                "Working knowledge of 3D geometry, multivariate differentiation, and some multivariate integration.",

                "while the material is necessary to learn it is taught in an incredibly de-engaging way. the professor did not help at all and was so boring",
                "Strengths: A challenging course but there's a lot of support from the instructors and the course leaders (John Hall and Miki Havlickova). Before the midterms and final exams there were several review sessions that were very helpful. Also, the peer tutors are great help for PSETS!\r\nWeaknesses: The pace was just too quick. Even for someone who has already done a little bit of multi in high school, the course material is covered too quickly, which although manageable prevents us from appreciating the concepts.",
                "It is very easy to fall behind academically. If you do not instantly understand a topic given during the at-home portion of the class, the entire in-person portion of instruction is very hard to follow and usually goes over one's head. I do not think that the structure of the class really worked for me in that I feel like I did 80-90% of the actual teaching myself on my own time. The majority of the bulk of the class is learned via the at home readings and videos which made it hard to understand what the actual class time of this course was for. A review of what we learned the night before? Practice of what we learned the night before? It was never really clear. I think it would make more sense to have all of the instruction done in class (with extra videos just incase one does not understand a topic) then have practice worksheet problems for at home practice rather than the \"flipped classroom\" dynamic that is currently in place.",
                "The setup of this course, with problem sets following the material they assess, is collaborative and helpful.",
                "Great instructors and good instructional videos. However, I do wish peer tutoring was more accessible. This perhaps was affected by COVID.",
                "They provided a lot of material and resources for those of us who struggled in the class. My only issue was with communication of these resources especially during reading period. For instance, my suite mate would get messages about review sessions that I wouldn't get messages about so that made for a few missed opportunities.",
                "Repetition of the material in textbook, video, and lecture could be understood as a strength, but it made class less interesting and useful.",
                "A weakness is that the course was very memory-focused; we werent allowed any note sheets on tests which shifted the focus from understanding the methods used to memorizing them. The course itself was hard and rigorous, but I think I spent too much time trying to remember what to do.",
                "Strengths: very comprehensive; the online videos are impeccably clear; lots of structured support.\r\nWeaknesses: class is not very engaging.",
                "I think that there should be more emphasis laid on how ideas and concepts connect throughout the semester, rather than at the end, because it would help make the formulas more comprehensive."
