Sometimes this is necessary and helpful for real engineering jobs, but not all paperwork is always necessary",
                "I like that the class provides structured work time for our projects. I think the level of guidance/intervention vs. letting us go through the steps ourselves is about right. On the weak side, the lectures did not always correlate with what we were doing and Dr. Booth did not seem invested in giving them. Our design reviews weren't really graded until end of term.",
                "It was very fun and motivating to work with a real engineering company. The professor was supportive when he needed to and hands off when he felt we had space for growth. There was the right amount of guidance where it didn't feel overbearing or micromanaging. The easy to digest but information heavy lectures were  a pleasure to sit through."
