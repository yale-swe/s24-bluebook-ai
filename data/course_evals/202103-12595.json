I learned how the central banks' tools, monetary and fiscal policy, differ under fixed and floating exchange rates. I also learned some national accounting skills and knowledge.",

We used these models to examine fixed exchange rates and floating exchange rates and the implications of each.

                "Strengths: Topics are very interesting and much more applicable to the real world than other econ classes\r\nWeaknesses: Much of the class is model-based but then the last unit is history-heavy which was a weird addition in my opinion",
                "Well-organized",
                "Strengths - Professor Fieler tried hard to get to know us and explained the information very well. The material is incredibly interesting and the class is well facilitated for learning. The psets were very helpful practice for the exams.\r\n\r\nWeakness - I think the general class would have participated more and been more engaged if the class were not at 9 a.m.",
                "Strengths were the slides and professor who teaches fairly thoroughly, although having the textbook was a great aid in the class as well. Strengths were also having psets that were graded for completion to help me understand the content but without a lot of stress. Weaknesses were 9am in Watson.",
                "It teaches concepts not explored fully in earlier classes. Not much weakness.",
                "no final exam during final period which was really nice! weakness was that there are 3 midterms",
                "The lecture and problem set material is not especially difficult if you pay attention in the lectures. The concepts flow together logically and throughout the semester you will feel your understanding of international capital flows grow. One weakness of the class is that it follows the textbook very closely throughout the semester. This can make lectures less dynamic and interesting than they otherwise would be.",
                "The strengths of the course are the breadth of concepts covered and the depth for which I truly understand the workings of monetary and fiscal policy in the context of money and foreign exchange markets. The course could be improved by making the notes and slides more clear and easy to understand. Often times I would go to the textbook ex-post learning about a topic in class and be surprised by how simply the book was able to explain the concept.",
                "Strengths: Professor Fieler is a very clear and organized lecturer. Her problem sets and exams are very fair. The content of the course moves in a cohesive manner and at a reasonable pace. Each lecture builds on previous ones and forms a very comprehensive picture in the end (ie when we first learned the foreign exchange + money market graphs, and then learned the AA/DD curves, which incorporates those graphs). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None! This is a fantastic course for learning the basics about international trade/finance.",
                "Great Professor. Very kind and goes the extra mile to help students.",
                "The strengths were that the materials were interesting and the tests were straightforward, which came out to an enjoyable experience.\r\n\r\nI did think that the lectures could have been better delivered in terms of organization, as it was highly dependent on what the professor wanted to review or felt that needed to be covered more irregardless of what was on the slides.",
                "Very well organized and we generally ran ahead of schedule! A little boring at times but generally rewarding. Problem sets were graded for completion which was huge.",

                "Very systematic course, and a lot of interconnectedness.",

                "I would recommend this course to someone only if they have a previous understanding of accounting and an interest in learning about money and foreign exchange markets. This course requires paying acute attention to the variable that change a model and how they change it. I believe that this is a helpful course to understand monetary policy, fiscal policy, money markets, and foreign exchange markets, but a student may not get the knowledge of international finance relations that they were hoping.",
                "Yes, I learned more interesting information than in micro and macro.",
                "Yes for sure!! International Finance is a very organized and fascinating class that gives you a robust foundation for understanding international economic news. After taking this class, a lot of news headlines about international inflation and exchange rates make so much more sense to me. In addition, Professor Fieler is absolutely wonderful. She's a great lecturer and gives very manageable assignments and exams. Would highly recommend this course to every Econ student!",

                "Yes if you are interested in learning the models behind phenomena like currency crises, capital flight, banking crises, etc etc",
                "Want to learn something about international macroeconomics, definitely take the course!",
                "Yes if you want to learn about exchange rates, monetary and fiscal policy, etc. There's nothing mind-blowing here. You learn what's in the syllabus and if that interests you you should take the course.",
