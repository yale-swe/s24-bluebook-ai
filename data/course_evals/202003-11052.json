I also liked the open discussions during lecture to discuss interesting topics related to VLSI design. I did not enjoy the disorganization of the course. The explanations of the labs were not easy to follow, the expectations for each assignment were rarely ever clear, the workload was much higher than what was described on the syllabus.",

                "The labs and lectures were all easy to do in an online environment, as long as the student had a mouse for the Magic layout tool. However, due to changes in the class registration process, courses were expected to be added to student worksheets before the traditional shopping period, and in turn, the syllabi of each course was expected to be updated. However, the syllabus, as well as all the information on Canvas for the course, seemed copy\/pasted from the previous course with Professor Manohar. Changes like no partners for labs, essay\/writing assignments, and a heavy workload were never mentioned on the syllabus, which was not what I was expecting in the course."

                "I would recommend this course to any CS, EE, or EECS major even remotely interested in computer engineering. It is really well taught, has very interesting and rewarding projects, and will give you an understanding of the true fundamentals of how modern computers work at the physical level. Don't be scared of the physics in the course, transistor physics is covered for maybe one or two lectures but you're never extensively tested on it.",
                "Absolutely not. For lectures, the instructor has no sense of pace. Some parts just take forever to move on, and other parts breeze past without much information. The instructor does prompt the students for questions, but all of us have learned that the questions will inevitably lead to a lengthy digression that often fails to directly answer the question, so we dont bother to ask. For labs, the software that the course uses has minimal documentation, and the instructor simply sends out a couple tutorial pdfs for the students to work it out themselves. These tutorials introduce loads of shortcut keys, but around a third of them are not even bound to the actions described in the tutorial. For the quizzes, the instructor decided to switch in the middle of the semester from quizzes reviewing lecture material to quizzes that require research to answer an open-ended question. This might sound nice, but students are heavily penalized if their answers dont involve intense research material or misinterpret such research. Personally, this is the first course Im taking regarding VLSI; how in the world am I supposed to comprehend research papers thrown at me? All in all, taking this course will make you as confused as a concussed deer swimming in a pool of spaghetti sauce.",
                "I would recommend the course solely to engineers interested in circuit and chip design. A basic understanding of electronics is expected and the expectations for the course may change at any moment throughout the semester.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to other students."
