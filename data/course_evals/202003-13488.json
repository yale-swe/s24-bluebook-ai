                "I thought the seminar discussions were very good especially with the small class size. Towards the middle of the class, the R workshops were very helpful, but they could have easily been recorded ahead of time, adn we would have had more time to discuss the bigger topics in class.",
                "The strengths of this course were its organization and the instructor. The course was well organized to help students develop the requisite knowledge and skills necessary to complete the final project. The instructor was a gem; Anton was highly invested in his students' learning and always made himself available to assist students with coursework. There were no weaknesses to this course.",
                "Strengths: The readings were well thought-out, with lots of interesting topics of discussion. Two R workshops helped improve my skills in applying new machine learning techniques to data.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The 2-hour seminar time was often too long in many instances; having part of the seminar time devoted to some lecture component instead of it being mostly discussion-based would alleviate this.",
                "The course was very strong, both organizationally and content-wise. I found it to be one of the better courses I've taken at Yale so far, and it was easily the highlight of my semester."

                "Absolutely; this is one of the best seminars I have taken during my time at Yale. It presents a relatively low-stress opportunity to not just develop a wide range of coding\/data analysis skills but also learn how to apply them in the context of social sciences - both in reading\/analyzing academic literature as well as conducting one's own research. I cannot think of a better recommendation for a seminar during my time at Yale.",

The course helped improve R skills and offered the opportunity to apply a more rigorous quantitive framework to the social sciences and political science, culminating in a final research assignment. However, if you are not interested or well-versed in either of those areas, then this course is not for you.",
