    "I learned that drafting essays can really change the direction you were planning to take your thoughts. This class also made me think a lot about how complicated the moral dynamics of healthcare are.",
    "I learned how to write at the college level in a variety of styles",
    "This course really taught me how to challenge my writing but also worked at my own pace. It took me through my paces and also the topics explored were interesting.",
    "How to understand the prompt.",
    "I improved my writing skills, learned how to shape an essay, and how to correctly build an argument. I will use these skills as I continue my time at Yale; it will help me solidify my ability in writing essays and papers strongly.",
    "I developed writing skills for general essay writing and research paper writing. I also developed close reading skills.",
    "This course helped me tremendously with my writing skills. It taught me how to write concisely and in many different styles."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this class are definitely the professor, Meredith, and the style of peer reviewing in small groups. The weaknesses for me were that we spent a long time going over simple writing concepts, and not much time talking about the topics of the class.",
    "Strengths are clarity of material and goals across the course.",
    "Sometimes the comments I received on my final essay were not mentioned in the initial drafting process so I think more clarification in that aspect or leniency in grading but she's incredibly kind because she grades on your personal improvement from where you started. The last topics we talked about in class were by far the most interesting so I think focusing more on them rather than the readings we had initially were great.",
    "No critical thinking",
    "Strengths: The readings were quite interesting, making writing the essays not boring or busy work. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Much of the small grammar lessons we had once in a while were somewhat useless to the overall scope of the course. We never really applied these to the main 4 essays in the course.",
    "The material was very interesting in getting me to think about the intersection of health, morality, and religion both in the past and in everyday world today. The class also focused on how I can improve and edit my own writing so that I develop skills I can use in future classes.",
    "A strength is how the course covered a variety of essay styles. I also liked how drafts were due before final papers, as it provided sufficient time to produce my best work. It was also great that we had peer editing and got to work with each other to improve our skills. A weakness was the readings that were unnecessarily dense and hard to read."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I was a little intimidated going into it because I had heard that 114 can be a difficult course, but I did not find it to be overly challenging to the point that I would not do it again. I enjoyed writing the essays and Meredith was a great professor to take it with.",
    "Yes I would. I felt like I improved greatly in my ability to write and would recommend.",
    "If you are trying to learn how to write, this is the course to take and this is the section to take because she really cares about you and your writing rather than some standard you have to meet. The grading is kind, the topics are interesting.",
    "Yes! The professor is great, you will learn a lot, and you will become a better writer. It will seem boring and useless at first, but I believe that it was overall a great way for me to improve my essay writing and analysis skills while taking a relevant course to society today.",
    "I would recommend this course because having the basic writing and reading analysis skills is very important for any class in the future and this class specifically was based on a very interesting topic.",
    "Yes, I would. Even if a student is not a strong writer, this course will prepare him or her for future writing assignments."
