                "The class will teach you fundamental writing techniques as well as how to manage your heavy reading schedule.",
                "I definitely developed new ways and techniques to read literature. I am now able to more accurately examine the message of authors, as well as identify areas with potential for unpacking. From recognizing these areas I was able to more effectively respond and adapt these areas in my writing. This definitely improved my sophistication in writing along with the significance of my writing. I obviously learned a lot about pandemics and human interaction in pandemics which was really interesting considering the state of the world today. I also learned what all makes a good paper. Professor Wepler would give very thorough feedback on every writing assignment, as well as encourage and sometimes require conferences about our writing.",
                "Writing an analytical and developmental essay, closely reading texts",
                "I learned a lot about how to write different kinds of essays and read different kinds of literature. This course really gave me a good idea of what college writing is like and helped me become better at formulating my thoughts in written language.",
                "I became a better writer -- I learned how to recognize and craft good essays. I came into the class with a decent ability to write standard essays, but left with an ability to write something that I would actually want to read. Manipulating writing to do what you want it to is not easy. Dr. Wepler teaches you how to do this. I am so glad I took his class. Pandemic literature was also a fascinating topic in the middle of a pandemic, and Blindness and Angels in America were amazing."

                "The strengths of this course lie in the fact that there is a cap on enrollment for each section. My instructor was able to provide a lot of individual attention to me and helping me develop my writing skills. \r\nThe weaknesses of this course were mainly due to the pandemic. Sometimes it was hard to remain engaged in class (not to any fault to the instructor) because it was a virtual format. Other than that, it was an excellent class.",
                "The course was a perfect class size, which meant participation and engagement were very high. Even though there were no group assignments, we grew close as a class and enjoyed discussing the literature with one another. The class did move at a fast pace, which meant keeping up with work was challenging, but other than that, the class was very interesting and nice to attend.",
                "The course follows an interesting topic which allows for students to be engaged. There was a routine to the work and you become a better writer from all the peer editing and one-on-one meetings you have with the professor. I would consider some choices of the text to be a weakness due to the inability to be engaged in a couple of the texts that seemed repetitive and arbitrary for discussion.",
                "I think the course itself is a very interesting subject, especially right now. I understand there is a lot of pandemic material from centuries ago, but I found that modern writings were much more engaging to me and I think I learned a lot more from them. With that being said, I loved how we could still relate and learn from those stories\/accounts from the past. That was very interesting to me and one of my favorite parts of the class. Sometimes I feel the language in some materials were too dense and took away from the point, but maybe that was a deliberate choice to include in our readings. I think with this workload it was hard to give full attention to one thing. Often there were readings due the same day as a draft, so it was hard to really focus on both.",
                "Strengths: good feedback on writing, interesting texts, Professor Wepler does a good job of making class interesting and engaging\r\nWeaknesses: didn't feel completely prepared for the first essay, unsure what was expected\/how it'd be graded",

While it would have been nice to always be in person, Zoom did not limit the discussions that we had, and I think that Professor Wepler did a great job of teaching during a pandemic.",
                "This course was the best geared towards covid that I took this semester. Not only did we get to meet twice but Professor Wepler creatively fostered an environment for learning despite the  circumstances. He encouraged us to always participate, made polls and asked us to type in the chat, and whenever he felt our opinion was needed on something he would take surveys and ask our opinions. He strongly encouraged us to be present every class and was always available for questions and made us aware of any times he was unavailable. I can't think of anything that could be improved when it comes to learning during covid."

I think I learned a lot about myself in this course and improved my writing a lot, but if someone prioritizes time and an easy english course, this is not the one for them.  Not only does this course take up a lot of time but it requires a lot of thinking, so it's not something you can just go through the motions for. With that being said, you do learn a lot and get to engage in engaging discussions.",
                "Yes I would. I enjoyed the course and think it's a good introductory writing course.",
                "Yes ! This is a great course if youre looking to get a good overview of college reading and writing. It totally prepared me for my next 7 semesters here and Professor Wepler does a great job of applying what we learned to fields beyond just English so this course is great for any major.",
                "Strongly recommend; Dr. Wepler gives writing advice that is both concrete enough to follow and abstract enough to be broadly valid\/applicable. You will actually learn how to write if you take this class. Be prepared grading isn't very friendly but not unusually harsh either... probably harder to get great grades than most writing seminars, but also it's not like you have to be the best writer in the class to get an A. Definitely worth it, but you will spend a lot of time writing especially if, like me, you are not an experienced writer from the start. The essay prompts are broad though, so you will never have to write about something that you don't care about. Also Dr. Wepler is super friendly\/approachable."
