The labs focused on baremetal programming with C and Rust on the STM32F411 Discovery Kit, and the final lab was creating a mini-kernel with multi-tasking support.",
                "A ton of stuff. Knowledge of the Linux kernel, arm architecture, embedded development in rust, writing Linux kernel modules and syscalls, and more.",

                "The spec has to be flushed out more not necessarily in guiding the students but clarifying what we're suppose to do for each lab (as well as implementations that are viable and implementations that aren't acceptable). Without these clarifications, the grading later on becomes a bit arbitrary.",
                "The lectures are very engaging and relatively easy to understand. The small class size allowed more in-depth questions and open discussions. The labs forces you to read through a lot of documentation and understand the tools and processes on a deeper level. The lab instructions are intentionally open-ended but can be vague sometimes, and I wish there was a little more specification\/guidance about the intended implementation.",
                "The material learned in class is fairly different from the assignments. It would be better if there were more instruction and guidance given for the assignments.",
                "This course was fantastic. Admittedly a ton of work, but very worth it in the end.",
                "The course was pretty difficult and a decent time sink. The specs are pretty underspecified, which can sometimes be stressful, but it also means that the TAs and professor won't be nitpicking your code--if it does what the spec suggests it should do, implementations and specifics can differ and it means the grading for the labs isn't harsh at all! It just takes a lot of time to actually Google around and figure things out. I might suggest that operating systems be a prerequisite for the class, but it was also doable if you didn't take OSes (I did not).",
                "Gives a very unique experience of programming the kernel of a microcontroller. Learns very important concepts of systems programming and the Rust programming language. Weakness is that lectures are sometimes disconnected to the labs and that labs are extremely difficult.",
                "Strengths: The lectures were engaging, the assignments were very challenging but I learned a lot, the professor and TA were amazing\r\nWeaknesses: I think the deadlines for the assignments could be shifted slightly to make the end of the semester less stressful. We were given a decent amount of time on lab 1, which was one of the easier labs, compared to lab 4, one of the hardest labs. I think maybe lab 1 could have been due earlier in the semester so that lab 4 could have been allocated more time from the start."

                "If you are into systems and are willing to learn things by yourself by all means take this course. It can be frustrating at times because of the lack of guidance but the independence while learning is also something that makes the course so rewarding.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in embedded systems or operating systems in general. The course is very time consuming so make sure it will work out with your schedule.",
                "Very difficult course and you will have to figure out a lot for yourself, but once you do, you will learn a lot. Extremely engaging and work intensive course.",
                "Absolutely. Prof. Zhong and Zhiyao are a great teaching team. I really enjoyed that we were never tested on the lectures; it made them easier to listen to and enjoy rather than stress about picking everything up. Its a ton of work, but it will really increase your ability to problem solve. In a lot of ways, it makes 323 look like a bit of a cake walk. Take this course with a light workload otherwise, and you will really, really enjoy it.",
                "Yes, if you liked 323 and OS, this course is for you. Taking it before OS is a little bit more of a challenge, but the two kinda go hand in hand.",
                "Yes! If you liked 323\/are interested in the hardware\/systems side of things I think you will get a lot from this course. Lectures are incredibly interesting but don't cover much of the technical side of things (intentionally) and the specs for programming assignments are incredibly vague. You will have to think structurally about your code and be prepared to do a log of googling\/debugging. That said, it's very rewarding when things actually work, and the TA was very helpful in terms of guiding you structurally.",
                "100%! This should be a major requirement for EECS! You learn to connect the electronics \/ hw to high level programming.",
                "Yes. But I would warn that student that this class is a lot of work and that it may help to have taken an OS class and be a bit farther in your CS career before you try this one. That being said, I have never learned more from a class I have taken at Yale then this class. Before you graduate, I would say this is a must take if you are interested in more low level software\/embedded systems. Professor Zhong is amazing and has many interesting takes on not only the technical side of CS but also the global context that made certain innovations succeed while others didn't."
