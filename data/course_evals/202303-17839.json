                "What was really emphasized was that conducting is a silent art form. It is not a matter of controlling each individual player of the ensemble, but instead about leading them where the music needs to go. We learned beat patterns, left hand motion, orchestration\/how each instrument functions, and ultimately how to act as a leader on the podium without being overbearing."

                "strength: great musicians. weakness: you barely get any conducting time. I conducted for max 10 minutes for the whole semester, and this was true for almost everyone in the course.",
                "It was wonderful to gain experience conducting pieces with a small orchestra, rather than just learning the theory and beat patterns of conducting.",
                "I thought the class was too big, so we each didnt get to conduct very often. Only so much can be learned by watching and listening. However, it was still very interesting to have a mini orchestra to both conduct and play in.",
                "Strengths: knowledgeable professor, individualized feedback. \r\nWeaknesses: oversubscription. Every student probably conducted an average of 3-4 times total. It would be better to have a system to keep track of who had already conducted. Also it being taught at 9:25am.",
                "Strengths: fun, chill course with strong musicians. Felt like a chamber\/mini orchestra group. Weaknesses: not too many chances to actually conduct (25 person course --> conducting once every 2-3 weeks), possible uncertainty about grade",
                "Strengths: I absolutely loved the ensemble playing. It was the highlight of the course, and being able to both conduct and lead a high-level group of players gave me insight into being both a better orchestral player and a better leader. My fellow classmates also made the class strong  you could feel the enthusiasm each time someone would go up. We received clear feedback each time we conducted on stage too, and there was a nice learning progression from simple motion to conducting an entire movement of a complex piece by Richard Strauss. It was ultimately an incredibly enjoyable and fun course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Since there were so many people enrolled in the course, we would each only be able to conduct for 5 minutes every two and a half weeks. Most of our actual practice in conducting had to be outside of the classroom. Some people would get accidentally skipped some weeks too especially if they were in the back of the room, meaning they would have to wait longer. A clearer orchestral roster and order could fix this issue."

                "Yes, it is a great experience to learn how to conduct.",
                "This class was a bit too big in my opinion, and so you dont get much time to conduct. Id imagine it would sometimes get boring for those who dont play an orchestral instrument to have to sit through a whole 2 hour class period only watching others conduct. I found playing in the orchestra while people went to conduct very fun and different from playing in groups with a professional conductor, but if you wont be playing in the orchestra, then definitely take that into consideration. There is much to be learned by watching and also from Maestro Boughton who is incredible at his craft, but the class itself and the day to day experience is definitely not as good when the class is too big. Unfortunately undergrads might not get to shop this class the first week because the school of music operates on a different schedule, so Id monitor the class size before making your final decision. Also there isnt really an organized structure to the content of the class (no textbook, etc.).",

                "Yes! Very little workload, class is fun, and you learn about conducting skills in general.",
                "Absolutely! It was an incredibly fun and enjoyable experience, and the players were all phenomenal (as would be expected from the School of Music here) and fun to work with. It made me really want to pursue conducting in other student ensembles here at Yale even when I had zero experience prior. Just be prepared to have to practice at home since there won't be much podium time."
