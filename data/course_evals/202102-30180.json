                "The frameworks within which to evaluate our morality",
                "I learrned about moral psychology: moral emotions (empathy, disgust, gratitude, etc.), evolution of morality, altruism, moral foundations and universals, dehumanization and more. The course explores tensions between nativism and tabula rasa conceptions of human morality, different philosophical/moral frameworks, and a humanistic vs. scientific look at issues of morality. This is definitely more of PSYC class than a PHIL one, though we did spend time on deontology and util. ALL THE READINGS WERE EXCELLENT. The course combines recorded lectures and Zoom interaction in an effective way. The final was well-structured to force students to condense their knowledge. I also worked on my academic writing and reading..",
                "I gained a wealth of knowledge about philosophy and how different social factors influence our morals.",
                "I learned a tremendous amount of information about moral psychology and moral philosophy in these five short weeks. This course definitely changed my perspective on a number of issues, including empathy, the rationale behind dehumanization, how religion and partisanship affect our moral decisions, and my personal favorite, how adult human morality links to infant and non-human primate morality. It was incredibly interesting to consider moral dilemmas from different perspectives, and to understand the logic behind differing philosophical approaches to morality. I also learned how to present arguments in a concise manner that favored learning. Overall, this course was very reliant upon student preparation, and that taught me how to best prepare for class discussions. Thanks for a great summer semester!",
                "I learned about the different ways in which people perceive morality and why they do",

                "Firstly, I improved my understanding of advanced texts greatly. As previously I have not had much exposure to scientific papers, completing the reading materials really strengthened my ability to understand them. Another skill that I found great improvement in is demonstrating complex reasoning clearly and succinctly. Through working hard on trying to improve my writing assignments based on Professor Sheskin's feedbacks, I gradually became able to analyze the prompts in detailed and in-depth arguments. \r\nAs for knowledge and insights, I believe that I benefited most by acquiring a sense of humility regarding my own backgrounds. Oftentimes, I find myself too easily assuming that others ought to think in the same way as I do, as my own cultural, family, and other social backgrounds tell me to think. However, after reading about many different ways in which people approach moral issues and putting myself into those perspectives in depth, I truly realize how drastically different they can be from my \"default thinking modes.\" Thus, now I try to stop myself from judging moral issues too quickly solely based on my own beliefs or those that my culture promotes, but to think about them from a more neutral, objective standpoint and taking the backgrounds and contexts of the specific people involved into consideration more.",

                "It was a good course, the information given about the weekly topics seemed a bit biased but there was still a lot of good information.",
                "heavy workload but the readings are super interesting and the prof/ta are amazing",
                "This is a solid course with some excellent readings and important questions. Be aware, though, that the content is much more descriptive than normative, and accordingly more psychology than philosophy. Additionally, despite the name, most of the examples don't really reflect \"everyday life.\" (When was the last time you strangled a cat, gave two-thirds of your income to strangers, or contemplated safe, consensual sibling incest, for example?)",
                "strengths: excellent structure of the course; the fragmented lectures, meaningful live-session discussions, and the useful feedback from the assignments help me make progress and interact with this course as much as possible\r\nweaknesses: the course content or the readings provided mainly focus on American history or the study of the American people, maybe this is because the topic is quite new, other countries' studies are not standing out. In the future, maybe the discussion may include not only the American people but also the people from the world.",
                "The readings are very insightful. Some material was repeated in multiple lectures.",
                "A weakness was that students did not really know what their grades were during the course and what the reading response grades translated to.",
                "Quite literally the best professor I have ever had.",
                "Strengths: THIS WAS AN INSANELY INTERESTING CLASS. Prof. Bloom is one of those \"star teacher\" types who is just excellent in how he communicates information and plans lessons. Julia was honestly brilliant and responded to our ideas thoughtfully and insightfully. Our discussions were deep  the two hour section flew by. My group was really engaged and interested. Every single reading was just FANTASTIC, and I especially liked the Ted Talks. The pacing is great for a five week class, not too much or too little content. Overall this was a pretty fantastic experience for me..\r\nWeaknesses: The grading felt pretty arbitrary at times  I've taken enough classes at Yale to get a general sense of what an \"A paper\" is and I felt like this class was harsher than most. That said, I get the sense that this was just meant to motivate us to work harder  I can't be sure as I haven't seen my grade yet. For me, regardless of the grade I get, I do believe this class was worth it since it was so interesting. Additionally, some of my classmates and I felt the prompts for the assignments could have been worded more precisely to avoid confusion.",
                "Overall, I thought the class was very well organized. The length of lecture videos each week was very manageable. Readings could take a very long time and be very intense, but I thought they were necessary for a full understanding of the concepts. If anything, it may be more helpful to split the two classes into equal times (1 1/2 hours each) because It could be difficult to sit for two hours, also because I liked discussing with Bloom!",
                "Strengths: I think this course gives students a developed and incredibly thoughtful evaluation of moral psychology and moral philosophy. This course has been in the \"works\" for years now, and you can certainly tell that it has been taught before every reading was not only extremely applicable, but was useful in evaluating things from a broader perspective. I also think that another strength of this course was that the professor and teaching staff were well-versed in the material. Finally, the final exam prompts were interesting enough to keep our responses less vague and more nuanced. \r\nWeaknesses: There are only a few weaknesses with this course that I would find important enough to share. Firstly, I think that the readings, though interesting, were slightly longer than necessary. While the vast majority were really interesting, they were incredibly lengthy most weeks would require readings upwards of 150 pages. Secondly, the reading responses were harshly graded. You should expect to be taken aback by your first grade on the reading responses. Even though the questions seemed open to interpretation, it felt as though they were certainly looking for some responses over others, if that makes sense. Lastly, I think that the two hour discussion with the teaching fellow was unnecessarily long  it was quite easy to zone out towards the last 30-45 minutes, though that could definitely be more personal than universal. Overall, I really enjoyed this course, though!\r\nImprovements: I would suggest shortening the length of the T.F. section on Thursdays, releasing the tips for reading responses before the first response is due, and seeing if any of the readings can be cut down / reduced on the ground of redundancy/irrelevancy. Other than that, it was great.",
                "Weaknesses: grading is arbitrary and there is little feedback on each reading response. the tuesday sessions with Prof Bloom don't cover much, and you only spend a total of 5 hours with him.\r\n\r\nStrengths: the other students in the course! The course is also clearly organized",
                "The content of this course was extremely interesting and Professor Bloom was amazing",
                "I didn't think the recorded lectures added much to the course but the discussions were invaluable.",
                "It's a well-oiled machine, and quite engaging. It would be nice if reading responses were more participation-based",
                "I really enjoyed the discussion based seminar format of the course. However, I thought it might have been nice to do more open discussion in our Tuesday classes with Prof. Sheskin. Although our structured exercises (like breaking down what we want to get out of Yale and whether Yale actually provides that) were very interesting and I could see the connection to our course, I think having more open discussion might have been more fruitful for my understanding of the material.",
                "Strengths: interesting course content\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lots of readings and assignments condensed into five weeks, although that's largely because it's a summer class",
                "The biggest strength to me is that it is very academically rigorous and enriching. I learned so much from the reading materials, writing assignments, and the live discussion sessions! By pushing and challenging myself to understand the readings and participate more actively in the live sessions, I gained so many insights into moral psychology. \r\nAs I am very happy with my learning experience, I do not see weaknesses in the course. The only potential place for improvement is that the duration of each live session can be longer, as sometimes we did not have enough time to discuss very intriguing topics.",
                "A strength is that the discussions are incredibly interesting and can help you think about moral issues in your own life. Also, the papers are clear and relevant. A way the course could be improved is to receive more instruction on how to write philosophy responses (structure, what kinds of facts to include, more examples).",
                "The content of this course was fascinating. The questions we discussed are ones that everyone would be interested in. The structure of the course itself - watching lectures on coursera by ourselves and then discussing the lectures and readings in a seminar style - is well-done. \r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by a restructuring of the content. There were 5 weeks and 5 corresponding units, but it seemed that there was repetition in material across weeks but also that material WITHIN weeks felt incompatible. This made the weekly reflections difficult, because we had to connect many different topics in one short essay."

And this course needs to be able to express my own thoughts in different forms, especially in writing. If the readings cannot be understood, it is difficult to organize thoughts.

                "YES. I thought the course was excellent. Prof. Bloom is a fantastic teacher. The readings are well-selected and not overwhelming. The recorded lectures made me think deeply. The two hour disussion sections flew by. This class genuinely changed my outlook on morality and intuitions, and I'm very grateful to have taken it. Do note that it's definitely more PSYC-heavy than PHIL (basic moral philosophy is covered, but the course spends far more time examining  human intuitions/emotions/thought processes).  YSS STUDENTS SHOULD SIGN UP EARLY FOR A SPOT  the course fills up quickly..",
                "yes, great class for students with no background in philosophy",
                "I would recommend this course to another student so long as they are prepared to spend a lot of time per week diving into and dissecting the course readings. They were, at times, a little overwhelming, especially if you are planning on taking another summer session course in tandem with this one. I think that the teaching staff were really welcoming to student participation and involvement with the material, which was great. You should, however, be prepared to receive shocking grades on the reading responses (especially the first one!) The response they are looking for is of a particular format and style, and they don't share what they look for in a response until after the first graded response :( I would not recommend waiting until the last minutes to complete reading responses, as they require quite a bit of thought and planning before beginning to answer them. Also, I would advise not skimping out on the readings you never know which readings the discussion section will pertain to (even though it's usually a good mix of all of them), but some are definitely favored over others. Good luck, and you got this!",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course. Firstly, it would be very intriguing and inspiring for students who are interested in psychology and morality. Also, the content taught in the course is very beneficial for not only students themselves, where their abilities are improved and knowledge expanded, but also for the society in general. The course materials and discussions on dehumanization, political partisanship, and effective altruism, for example, can potentially make us realize how to do better morally in the future.",
