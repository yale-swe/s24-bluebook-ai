From the first class she set a very chill atmosphere that made it possible for me to engage with her s my professor without fear and also engage with the other course mates.  The structure of the class was also amazing: using worksheets to actually work through problems in class, using examples that are like a reflection of how exams are set and the PSETs, Concept checks and workshops to expose you to the more application side of Calculus improved my critical thinking. The extended deadlines on PSETs was also a huge lifesaver sometimes.",
