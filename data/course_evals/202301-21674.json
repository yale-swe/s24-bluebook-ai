                "So much knowledge about the military dictatorships in Guatemala, Argentina, Chile, and El Salvador and the many ways in which violence can influence different people in different ways. This seems vague, but the course really does cover a wide range of topics in a short amount of time, in the best way. We learned a lot about indigenous communities and the impact of the dictatorships on them, as well as the legacies of colonial violence that continue today. We also learned about transitional justice and sexual violence.",
                "So so much about transitional Justice, histories of violence in Latin America and much more",
                "I loved that this class began with an exploration of violence from the colonial era, and spanned until the present day. It allowed us to understand violence as a continuity, instead of looking at it within a vacuum. This class was very intersectional- also discussing questions of race, class, and gender.",
                "I learned a lot about different types of violence used by the state against its people during dirty wars in Latin America. Reading so many academic articles and analyzing primary sources on this topics provided necessary information on these topics. I also learned how to have meaningful conversations with my peers about these topics.",
                "I gained a lot of knowledge about dirty wars in Latin America as well as the current state of such countries.",
                "I learned more about the effects of political violence in Latin America, especially violence targeting Indigenous people and women. The class also provided different lenses to look at violence including spatial theories, settler colonialism, gender theory, and much more.",
                "This course took a great deep dive into the intricacies of the political and cultural environment of Latin America through the lense of violence and resistance. In addition to the course material itself (which is well-curated), I developed my ability to participate in discussion and conduct meaningful research."

                "Strengths: Professor Aguilar was very passionate about the material and brought a lot of expertise to class every week. I liked the weekly format (she presented, break, and student presentation + discussion) and the readings were interesting. Weaknesses: too many people in the class to have super in-depth discussions, not a lot of clarity about grades (we didn't get any assignments back), sometimes with multiple documentaries and academic papers the readings + discussion posts could be a lot of work.",
                "Great selection of readings and great organization in terms of projects, reading responses, speakers, and class assignments. No glaring weaknesses.",
                "The readings, discussions, and projects are all incredible",
                "This is a fantastic course. The structure of the course is very effective for teaching and learning. It includes Professor Aguilar's presentation at the beginning of class, a presentation from students, and a class discussion for the rest of the course. The readings were very interesting and we always discussed them in class. The class was organized into different themes for each week which really improved student learning.",
                "Strengths: Professor Aguilar is amazing, pretty much everyone does the reading, and the readings are super interesting. Assignments are also very manageable and overall you learn a lot in this class.\r\n\r\nI don't think this course has any weakness to be honest. Great class!",
                "Professor Aguilar is amazing and extremely insightful, providing a lot of nuance during discussions. I also enjoyed how diverse my peers' academic backgrounds were as it allowed them to show different ways to analyze concepts as my peers lead discussions each week. The readings we had were really insightful and got to the heart of our concerns and discussions.",
                "Strengths: Discussions are well moderated and the balance of presentations from the professor, information from students, and discussion was perfect. Classes consistently engaging. The real strength of the course, though, is Professor Aguilar. Her knowledge is vast and she is incredibly caring!"

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about Latin American history. As a political science major interested in Latin America, this course is much-needed to filled a gap in Yale courses. By focusing on four country case-studies, you have the opportunity to go in-depth into each conflict really understand how they transpired and what is next. Not to mention that Professor Aguilar is great, super helpful, and truly passionate about the material. The workload was pretty manageable as well, although on documentary weeks the weekly readings could add up. Overall, a great course.",
                "Yes. I cannot express to you how much I loved this class. It was one of my favorite courses that I've taken at Yale. You will learn so much, get to discuss it, and Professor Aguilar is the best.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is a great combination of history and the present and we are allowed to express our opinions, findings, and questions in a safe environment.",
                "Yes 100% Professor Aguilar is a delight!",
                "Yes! Important topic, interesting class, reasonable workload.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student because of the amount that I learned. The course content was very interesting, and it was also taught in a way that made it very possible to learn.",
                "Absolutely! I had already a book background on the history of Latin American countries but this class certainly expanded my knowledge and provided me with different perspectives to analyze the complexity of Latin America. Super manageable course too.",
                "For anyone who wants to know more about Latin American History, transitional justice, violence, and reconciliation, I would HIGHLY recommend this course. It was one of my favorites that I have taken at Yale so far. The readings are nuanced and consistently interesting, the course is well structured, and Profesor Aguilar is brilliant.",
