                "We learned how to write and talk about science in a way that non-scientists could also understand. We discussed various chemistry-related topics after watching lectures conducted by chemists.",
                "This course really helped to develop skills in thinking critically about scientific research as a whole. Additionally, it built foundations in scientific writing which isn't as frequently taught at Yale, such as reviews and perspectives.",
                "I gained a much better understanding of how to analyze various scientific talks and papers as well as how to construct a review paper.",

I also had the opportunity to write quickly and concisely about scientific material and thought more about what makes an effective presentation of scientific material."

                "I wasn't a huge fan of watching recorded lecture talks. I wish instead that we would choose a paper to read collectively and discuss that single paper in class. If the room was set up more like a seminar room I think discussion would be better. That being said, the professors were very nice and helpful.",
                "Strengths: material is varied and interesting. Anyone can get what they want out of the course. Allows you to graduate with a BA in the chemistry department.\r\nWeaknesses: much of the work is conducted on your own, with discussions every week.",
                "The co-teaching is a strength - Drs. DiMeglio and Parr work well together.",
                "This is a phenomenal course and I enjoyed it thoroughly.",
                "The emphasis on student participation and the easy access to the professors make this class extremely strong.",
                "This course was awesome! Professor Parr and Professor DiMeglio were always kind and thoughtful and gave good feedback on written assignments. I liked that we had time to do our own research on the assignments before meeting on Fridays to briefly talk about what we each learned. My only wish is that we spent more time on writing our own thesis papers, though I understand that we needed time to first get through the seminar portion of the course before choosing a topic (since the topic of our papers were supposed to relate to at least one of the topics we covered in the first half of the semester)."

                "If you are taking this course as senior essay requirement in chem, it is required, so regardless of my recommendation, you'll have to do it. It is of course less involved than doing independent research, and that comes with its own strengths and weaknesses. You won't be able to do as much original work, and you won't be able to go into as much detail as an independent research project would. At the same time, it doesn't involve lab time or extensive effort on your part.",
                "Yes, good capstone class for the major.",
                "Absolutely. It's restricted to senior chemistry majors mostly, but it's truly a great course for anyone in STEM.",
                "This is the senior requirement for chemistry, so I would only recommend to chemistry majors.",
                "Yes, the professors are really nice, the class has a nice laid-back environment in which we can share our thoughts about Chemistry research, and the weekly ACS lecture summaries are a good opportunity to improve scientific writing. I had a lot of fun working on my thesis paper during the last few weeks of the semester and always received good feedback!"
