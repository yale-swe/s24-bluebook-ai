                "It was very fast paced and hard to follow along. The lectures were structured oddly and it was hard to go back through lecture notes and such resources. In assignments, questions were also vaguely stated, and grading was very vague. There was no rubric and annotated assignments just a single comment on the graded assignment on canvas.",
                "The strength is that some of the homework problems are good thought exercises. The weakness is that lectures and provided notes seem vague and it's difficult to understand what we are supposed to be taking away from each class. It is easy to follow the lecture but hard to know how to apply each example to other circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe recommended book is intended for computer science majors and the computational efficiency focus of topics is irrelevant to the class. The book does not contain a single solution to it's problem sets, only hints - just like the optional problem sets provided by the instructor.\r\n\r\nIf the class is going to introduce proofs, we need to learn how to systematically approach proofs better, and how to extend or generalize the basic examples provided in class.",
                "The range of topics the course covers is excellent. However, given the short time period of the summer, it is hard to fully achieve mastery in any one of the topics discussed. There was definitely a large gap between the problems we encountered on the homework vs. the problems that were on the final exam. If this class is offered again in the Summer, I'm not sure what compromise could be reached between depth and breadth of the topics covered.",
                "I like it overall. There are lots of similar proofs so sometimes classes can feel a little monotonous, but the materials are interesting.",
                "Strengths: at least with the summer version, the homework was not bad at all. For each class we had one problem with 2-4 parts that usually took 2 hours max (although near the end the difficulty ramped up a little). Weaknesses: the course went either super slow (i.e. I could zone out for 5 minutes and come back and totally get what was going on) or super fast (i.e. flipping through slides so fast there wasn't enough to time to take notes AND fully understand the concept). It felt like we wasted a lot of time on some things, and then we raced through other things that we only ended up talking about once. Also, I barely got any feedback on my proofs and compared to MATH 230/231, this class felt a lot less rigorous which was occasionally nice but could also be frustrating.",
                "The discord is super useful, and the material is incredibly engaging. I mean seriously, if you have the time to put in, this course is incredibly enlightening. On the other hand, if you dont have the time, its pretty hard. The exams were consistently harder than problem sets too. In order to solve them, you have to recognize some trick, rather than strictly applying theorems from class. That being said, you learn a LOT. You have to",
                "Weaknesses: This class is not taught very well over the summer; definitely try to get some practice with proofs on your own before taking this class.",
                "The material over all was quite well presented, especially given that it was over zoom. I would have appreciated more feedback from the TA's on homeworks, although I did appreciate seeing other people's answers and I found their office hours really helpful. I also really enjoyed the discord chat as it felt more casual and was a nice way to ask questions outside of class.  \r\n\r\nI know this is a condensed class, so the longer class time is necessary, but I found it to be quite difficult to remain focused the entire time. I really appreciated the 10 min breaks each class.",
                "I wished that the course could have spent more time on some of the more abstract topics we talked about in the class and less time on proofs (not to say no proofs, but perhaps fewer proofs or proofs with a greater influence on the high-level ideas rather than the sometimes tedious algebra). n-dimensional hypercubes, for instance, was a subject that I really liked to work on in the homework (and although I wished we would have spent more time on it) I liked the general pacing of the topic. I do think the amount of time we spent on set/graph theory was appropriate respectfully.",
                "Proofs felt unnecessarily hard to follow at times, but overall the course was very good and I would not change anything major",
                "Cosmin is a very good professor.",
                "This was my second proof-based math class after 225 and while 225 proofs were directly related to theorems learned in class, the proofs in this class were mostly able to be done just using intuition and a basic understanding of combinatoric/graph theory terms. I think these proofs were much more interesting and enjoyable, and sometimes really beautiful once you got the right idea! I am not super convinced that the length of the summer term was conducive to this class since we didnt even get to Ramsey theory or probabilistic method before the final exam, but I really enjoyed learning about combinatorics and graph theory.",
                "I thought the organization of the course could have been better. Often when doing proofs the professor would make so many tangents for things we needed to aid us in the proof that it was hard to understand the central proof we were learning. I also thought that the class could have been much more inclusive. It felt like it catered to the kids that basically already knew the material. I liked how we had a Discord for the class but even that was overrun with the students who knew much more than the majority of the class but would just cloud the server. Even when used for questions it felt like the answers from the professor/some of the students were very passive aggressive so it would make you feel bad to ask any questions on Discord (even though that is what it was set up for). I also think the difficulty of the exams and homework should have been flipped. Often I could finish the homework in an hour or so \r\n(we had one problem due before each class in the summer). I will concede that I worked with a few students but even so the difficulty of the homework was no where near the difficulty of the tests. On both the Midterm and Final the problems were extremely difficult. No where near what what we had done on the homework in terms of difficulty.",
                "Having new homework problems due each session rather than once a week helped with pacing the course and keeping us engaged with the material as it was taught. Lectures were really well delivered as well.\r\n\r\nI will say that the balance between homework and exams felt off. Rather than giving deep and challenging homework and allowing the exams to test more general digestion of the material, the problem sets were rather simple and the exams were made to be as tricky as possible to create variance in grades. It did not feel like the exams tested my knowledge of the class content, instead they required finding clever ways to solve exotic problems under serious time pressure. We were told the exams would be a chance to spend a few hours thinking about combinatorics, but as someone who isnt amazing at problem solving but still wanted to finish the entire exam, I found myself spending ridiculous amounts of time puzzling out every single problem under pressure to get the grade. I recommend giving us more time on the exams or shifting the deep and difficult questions to the problem sets, and using exams to actually test our digestion of the material.",
                "Very interesting and rigorous content. Lectures were very long and sometimes hard to focus on.",
                "I think this course suffered due to the constraints put on it due to the summer session. The condensed period did not grant students enough time to firmly grasp and comprehend the content, and I found it near impossible to stay dialed in and attentive for the entirety of the nearly two and a half hour lectures. While the homework allowed us to apply and draw connections with the content that we had learned in class, I found myself having to rewatch almost every lecture to comprehend the content and the homework questions to formulate a solution. I believe that if this same course were taught in a near-identical structure during a normal semester, it would not only have a lower, more manageable workload, but also grant students a better environment to comprehend the material.",
                "The strengths of the course included the teacher being very good and having 3 TAs who were available and able to help. The weakness of this course was being online and having 35 students or so, making it difficult at times to ask questions or to gain the teacher's undivided attention. Also, sitting for two hours and fifteen minutes learning about intense math was difficult at times.",
                "strength: the professor has tried his best to demo the proof in the class using ipad.  TAs have done a fantastic jobs to answer our questions. :",
                "The course was very well organized, and all the lectures were very engaging! The second half of the class definitely went faster than the first half, so more of a balance might be nice, but I understand this is likely due to the condensed summer session.",
                "This course has a very enthusiastic instructor in Cosmin. The homework problems are well-crafted, and Cosmin's lecture notes are some of the best of any math class at Yale. However, the major weakness of this course is that most of the students were extremely talented former math olympians who skewed expectations extremely high, making the course a nightmare in difficulty for us normal folk. The tests were absolutely insane and required two or three 10-hour days apiece (unless you are an aforementioned former math olympian).",
                "This course does not have many, if any strengths. The only one is that the material is decently interesting and very applicable. As for weaknesses, Cosmin, while nice does not teach the material required to succeed in this class. His homeworks are fair, but sometimes he includes problems which require thinking beyond what is taught and in fact in barely related to class material. The biggest weakness by far are the exams. They are above the level of the homework, which in a proof based math class where you can collaborate on the homework, makes no sense at all. Also they ask pretty crappy questions, not satisfying and some of them aren't  really related to any material being taught. In fact  both exams given had one very easy straight from class question, one question which required a key idea related to class material but extremely tricky to see, one question about a topic covered for less than 20 minutes and could be asked to someone not in the class with the same result, and one question barely related to the material and really just needing a good math background to solve (i.e. you've seen something similar).",
                "This course covers a lot of aspects of different knowledge of Discrete Mathematics. \r\nHowever, this diversity of teaching content leads to some shortcoming in organization of this course. For example, I was confused when I saw one chapter was \"combinatorial number\" in which we learn an arithmetic concept \"n choose k\", while another chapter was \"mathematical induction\" which is one certain way of proving mathematical theorems which can be of any subfield of math. I think the induction method should be an extra which is covered when we  are going through in-class examples. The teacher can use induction method to solve several example problems, so that students can learn how induction method is working and be able to try using it in other problems. putting it separately as one chapter might result in time consumption on some problems which is less related to Discrete Mathematics."

I did not learn anything from the lectures, and the recommended book was not that useful, intended for computer science majors",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student interested in more of the mathematics behind graph theory/discrete math. This course is probably more in-depth than CS 202 (if that is other introductory discrete math course a student is looking into). However, this course is quite difficult even though the only pre-req is \"mathematical maturity\"/MATH 115. It would probably be in the best interest for a student to be introduced to proof-based math before this course but that is oftentimes not possible as students who are taking this course have probably taken MATH 120 (no proof-based math) and either MATH 222 (no proofs) or 225 (some proofs). If you like to think about problems for very long hours then this is the course for you. Taking it during the school year if possible would also be great to give more time to really have the ideas mature in your mind.",
                "Yes if that student is a math major or quite interested in math.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they had to take it for their major (or they're for some reason a graph theory nerd). I personally did not love the content and was not super engaged.",
                "If and only if they have the time and love math. If you do, its way more inspiring than a bunch of epsilon-delta definitions. But if you dont, it can be a real pain.",
                "Yes, if you are confident in your mathematical intuition and proof writing abilities, or are willing to learn. One of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Yale and I will be taking further proof-based math classes! Don't be intimidated by the bad reviews or if your math background is not too high. The highest math class I took was MATH 120, so this is my first proof writing class and I enjoyed it and will probably take higher math proof-based classes now. This class will challenge you to think outside the box and there will be almost no questions based on computation or plug and chug, but instead you have to think hard about how to approach a problem, and often this might require a trick to the problem that comes form a spark of inspiration. To that end, this class is probably best done with a study group to work on p sets together. There were 2 take home exams which are are just longer p sets but without collaboration, it challenges you to formulate solutions on your own and trust your mathematical intuition, which can be a hit or miss depending on if the problem clicks in time and you can realize the trick to the problem.",

                "Yes, this was an enjoyable math class and it gave me confidence to continue doing math at Yale. I especially liked the fact that homework could be done without really memorizing anything and the class seems to be set up to reward good intuition and clever thinking rather than complete understanding of proofs from class or any sort of theorems (there arent many theorems). Cosmin is reasonable, easy to communicate with, and a good professor in my opinion.",
                "Not if Cosmin is teaching. I took it over the summer and it was pretty bad. I always felt good on the homework and would score well and then the tests would be extremely difficult. It should be the other way since you can work with people on the homework and not on the test. On both the midterm and final I took all of the time that was allotted and did not finish either exam. Those two tests destroyed me. Even as someone who had taken math 230/231 before this class the exams were a nightmare. I also felt like the professor did nothing to help with inclusivity in the class. The class seemed to cater exclusively to math competition kids and if you weren't one of them then you felt extremely behind. There was also a situation with the final where the professor decided (on the day that the final was dropped) that if you turned in the final within 24 hours then you would receive 10 extra points. This was extremely stressful. The students who needed those 10 points (myself included) could not finish that final in 24 hours without risking losing significant points. It was a hopeless endeavor and made me feel pretty terrible that those 10 points were unattainable. Also, some of the homework/exam questions felt like they were purposely trying to trick you. It went so far as the professor asking us to prove something untrue on one of the homework assignments and then shooting us down when we asked a question about it.",
                "I would recommend this to anyone interested in math or computer science, or to anyone who wants to improve their problem solving skills. \r\n\r\nAs someone with a decent math background this class was nothing too new, but I will say that the prerequisites may be misleading to anyone who hasnt done proof-based math before. Like sure we quickly go over induction and some other techniques, but youd have to be very motivated to walk into this class with no proof experience and actually do well.",

                "Not unless they need it to graduate. If a student does need this course, it is a great course and very interesting. However, the intellectual difficulty and sheer workload to keep up were so intense, so anyone considering this course should take this into account.",
                "yes. it helps math major students to develop the way to think about logical proofs.",
                "Yes! I'd recommend this course to anyone interested in discrete math, regardless of major.",
                "If the course is taught by a more empathetic instructor who understands that not everyone in the course is a genius, then absolutely. The topics we covered were fascinating and the problem sets were very fun to work through. However, the expectation that anyone (including those who had never seen proofs before) would be able to solve extremely difficult olympiad problems in 5 short weeks was very crushing - perhaps the pacing is better during a normal semester.",
                "I can not recommend this course while Cosmin is teaching it in good faith. The material is super applicable and cool, but Cosmin doesn't ask the right questions to push you to enjoy it. Wait for a better prof to teach this course, then it will rock.",
                "I recommend this course to other students. One can get a grip of a wide range of knowledge of Discrete Mathematics in this course. Also, for it is strongly proof-based, the course can train one's ability to analyze a problem rigorously. This course is a little difficult to learn, but it's worth a try as a challenge."
