                "This course's main weakness was that many of the screenings centered documentaries by and about older white men and women, often by documentarians within the professor's personal network. There was nothing wrong with this inherently, but it often felt very divorced from the work of students in the actual class. In addition, while the visiting artist format was a great portion of the class, some of the visiting artists that came to speak with the class failed to really enrich our understanding of the screened work or our personal practice. It was very helpful to see some of the films about more diverse subject matter, so maybe it would be a better structure if students had to submit their documentary topic during course enrollment and the professor took up the task of curating an invigorated and relevant list of films to screen. If not, the screenings should be optional and the in-class time should be mandatory. In this case, the course could benefit from more structured assignments. They could be small, but still give students a sense of structure as they approach such major projects. Potential assignments could be an opportunity for students to isolate and organize materials that are directly useful for their projects and make progress on filming and editing, whereas the screenings make up 3 hours of class time that could be spent working on our films."
