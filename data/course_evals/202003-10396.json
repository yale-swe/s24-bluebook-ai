                "The readings were a little excessive sometimes. Most weeks I had to look at the list of readings, decide what looked most important, and just skip some of the other stuff. That said, the readings were certainly engaging, helpful, and insightful, and I enjoyed them thoroughly.",
                "This class had great lectures, well-chosen readings, and a grading system that I liked. I appreciated the open-book, 24hr exams and how open-ended the paper was. However, information about those assignments seemed to be always given at the very last minute, so I often felt like I didn't know what was going on or what would be expected of me. Unfortunately, this lack of organization does a disservice to the professor and the topic.",
                "I thought the course could focus more on modern history (which we essentially only covered in the last 2 lectures) and a lecture on current events, which essentially wasn't covered.",
                "History of Brazil was well-organized to cover half a millennia of Brazilian history in a single semester. Lectures were divided both by time period and theme. Professor Schwartz was passionate and extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter, and my TF was communicative and made sections engaging. \r\n\r\nOne aspect of the course which could be improved is its consideration of language. Professor Schwartz would often use both English and Portuguese words for various terms relevant to Brazilian history. This could get confusing, particularly in regards to the topic of race, which is conceived of and described differently in the United States and Brazil. Our lectures and readings were very helpful to understanding the conception of race in Brazil, but discussion about how the language used can influence understanding was largely limited to section.",
                "Strengths: extremely flexible and accommodating, Prof Schwartz is a really friendly and nice guy, TFs were also great. \r\nWeaknesses: would be great if they said upfront that they would provide PDFs of some of the books online (at least the Diacon, which we didn't read much of anyway) so I wouldn't have spent money renting all of them",
                "This course gives you a great survey of Brazilian history, while allowing you to explore a specific topic of your own interest in the final papera great balance between breadth and depth. I felt I left the course feeling a lot more knowledgeable about Brazil (since many enter the course knowing next to nothing about this country that is so often overlooked). I would highly recommend to take this with Professor Schwartz. His lectures were always very engaging.",
                "Prof Schwartz and the TFs were the biggest strength, they were clearly interested in what they were talking about and made the entire class that much more enjoyable",

                "Communication about assignments should be streamlined and organized. It was confusing at times to know the requirements and deadlines of assignments.",
                "Strength: lectures are very good, Schwartz is a great lecturer, very open to office hours\r\nWeaknesses: it might be helpful to have something written on each slides, even if its just the time period. It was sometimes difficult to write down the important info\/ spell things correctly",
                "I really enjoyed this course. It's a straight-up history class with no weird stuff or formats. I'd strongly recommend it. If I were to change one thing, it'd be to extend the amount of time talking about modern Brazil. Alternatively, restricting the timeframe of the course to end in 1960 or so would also work.",
