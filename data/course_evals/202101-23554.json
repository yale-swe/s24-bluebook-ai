                "This class was listed as a seminar but was more of a lecture. The professor seemed a little disorganized and the course material did not always relate to environmental issues. The final paper for the class was announced a week before it was due and it would have been nice to have known the requirements on the syllabus or at least a few weeks before.",
                "The strength is the subject. It's a field of study that is growing ever more complicated, relevant, and interesting. There were several weaknesses of this course. It's a very disorganized class. The readings were all thrown into one folder and we often got our reading list 4-6 days before the seminar. The lecture slides were challenging to follow because it seemed to have no structure. The 'seminar' is like a lecture so you listen to Professor Swenson talk for an hour and then listen to your peers present for another. I think this class can be improved if these things are addressed. Also, the short essay instructions were very vague and he only sent me them after I asked. It would have been helpful to see a few student examples too. Overall, I think the class just needs more structure and more opportunities to discuss (like in a seminar).",
                "Strengths: the readings were incredibly interesting. The paper assignments were also great exercises in helping you think about the weekly topic more deeply\r\nWeaknesses: would have enjoyed more class discussion, since most of the class is spent as a lecture or listening to student presentations",
                "It's hard to stay engaged in this course because it's half lecture, half student presentations. There is little to no participation outside of the two presentations a semester.",
                "Strengths: well-structured and covered a wide variety of topics. Had something that suited everyones interests - from ecology to religion to finance\r\nWeaknesses: while there are no major weaknesses with the course per se in my view, I would say a great addition to the course would be expanding the role of discussion among students in each seminar.",
                "I feel that Professor Swenson could offer more opportunities for students to consult him on the feedback given for assignments",
                "I think lectures could have been a bit more engaging and interactive. I found that if I wasn't presenting or asking questions to the presenters, many of us didn't get to speak in the seminar."

I was not able to get much out of class because it was more like a lecture than a seminar. Also the slides were very confusing because no \"content\" slide was given so figures and words were just thrown at us. Moreover, Professor Swenson was often confused about why he put certain things in his slide deck so he was essentially winging every single class. Overall, the class did not meet my expectations even though I really wanted it to.",
