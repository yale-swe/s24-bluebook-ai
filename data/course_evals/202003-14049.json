                "This course was basically a survey of the history of television (mostly in the US) mostly in terms of the social development and implications surrounding TV and more modern media. Topics specifically included some theory about TV as a medium, race and gender on TV, the theoretical \"flow\" of TV, the transition from the TV set to streaming online, and more.",

An ability to apply scholarly frameworks to the things that we watch on a day to day basis and understand why they have persisted. Prof. Shechtman also provides very detailed feedback on papers and argument construction, which is very helpful.",

                "Every part of this course was done pretty well I would say. The required screenings were all interesting and well-placed within our discussions.",
                "Most days we would struggle to cover both of the days readings throughly and therefore I think it would have been valuable to focus more closely on just one reading a day. Furthermore, I believe it would have been helpful to go over the desired format for the essays more heavily to make the prompts and instructions clearer.",
                "We watched some great example episodes and clips to give context for the theory we were learning and Professor Shechtman always worked hard to make clear exactly what in our often convoluted readings was important. We also always had good conversation because the topic lent itself well to personal anecdotes. One weakness, already semi-mentioned, is that the readings were pretty convoluted VERY DENSE. It was often hard to figure out what exactly we should be getting from the text and how it related to the screenings for the week. We also often did in-class activities that involved doing a lot of complicated textual analysis in a very short amount of time and then having to present informally on the spot for our classmates. I found these activities quite challenging and rarely felt like I got much out of the text in that context.",
                "Learning about the history of television and how its come to be was really fun and interesting. All I could think of to improve the course would be more tv episodes from a particular series, maybe watching a whole miniseries or something along those lines.",
                "Strength is getting many different views on the same topic",
                "It is unbelievable. Prof. Shechtman is such an expert about the material and it is a topic\/field that everyone loves in their own ways. There is so much of an opportunity to interact with classmates, too, each of whom has a different personal relationship with television.",
                "The strength of this course comes from the discussions we had about the materials we viewed and read. Another strength comes from how interconnected television is; allowing us to explore the influence of television closely.",
                "strenght: professor is young and able to explain the material in an interesting and relevant way",
                "I appreciated the teaching style and discussions, but I would had liked to watch and analyze more film during class time."
