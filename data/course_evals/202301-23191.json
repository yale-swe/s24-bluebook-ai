                "strengths: she follows her slides and the class is very well organzied",
                "Honestly, this class is very strong in general, I think more randomization of the quizzes will hold students more accountable to come to class, but Professor Kinane also understands how students work and makes it clear that fostering learning is the priority.",
                "Learning about the political science theories was interesting, but sometimes the course felt like a refresher of content that many of us had already learned in high school U.S. history and government classes.",
                "Strengths: Very engaging lectures and readings, ability to drop two reading quizzes if necessary\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes an unfeasible amount of reading was given for the week, but this didn't happen very often",
                "strengths: very fair class (put in the work and get rewarded), covered a lot of topics that all related to each other nicely, really dug into each topic and each topics relevance was clear by the end of the discussion, final exam set-up was very fair and mitigated a lot of anxiety while still allowing students to really feel as though they've learned the material (my studying/preparation allowed me to see my knowledge come together and fill in any gaps I had)\r\n\r\nweaknesses: section probably not necessary for this course",
                "I think this course is set up very nicely and the material is very manageable. It can feel a lot like AP Gov in the beginning of the class, but it gets better towards the end.",
                "ICON CHRISTINA KINANE. FLAWLESS. QUEEN. AMAZING.",
                "The main strength for me were sections, which I found always engaging. Lectures were sometimes boring, we were assigned an obnoxious amount of readings every week that we sometimes never went over or mentioned. The format of the exams is a bit odd.",
                "Teacher was amazing!",
                "Strengths: lectures were pretty well done and content was communicated very well. the course load was not bad at all and grading was very lenient. It's pretty gutty.\r\nWeakness: sometimes the material felt repetitive and hard to engage in since it's stuff we have talked about in history/social science classes for most of our lives (assuming you're American). if you're an international student who is unfamiliar with the American political system then maybe you would gain a lot from this course",
                "Strengths: This course is well organized. The lectures are all super interesting. Kinane is an amazing lecturer. Overall, there are so many strengths of this course!\r\nWeaknesses: There is a LOT of reading, often more than one can realistically complete. I think it would be helpful if the reading was only given in excerpts or if it would be decreased. Also, there are a lot of differences in the TA sections, as some TAs discussed readings while others discussed the material from the lecture.",
                "Strengths- It was a very interesting course (even though it is foundational) and the professor is truly incredible! The quizzes were really fine and all you have to do is skim each reading for the main idea and a few of its important aspects). The lectures were engaging and the final was kind because you knew all of the questions and were basically encouraged/motivated to engage with the material. Most of all, I loved the professors' energy and enthusiasm! The professor cared about our success.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Every section was handled differently and I did not appreciate that more people got material reviews than others (who simply read outside readings that had little to do with the substantive content of the class and what we were tested on for midterms/final). I would have appreciated better review sessions (both for the section and before the midterm) in which we went over what we had covered in the past week. \r\nThere was no feedback on the essay and little help at all from the TFs. That was disappointing.\r\nNo feedback on the midterm either. All we learned was the grade.\r\nIt was hard to improve.",
                "No weaknesses I can think of. The overall scope of the course was amazing. The professor was phenomenal and showed so much commitment to teaching the material, and the teaching assistant was on top of his game.",
                "Weakness: lectures are extremely repetitive, slower learning environment than some of my high school classes.",
                "Strengths: It's a gut. You'd enjoy it if you like reading social science papers without thinking too deeply about them.\r\nWeaknesses: Terrible lecturer who treated students like elementary-age childrenI will die happy if I never hear the phrase \"you are budding political scientists\" ever again. I fell asleep in 80% of the lectures, and my masochistic self attended every one of them, unlike a full two-thirds of the class. We are encouraged to do the bare minimum, by which I mean skip the textbook entirely and skim the papers in the ten minutes before class. The ridiculous weekly reading quizzes did not motivate genuine engagement with the course. Final exam answers were given out beforehand like candy. The paper was an exercise in futility and sections were a joke that falls flat and no one laughs. This entire semester, not a single student was challenged to think about a single interesting question, and we did little else besides parroting findings from random research papers.",
                "The course is impeccable and covers a wide range of topics. I believe the course can evolve and actually talk more about slavery and its repercussions on American politics",
                "Strengths: Having laid back quizzes and assignments\r\nWeaknesses: Having in-person exams as opposed to more paper assignments",
                "The quizzes were great commitment mechanisms and the readings were not overwhelming.",
                "The largest strength was the professor. Very charismatic and straight forward,",
                "Kind of a boring class overall. Professor of super nice though and accommodating of your needs.",
                "I appreciated that I always knew the expectations for the class and doing the readings and having engagement correlated directly with doing well. However, I wish that our final exam had been a take home essay, because I think I would have done better work that way.",
                "This professor was very engaging and you can see she is passionate about what she teaches. Also, the pop quizzes arent as scary as they may seem when you see them on the syllabus if that worries you at all (usually they are one or two questions and just based on the weeks reading, and we got a heads up a few days before, which I very much appreciated.) We also had an open-book final, which I also appreciated.",
                "This is truly an excellent course. Its very well organized I just wish we got back feedback on our essays and exams.",
                "I felt that the lectures were very engaging. I just wished that the readings were more evenly spread out and lectures were posted.",
                "I thought the course was great.",
                "Strength is the practicality of the course.",
                "The strengths of this course are the ground that it covers, not only do we learn about formal systems, but we learn about the political landscape as a whole when we study media and public opinion. If you think about it, they could be their own classes separate from the three branches of government and the constitution. It sets a prospective American Government student up really well. The kinds of readings is another strength, not only to we analyze theory, but we look at social science and political science research. The only weakness was the speed at which we covered everything (one lecture per topic) and the amount of reading associated with each topic. Not in that the amount of reading was too much, but given the time frame to master each topic, it felt like a lot.",
                "Honestly, isn't much I would change. It is structured to force students to study but rewards effort with the grade.",
                "Strengths include the breadth of topics covered, the quiz commitment mechanism encouraging students to do the readings, and Professor Kinanes incredible teaching style. Some weaknesses are that the lectures recaps can feel repetitive, the pop quizzes can be stressful, and section can be boring when other students havent done all the readings. The course might be improved by skipping content recaps to instead go over the content in more depth the first time around and increasing the number of quizzes but providing warnings for when all quizzes will take place/what readings they will be on. Alternatively, keep the current quiz framework but encourage section leaders to cold call more so that the few students who have done the readings arent the only ones talking.",
                "Tying course to current issues in the US would be a great idea. :)",
                "This course was extremely helpful because of an enthusiasm surrounding it in lecture and in readings which made me think harder and more diligently about politics in a way I hadnt before.",
                "The course is nicely set up and the professor does a wonderful job of preparing students for the exams!\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course is that the lecture slides can begin to feel a bit repetitive throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: lecture is engaging and informative and the discussion sections are very insightful\r\nWeakness: I cant think of one",
                "The course was very easy to understand and remain engage."

                "Yes if you need it for a pre-requisite (EP&E or political science). If you want a gut then this is also a pretty good one. If you are actually interested in political science then I'm sure there are better courses offered that have more interesting info.",
                "Especially as an international student, this course proved useful to introduce a survey of US politics. However, I wouldn't take this course if you're a junior or senior.",

                "Yes, I would recommend it overall. I really enjoyed the content and the professor and I feel better prepared to take more advanced political science courses. I believe people from any major can benefit from this course. However, only take it if you are interested. I would not call it a real gut simply because of the reading load. Also section isn't that great. Take it for Kinane and for the substantive content! And the relatively fair assignments.",
                "Yes. Take this class regardless of how much you care about politics. The material is relevant to everyone, and the material is taught from a non biased lens. Professor Kinane is awesome and is understanding of the stresses of student life, and adjusts the class to allow everyone to succeed. As long as you care you will do will in the class.",
                "Yes.",
                "I absolutely do not recommend this class to any serious student of American politics. It's an absolute waste of time. Lectures are a farce, you don't need to go to them. If you want to debate the pros and cons of, for example, dynamic/rigid Supreme Court interpretations, then take a class focused on the topic and do not go to section, where we rehash the same tired concept over and over for 50 minutes and then call it quits. Writing the paper will not teach you to think about a topic any more deeplyit's more of an exercise in how well you can regurgitate and cite the social science papers the class read on the topic. It is close to the worst class I've taken at Yale. At least it was easy.",

The discussion portion of the class will probably be more fun because you may have the background knowledge solidified, and can explore it in a deeper way in this class. For those who have not taken AP US Gov, (myself) this is also really great because you get a great foundation for interpreting American Politics.",

Her belief in student success shows in her efforts to engage with students in class and at office hours, continually offering to provide personalized book suggestions and answer any questions. The course content is extremely interesting, and I learned a ton of new information. Its highly relevant to current times and provides useful commentary on our current political atmosphere.",
                "Probably not, unless a student has very little understanding of American politics/history.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, regardless of major, because I think you take more from it than most other courses at Yale. This course is fundamental for civics and will help those in it get a better grasp of the American political structure around them.",
                "Yes, Professor Kinane is a wonderful lecturer and she is always so enthused about learning and teaching! I would recommend taking this course if one is interested in learning about the American political system and the varying interactions between the branches of government.",
                "I definitely would because the way the course is taught it encourages learning rather than just cramming and trying to get a good grade.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who wishes to have a broad introduction to politics in the United States.",
                "Yes, I learned a lot of important information and was excited to learn."
