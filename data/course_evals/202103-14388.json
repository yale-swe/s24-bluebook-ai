                "In terms of strengths, I appreciated the very detailed syllabus since it was essentially a roadmap for each day and was very explicit in how students could prepare for it. On the other hand, I did not appreciate the multiple quizzes at the very beginning of the semester. It felt very unfair, especially for someone in my situation, to come into an elementary-level language class and be expected to grasp grammar rules and score well on quizzes.",
                "Strengths: You will learn a lot of Spanish in a short period of time. It is very rewarding to gradually begin to understand more complicated phrases and the nuances of the language, and I thought the course did a great job of forcing me to practice my Spanish on a regular basis. Very well-organized course.\r\nWeaknesses: Although the course was solid, it seemed quite intensive and difficult for people who had never been exposed to Spanish before. I think the accessibility of the professor and small class size really helps with this.\r\nImprovements: Although the course moves fast for good reason, it would be nice to have more time to master concepts.",
                "I enjoyed the asynchronous days a lot, as well as the lack of a final exam. This made learning more enjoyable for all students, and less pressurized. The in class activities were fun.\r\n\r\nSome weaknesses was that there was a lot of homework per day and grammar points were taught too fast.",
                "The main weakness in this course is how fast we go/how much content we cover in a semester. It is difficult to retain and study it all and if you miss one piece, it messes you up for the next unit. The main strength is that we are encouraged to practice sentence structures in compositions and class conversations.",

I get that it seems intimidating at first, and the workload is a little heavy, but the course is very engaging.",
                "Definitely a good route to get language requirements done, as it efficiently teaches you spanish and isnt too hard.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who is enthusiastic about learning Spanish. If you are not motivated to learn and genuinely care about learning the language it will be quite painful.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in learning Spanish from scratch and are prepared for the heavy workload.",
                "I would if they want to learn Spanish and take it seriously for future study abroad trips or certification. However, if it's just another language to pick up after you're already certified in a different one, I do not recommend it.",
                "Yes I would. I had a great instructor and the material learned gave me a good basic understanding of the language"
