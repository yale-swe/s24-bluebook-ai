   "comments": [
    "I learned a ton in this course. Brill proves that journalism CAN be profitable, and helps the class get internships in journalism if that's what they desire. If you get into this course, TAKE IT!",
    "I grew a lot as a reporter, and learned how to report on a long-form story while handling dozens of sources and research.",
    "The journalism business and how to focus on narrative story telling",
    "This seminar was phenomenal. I improved as a writer, journalist, and investigator. The class was engaging, the discussions were lively, and I had a thoroughly enjoyable time.",
    "My biggest takeaway from this class was learning how to approach journalism and life with sustained curiosity. When I'm going about my everyday life, seeing and reading and experiencing, I'll notice things and ask \"why\" when before they would have just slipped by unnoticed. It's really rewarding, and I really believe in Brill's take that it's a fundamental outlook to have if you're looking to be a journalist. \r\n\r\nIt was also valuable to be able to tackle some big projects condensing someone's life essence into 2,000 words, writing a 4,000 word feature article and learn by doing. There definitely wasn't a lot of support from the professor, but even just doing these assignments was valuable for developing my writing and structuring abilities.",
    "This is a great course to learn about the skills of journalism: interviews, writing, framing, etc. It is also a super experience to be taught by one of the greats in the journalism world, Steven Brill. He also has access to a huge alumni network that really comes in handy if your looking for a job in journalism.",
    "learned about business of journalism, how to conduct interviews, journalism ethics",
    "Learned about the practice and practicals of journalism. Basic structuring\/reporting techniques, as well as an overview of the business and general prospects of the journalism industry. The course is definitely intended as a sort of how-to guide for journalism, and in that it succeeds. It's a bit more like a trade class than a pie-in-the-sky intellectual deal, but that was honestly a refreshing change compared to a lot of Yale courses.",
    "I learned many practical skills as a journalist.",
    "I developed an intuition about how to approach journalistic decisions. I learned about how to make my writing more concise. I also learned a lot about what makes a good piece of journalism."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Brill. He's such a great professor. He can pick on you but it's not out of meanness -- he's just dedicated to making sure that you're doing a good job. Could be improved by making the readings (there's a lot) more relevant to the class. But when we meet just 2 hours a week, it can be hard to fit it all in.",
    "I wish we could have discussed the readings a bit more! But I do love how it forced all of us to write and report rigorously.",
    "I love the assignments for this course, and seminar was genuinely very enjoyable for this course. I think we could discuss the readings more and discuss them more for their journalistic value as opposed to their content.",
    "i think my writing and confidence in my abilities both improved a lot under Professor Brill's guidance. There are quite a few readings, and you really do have to do them carefully, but they're always interesting and very relevant to the class discussion. The assignments are demanding, but really fun as well  especially the profile. i have made  some really good friends from this class!",
    "Strengths - The assignments were good, although I wish we also spent a little bit of time writing more \"newsy\" pieces too. We cover a lot of practical, helpful material in the class, including discussions on journalism business models and how to structure an interview.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Brill's seminar style is alternating between talking and cold-calling people to give him the right answer. I wish we were able to have more fruitful discussions on topics like ethics in interviews and even how we plan on approaching journalism in the future.",
    "weakness: I wish we got more detailed, critical feedback on our drafts. I wish it had more assignments so we could come out of it with more experience writing longform pieces. I think there's room for 3 assignments instead of 2. (maybe less time for profiles at beginning?) I wish class discussions were more focussed. \r\n\r\nstrengths: assignments are great. reading is amazing. brill makes himself very available to you",
    "Strengths: The people in the class are pretty great, the readings are incredible, the class sets you up for journalism internships\/YJI support, and the two main projects are really fun and interesting to do. Also Brill will usually put on an event with his NYC journalism friends, who are really high-level and have a lot of great advice to dispense. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class sessions themselves can feel stale at times since Brill's style is to cold-call on people rather than fostering open discussion. I do wish there was a bit more space for people to discuss the admittedly fascinating stuff we read. Also wish we received a bit more feedback on our writing, but I think that's also a function of how much you seek it out.",
    "Strengths: The class was well-organized. Professor Brill was passionate about the subject, and so were my classmates, which made for lively class discussions. We only had two assignments, both of which were interesting and challenged me.\r\nWeaknesses: We had a lot of readings, some of which were never referred to in class. I also wish I received more detailed feedback from Professor Brill.",
    "One strength was that the readings were well-thought out and reinforced the concepts and themes of the course well.",
    "Most everything about this course is a strength, with Brill and the two writing projects being the most prominent. Brill is just wonderful, harsh at times but most always well-meaning. He cares more deeply about the class of students than nearly any other Yale professor I have had. He is sharp, witty, careful, and exceedingly generous to his students. He gives thoughtful feedback on drafts and final products alike. He wants you to succeed, will tell you when you do, will remind you when you aren't, but all because he knows the potential of his students. It's a serious class, and you must do all the readings, make all the deadline, and never come late to class, but if you follow his clear, particular directions, you will come out of this class with two long writing samples which he and you both feel deeply proud of. The final project, which takes up the entire second half of the semester, is a long article on any topic of your choosing. It's an opportunity to have time set aside to really take on a writing project you've been thinking about."

   "comments": [
    "This class is a very good one overall. Professor Brill is committed to his students, and the workload is challenging. I wish we did more writing (we only did two pieces) and got more direct and detailed feedback along the way while writing both of them. However, I learned a lot of practical little things about practicing journalism.",
    "Absolutely. If you get into this course, TAKE IT!!!! Take it just because of Brill -- he's dedicated to making sure we get jobs in journalism.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course to students interested in pursuing journalism as a career.",
    "Absolutely  whether they want to do journalism for ever or just for a semester.",
    "100%. Especially if you are pursuing journalism\/publishing\/any career that involves writing (which is most careers).",
    "Yes, I had a lot of fun in it primarily because the other students in the class were fantastic, sharp, and soulful human beings, and a lot of us got really close. Good journalism makes for really fantastic required reading. And I did learn a lot about aspects of journalism I hadn't thought a lot before, and some of the readings and discussions about the craft of journalism are never going to leave me.",
    "After reading tons of negative course reviews about this class, I was hesitant to apply. People said that Brill was quite aggressive and, by some definitions, mean to his students. This is so not true. Brill certainly does not pull punches, and he certainly write a quite curt email, but he is not a mean man and not a harsh teacher. He will say some things that come across somewhat aggressive, but that is not a reason to fail to apply to his class. As one alum said of him on a class visit: \"he's a dick; but he's one of the most kind-hearted, generous people in the world..\" He truly cares about making students better writers and truly cares about improving the wider world of journalism. He makes a promise to every student in the class that he will get them a job in journalism if they want it. He stands by that. Not to mention Brill is one of the most well-respected journalists in the industry right now. If you are even mildly interested in journalism, you should definitely take this class.",
    "absolutely! a great intro to journalism. it won't improve your writing (take a different nonfiction class for that.) but it will improve your research skills, critical analysis, organization, understanding of journalism, etc",
    "Yes! Take it if you're interested in journalism. It is one of the very few classes where you learn the practicals of reporting and is generally quite enjoyable, and getting to join the YJI and get help with internships\/jobs is huge.",
    "Yes! Professor Brill is excellent, and I greatly enjoyed the class.",
    "Yes, this course not only helped me understand more about the current landscape of journalism, but also improved my writing and reporting skills.",
    "Definitely. If you already know you want to be a journalist, this course will again and again remind you why. If you aren't sure, this course will probably convince you. It's different week-to-week, most of the readings are just great, and the written work you produce (with the final being about 15 pages) makes it all feel so worthwhile. Brill is a wonderful mentor, though strict at times, but anyone at Yale, writers in particular, would be lucky to learn from him and with the other students he chooses."
