Leaving this course, I am conversational, can write short essays, speak with native speakers, and read simple books  all in Spanish.

There is a lot of work that solidifies your reading and writing abilities in Spanish; however, I feel that there should be more elements of speaking and listening to keep up with the comprehension level.",
                "The course was definitely demanding in terms of time investment, but that's necessary to learn a new language. I think the course could be improved by adding homework worksheets because they would force students to practice the grammar concepts we learned.",
                "This course is meant to really force you to learn Spanish with the amount of daily work. I think I learned so much from it. However, that could also be a weakness because there was assignments in multiple places which caused me to miss some of them and turn them in late.",
