I learned how to analyze sociological theories and writings, in addition to putting reasoning behind everyday phenomenons of lived experience.",

I also learned a lot about how to synthesize information accurately to make a claim, without picking and choosing from sources. The reviews we did were challenging but I think that I learned a lot about how to use other knowledge to relate to new information and ask specific questions from there.",

                "I would say one weakness was keeping the engagement at some points because the lecture style became a little bit hard to concentrate sometimes, but a major strength of this course was definitely the professor and TAs in the course. They sighted such a great environment for learning and improving writing skills.",
                "Strengths: The content, on paper, is interesting. I also liked the easygoing nature of the class. \r\nWeaknesses: Assignments and assessments feel like high-school type busywork. Doing the review papers and quizzes was endlessly confusing due to the lack of guidance and even contradictory instructions from the teaching staff. The class overall felt disorganized, my TF was nearly as clueless as we were about assignments (although she was self aware about it), and I felt like lectures repeated the readings rather than giving new insights.\r\n\r\nFor the papers specifically, the instructions were massively unclear: we were told to use outside evidence, but not rely on it; to provide our own opinions, but not be too opinionated; to write out a thoughtful critique, but only in 2-3 pages; and this only for 5% of our grades each! As opposed to the quizzes, on which I spent less than 1 hour, but are somehow worth twice that. The effort vs effect on our grades is disproportional. \r\n\r\nThe general feeling for me and a lot of people that I've talked to is that this is a very mediocre course. I don't feel like the feedback I ever got was helpful, and I certainly don't feel like what I learned in this class is stuff that I couldn't have gotten out of a book about the class' topics.",
                "Lectures are very clear and straightforward, though I can tell that Professor Kao's lecture style would have been more engaging in person. One weakness is the actual slides Professor Kao uses and shares, because they have little information on them that help guide the lectures. Additionally, discussion sections would have been more engaging if there was prompted discussion instead of a reflection over the readings.",
                "Lectures are really fun in this class. Professor Kao lets discussion flow naturally, even though it's mostly her talking. She gauges student energy well and will let us explore another topic if we have questions. Section also really helped us to clarify anything we didn't understand and discuss readings to be sure we interpreted them accurately. I can't think of anything that needs improvement.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kao and the TFs were amazing - both were super helpful and willing to answer any questions about the content or any assignment. In addition, they were understanding of the unusual situations brought upon by COVID and flexible enough to allow students to thrive despite the circumstances. Section, though lacking in structure, was more fun that way as it allowed us as students to bring what we needed\/wanted to discuss to the table rather than being forced into discussing a topic we didn't enjoy over zoom. \r\nWeaknesses: Content could go a little more in-depth, though I guess this is nitpicking since it is an intro level course. Some assignments could use extra guidance - perhaps some sort of memo that provided instructions on how to complete the assignment rather than waiting for the students to ask about it.",
                "I liked that this course had very intriguing readings and research that pertained to the discussion topics. I thought that all that we learned was applicable to the real world, given the amount of critical analysis that students had to learn.",
                "I loved the mini quiz and mini essays format of this course. It wasn't overwhelming and it served as checkpoints to make sure I caught up and genuinely understood what we were learning. The only thing I'd say to improve is the instructions for the mini essays; I was totally lost on what to do for the first one and I appreciated my teachers being very available to explain and help me out but I think there should be a document with tips on organization to begin with",
                "This was unfortunately the most disorganized course I have ever taken. We didn't keep up with the module plan and I was always confused about which module we were supposed to be in and which readings were due. It made it really difficult to stay organized mentally with the different course material. I also felt like there wasn't much information in most of the lectures, and a lot of time was wasted in breakout rooms that were unhelpful. For the lack of material we learned, I was shocked about how many assignments there were in this class. Four review papers, four quizzes, a video project, and a long final paper felt like far too much. Also, throughout the semester, there was never clarification about the expectations for the review papers and many of us felt repeatedly confused.",
                "The strengths of this course were the content of lectures, the readings, and the assignments. Professor Kao and the TFs were also big strengths for this course!\r\n\r\nI think one weakness of this class is that sometimes lectures and readings didn't match up with what was on the syllabus. I sometimes ended up doing a reading a week early, or showing up to class with no clue I was supposed to have done the reading. It would have been really helpful to have more clear communication about what was actually required each week.",
                "All strengths little to no weaknesses.",
                "The topic and the progression of the material were great but I wish that we were taught to think more critically. The assignments only allowed us to regurgitate information rather than to think cricfally.",
                "I think that this class was very disorganized. It was hard to know what readings we should be doing for what date and the assignments were very unstructured. I never knew what was expected and it seemed as if the teacher and the TA did not have a clear set of expectations either. It always seemed as if they were not on the same page, with different people saying different information. However, they were all very sweet and the material was engaging.",
                "Many of the lectures were a repeat of the readings, but the readings were very interesting.",
                "This course did well to give students both a historical and modern overview of major topics in the field of sociology. I felt that the lectures did well to disseminate a large amount of information within a limited amount of time. I also felt that students had many opportunities to form their own thoughts and opinions around the material and to express them in written and verbal formats. I do wish that there had been more opportunity for collaborative work, but I understand that this was hard given the virtual format.",
                "Strength: the live recorded lectures were great because I could always go back and review. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I though the course would be a bit more interesting if we had a module or section to think about solutions or what people are doing about these disparities.",
                "One strength of this course was the organization of the course. The layout of all the topics and discussions was extremely beneficial for learning. One weakness was that there were not many breakout room discussions to virtually interact with my peers.",
                "The strengths are that there were a healthy variety of assignments with each taking a fraction of your grade rather than a large chunk. A weakness is that there was little guidance for the final paper and it was difficult to figure out how to complete it properly.",
                "Strengths: Content presented in an interesting and engaging way. \r\nWeakness: Not a lot of guidance on the critical reviews we needed to write",
                "The topics are relevant, important, and delivered in a very engaging manner. The response papers were useful in helping us engage with the text (I do think the course would benefit from having 3 response papers instead of 4). I can't really think of weaknesses, the course was truly great with a wonderful professor, fantastic TAs and a really great community of my classmates.",
                "Some parts of the course seem rather intuitive and not that interesting compared to others. One of the strengths is that instructors were very considerate of students",
                "This class was a significant amount of reading, but the assignments were not stressful, and the final and group projects were well explained and graded I felt correctly and fairly. Having recorded lectures of the class was nice to have all of the information available at all times, and the way discussion sections were run because of COVID, at least with my TF, were ideal for this uncertain time.",
                "strengths-\r\n- discussion\/section was really helpful in understanding the readings more \r\n\r\nweaknesses-\r\n- it was hard to keep track of what the professor was talking about in class, the slides\/info went too quickly and you wouldn't be able to take notes"

                "Having synchronous lectures with an asynchronous recorded option is definitely the best way to go for large lectures during this pandemic. It was a successful format that allowed students to engage real-time but also allowed students who couldn't join live to catch up with the recorded lectures. Professor Kao also encouraged cameras but never required them which was also great in my opinion as it took a lot of pressure off technical difficulties amidst virtual learning.",
                "I think this course was perfect given the circumstances, I think we could have had more movie nights after class since I couldn't make the one we did have and I know many other people in our class couldn't either.

Not only is Prof. Kao incredibly disorganized, I feel like she passes on little to no information down to her TFs, which then means that, week after week, students are confused about what the reading was for that day, what's due when, and how to write those review papers. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I took this *lecture* class so that I wouldn't have to speak up during *lecture*. While this may be an unpopular opinion, the surprise breakout groups (for making presentations) were a big bummer for me and kind of a classic cop out.\r\n\r\nAvoid this class if you like clear assignments and meaningful feedback.\r\n\r\nI'm a senior and this is hands down the worst class I've taken at Yale.",
                "Yes. Whether or not you have an affinity towards race, ethnicity, and immigration, the course material is highly engaging and applicable to every day life. Professor Kao is hilarious and invested in her students, and her knowledge is greater than what could be covered in a single semester.",
                "Yes, I think this is an important class. It would be good for society for people to know how systemic inequality impacts people. Also understanding race as a construct that changes over time was something that was solidified for me in this course so I would recommend it to people interested in that. In general, I would tell my friends to take it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student seeking an intro-level sociology or ER&M course. It will provide you with a nice foundation of knowledge and Professor Kao is not only very knowledgeable but just a great person in general.",
                "This course was really engaging and provides a lot of introduction to sociological phenomenons.",
                "Yes! Grace Kaos class covers a lot of the basics (ie. definition of race and ethnicity, race-related issues like health and education) so I'd recommend it for both humanities and STEM kids. It teaches things that everyone should know and be aware of to check their privilege, recognize racial disparities, and understand their own experiences in a sociological and historical lens. All the quizzes were open note and we had a lot of freedom with the last essay to explore something we were interested  in, and my ta was super helpful!",
                "No. This class was terribly formatted and had a disproportionately large amount of work for how little we actually learned.",
                "Absolutely! I think everyone at Yale should take this course. I learned so much about society and the discourse about various aspects of ethnicity, race, or migration (particularly in the US) which has definitely impacted my understanding of the world; I think everyone needs to have this experience.",
                "Yes this was the best course I took this semester.",
                "Yes! A great introduction into issues of race, ethnicity, and immigration.",
                "I definitely would recommend it as an introductory course for the material.",
                "not really. It was interesting but I think there are better classes out there that will do the same thing",
                "The readings were really interesting and gave you a better understanding about what race is and how we define it throughout our lives.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning how ethnicity and race are connected to a variety of economic and social issues. It is very eye-opening in a lot of ways, and prompts students to question the institutions that they are a part of.",
                "If you have no idea or what to learn more about how race affects life in the United States, take the class.",
                "Yes, I think this course introduces and emphasizes many important topics that all students should be aware of about race, ethnicity, and immigration.",
                "Yes, I feel that this course is very relevant in today's society, and the information that you learn will be beneficial for you outside of school.",
                "Yes this course gives you a great overall understanding of sociological topics in ethnicity race and migration.  These topics are really interesting and relevant.",
                "Yes!!!! This class covers very interesting and important topics and I highly recommend taking it! Discussions with classmates were interesting and Professor Kao and our TAs were fantastic.",
                "Yes, I thought it was a solid course, but at the same time I wasn't blown away.",
                "No, I found the lectures unengaging since they were loaded with graphs and sociology research rather than concepts that could help us better understand the material we were reading.",
                "Yes if you are not an ERM major, or haven't taken other classes like ERM, because it doesn't really offer too much new information. If you are, it can be an easier credit (except for the reading load), but also kind of boring.",
                "Yeah! It was a pretty great class for an introduction\/explanation to a lot of topics that are covered within sociology and ethnicity, race, and migration."
