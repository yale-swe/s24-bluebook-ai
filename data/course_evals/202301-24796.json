                "The biggest takeaway was that we got a really strong grounding in the philosophical roots of the multiple analytical threads we were using to study technology.",
                "I learned SO much in this course. I learned about affect theory, and how it applies to ideas of embodiment and perception. I learned about how the field of anthropology focuses on identity and the ontological turn (aka how we think about the world). These theoretical texts were interspersed with really interested ethnographies of these theories in action. They were required to understand and provide analytical frameworks for understanding robots later on, and why they are so eerily human, and what they mean about the future of our modern society. We also studied some of their current applications in social robots in Japan, along with other work in Science and Technology Studies (STS)."

                "It would have been more interesting to dive into robots\/technology earlier in the course. The class title sounds super interesting but we spend 11 weeks learning about affect, embodiment, phenomenologywhich is overall very abstract and academic. I wish we spent more time learning about actual technology \/ robots \/ use cases of these technologies, as that is what I was expecting when I signed up for the class.",
                "It was a strong course with strong readings.",
                "Very supportive professor who cares about her students. Also well-structured in terms of deadlines.\r\nCould be very confusing and dense especially at the beginning, but material begins to make sense as we move further into the semester. It comes together beautifully at the end.",
                "Strengths: Professor Aronsson is absolutely brilliant and caring, the grad students really up the intellectual rigor and excitement of what you learn, the homework is extremely reasonable (just 200 word reading responses each week), the content is incredibly interesting and topical and engaging (rethinking your relationship with technology)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: beginning of the course is rather theory heavy, although it is balanced out with a few ethnographies. This class might be difficult for a student without any prior anthropological knowledge of concepts like agency. At the same time, Professor Aronsson does a great job of explaining complicated concepts in a simple, easy to grasp manner, which makes this one of the best intro courses into anthropology, in my opinion."

                "Yes! Its a lot of work but its been very rewarding! Make sure to allocate that this requires a lot of time for thinking through. Freshmen would die in this class.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! TAKE THIS COURSE! This was one of the BEST courses I've taken at Yale with one of the most brilliant professors I've met at this university. Professor Aronsson is absolutely brilliant, sweet, caring ... she speaks like 7 languages, is doing cutting edge work on the edge of STS, and is super supportive and caring to her students, and won't hesitate to find time to meet with you during office hours. I entered every single class with a clear mind and exited mind-blown quite a lot of the time. A lot of what we learned really challenged my understandings of our relationships with emerging technologies, and also gave me the anthropological background to better understand how to engage and critically reflect upon them."
