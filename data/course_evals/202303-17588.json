While the professor's structured introduction of topics sometimes limited the freedom of the discussion, his unique perspective on the texts we read challenged us to make complex/obscure connections to them that we might not have otherwise seen.",

Weaknesses are the class is a bit disorganized, but I think it's because Prof. Klein is always willing to keep talking about something interesting and accordingly adjusts the syllabus.",

I truly enjoyed doing the readings and having enriching discussions on truth with my peers and Prof. Klein, who provided great insights about the subject. Learning about parrhesia was particularly meaningful. However, it would have been beneficial for the class to have been more structured and to have followed a clearer outline."
