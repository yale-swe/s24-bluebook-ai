   "comments": [
    "I gained great historical context for many contemporary issues that are very relevant to my life and future work.",
    "Public speaking, concise writing, in-depth analysis",
    "I learned more than I could have imagined in this course. I did not have a strong history background beforehand (I'm a science major), so it was incredibly helpful that Prof Eisenberg covered all the background needed and more so that everyone was always on the same page. Not only was I able to interact with important aspects of history, I was able to synthesize that information and apply them in order to substantiate claims about larger concepts.",
    "course themes covered chronologically and then individually. Critical perspectives introduced in the readings.",
    "I learned how to analyze the history of reproductive health.",
    "I learned about how to read complex historical papers and excerpts of books as well as analyze primary documents.",
    "I learned so much! We discussed the history of reproductive health (with a focus almost completely on women) from about 1850 to present day. I learned about reproductive health issues that used to be prevalent but have since been mostly eradicated, at least in the U.S., due to advancements in medicine. We talked a lot about the tradeoffs between technological advancements (which improve womens access to knowledge about and care for their reproductive health) and womens agency (which technology and medicalization at various stages often decreases in certain ways). We also discussed major figures in the history of reproductive health, such as Margaret Sanger."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was the perfect amount of work to keep me engaged but also not feel overwhelming. The classes themselves were interesting and I thought the incorporation of videos and stories kept things super fresh and relevant. The only weakness was that we definitely did not have enough time to have as in depth conversations as I think we would've liked, it often felt as we were just getting really in to it as the class was ending.",
    "No weaknesses -- this course is excellent.",
    "This course is absolutely phenomenal. I looked forward to every single class. The readings were incredible interesting, and every in-class discussion was uniquely structured around those readings' topics. The syllabus was one of the best I've ever encountered; every single topic was thoughtfully hand-picked by Prof Eisenberg and we covered every sub-topic imaginable within that theme. The work is fair and manageable, and I never felt overwhelmed. \r\n\r\nMy only complaint is that the course was not longer. I feel like we could have covered even more amazing information if time permitted!",
    "strengths: the readings, Prof. Eisenberg, the structure of the course\r\nweaknesses: Prof. Eisenberg sometimes showed too many video clips during class.  the clips were interesting and highlighted the topics we were reading and discussing, but often I would have rather held a discussion or listen to Prof. Eisenberg lecture",
    "the strengths are the readings, assignments, and professor. This is an excellent course.",
    "Really fantastic course- Interesting content (readings were very informative). The assignments were both very engaging and fair as well. The only thing is that perhaps sometimes there would be too many videos shown in class- I would have rather some of that time be devoted to further discussion about that week's topic.",
    "The course was fascinating. I learned a lot, and Professor Eisenberg did a great job intertwining current events. At times, the class felt slightly politically biased, but I understand that is a product of the subject matter.",
    "This course was really amazing overall. The readings were the most interesting of any class Ive taken here (and Im a junior History major). I was surrounded by classmates who were strong, well-spoken, and (mostly) women. Prof. Eisenberg holds a wealth of knowledge about the topic and was a valuable resource in planning my essays, particularly the final research paper. He was always willing to meet and made himself available at short notice. My only criticism would be that discussions sometimes felt unbalanced, with Prof. Eisenberg speaking more than any individual student. We also tended to spend a lot of time watching news and TV clips relevant to our discussion instead of talking about the material. While I appreciated Prof. Eisenbergs method of switching up class discussions with different forms of media, I would have liked to have more opportunities to share my opinion with my classmates and hear their input."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!! Especially if you are interested in reproductive health (which everyone should be tbh), you will find this class engaging, interesting and thought-provoking. Professor Eisenberg does not shy away from the big questions.",
    "Absolutely -- the material is fascinating in its own right, but Professor Eisenberg is also excellent at asking thought-provoking questions and facilitating group conversation.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course. Very insightful and important for anyone remotely interested in understanding the politics and underpinnings of reproductive health in a historical context. The readings can be heartbreaking but also eye-opening.",
    "100%. Anyone who has the chance to take this course, should. There is always a huge demand for the course, so you might not get in the first time you shop. But, if you can, keep shopping it until you get in. It is well worth the wait.",
    "Yes, for those interested in the history of hot-button issues in reproductive health, and want to gain a more nuanced understanding of all the stakeholders that played a role in shaping this history",
    "I would recommend this course because the readings were engaging and not difficult to get through, the conversation in class covered the controversial topics well, and the assignments were fair and not difficult.",
    "Yes! Absolutely. Professor Eisenberg is a fantastic professor who cares a lot about helping you grow academically and think more critically. Best seminar that I've taken so far!",
    "Definitely! Any student will learn a ton about historical analysis and gain valuable insight into reproductive issues of which any person should be knowledgeable.",
    "Yes! This course helped me realize I have a passion for reproductive justice, and I may choose to pursue a career related to this topic."
