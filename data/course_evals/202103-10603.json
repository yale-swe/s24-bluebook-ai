We also all had the opportunity to do a 25 minute presentation on a musical topic of our choice.",

                "This course is very engaging and entertaining. In other words, a joy to take. Professor Lalli takes the time to meet one-on-one with his students to ensure that they are learning and fulfilled.",
                "The course was great although it didnt seem to always have the most structure to it. But overall O had a good time in class doing the activities we did.",
                "One strength of this course are that you'll always be challenged and learn something new every time you come to class. However, one weakness or aspect in which this class can be improved is that there is no definite assignments or ways to check your standing in the class. We don't necessarily receive grades for weekly assignments or any indication of what overall grade we have going into the final. It would be helpful to have some way to keep track of this throughout the semester!",
                "This course is strong in that I think it made people feel comfortable: a minimum of putting people on the spot. I enjoyed sampling a variety of musical topics and improved my musicianship in several different areas. I enjoyed giving a presentation about sight-reading one of my favorite choral pieces. However, I believe one weakness is that there was a clear range of musical abilities within the class, preventing Professor Lalli from really challenging those of us who were up for it. Perhaps a stricter pre-requisite/placement system would be useful. Professor Lalli brought in an undergraduate student to teach sections of a few different classes, and while it was nice to learn from him, it wasn't really what we signed up for. The student is not a teacher and at times was a little bit condescending: I would have preferred for Professor Lalli to teach those sections instead.",
                "The course did not really have a difficulty curve, and many assignments were repeated and recycled. This worked OK, but I would have loved to see us steadily ramping up the difficulty as we went along. There were also some exercises that were remarkably harder than others, and the difficulty didn't feel like it lent itself to my learning. I think the course could be helped by more organization of how challenging various exercises and topics were."

                "If you would like a general overall of music theory that goes into more complex topics, this class is definitely for you! You learn a variety of different skills in each class, but there's no specific focus on any type of topic.",
                "Yes - great way to improve musical skills.",

While I had a background that made this course less constructive to me than I would have liked, I loved the professor and the way he made class fun. I think this class is a really great music class for beginner-to-intermediate music students and I would definitely recommend it, even to friends who aren't taking other music courses."
