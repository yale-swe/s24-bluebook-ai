                "I enjoyed the breadth of topics we discussed, and the guest lectures from visiting professors. Professor Maruyama is excellent and did a good job pacing the course.",
                "Strengths: Research papers in class, Office Hours, Final projects\r\nIt's nice to see some modern developments in nuclear physics and see the history tied to it. I really enjoyed learning about the Wu experiment, and reading about Fermi's first formulations behind the neutrinos. Prof. and TA office hours were especially helpful in completing psets since they provided good insight into the significance of the questions. Final projects were also a great way of delving into a topic that we were interested in.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures\r\nWhile Prof. Maruyama is very easygoing and accommodating, I felt that class lectures were a bit weak. I wanted to learn more about the fundamentals and math behind the nuclear physics, but the lectures focused more on a survey of the current experiments They were bit all over the place if you ask me. This made the problem sets inaccessible since lectures and assigned textbook material didn't tie very strongly.\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\nMaybe focus on using the blackboard to write stuff and less powerpoint. While I enjoyed the survey of modern research, I don't think I have a solid understanding of nuclear physics without the traditional physics walkthrough with a board and chalk.",
                "The engagement with the class was great, I really liked how discussion-based it was. The guest lectures were very good (Laura Havener in particular!) and I enjoyed the active and inclusive learning environment. An improvement to some lectures could be adding more concrete, worked out computational examples, especially during the lessons on statistics. It would have been useful to have more experience using the new statistical tools taught in class on the homework if we'd seen their application in class, and in general I think it would improve the retention of the material."

                "Yes, if they are interested in the topic. Do make sure you know the topic; it seems the focus of the course strongly depends on who is teaching it (from nuclear theory to detector theory to current detectors).",
                "Absolutely, especially if you are interested in any sort of neutrino or dark matter physics. I personally was not planning on immediately going into research, but the course revitalized my interest in the field.",
                "As an undergrad, I would say ONLY IF it's tied to research you're interested in. Bonus points if it's taught by a professor you research under or know very well.\r\n\r\nIf you're not doing research in nuclear\/particle, you may find the material dull or difficult to access.",
                "Absolutely, I think even someone who is not in this specific subfield would have a valuable learning experience in this course."
