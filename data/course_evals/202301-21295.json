                "I gained skills in reading a broad range of poetic styles from the 18th to the 21st centuries for both depth and breadth. Our readings and class discussions included analyzing poems both in isolation and paired with other poems, whether strikingly similar or vastly different. I grew in my close-reading and broader application skills, and I learned how these skills uniquely function in the context of poetry as opposed to prose.",
                "I learned a whole new way of thinking and speaking about poetry. I gained a really deep appreciation for poetry as it functions as an open window for conversation and reflection. I developed a system for analyzing poetry and learned a tremendous amount from classmates' insights in addition to Professor Eccles' brilliance.",
                "An overview of poetic trends in the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries.",
                "learned how to analyze poetry, work with a collection of poems in conversation, incorporate scholarly research into papers",
                "I learned how to ask bigger questions about texts and consider ways that bits of the text challenge or subvert other bits of the text, and how to turn these into compelling arguments. I also learned about the historical context behind poets such as Wordsworth, Smith, and Brooks. This course introduced me to contemporary literary criticism about Romanticism and Bishop, and taught me how to consider texts as speaking to one another in ways that highlighted their differences and similaritiies.",
                "Analysis of poetry, integration of secondary sources into criticism.",
                "how to engage with the formal aspects of poetry (sound, rhyme, diction, etc.) in the context of a poems meaning; how to close read poems to yield new interpretations; how to put different poems in conversation with each other; the canon of poetry from the wordsworth era to the present",
                "I had no interest in poetry before this semester. This class was so incredible that I absolutely love it now, and I hope to take more poetry classes in the future! The material we read provides such a great overview of the timeline of poetry, and gives you the skills to analyze it yourself. Please take this course!"

            "comments": [
                "The workload and pacing of this course were excellent. The work was substantive and meaningful and also manageable. Our class discussions were rich. The only downside was that we often did not cover much of what we read for class. That being said, our discussions being so focused allowed us to dig deeply into a smaller number of poems which may have been more valuable than a broader, more surface-level survey of all of the poems.",
                "strengths: we cover a lot of poetry and many different poets, so you really get a sense for what's out there and different kinds of poetry across time. The class discussions are often super fruitful and revealing. We usually close-read a passage of poetry and then discussed it in depth, meaning that there was less homework pressure to do the reading carefully before class. Because we were reading poetry, the reading load was quite light. Professor Eccles is absolutely brilliant and an incredible professor. I have never gotten such amazing feedback from a professor on my work: her comments are always spot-on and extremely productive. I learned so much from her as a professor and person.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: there's never enough time to talk about most of what we've read, so you end up reading more poetry than you can discuss, and that can be frustrating. I sometimes felt like the small homework assignments weren't fully explained or clear, probably because they're often somewhat open-ended and creative which is probably a good thing.",
                "The big strength is the amount of reading: light enough that everyone always has time to do all the readings, but dense enough that conversation quality never wanes.",
                "this course is amazing, especially with eccles. she is super responsive to feedback about how to improve the course",
                "I really enjoyed the readings given in the course as well as the homework assignments, which were the most enjoyable and the most effective homework I have had in an English class at Yale. They were thorough enough to get me thinking about the texts, but not too much to make them hard to complete. Professor Eccles is a great rhetorician, and I learned a lot about writing in an academic style just by listening to her speak and pose questions about the text. The essay prompts were expansive, and I always felt like I had access to Professor Eccles via office hours. \r\n\r\nIt is difficult to think of specific weaknesses. I think maybe one thing I would like to see different about the course is more supplemental criticism being incorporated. Towards the end of the class, we were told to perform more external research about the historical context of the texts we were writing upon. I recognize that this is likely placed at the end so we can make use of skills developed earlier in the semester, but I wish we had more time to go to the archives in the Stacks or Beinecke, and do more extensive external research.",
                "Great selection for the syllabus. Professor Eccles is a great facilitator of seminars, providing mini-lectures for each class to give everyone a grasp on the readings. Professor Eccles' evaluation of my essays was always incredibly thoughtful, and she provided very helpful feedback fro improvements. For an intro class for the English major, Eccles is amazing!",
                "strengths: discussion always revealed very interesting insights into a poem, helped me conceive of it in a different way; i liked how we paid attention to the reading of a poem and had people read them aloud\r\n\r\nweaknesses: sometimes discussion felt repetitive or we would often run out of time as we were digging into something complex; wish we were guided in a more specific direction sometimes with how to think about a poem instead of more broad thoughts because it felt like everyone just shared their opinions on the poem rather than considers its project",
                "I appreciated how we delved into specific moments or lines within our larger class reading assignments  I really feel that it taught me to analyze poetry in a way that I couldnt before the class. We had the perfect balance of getting an overview of what we were learning, to delving in deeper and analyzing the text."

                "Yes, I think so. I didn't love all of the poetry, but it was generally a valuable class and it was interesting to read poetry spanning several hundred years. The course is also extremely well organized and the assignments are actually very fun. The readings are interesting and not too time-consuming. Overall it's a great course!",
                "Yes, if you like the topic and you like literary analysis. Discussion based. Good readings imo. Worthwhile as a tester for the English major.",
                "Absolutely. I loved this course. I consistently looked forward to class, because I knew that I would learn something new and develop a deeper understanding of the poetry I'd read. I didn't have much of an appreciation for poetry going in to the class, and I feel like I've developed so much more knowledge of and excitement toward poetry. There is a bunch of work required for this class, but it's doable and interesting if you like analytical thinking and writing.",
                "yes but with prof eccles specifically!!",
                "I would recommend this course because it is a solid introduction to English poetry and quite fun because the texts chosen are fun (the Rape of the Lock, Tender Buttons, Beachy Head, the Moose). I found all of them deeply thought-provoking, and they are also quite classical, often staples of the Western canon, which makes studying them feel like situating oneself in a longer dialogue.",
                "If you're an English major, then I would recommend taking 126 with Eccles for sure. But even if you're just interested in poetry, this class would be a great introduction to that!",
                "yes, i would if youre an english major looking to fulfill the requirement. if not, browse through the other poetry courses, some might be more specific to your interests with less of a formulaic structure that the core english major classes have. it was an interesting class because i was already interested in poetry, but im not sure how engaging it would be otherwise",
                "Please, please take this course with Professor Eccles! This may have been the best course Ive taken at Yale. I learned so much and am leaving as both a stronger reader and writer. I was skeptical about if Id enjoy the class and originally took it because it was a requirement but it turned out to be the most incredible course!"
