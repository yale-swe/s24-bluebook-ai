    "Great opportunity to become familiar with and learn from the senior projects of other WGSS majors. Good way to structure different steps in the early senior essay writing process. I found that there were a few too many reflective writing assignments about the senior essay, and not enough assignments relating to actually writing the senior essay itself. Similarly, the senior presentation was a great experience, but I think having two presentations prior to working on and practicing the final one was one too many.",
    "It was very helpful in thinking through the big ideas of my thesis, but I wish we spent more time writing and peer editing, as advisors work at variable paces.",
    "Someties it felt like the activities were unncessary for actully writing my thesis and took away from the time I could spend on my thesis. However, the class did help me get more focus on how to approach my thesis."
