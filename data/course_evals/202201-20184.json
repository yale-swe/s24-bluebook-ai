I think the course makes clear the limits of where we go in terms of theory, but sometimes even that can feel a bit challenging to gauge just how deep you know the material.",

                "Yeah, solar power is pretty cool and I thought learning about it was a good experience.",
                "Yes, I was actually surprised at how few people take the class. I enjoy it and believe all majors will benefit from it.",
                "Sure, interesting material",
                "Not really. Course was actually not very interesting. It was very tedious at times. There are better EE electives.",
                "Yes! A great introduction to valuable concepts. I loved the way the course was structured, placing emphasis on getting exposure to ideas and equations in class that were quite complex, but there wasnt pressure to memorize these or use them in a test. Learning was the priority, rather than stressing over grades. Psets are super reasonable, and useful - using real world data for solar cells put things in context and helped cement the concepts we learnt in class."
