Indeed, this course made me clear that I wish to do anthropological studies as my future academic career.",

I also learned how to utilize a Marxist\/Weber\/Durkheim lens to look at sociological phenomena. The class trained all of us to think critically about today's urban issues in Asia, from migration to social movements to popular music, and to understand Asia not as a geographically-bound territory but as an assemblage of people and things that is fluid and constantly changing.",

                "get you to look at the world from a very Weberian and multiple layered way. Using abstract and academic terms.",
                "This course is organized badly  Prof Siu means well and is very knowledgeable, but she usually  lectures at you for basically the entire class, sometimes going on tangents unrelated to the material at hand. It becomes hard to follow, and the lack of discussion was weird for a seminar.",
                "The materials were extremely interesting and evocative to engage with. However, some of the materials were rather dense (especially the theoretical frameworks), and I think that Professor Siu and Al were a bit difficult to follow at times.",
                "I believe I could only name the strengths of this course since there's barely any weakness. I enjoyed the case studies of Asian hubs, and also Dr. Siu's personal experiences recounted. Those were very realistic and engaging, making me want to conduct field research in the future.",
                "Strengths: great readings, challenging but manageable workload, Professor Siu is excellent\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: could be structured to allow for more student contributions in class",
                "Sometimes I wish there was more time for discussion in Professor Sius class.",
                "This class was a small enough size such that we had great access to both the professor and the TA. The discussion posts also allowed to tee up any questions or topics we wanted to discuss during the class. However, since it is almost a 2 hour long seminar, I wished there were more opportunities to speak during class rather than it being almost completely a lecture. This made it a bit difficult to follow at times.\r\n\r\nAlso, the class is quite unstructured in terms of assignment requirements, etc. You have to ask the TA for examples of past papers to understand what they are looking for.",
                "Strengths: the course was well organized to familiarize us with the theoretical framework in the first few weeks of classes, then subsequently we analyzed  more empirical examples and ethnographic research using those skills. The course assessments were designed to gradually to build up our scholarship review skills and sharpen our analytical thinking for the final project. Weaknesses: there was not always the opportunity for class discussion because Professor Siu's lecturing and the student presentations in the latter half of the semester took up all of class time. I still learned a lot from class, so it's only a weakness if you prefer a discussion-heavy seminar.",
                "The presentations and lectures are thought-provoking, useful, and fascinaiing. \r\nSometimes the lecture went too long thus not much time for discussion. \r\nSome students in class are not very engaging."

Although this class can be intellectually challenging for students who are unfamiliar with social theory, you will develop a strong understanding of these frameworks that will help you in future anthropology classes. You develop greater insight into Asia's development through a cultural lens and learn about all the fascinating history and people and places that make up Asia today.",
