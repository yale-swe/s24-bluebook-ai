                "More advanced knowledge about minerals, rocks, and geology in general.",
                "This course developed an extensive understanding of New England geology, the ability to conceptualize past geological environments based on present-day observations on the scale of millions of years, and gave a hands-on application of processes and vocabulary from lectures with the ability to identify the rock type by its physical characteristics."

Without the lab, I don't think I would've taken away that much from the class, but I was able to see the lectures come to life on the field trips. \r\nWeaknesses: Deadlines were pretty confusing and it was pretty freeform which I guess wasn't the worst",
                "This was a perfectly designed lab class. Professor Evans makes sure that the class is truly only half a credit's worth of work. Even though we only met for about 7 sessions, I still feel like I gained an adequate sense of the skills used in the field.",
                "This course was great! I really enjoyed the field trips and how much practical knowledge was shared. It was fantastic to get outside in Connecticut and see actual examples of what we learned in lecture. THIS CLASS IS ACTUALLY A HALF-CREDIT STEM LAB :)). In the future, I would request that Professor Evans gives students a heads up about field trips that involve hiking so students with physical challenges\/disabilities can prepare. Several of us were caught off-guard by the glacial features field trip in particular. In this vein, finding course information on Canvas was a little rocky. There wasn't too much detail in the syllabus.",
                "Strengths: All three field trips are so interesting! Prof Evans and both TFs (James and Zheng) are very nice, patient, and knowledgable.",
                "The strengths of the course were that the workload and the effectiveness of labs in helping with sustained exposure of concepts that aided greatly in recall of information. The field trips were great."

                "Absolutely, especially if you're taking EPS 110, the companion lecture course! The themes in the class only really make sense (and get interesting) when you apply them directly. The highlight of the course (and really my entire semester) was the fall break trip across New England. The sights were gorgeous, and I am really proud of the work I did over the course of those few days.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course -- it's engaging, not too hard, and you learn a lot without really realizing it because the work is enjoyable.",
                "Yes, absolutely!",
                "I would highly recommend this lab to another student because information is conveyed concisely and understandably, the lab work greatly solidified concepts, and the class environment was comfortable and inclusive."
