   "comments": [
    "The strengths is that we had a lot of homework and that allowed us to learn how to make things in design in depth. However, the weakness was that we had to learn everything by ourselves, the teacher did not teach us how to use the tools ahead and how to make things in advance and that was a struggle amongst the class.",
    "There was a lot of critiques and individual attention for each project which was extremely helpful. My only complaint would be regarding the timing. Every class would go overtime for at least an extra half an hour which was extremely inconvenient for those who had classes in the afternoon.",
    "it takes too long to do the critique for every student each class"

    "Yes but not as a summer course",
    "Yes I would since it was a great introduction to design especially if they have no prior experience. I would warn them though that they should be ready for a lot of work and creative projects that they most likely arent used to if they're coming from a different field.",
    "Yes",
    "I will recommend the course to students who are not major in design but want to learn the basics of design and challenge themselves."
