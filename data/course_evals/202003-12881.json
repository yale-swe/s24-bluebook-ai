My speaking and listening improved as well, but not as much, which makes sense because we unfortunately didn't get to speak and listen to each other in person.",

                "I really improved my speaking as we used the breakout rooms a lot. I think I learnt more grammatically and I think L3 explains the concepts well. Also, there was a lot to learn about Spanish culture.",

                "Strengths: Professor Diaz really cares about educating his students on the intricacies of the spanish language.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class is a lot of work. There is little helpful feedback given Professor Diaz can be sexist at times, and will whistle or click at female students.",
                "The course was very fast paced.",
                "I think that the course was well made for the circumstances and I don't have many things to complain about.",
                "The cyclic nature of the course made it easy to schedule around. I loved the organization and thoughtfulness of the professor. I truly enjoyed the cultural assignments that involved reading or watching stories from other countries.",
                "I thought the readings, short films, the novel, and the movie at the end of the semester were all strengths of the course. The activities that simply involved talking between two students were also very helpful. Probably the least helpful parts of the course were when the entire class was together, learning from a slideshow presentation, because it was easier to become disengaged in that setting. I would push for more activities involving talking between two or three students, and less lecture-style presentations, although I understand that sometimes those presentations are necessary and useful.",
                "I think that a weakness of this course was the poor scheduling of the assessments. Some weeks we had multiple assessments and other weeks we had no assessments. Another weakness of this class was that sometimes instructions for assignments were unclear, and towards the end of the semester we were assigned excessive amounts of readings for our book: relato de naufraugo. One strength of this class was that because we only met usually 3x a week, we were able to take our time and review on our own on the other two days. Another strength, was that the professor provided extra modules for us to watch and it definitely helped me understand the material better.",
                "The strengths are the in class presentations to learn maters and the weaknesses are the in book learning opportunities.",
                "The course is designed really well. There was an abundance of work that helped me improve upon the areas I was weak in and truly become a better speaker and writer of Spanish. I did not think there were too many weaknesses to the course. If you put effort into this class, it pays off greatly.",
                "I think this course immerses you into Spanish culture and watching\/reading Spanish media made the course really engaging. Sometimes the textbook work was not always useful though. But supersite was very good.",
                "I thought the course was extremely immersive and one of the harder classes I've ever taken.  I found the recorded explanations of grammar lessons (on Loom) to be extremely helpful, but the amount of extra worksheets and exercises seemed too extensive at points.  It also made it hard to narrow down what to specifically study for the exams; however, communication between the teaching team, professor, and students was excellent and the rubric for every assignment was very transparent and understandable."

The availability of online resources was probably my favorite part of the entire course. The Canvas site had so much to offer, and the professor was always willing to help. I think the tests maintained a great format in spite of coronavirus as well.",

The class isn't necessarily as challenging as other courses, but work is required in order to get the benefits of the class. The work is not very difficult, but daily practice is important to make sure your Spanish improves. Although it may not be as exciting as some other courses, it is still fun, enjoyable, and helps you learn Spanish.",

By the end of the class, you will have a much greater understanding of both Spanish language and culture. You must be prepared to do a fair amount of work, but it never feels too burdensome. It was also a fun class experience because it allowed a lot of interaction with other students though breakout rooms in Zoom.",
