I was able to learn more about the famous figures that shaped each decade of American sport and was also able to learn about the social, political, racial, cultural, and economic happenings in each decade with regard to sport and how it shaped sport throughout history.",

The only weakness of the course was that some more resources could have been provided for the papers, but overall I felt like I was given the tools needed to do well in the course.",

You will learn so much about sports in America and have a true appreciation of history in a field that is fun to study and analyze. The course is not overwhelming and you're given the support to do well while learning a lot. I truly enjoyed this course, and if you get a spot in the class, I would absolutely recommend it. You start making connections to modern-day sport and other sporting events in history, which is a really cool realization to have. Highly recommend!",
