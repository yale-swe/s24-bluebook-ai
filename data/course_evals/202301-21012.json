I definitely developed perseverance because a lot of the concepts covered in class were difficult for me to wrap my mind around as someone with little coding experience, but I ended up becoming comfortable enough with coding to code my Final Project!",

The weaknesses are with Supercollider, as someone with no knowledge of coding going into it, he never really taught us the basics of coding and what coding really is, which made it hard to keep up as we went pretty fast into supercollider."
