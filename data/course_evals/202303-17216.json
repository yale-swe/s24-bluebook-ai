                "This class is a good representation of the difficulty of programming in a practical settings. I think the course examination could be more centered on topics that students would be more familiar with at the time of testing.",
                "strengths: lectures weren't very useful and hard to stay focused on them. the psets were very fun\r\nweaknesses: first couple psets didn't have much instruction and thus i spent way more time on those than the 3rd and 4th psets.",
                "Strengths: Useful skills that will be transferred to the real world; Great lecturing and Demo code; Fun project\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of work at times, with the sometimes difficult PSets and Project Deadlines at the same time. I think some of the initial things we did could have been emphasized less so that we could do more of the essential and applicable concepts to today for longer in the course. For example, I think it would have been more useful to learn React rather than place a humungous emphasis on HTML. I also thought that the GUI we learned in Python was unnecessary in a way.",
                "bro a better instructor",
                "Manageable workload, engaging psets",
                "Professor Weide really struggled with this class organizationally. There were lots of PSET specs that were wrong or held over from previous semesters, and it fell onto students to catch these errors. 3 of my 4 PSETs were graded improperly and I had to go to office hours to get them fixed. The midterm exam was meant to be completed in class, in 75 minutes, which was completely impossible. He then gave us 3 weeks to work on resubmission for a higher grade, except you could still earn full points with the resubmissions, so it should have been a take home exam from the beginning. Also everyone I know spent about 10 hours on the midterm meant to be done in 75 minutes. \r\n\r\nThe PSETs were usually interesting, and I liked the way they built upon each other. Grades came back a little slow but better than many other STEM classes. I felt like the 2nd PSET (creating a GUI desktop app) was pointless in the scheme of things, while the other PSETs were all very useful and built on each other. Workload was not too high, and really got easier after the first 2 PSETs. I feel like I learned valuable things, but the class was poorly organized.",
                "Strengths are the Psets and Teaching staff. Lecture's need a complete overhaul. They are quite dull, especially at 9AM.  Professor is very engaged but the material he's teaching is insanely dry. I did almost all of my learning from the psets, online resources and ChatGPT.",
                "There were four substantial programming assignments. It would have been preferable if they had been assigned a bit earlier, providing additional time for the final project. The coverage of the JavaScript component occurred relatively late. It was  a challenge for students who don't have sufficient prior knowledge to plan adequately for the final project",
                "I liked how the psets built onto each other and weren't too much work, while still teaching me the most important concepts",
                "Strengths: Felt like I was able to actually develop practical skills (using github, developing cool web applications, working with a partner on psets and a team to build final project)\r\nWeakness: Few office hours and would have liked better feedback on final project during advisor check-ins",
                "The entire class is a series of group projects, so your experience is either fine if you get a good partner, or hell if your partner doesn't pull their weight.\r\n\r\nGrading was highly inconsistent and opaque to students. For our final project, we had no idea how we were going to be assessed (and still don't).",
                "It's a rewarding class in that you get to see your efforts visualized in the psets and project. But, because it's usually a large class it's hard to get good help.",
                "Many coding assignments to practice hands-on skills.",
                "Strengths: The psets were definitely challenging but taught me a lot in terms of how to code certain things.\r\nWeaknesses: Long specs for psets (that still needed clarification in EdDiscussion) and disorganized lectures (didn't line up with what we were doing\/didn't teach the required knowledge for the psets just yet)",
                "Strengths: Not sure\r\nWeaknesses: Extremely disorganized, contradictory directions in assignments, not enough taught to complete assignments",
                "The lectures have lots of live coding demos that are not always the easiest to follow, they should be more directly related to the PSETs or organized in some other way",
                "Very applicable to CS industry, but can be very disorganized at time, and feedback can be quite late. Shoutout the entire TF\/ULA staff for being so helpful at OH!",
                "honestly thought the course was well written. psets were pretty chill and produced something that was cool in the end, i enjoyed them! midterm wasn't a curveball even though it had a unique format and the final had a ton of freedom so it was a lot of fun. i liked alan as a lecturer a lot, though technical difficulties did get the best of him a few times. also, grading was pretty slow, and the TAs were definitely overworked (they were still amazing though). overall great course though!",
                "I think the strengths were the psets which helped us to practice the content we went over in lecture.",
                "When my groups project began encountering difficulties, I found him to be very understanding and approachable to discuss these issues. He helped to keep things more on track, but not in a super restricted way either, both of which Im very grateful for. I liked the lectures and found the psets and project to be pretty fun and rewarding overall!"

                "The content taught just seems so awkward and out of place. On one week you discuss web sockets, which you think is relevant then the next week you're on forking some process. The nature of this course is also very stressful, 4 PSETs of which each stack, so if you do poorly on PSET 1, you will need to fix pset 1 just to make sure the mistake does not carry to pset 2, 3, and 4. Alan also had a lot of technical difficulties this year - so maybe wait until more experience teaching it",

Just be warned that a lot of the skills are pretty rudimentary and baseline, but it will help you learn newer web development skills much easier in the future.",

                "Yes, it is very useful but take that with a grain of salt, especially if you like clear, quick feedback.",
                "honestly yes, it's a great course to take to understand the basics of how to make a website. if you try to jump into really abstract high level frameworks without knowing this stuff it can get you pretty far but knowing what's going on behind the scenes makes you feel more comfortable at worst and allows you to think beyond what already exists at best. if you wanna go into SWE, definitely. if not, i would say it's still great to know how apps work.",
