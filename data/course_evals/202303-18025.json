                "Strengths - The material was fascinating. The readings weren't too difficult nor tedious, and lecture was highly engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The group project that the course is structured around is a bit dull. I wish we had had the opportunity to view other chronic illnesses (e.g. AIDS) under the same light as opposed to solely obesity. It felt like a lot of time to work on the same topic, and a few too many components to be worthwhile. Also, if you got paired in an inadequate group, you were stuck for the whole semester.",
                "Lectures were really engaging and interesting. Usually section lined up well with readings and lectures. I enjoyed that the readings were actually helpful in understanding class.",
                "Perhaps a greater focus on introducing general sociological concepts in the beginning of class/explaining how to write sociologically.",
                "The lectures were not super engaging and the instructions for the essays and other assignments weren't clear so it was hard to figure out what was being asked of you.",
                "First essay was graded really hard for an intro class. Was tough to bounce back",
                "Better grading system",
                "I liked that there was discussion section for this class because I thought it made the class even more engaging. I also liked the format of the different graded assignments. I also really liked the guest lecturers.",
                "Strengths: This class was wonderful! The lectures were very well-structured and went perfectly with the readings. The professor was very passionate and knowledgable about the topics.",
                "Strengths: good lecture, I liked the projects/readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: harsh grading on the first paper with little instruction on what they were looking for, lectures went online so not many people went to class, I wish we had gone deeper into topics",
                "Strengths- accommodating professor, relatively laidback quizzes, responsive professor\r\nweaknesses- readings are overwhelming and although they're super valuable, the reality is that many Yale students don't have the time to read numerous readings for every class. I took 5 classes this semester, and would often feel paralyzed when it came time to do all of the readings, and I think that most of my peers felt similarly.",
                "Strength: the course content is very relevant to daily life and I learned a lot about the world around me. Weakness: sometimes it felt we were just sitting in lecture with minimal engagement with the course concepts until the essays and projects happened (and there were only a few of these). I think that this could be improved by making the discussion section more engaging and small-group-discussion-based.",
                "The content of this course was interesting but I don't feel that it was well-organized. The first few assignments of the year were frustrating in that for the first essay for example, barely any prompt and absolutely no rubric were provided, and the grading was very harsh. The quizzes also seemed to contain questions that were hyper-focused on small details and specificities mentioned in lectures/reading, which would have been fine except that the actual questions on the quiz were not even written with enough precision to be able to come to such a specific answer. Many of the lecture slides were confusing with little connection between slides or repetition of a phrase or sentence without context to ground it in. The whole class just felt very imprecisely organized while also requiring us to know details or perform on essays to such a high level of precision.",
                "strength: cool subject matter\r\nweakness: every assessment was attempted to trick you.",
                "Course material is engaging, but strictness/grading style of teaching fellows varies greatly",
                "Strengths: as someone interested in global health, this course pushed me to really try and think critically about the sociological facets to health, and how such phenomena are reflected in human experiences. I think the course structure reflected this as well, as each assignment appeared to build off of the next, with a central goal in mind for an intervention. \r\nWeaknesses: none really, maybe balancing out or isolating more critical readings from/with more optional ones, as there might have been more readings than what could be handled for an average week during the semester. In addition, although achievable, group projects were just not as ideal, especially in the final projects of the course, when students are most busy and have varying schedules.",
                "I don't think there are weaknesses and strengths I think it is the course material.",
                "Professor Menon and my TA was amazing, very passionate about the subject",
                "Weaknesses:\r\nCourse was very broad and failed to give palpable solutions to the challenges discussed in class.\r\nStrengths:\r\nGreat assigned readings and lectures. The professor was very engaging.",
                "Professor was a great lecturer and you could tell that she put a lot of effort into making this class an amazing learning environment for her students. My problem lies with the TFs and the way in which they communicated to us. In my opinion and experience, the TFs made her job as a professor a lot harder, and I will expound on this harsh statement a little later.",
                "The strengths for the course is the feedback from the assignments. Professor Menon was very clear about grading and often encouraged us to try harder and show improvement which was very encouraging to continue trying harder despite getting lower grades on some assignments. The teaching staff was also very accommodating and made the class accessible for students with little sociology background. The weakness for the course is that the lecture slides were too brief and I often wanted more information to be displayed on the slides because I can't always write down everything the professor says out loud.",
                "Nothing Alka Menon is the goat and every lecture was a delight to attend. Readings and lecture material are always super well organized and relevant to each other",

                "Loved the content and lectures were very interesting. The assignments, including the group presentation and project, were not my favorite. I think a good alternative would be to write about your personal experinces with the concepts we learned each week for a grade. The intervention stuff was just not very engaging.",
                "The lecture format of the course was well supported by discussion sections, though I would have appreciated lecture recordings being available earlier in the year.",
                "weakness: group projects are unfair in the amount of work students have to do, very into ERM class so really nothing super provoking or in depth",
                "Strengths: Great lectures, great slides \r\nWeaknesses: More info on how sociological papers should be written",
                "Strengths of this course include the readings, documentaries, and podcast episodes that enabled a real world immersion in the construction of health and illness in the modern day."

                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in working in the healthcare industry. It brings up a lot of valuable points and key food for thought that should not be brushed over. Professor Menon is a gem, too.",
                "Definitely. Especially for premed students who take a heavy science workload. This perspective of social context is really important for medical and public health practitioners.",
                "I think if you are interested in the field then yes this is a great class. It's not too difficult and the readings are fairly interesting. You will learn a lot about the perception of health and illness as well as the healthcare system. However, I wouldn't say this class was super revolutionary or eye-opening. Its a good intro-course.",
                "Yes if youre interested in topic",
                "yes because its a good intro class to learning more about health",
                "yes I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are interested in science / global health and looking to explore the sociological side of that kind of material!",
                "Yes! This class was crazy interesting. You learn so much about healthcare systems around the world, healthcare organizations (CDC, WHO, etc.), and important sociological topics, which can be applied beyond healthcare. I highly recommend.",
                "Yes, if they are looking for a basic overview.",
                "Yes! The information taught in this class is extremely valuable, and I think that EVERYONE could benefit from the content that's covered in this class. Prior to taking this class, I understand that lower socioeconomic status was correlated with worse health outcomes, but I didn't realize how complex and truly deep-rooted these inequalities are. Even in my day-to-day life I catch myself looking at some situations differently and having a lot more empathy for others since now I understand a bit more about how particular communities have been so marginalized. To really achieve a more equitable world, I think everyone should learn the material in this class.",
                "Yes! Would recommend, it's a great introduction to sociology as way to view the world.",
                "I would not necessarily recommend this course to another student just because I don't feel like it was well-organized or graded kindly.",
                "no",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning a little bit about health because it offers a sociological lens into how health works and discusses health frames. It was extremely interesting, and this was my favorite class of the semester.",
                "Yes, if you want to take an interesting sociology class/5th credit.",
                "I would recommend to a first year or sophomore student who is interested in learning more about American healthcare. If you're an upperclassmen, you've probably learned most of this content already.",
                "I would if you're interested in the material. One thing to be aware of is that you should be able to have some sociological background to get a good grade on your essays.",
                "Yes, mainly if they have a more niche interest in the interface of social sciences with health. Be mindful that the course doesnt come without a lot of effort and time in studying for quizzes and group projects. When mid-semester feedback reflected some students dissatisfaction with the course structure up until that point, however, the professor and teaching team were quick to adjust to and truly incorporate this feedback. Overall, putting in that time to be engaged, attend office hours, and to obtain routine feedback from TFs was necessary to doing well in the course.",
                "Yes I would because I think the material is something everyone should learn at some point.",
                "Yes definitely! Take it, especially if youre interested in public health",
                "Yes, I definitely would!",
                "I really hate to say this, but based on my experience this semester, I would not recommend this course to another student. I would 100% recommend a Professor Menon course, but my experience during section and with the constant moving pieces of this class was so negative that it made me consider not being interested in healthcare at large. This evaluation is really hard for me to write because I am not a negative or pessimistic person, and I made an effort to voice my concerns with both Professor Menon and my TF during the semester. Where Professor Menon was helpful, honest, and understanding, my TF was the exact opposite.",
                "Amazing course!! Everyone should take this  especially if you are considering a future career in anything healthcare-related",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it provides a brief introduction to what American healthcare really looks like through a sociological perspective. If you are looking to learn about public health through a research standpoint, this course would be best for you. I would highly recommend this course if you are pre-med or looking at any future career in medicine!",
                "Yes!!! All the lectures are so engaging and readings work so well with them. Professor Menon is the only professor I trust to teach the sociology of health because she is extraordinarily based",
                "This course was pretty mid. It was incredibly easy in terms of workload and people stopped showing up to class after a few weeks, but I did not find the content that interesting. I'm not saying the content is boring, but it wasn't for me, and I wished I had chosen a better class because I thought I was wasting my time. The final project of doing a health intervention was a waste of time in my opinion.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it teaches you about parts of society that we see and hear about that we don't know the full story behind. It provided me with a greater understanding of health and illness in this world.",
