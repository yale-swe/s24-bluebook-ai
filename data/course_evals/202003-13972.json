                "Prof. Cooper is AMAZING! he is so patient, posts all the notes and lectures, and teaches in such an approachable, understanding and applicable way. \r\nHe was so generous with the timing and pace of the class. \r\nThe only challenging part was that the first discussion section did not get to learn what would be on the quiz before we had to submit our responses while the second discussion section had much more time to prepare and could learn the concepts with the class.",
                "the practice exams did not really reflect the actual exams so it was quite difficult to feel properly prepared for the exams throughout the term. The modes of student support were definitely a strength. I was able to set up frequent meetings with the TA and felt very supported in that sense.",
                "Strengths: The sapling psets that allowed you to see if you got your questions correct in real time. The zoom lectures were fantastic. \r\nWeaknesses: The fact that the grade cutoffs are unknown. I have not idea what my grade is. Also, the exams were often very very very time constrained which I feel was a bit unfair considering we were taking them via zoom on a piece a paper with the questions on our screen. I spent a lot of time copying down information from my screen onto my piece of paper in order to be able to start exam questions.",
                "This course was very informative and offered good explanations of materials.",
                "Strengths: instruction, learning curve assignments, recorded lecture\r\nWeaknesses: testing manner\r\nThe exams tested the rapidity of regurgitation of material rather than an overall understanding. The testing manner could be improved by providing additional time during exams.",
                "strengths: feedback on tests were prompt and discussion sections were dependent upon student questions",
                "I was placed into a section designed for students underprepared in chemistry (small lecture, and our own TA, and different assignments and tests). I was happy to be in this course because I knew a lot less coming into chemistry than my friends in the other section. I thought a weakness was that we spent so long on the intro to the class. We spent 2 weeks on chapter 1, which was basically the only material I already knew coming into the class. That meant we had to speed up during the harder topics to get through all the material for the course, which compounded the difficulty of those topics.\r\nThere was also one week where the lab for that week had to do with topics we hadn't covered in lecture (I had the same lab as people in normal chem), which made doing the lab report difficult.",

                "The strengths of this course was the variety of resources available to get help (Professor Cooper's office hours, TA office hours, peer tutoring). The weakness was the difficulty of timed midterm\/final exams especially to people that have never taken chemistry courses before.",
                "I thought that the way this course was organized (lecture, learning curves, problem sets, discussion sections) was a strength to the course because I had enough practice with the material before each midterm. However, I think that the quizzes before each discussion section did not add a lot to my learning. Often, they covered topics that I had to read ahead in the textbook to understand, and I think discussion section was more helpful to me when it was lead by student's questions and what they identified as their weaknesses.",
                "More review sessions before tests",
                "The greatest strength of the course was that the teacher was very organized and I knew what was expected of me and liked the learning curve aspect of my homework to help me prepare for what would be asked of me through practice that was graded on completion. I found that the quizzes before the sections to be the greatest weakness because they often tested the material we learned in the lecture that ended 15 minutes before the section and we were expected to complete these quizzes earlier when we had not yet learned everything necessary.",
                "I found the sapling homework very helpful as a way of reviewing and practicing material.",

I also enjoyed that all his presentation slides were posted prior to the start of the course; this made planning ahead easy for questions and note-taking.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's gen chem... the concepts are unfortunately pretty boring, and anything that is fun isn't explained because \"you don't know enough for this yet.\""

Other things that I enjoyed were lecture materials being posted on Canvas. I didn't end up using the textbook as much as I should've, perhaps because it was digital, but I'm glad I was able to spend the hundred dollars or so I would've otherwise had to spend on it.\r\n\r\nAs for improvements, this course could use more interactive elements. Dr. Cooper (bless him) did his best to keep the class engaged by asking us questions during lecture, but it wasn't long before everyone's cameras were off and only one or two super dedicated students remained to answer him. Maybe some polls or whiteboard use during our virtual lectures could keep everyone more engaged?"
