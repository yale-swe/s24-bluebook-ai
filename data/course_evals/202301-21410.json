                "I appreciate the structure of the course since everything ties back to the key concepts discussed in the first lecture and the pace was perfect.",
                "The instructor started off at the right speed but by the end of the half semester was going really fast it was hard to keep up. I also believe the paper could be explained better as a review rather than a paper",
                "The classes and the problem sets are very engaging and kind of support each-other by filling in gaps. The content is well curated, demonstrating fundamental chemistry with current applications.",
                "Nilay is a great professor and you can tell he really cares about teaching. I felt like the focus on how to approach problem solving and thinking rather than rote memorization was much more helpful at a graduate level.",
                "I honestly believe this course needs little to no improvement. The amount of course load is perfect, giving us chances to challenge ourselves in homework without being overly time consuming. I also believe the term paper assignment is one of the best assessments I've ever had to complete. It really bridges the gap between learning in a classroom and learning from the literature. Additionally, this course is great for someone like me who is an organic chemist but wants to learn more about the field of inorganic chemistry and organometallics - the course certainly teaches us new material, but in a way that is digestible to someone outside of the field.",
                "Strengths: The format of the lectures was generally good & engaging, especially the mini storytimes! Nilay asked us questions that helped move the class along and made us really think about what we were writing down. I also appreciated the brief recap given at the beginning of each lecture to highlight the most important points from last time. \r\nWeaknesses: Since we went through so many examples, including some mechanisms that were disproved, it was hard to pick out exactly what we needed to know/what the options for \"correct\" mechanisms were. I generally struggle to put together a mechanism on my own, so more emphasis on the elementary steps or showing the arrow pushing would've been helpful. Also, the first half of organometallics (CHEM 503?) was way back in the fall; if these courses were directly in sequence, I think it would've been easier to learn, since I needed to take time to remind myself of the basics.",
                "Instructor is very clear in teaching. Sometimes the pace was a bit fast though (writing notes and at the same time trying to follow what was being said was sometimes difficult). I think it would have been more helpful for me if his notes were written on a tablet(and projected), and then we could have access to his notes later. This way, if at any point we missed a point/wanted to stop writing and listen, it would be easier to do so. Problem sets were sometimes challenging but I learnt a lot while working on them."

                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in inorganic or organic chemistry. Even as an organic chemist, I learned a lot about how to create tailored mechanistic studies and make conclusions based off of those studies.",
                "Yes",
                "Everyone interested in organic, inorganic, and organometallic chemistry should take it. Even if the applications themselves may not be useful to a certain student, the mechanistic insight (and how we got to the said mechanism) is invaluable.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I never once felt in over my head, but also never felt that I was skating by. As I said in a previous response, this course is the perfect introductory bridge between organic and inorganic. It also builds on concepts that one has previously learned and applies them in a new setting. I would also recommend this course because it not only taught me new reactions, but also taught me how to think critically in terms of elucidating the mechanisms of those reactions.",
                "Yes, if you're going into organometallic chemistry/synthesis (which many students are). This course gives foundational understanding of many reactions and provides exposure to them if you haven't seen them before, and if you're a mechanism person I'm sure you would find it to be exciting and easier to follow. As someone who has always struggled with seeing mechanisms, I found it challenging but still interesting.",
                "Yes, even if organometallics is not going to be a huge part of your research, it's still helpful to learn about some of the things that were taught in the class."
