While I appreciated the amount of freedom afforded to us with regards to our midterm and final, there were times in class where the reading we were expected to do was unclear or the framing of a question was confusing. However, I think a lot of the course confusion was related to being digital.",
                "If you're interested in exploring the \"other\" and exclusion based on religious, ethnic, or gender affiliations, then I would highly recommend this course. I'd never explored these topics through the lens of the Middle Ages before; it was fascinating to dive into a time period that seems remote at first glance but actually grappled with many of the issues that we continue to grapple with today. The course does an excellent job of bringing in a variety of historical perspectives and texts, and I particularly looked forward to unpacking these in our discussion sections. At the same time, I sometimes wished our discussions could be more student-directed. Every discussion we had was led by a professor or TF, and although they encouraged us to bring up passages that interested us, I think the discussions often ended up reflecting their interests more than they reflected ours. I think it would have also helped if each week's topic had transitioned more clearly into the next; that would have given me more of a sense of the course's structure and how all the pieces fit together.",

                "Virtual lecture was great. Synchronous seminar with professors was a good balance. Improvement in providing breakout rooms",
                "I think that the whole group discussions were not as helpful as the smaller seminar discussions. While they were useful for making sure everyone was on the same page (which I appreciated a lot), the large group discussions did not help me understand the topics as much as the seminar discussions. I loved my seminar. There was a good balance of speaking and hearing from my peers that helped me digest the readings and lectures well. I also think the smaller seminar allowed my group to develop a level of comfort that is difficult to achieve over zoom, especially in a large group setting.",
                "We spent the first 20 minutes of our weekly seminar in breakout rooms and then came back to share what we'd discussed with the rest of the class. Since speaking out in a large Zoom meeting can be intimidating, this made it easier for everyone's ideas to be heard. I also liked that our lectures were prerecorded because this actually made it easier for me to take notes and absorb the material, and the fact that everyone had to respond to these lectures in a discussion post helped us to engage with the lectures.",
