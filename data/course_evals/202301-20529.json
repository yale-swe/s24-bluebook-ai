                "Very solid class. Provides enough foundational knowledge to self-learn other topics and derive how different statistical tests/models are formed.",
                "Strengths: Great course and presentation of material. PSETs were perfectly correlated with the lecture content, and the course itself was highly cohesive in promoting learning.\r\nWeaknesses: legitimately none that I can think of",
                "Some of the homework questions could have been more clear on what was expected",
                "Strengths: The professor is a great lecturer and very nice. The material is explained well, even though there is a lot of it, and the problem sets and exams are manageable. The TFs were also helpful and supportive. Weaknesses: The material is very dense and hard to follow at times, and discussion of applications was usually saved for the end of the concept, which made following the proofs difficult and confusing some of the time.",
                "Loved that the professor was very engaged, kind, and offered a lot of office hours. Could have used a programming exam, grading was harsh and exams difficult. Definitely the hardest class I've taken so far at Yale and required a lot of time and energy. Interesting but do not take if you are not required to.",
                "The class is well taught, but at the same time is a very intensive introduction to the subject for undergrads with not much prior stat experience. The class is also accessible (recorded lectures, posted notes, and corresponding textbook readings), and you learn a lot through psets",
                "Strengths: professor wooster is powerfully engaging and excited to teach the material (with a strong, math-focused background in the field), recorded lectures, everything was proved live (as opposed to slides where too much info is thrown at you very fast), instructive psets, fair exams. Very well-organized course overall (especially given that it was Wooster's first time teaching the course).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Gave Zhou Fan's material as practice for exams (which was brutally difficult to the point of discouragement) but Wooster's exams were much fairer in line with the content that was taught. Oddly, the final felt more like a calculus exam rather than a stats exam. 9am on Marsh...",
                "Professor Wooster is good at explaining concepts and the textbook is very closely connected to lectures and the problem sets. The demonstrations in R were pretty straightforward, but may have been difficult for people who did not already have experience in R or any computing language. Takeaways from/enjoyment of the homework might depend on whether your enjoy deriving formulas or not.",
                "I took this class last year (when it was taught by a different professor) and had to retake it, so I can confidently say that Prof. Wooster is an outstanding lecturer that is a very good fit for this class. His pure math background made him give us a deep appreciation for these concepts with scarce handwaving involved, but at the same time it rarely felt like we were lost in the proofs. It's rare to find such a perfect balance of mathematical rigor and big-picture conceptual understanding. \r\n\r\nThe course content is also very readily applicable. Although 99% of what we learn mathematically is available in R, the way this course is taught actually helps because, more than just proofs, we deeply understnad the assumptions embedded in those commands as to avoid common statistical pitfalls. I gained a deeper appreciation for the field after this class.",
                "The class was overall well organized. Topics were well introduced and explained.",
                "The homeworks were relatively straightforward, but the exams were tough -- if the tests were one-to-one with the difficulty of the assignments I think I could have gotten more out of this course.",
                "Strengths: rigorous course material and advanced mathematical concepts covered, I feel more prepared for next set of advanced statistics classes.\r\nWeaknesses: given the difficult material and technical concepts covered in the substantive readings and in lecture, I was surprised that there was no required section mandated outside of the lectures each week.",
                "The strength is the amount of support that we get. I couldn't survive this class without the daily office hours options and Ed Discussion. I never feel like I am alone in this class. I never understand the content, but I'm not failing because I have opportunities to get help. There are always office hours whenever I need them. For me the weakness is just the content really, it is really challenging but that's really just a fault of my own. I feel like the exams are unreasonably tough. They are always tricky questions.",
                "Made the theory very clear by giving many examples, but can incorporate more with real-life usage.",
                "Strengths: The course had a relatively straightforward form. Some of the ULA's were really helpful. Weaknesses: The course is really, really, really challenging. I think the content is too much for a one-semester course and I thought there was a big gap between what was taught in class, what appeared on problem sets and what was tested on exams. I wish the course could focus on a little less topics and have more realistic expectations about what students are supposed to grasp by the end of the semester. I also didn't find Professor Wooster's teaching particularly helpful.",
                "the course does not have powerpoint only handnotes\r\nthe exam is difficult",
                "Strengths: 1. good material 2. the professor is very passionate. 3. Problem sets are helpful to understand the material.\r\nWeakness: 1. I prefer powerpoint slides rather than hand-written notes 2. Could give students more intuition about some concepts rather than just prove it.",
                "can help me build more solid foundation in theoretical statistics",
                "The lecture hall was a bit too big for the course so at times you felt like you were so far away from the instructor. Overall the material was well-prepared and the exams were fair. Weakness is all the undergraduates they let teach the course. They do not know the material that well and are always rescheduling and shifting their office hours. That is the bare minimum, be at your spot, every week for 1.5 hours, if not, do not teach the course.",
                "This course is very good",
                "Strengths: Professor Wooster was one of the most accessible and helpful professors I've had at Yale. He himself held five hours of office hours and also had a huge team of ULAs and TFs. Concepts were also taught quite well during lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Textbook we used was not great and the professor may have assumed better existing student understanding of how to work with probability distributions and confidence intervals. However, certain corrections for this were made for this after the midterm!",
                "The strengths is Bob. Bob sets a high standard for teaching talent. I tried to nominate Bob for the teaching prizes but it said that the professor had to have worked at Yale for at least three years, so you guys better nominate Bob in two years. Bob made lessons very illustrative and clear with constant examples and interweaving proofs and problems to great effect. Like an ideal math professor, Bob literally clarified almost everything he wrote down in the course, which proved super helpful during lengthy derivations. His notes were absolutely great, and he would always hand write them and update them timely. He always made a point to make sure everyone was up to speed and regularly solicited questions. Bob also did a great job constantly referencing topics from other lectures in a different lecture and tying similar topics together, which made understanding the context of a topic in the statistics universe a lot easier. He provided practice problems very relevant to exam content and difficulty, lots of supplementary information like illustrative examples in R, and held literally four office hours per week what the. Bob was elegant and quick on his feet when answering student questions, delivering them well formulated responses. He is kind, humble, welcoming, funny, responsive, and overall a great guy, one of my top three professors at Yale out of probably like 50 I've had. Yale's other STEM professors (especially math and stats, jeez) would do well to take a page out of Bob's book, and he is the ideal exact kind of new professor that will ensure Yale maintains its academic edge into the future.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness is that Bob is not teaching other courses that I want to take! (inference and machine learning and advanced probability) because the current professors leave much to be desired. I wish I could learn machine learning from Bob, this man would carry me into the future of AI. Did you read this review??? Give this man a promotion and a raise!!",
                "This course has a wide variety of resources and office hours to assist learning. Professor Wooster himself had office hours 4 times a week and there were around a dozen TAs/TFs who had their own designated office hours distributed evenly across the week. This course does a great job of teaching many different core statistics concepts as a knowledge foundation for future courses in the major. That said, lectures sometimes consist of long derivations that are fun to learn but may hinder instruction of formulas and procedures that are used on assignments, which occasionally made coursework unnecessarily difficult.",
                "I thought the class was put together well, lectures were very helpful and psets were fair compared to what we were doing in class",
                "It is good, but the exams are challenging.",
                "Bob Wooster always writes his notes live, which is really great because the pace of the class is not artificially fast or slow. The exams are also fair. Some of the problem sets near the end could have been more challenging- some were just a collection of simple exercises in R for which we already had very analogous example scripts from class.",
                "Prof. Wooster is an amazing lecturer. His lectures were very clear and organized. The pets and exams were fair.",
                "Strengths: Professor Wooster is super patient and explains things very clearly. Hes also super accessible and hosts a lot of offices hours each week. \r\nWeaknesses: I think the homeworks, especially after spring break, were a bit too trivial and I felt like I didnt have as good a grasp on the post-spring break material.",
                "Strengths: Bob is a fantastic lecturer, interesting and pretty light problem sets\r\nWeaknesses: lecture was at Marsh at 9 am",
                "This course needed to move more slowly through less topics. In one semester we covered the entirety of the Rice introduction to statistics textbook, which meant skipping interesting ideas in each unit, meaning each statistical unit/framework (estimation, hypothesis testing, goodness of it, etc.) was grasped in less depth. Obviously there is not enough time to do everything, so rather than doing many things rather hastily, it would be better to do more proofs in class, and train students to be able to (re)produce proofs themselves. Another weakness of the course is that OH was basically reserved for working on Psets, and it was hard to find time to ask actual questions about theory (sometimes only Professor could answer such questions, and it was hard to get time to ask in depth when every OH became Pset Q&A). The strengths of the course were the underlying material, the hypothesis testing unit, and Professor Woosters overall upbeat, infectious personality.",
                "Strengths: Wooster is a good lecturer, psets are fair\r\nWeaknesses: couldve had more practice material for the big exams",
                "It is hard, 9am is terrible but the recordings were good.",
                "I didnt attend class but lectures were recorded and lecture notes were very detailed and explained concepts clearly, so it was easy to learn outside of class. OH was very helpful for PSETs.",
                "The format of the course made it easy to stay on track week by week.",
                "The lectures are a bit boring. I wish we looked at more interesting applications than fake R examples.",
                "Better tfs because there is so much material it is impossible to understand stuff after one go. Ed discussion and Professor Wooster help, but they arent always available",
                "I thought it was taught and structured well.",

                "All strengths, I felt like this course was really designed to facilitate learning well.",
                "Wish the lectures were a bit better organized, similar to 241. Was at times very hard to figure out what was the most important ideas to understand from a lecture.",
                "Bob is a really great lecturerhe explains things really clearly and doesnt assume a ton of math background (though ofc you should have taken calculus and 241). I had taken 241 a while ago and was still able to get up to speed quite fast,\r\n\r\nThe HWs were also really helpful and edstem responses were super fast",
                "Strengths: The course is well-organized and all the material follows a clear theme. I also liked the real-world examples used in lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes we spent a lot of time in class just going over R code. Since the level of knowledge of R required for problem sets wasn't super high, it was difficult to find the motivation to put 100% attention into following the lecture when going over code.",
                "I wish there were more engagement with the course in terms of meeting other students  maybe a peer tutor would be helpful??",
                "The course tries to mix statistics with proof-based mathematical rigor. The lectures are very proof-based while the homeworks are a mix of application and proofs. I didnt find the class that engaging and would have appreciated if the class had a faster pace and we had a better understanding of the course outline.",
                "NA",
                "Strengths: Dr. Wooster is a great lecturer! I really enjoyed this class taught by him, and I appreciated the abundance of practice materials made available before exams.\r\nWeaknesses: I did feel like the difficulty of the practice materials was not comparable to the difficulty of exams, so it'd be helpful to have more accurate materials going forward.",

                "Strengths: Wooster is really great, the problem sets are appropriate length and challenge and were always relevant to the course\r\n\r\nWeakness: the midterm tested topics that were taught that morning in class.  That was really unfair in my opinion.",

                "Pretty well structured and full, although I think the inclusion of R was not very smooth because it was mostly changing various parameters in the sample code, so not much learning about R was done. Granted, this course is not a course on R. It would be quite successful as an introduction to the R language though.",
                "Strengths: good professor, reasonable P Sets. Weaknesses: somewhat difficult class.",
                "Nice",
                "This course is very good at teaching fundamentals of statistics and expanding on a solid base of mathematics, as well as giving a basic introduction to R. I think it could perhaps have gone a bit more in depth on some of these things at the cost of breadth. I often felt that it was hard to really understand the details of the many many formulae we were given, and the occasional proofs were nice, but often approached with the perspective of needing to get through them when they were actually among the most interesting parts of the class. The r parts of the class could also maybe be expanded",
                "Professor Wooster was an amazing intructor. His teaching was clear and he gave me a solid understanding of the material.",

                "Very well-structured course--I liked the book and the flow of the material was great. I thought the exams were well constructed and appropriate to the coursework.",
                "I liked the material as it spanned many important topics",
                "Class time could be improved by spending less time on super detailed sections, with more emphasis on how things fit together. For example, the last class where we went over how everything fit together in the grand scheme of things was super helpful, so it would be great to have small tidbits of that sprinkled into regular classes.",
                "Robert Wooster made thorough notes in lectures and was active on EdStem, often forming long threads of back-and-forth Q&As. While the class moves quickly, psets are doable with the help of office hours, and the midterm and exam were both fair or even easier than pset problems. I walk away with a stronger intuition about the fundamentals of statistics, but I didn't always find lectures to be the most intuitive. In the second half of the class, lectures often finished with some demos in R, which I always struggled to follow or gain intuition from watching. Perhaps more static slides (ex. a graph of the chi-squared distribution at different degrees of freedom) and fewer live demos (ex. generating the graph live, but we can only see one at a time and might lose track)",
                "The distribution of the course contents is even, but different topics can be better connected.",
                "excellent, really good teaching",
                "There are too many technical proofs that do not matter. Assign them in the reading, spend class time doing problems more like our PSET problems"

                "Yes. Some probability theory is a pretty hard prereq; taking it without was pretty difficult for the first few weeks",
                "ABSOLUTELY, Robert Wooster is an amazing professor, super kind and understanding, and actually teaches the content in an understandable way compared to some older professors.",
                "I would only recommend this to student who are in the major/doing the certificate, as it is not an easy class. Professor Wooster is very good at explaining the material, this course was a lot better experience than S&DS 241 with Professor Wu.",
                "Yes, I definitely learned a lot",
                "Only if you're doing the BS in statistics. If you're an applied math or pure math major, this class isn't worth the time and effort you need to put in, unless you're genuinely interested in learning about why t tests or confidence intervals work the way they do, or other concepts you would see in 230 or AP Stats. The homework isn't bad, but 242 requires you to completely understand the concepts from class and be able to apply them, which requires spending a lot more time than you would expect digesting the material. Doing well in 241 is also not a good indicator of how well you'll do in 242.",
                "I would only recommend this if it is required, because the workload and challenge is extreme. However, you will learn a lot.",
                "If you are really interested in the subject or have a knack for statistics, go for it. But it is not for the faint of heart and prepared to study.",
                "Yes! I think it provides a great foundation for statistics which can be applied to several other classes",
                "Yes, I would strongly recommend the course. Wooster does an excellent job teaching the content in an approachable way; though, the course expects mathematical maturity (strong calculus esp). I feel much more confident using statistical models/inference (e.g. t-tests, chi-sq tests, bayesian stats). I took S&DS 238 before and felt very prepared for this course (slight catching up in terms of probability at the beginning, but very quickly, the stats focus in 238 aids you).",
                "If you're a stats major or applied math, then I'd reccommend the class.",
                "Yes, especially if Bob Wooster is teaching it",
                "Yes.",
                "If you are interested in statistics and are willing to take a more deeply mathematical approach, absolutely!",
                "I would recommend it to other students because this course introduced concepts of techniques of important statistical methods.",
                "Yes, if they need to fulfill the requirement for statistical theory",
                "If they like math approach to stats",

                "I took this course because I was required to as part of my degree. I generally wouldn't recommend it because I think it is really tough and for most people I think an applied statistics course is a better option. However, it does give you a foundation of some theory that you will need if you actually want to be a statistician. If the goal is not to be a statistician then choose an applied class.",
                "Yes. A must-take for those interested in statistics.",
                "No, unless they need it for their major. Even so, I might look at other options. The course is very difficult.",

                "Yes",
                "Yes! I think 242 is very well-taught for being a challenging course. Probably one of the most valuable courses to take in S&DS",
                "Yes if you want to learn some theory behind some stats topics you've heard of throughout your academia. Professors make or break the course. You definitely want to be taking stats with Bob. Bob sets a high standard for teaching talent. I tried to nominate Bob for the teaching prizes but it said that the professor had to have worked at Yale for at least three years, so you guys better nominate Bob in two years. Bob made lessons very illustrative and clear with constant examples and interweaving proofs and problems to great effect. Like an ideal math professor, Bob literally clarified almost everything he wrote down in the course, which proved super helpful during lengthy derivations. His notes were absolutely great, and he would always hand write them and update them timely. He always made a point to make sure everyone was up to speed and regularly solicited questions. Bob also did a great job constantly referencing topics from other lectures in a different lecture and tying similar topics together, which made understanding the context of a topic in the statistics universe a lot easier. He provided practice problems very relevant to exam content and difficulty, lots of supplementary information like illustrative examples in R, and held literally four office hours per week what the. Bob was elegant and quick on his feet when answering student questions, delivering them well formulated responses. He is kind, humble, welcoming, funny, responsive, and overall a great guy, one of my top three professors at Yale out of probably like 50 I've had. Yale's other STEM professors (especially math and stats, jeez) would do well to take a page out of Bob's book, and he is the ideal exact kind of new professor that will ensure Yale maintains its academic edge into the future.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness is that Bob is not teaching other courses that I want to take! (inference and machine learning and advanced probability) because the current professors leave much to be desired. I wish I could learn machine learning from Bob, this man would carry me into the future of AI. Did you read this review??? Give this man a promotion and a raise!!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course, especially for S&DS Majors. Especially after having taken one of S&DS 238 or S&DS 241, you will have a strong knowledge base for this class yet 242 has very little overlap, so you still explore and learn many different concepts in statistics.",
                "Definitely would recommend to stat majors, because it is a prerequisite for a lot of other interesting electives for the major.",
                "I took this CR/D/F as a non-stats major and still had a lot of fun!!",
                "Yes. The instructor is so good at teaching and the materials are very useful for future research.",
                "I would because it's required for the B.S",
                "Absolutely! The statistical inference content is applicable in a wide variety of disciplines.",
                "Yes",
                "If you have to take S&DS 242 for the major, I would definitely recommend taking it with Professor Wooster over other professors! Its absolutely a fundamental course in understanding statistics, and anyone interested in data science should absolutely take it rather than skipping to the application classes.",
                "The class is very theory-heavy, so only take this course if it is required for your major/prerequisite for other classes or if you are genuinely interested in learning the theory behind statistical methods.",

                "If they need it for the stats major then yes",
                "I don't think so. This class was hard and not very fun",
                "Yes, its a good introductory course to basic stats concepts like MLE estimates or constructing confidence intervals and really gets you familiar with stats notation and how stats thinking differs from traditional math fields. It definitely makes me feel more confident taking harder stats classes in the future.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I believe it gave me an understanding of the foundation of statistics.",
                "Yes, if you want to dive into stat",
                "Yes, good for theoretical understanding of statistics",
                "Don't take this class if you're not a stats major. Literally no reason. There are plenty more interesting math courses.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes if you are a stats major, of course. Could be an ok elective too.",

                "yes, very good professor",
                "Yes, especially if Professor Wooster is teaching.",
                "Yes, the professor is wonderful. Really cares about his students and learning.",
                "Yeah, if youre a SDS major. Its pretty conceptual stuff, so if youre just doing the certificate Im not sure this one is needed. 241 is probably more useful.",
                "Yes, even if youre not a stats major (im a CS major), if you are more quantitative",
                "I'd recommend this course to any student majoring in statistics, applied math, pure math, or computer science. It's a great introduction to some really important statistical methods. The computation is a bit heavy and some of the content is a bit theoretical, so be prepared for that.",
                "Yes, but it will be difficult.",
                "I didnt love the course but I guess its important to understand the derivations of the fundamental statistical tests. Most people already know a lot of this, though. Professor Wooster is nice.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I would! Specifically if taught by Dr. Wooster. He's a very clear teacher and you learn in a very coherent order about how to identify parameters, test hypotheses, and apply that in linear regression. The R component was also helpful.",
                "This course is pretty essential to both S&DS and math majors, so I would definitely recommend for students in either major.",
                "Yes. The topics covered are crucial in statistics",
                "No, the material is hard on its own and Bob doesn't have the right teaching philosophy or methods to make the material easier to understand. Lectures are useless and your best bet is the textbook.",
                "I would recommend it if you're interested in stats and want to understand more about the inner workings of how common stats methods work.",
                "Yes",
                "It's quite difficult but it will give you important information.  Do not take this if you are not a stats major, data science certificate candidate, or someone who is very quantitative by nature.",
                "Certainly",
                "Yes",
                "If you have interest in the derivation of tests and why test statistics fall under some distribution, take this. It might be good to already have experience dealing with estimation / error analysis in the context of labs or projects so that the hypothesis tests that are taught would seem actually relevant. Otherwise it might be rather dry.",
                "Yeah, for stats majors. It's a difficult course and the material isn't the most interesting, but unlike 241, this one is very well taught. The tests and homeworks are not terrible.",
                "too good",
                "Nice intro stats",
                "Most boring stats class of all time. Love you Rob, but it wasn't enough.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes. This course provides a general view of statistics and everything taught is very helpful.",
                "Yes, if you want a good overview of statistics this is a good choice, not too heavy of a workload and the professor is very good",
                "I would. It is so comprehensive, and I feel like I understand statistics so much better than before. I made my brain work!",
                "No",
                "Maybe, since this is the fundation course for a student major in math",
                "Yes, I think it is a great course to learn more about proper statistical practices and the applications are also very nice to see",
                "Yes. I took this course after having previously taken an introduction to statistics overview course previously and this course provides more in-depth and nuts-and-bolts understanding of concepts that get just an overview in the introduction course. For someone wanting to use or engage with statistics and statistical reporting in their career, this kind of theoretical course is a valuable opportunity to understand the subject beyond simple rules of thumb as often presented in intro courses.",
                "Yes, statistics is very relevant in todays world",
                "Yes! I walk away with better intuition on fundamental topics in statistics and working with samples. It's not a class where you learn how to do research in R on an arbitrary dataset. Instead, you hopefully gain the ability to explain and justify the steps in such a research task and be precise in your definitions.",
                "Yes, it is fundamental for learning statistics.",
                "yes, excellent",
