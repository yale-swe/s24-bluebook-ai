                "This course was very well designed and even for a student without a theology background it was easy to become involved and engage with the material. This course is definitely more history-like with a heavy emphasis on identifying terms and people. But it is structured in a way that is constructs a narrative that can be applied in a political science, global affairs, or religious studies dimension. Incredibly relevant material that helps students understand the conceptual background rooted in religious studies to todays current middle eastern crisis and terrorist groups.",

                "Strengths: great lectures, lecture notes are uploaded prior to midterms, interesting perspective on the Middle East presented through the lens of Islam, manageable workload, generous grading \r\nWeaknesses: none-- truly fantastic course!",
                "Strengths: material is super interesting, Griffel is a great professor; weakness: Griffel can go a little fast when lecturing, tough to get all the notes down. Exams are a little tedious but if you study the ID sheet well you'll be fine.",
                "I really loved this course. It was incredibly accessible and engaging. My only suggestions are that at times I wished we moved slower (it was physically difficult to write notes in that class so if anything highly suggest typing notes), and I wish the content was organized chronologically as opposed to by country. It wasn't until the end of the course when I was studying for finals that I was intellectually able to \"connect the dots\" on broader themes/movements/events we learned about throughout the region, but it felt jarring jumping around from country to country and not having a cohesive timeline.",
                "Strengths: I really enjoyed the option of writing a 5 page versus 10 page final paper. At times, section would feel pointless because we would just be discussing historical facts. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have preferred for the Professor's slides to have been posted before the midterm or final, because despite attending all the lectures sometimes I missed information. Also, sometimes it felt like we were being tested on completely negligible or niche information. For instance, we would be expected to know a number of historical figures while barely having discussed them or their significance in class.",
                "Exam was too focused on memorization",
                "Strengths: great lecturer style, knows his stuff, makes all the terms and people to identify flow logically and paint a narrative\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes boring discussion sections, very fast speaking during short lectures",
                "The course's material was incredibly interesting and displayed in a very informative and productive way that truly engaged me in the subject.  The only weakness in my opinion was the format of the exams, which relied almost entirely on memorization of terms, some of which felt very barely relevant to the course matter (and were mentioned for less than a minute in the lectures).  Overall, a very well taught course.",
                "strengths - very enriching, good summary and survey of Islam and Muslim countries today. review sheet is provided for exams, paper is chill. prof griffel is quite a good lecturer. sections are helpful\r\n\r\nweaknesses - exam review sheets are way too long, we should not have to memorize esoteric terms and names that we would forget quickly after the class, more emphasis should be placed on important concepts. lecture notes should be given contemporaneously to aid student learning, rather than posting them only a few weeks after to make sure people take notes.  readings are way too long and should be shortened, else most people just skip them",
                "strengths: cool professor, very interesting and relevant subject matter, cool readings, pretty easy, you get to choose when to write the essay and you get a second chance if you don't like your grade\r\nweaknesses: went overtime in lecture every. single. class. because of information overload, there are so many names/dates/unfamiliar words that it is impossible to truly grasp all of it, a lot of assigned readings (but you don't have to read them all in depth to do well)",
                "The strengths are that the lectures are very straightforward and easy to follow and the readings are helpful to supplement the lectures. The only weakness in my opinion is the mid term and final being too memorization based.",
                "The strength of this course was how it steered away from a US centric approach that most courses at Yale dealing with Islamic affairs end up with. The weakness, however, was for example the first class where the history of Islam was brushed over in a few minutes. I would recommend the usage of a more modern English translation of the Quran for example The Clear Quran by Dr Mustafa Khattab when displaying Quranic ayahs in class and also giving more context to the ayahs because otherwise it looks like the typical Orientalist and Islamaphobic strategy of cherrypicking verses for their own benefit.",
                "The greatest strength of this course is the level of organization. Lectures are clearly presented, come with helpful written materials, and reading materials are largely relevant and generally interesting.\r\n\r\nThe greatest weakness of this course, in my view, is an occasional lack of clarity on how representative certain ideology or doctrine is to common Islamic practice. This class focuses on jihad and fundamentalism, and as a non-Muslim without particular familiarity with Islam, I could not always tell if a particular concept only applied in the context of terror or political Islam, or if it was more generally relevant.",
                "I think it was great, the readings were interesting and the lecture material was strong.",
                "Strengths: interesting course on great topics \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the midterm and final are terribly structured so all you do is memorized hundreds of terms. Should find a much much better way to evaluate the student's understanding. Have me memorize hundreds of dates was entirely useless and not helpful",
                "This course was very well taught and lectured. There was very clear course progression which clearly identified different periods and understandings of Islamic thought, and how this conception has grown and changed. Really opened up and clarified concepts that may be distant for us to understand, in a manner that was balanced and elucidative.",
                "I really enjoyed this course even though I decided to take it more last minute. Professor Griffel is really knowledgable and clearly passionate about the subjects. I think that it was well organized! My biggest change would be to move the Al Qaeda week before ISIS and also to imbue more of the philosophy final week throughout the semester. It felt as though the ending was not inconsistent with the rest of the course but was a bit of a turn away from the radical extremist conversation of the immediately post-9/11 world.",
                "I thought the sections were very helpful for learning and review lecture info. I think the only major weakness of the course was the lack of Quranic info. We were learning about jihadi and radical ideas but never reviewed excerpts from the Quran itself.",
                "The course is incredibly insightful into the content and the professor is very well structured to give a good survey of the Muslim world.",
                "This was in general an incredibly well-structured history class. The topics were engaging and compelling, and the professor provided ample resources and time in order to complete the assignments. There were times when the course topic itself felt constricting-- non-extremist movements were minimally discussed. I would have loved more discussion on premodern Islamic thinkers and their attitude towards religious questions. This class inherently discussed Islam in reaction to colonialism, and the depth of historic Islamic thought was thus briefly mentioned. This, though, is not a flaw in the teaching.",
                "Very engaging and interesting",
                "Strengths: Griffel is an engaging lecturer and the TAs are great. Material is also very interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like the name for the class was a bit clickbaity (jihad), and as a Muslim this bothered be a little. Also every so often the Professor could make comments about Islam and the Quran that seemed a bit problematic but for the most part he remained objective.",
                "I wish there was little click-baiting but other than that well-designed class.",
                "The lectures were extremely interesting and I loved listening to Professor Griffels take on historical events and their significance. If I could list one improvement to make Id ask for a slightly greater emphasis on recent historical events, however the nature of the class must be centered around Islam, so Im not sure my suggestion would be appropriate for this specific class."

                "Absolutely yes! This course is one of my favorite that I have taken at Yale. The lectures are incredible and informative, and the readings enrich what we are learning in the course. The workload of the class is highly manageable and the grading is generous. Professor Griffel is insightful and a skilled lecturer who cares about his students. I cannot believe how much I learned in one short semester-- I now feel that I am fluent in discussing terrorist organizations when before taking the class I didn't know the difference between Hizbollah, Hamas, and Isis.",
                "Yes if you are interested in learning about the Middle East. I do not recommend if you are not interested in the topic as there is a lot of exam prep and readings.",
                "Yes, totally!",
                "Yes. Pretty easy throughout the semester. But you have to be prepared to do a lot of memorization for the exams.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning about Islam and the Middle East from a (slightly) less Western perspective. If you have time to devote to the readings you can probably get more out of the course.",
                "Yes! Just be aware that the exams are challenging and require a ton of straight memorization of upwards of 200 terms.",
                "absolutely! this topic is neglected by most students but it is so important to understand Islam so as to contextualize what we observe and hear in the media in the larger context of how Islam has progressed and evolved. however be warned that there is a good amount of memory work involved for the exams. other than that, it is a solid survey course that will make you learn a lot about Islam and its progression.",
                "Yes, because I definitely learned a lot about the subject material.",
                "Yes, I would! Great way to learn about Islam without too much work. Great HU/SO distributional credit as well. We learned about Islam in the context of case studies on various countries in the Middle East region: Syria, Egypt, Afghanistan, India/Pakistan, Turkey, Israel/Palestine, etc. The unit on terrorism and jihad in the present day was particularly interesting to me! The class did not require much work besides 1 5-page paper, a midterm, final exam, and discussion sections. Discussion section with my TA were very summary-based so honestly did not have to really do the readings to really participate. Prof Griffel's notes are very thorough and are what the exam is based on so knowing them very well is enough to thrive in discussion section and the exams, which are very memorization-based. This is made much easier by his review sheet of terms to know which are taken straight from his lecture notes, which he posts around exam time.",
                "Yes!!! Not enough people in the world are well versed in what Islam actually is. although the quantity and unfamiliarity of the course material might seem daunting, it is a pretty easy class",
                "I would absolutely recommend the course, I found that the course really got me thinking in new ways about religion and politics. It also gave me a deper understanding of what is going on in the middle East.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students but they should be ready to think critically about everything in the course even what Professor Griffel says in lectures.",
                "I absolutely would. Islam Today is one of the most informative classes I have taken at Yale, and Professor Griffel is brilliant. I learned a tremendous amount about the rise of the Reformist movement in Islam, and how its multiple subsidiary theologies have given rise to modern-day Islamism and terror groups. As somebody who came into class with only the most rudimentary knowledge of Islam, I think Professor Griffel did a good job ensuring that the course was accessible while refusing to be simplistic and delving into details and contradictions. I learned an astonishing amount, and anybody interested in terror or political Islam should take this course.",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes. It was an easy humanities credit that was interesting.",
                "I absolutely would -- I think it brings great exploration and understanding in a field often undercovered to Western audiences. It explained and synthesized it in a way that is both reachable, yet intellectually stimulating. The way the course was structured -- through brief historical accounts of the progression of Islamic political thought in different areas of the Muslim world, combined with a modern look into particular areas and their conception of Islam and Islamic politics, was excellently covered. I thought the course was well taught, balanced, and offered fresh perspectives. Regardless of major or interests, I think this is an excellent course to broaden your understanding of the world.",
                "Yes! It is really interesting and the reading is not too much each week. I enjoyed our discussions in section and thought the expectations were quite fair. Really good survey course of many different countries in the Middle East and South Asia also if you do not have much exposure to those.",
                "Yes it was very well organized and I learned alot",
                "Highly recommend. The professor was excellent and the material is great to know",
                "Yes! It's a relatively low-work class that I highly recommend to anyone with vague interest in the topic. It will likely challenge preconceived notions-- in a good way-- that many hold about Islam. I would say, though, that I recommend engaging with the TF or professor on certain topics to get a more well-rounded grasp on non-extremist aspects of the religion. Would make a solid fifth class.",
                "Yes, it is very insightful and helps you to better understand the world",
                "Yes! But not if you just want to fullfill your preexisting negative notions of Islam. Muslims are also often discouraged by other Muslims from taking this class and as a Muslim myself, I highly recommend you take it! Your voice and perspective matter and are much needed to review the lesson material in a critical way.",
                "Yes, super interesting with a great professor and low workload",
                "Yes if youre interested in actually learning about Islam and politics rather than the what you hear in the news",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to everyone at Yale. I was blown away by how little I truly knew about Islamic religion and its influence on the world, and I learned information in this class that I will take with me moving forward. This class ignited an interest in me that I appreciate sincerely. The class was very easy to stay engaged with, and I truly loved it."
