For those who want more than the surface level presentation of these issues in the media, it is a good class.",

The topics are interesting! \r\nWeaknesses: it would have been nice to have more regular opportunities for class discussions; we also barely got any feedback or grades throughout the semester",

I do wish we could have had a little bit more debate in class (maybe a smaller classroom would've facilitated that better), and having more feedback would've been helpful as well.",
                "Improves your discussion and presentation skills",
                "The course definitely skewed towards the pro-globalisation camp, and oftentimes I felt that there was not enough critiques of neoliberalism and explorations of globalisation outside of traditional economic theory, and personally I feel that a course titled Debating Globalisation should explore other perspectives in greater depth.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a though we submitted work every week, we got little to no feedback, and got no instruction about our final pape, which is good for some students but can be a bit disorienting for others.\r\n\r\nHowever, I really enjoyed how current events focused the course was, and how flexible the class was in responding to global events.",
                "Strengths: Very logical order and classes build up on each other, establishing theoretical frameworks and then analyzing contemporary topics \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No feedback, quality of each class depends on student presentations"

If you are interested in taking a broad view of trade from an economic, political, and historical perspective, then this class is for you - if not then you won't enjoy it as much. I have found this class really bolstered my understanding of a lot of international issues in the world today.",
