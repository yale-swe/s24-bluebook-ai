Professor Ho structured the class in a way that led students through the process of writing a history paper by breaking the process down into multiple parts. It connected really well with the content which touched on different aspects of Hong Kong and Chinese history such as education, women, and economy.",

                "This course had great readings, especially the books (Carrol, Chen Village and Chan). The way the writing assignments were organised (three smaller essays, each a part of a longer history essay) were extremely helpful for the final paper. The course is also varied in its academic subjects: Primarily history in the first half, social sciences in the second. Workload was manageable and fair.\r\n\r\nI do not have many complaints about the course. The only aspect of which I was not quite sure were the weekly reading responses. While I understand that they were meant to make sure everyone did the readings, apart from a few mentions of them in class, they often felt quite disconnected from the section discussion. Reading them, it felt like we were all talking past each other. Maybe a different reading response format that would make it feel mroe like a discussion woudl ehlp the responses feel more integrated. Maybe having part of the class write a response and then having the rest respond to those would work. Or maybe a format similar to \"The Conversation\" in the NYT where students meet in groups of 2-4 each week and write a log of their conversation on the readings.",
                "strength: Prof. Ho's curation of reading assignments is one of the finest and most interesting I have had, and I am a History senior. I truly appreciated their breadth and depth; Prof. Ho's passion and expertise on the topic made this class so insightful and fruitful. The level of support and feedback she gave to each of us was also unparalleled -- with the written assignments, she really helped me re-examine my own writing and pushed it to the next level \r\n\r\nweakness: none. It's a superb seminar",
                "discussion can be more guided. Maybe it's better to give feed back digitally",
                "Professor Ho's seminar was insightful and probably one of the most useful courses I have taken at Yale. The way she structured the writing assignments were helpful and made the writing process easier to understand and improve. I definitely learned a lot about specific events in Hong Kong and Chinese history, especially focusing on Shenzhen. However, I think if we had more time I would have loved to be able to get a deeper understanding of both individual histories to see how they connect. Of course, Professor Ho does assign a reading that summarizes Hong Kong history in 200 pages or so, but as someone who came into the class with less background, it was a little challenging to keep up.",
                "Strengths: highly engaging, organized, readings are relevant and interesting, the professor gives great feedback, class discussions are exciting, the professor created a supportive environment where people felt comfortable sharing their opinion in class. Weaknesses: lots of assisgned reading.",
                "Good primary materials, but can be a bit much to go through.",
                "I believe the strengths would be the professor's choices of this course's structure, the choice of diverse historical journals\/data\/books\/news-pieces that would reflect the whole picture of what happened and would potentially happen to the land of Hong Kong. I enjoyed this course very much and I believe it was my favorite in the past semester. The only thing I believe could have been bettered was that the discussion leaders should have planned orders of discussion topics, and followed them categories by categories, in order to keep the whole course constituent and engaging at all times.",

                "Yes. I think it is more accessible to many students than other East Asian History courses because it requires no knowledge of previous history. If you are willing to do the readings, it is a great course. If you are lucky, the course will also include grad students, which helps keep the level of discussion quite high. If you are interested in China or Hong Kong, I would recommedn taking thsi course.",

This was not an area of history I was particularly familiar with, however, the course is balanced just enough that you are challenged without feeling left behind. Would certainly recommend.",
                "Yes.",

I came into the class not knowing anything about Hong Kong and left being able to engage in high-level conversations about Hong Kong in history and in a modern-day context. This class went chronologically, which really helped me learning.",
                "Yes. This is a great overview of Hong Kongs history for those who are interested in studying it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a great course to understand the pre-modern to the modern history of Hong Kong and relations to mainland China, as well as to the West. Hong Kong is a window for Asia to the world, and it's also a window for Westerners to understand China as well (also a great opportunity for mainland Chinese students to learn about their Hong Kong counterparts).",
