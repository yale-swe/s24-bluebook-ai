                "I learned how to read texts through the lens of influence, which means better understanding how any given work fits into a broader historical & poetic context. This way of reading poems will undoubtedly shape how I read texts in the future -- paying special attention to the allusions, edits, or callbacks to poetic predecessors.",
                "The influence poets had on each other and the poets who came after them. The anxiety of influence and how this \"need to outdo the past\" affected all poets. I was exposed to a range of \"canonical\" poets from Shakespeare to Whitman to Stevens.",
                "A cohesive understanding of how poetic influence has evolved from Shakespeare to the 21st century. Also, I was able to perfect my close reading skills.",
                "Talking about poetry and how to build my analysis skills and poetry senses",
                "I read many poets that I hadn't read before and improved at literary analysis, writing essays, and noticing influence. I learned more about what I like and don't like in poems, and became a better reader and writer of poetry.",
                "This class gives an extensive survey of English poetry from Shakespeare onwards through which we read many great authors -Milton, Blake, Wordsworth upwards of Ocean Vuong. \r\nMost importantly, we got to understand how centuries of western tradition tied together in constant renewal of age-old poetic tropes. We learned to detect echoes of poets past in each new poem we read , which is a worthy analytical skill to develop.",
                "I will never be able to look at poetry the same after taking this class. Soles confirmed what every English teacher said in high school but never proved: that yes, the poet/author was thinking about all of that while they were writing.",
                "I developed the ability to trace poetic themes and motifs across centuries of poets. The western poetic lineage feels much clearer and cohesive after this course, and I feel confident in my abilities to develop poetry and understand what has influenced my own writing as well. I also developed a completely new approach to reading poetry after this class  I feel like I am able to consistently parse out the poet's stance towards the medium of poetry itself through their work."

            "comments": [
                "A huge strength of this class is Professor Soles. He brings a great energy, wealth of knowledge, and genuine excitement to class. He picked classic texts, some of which I had read before, and instilled them with totally new life. He also gives incredible feedback on essays! No weaknesses beyond the fact that it's just one semester.",
                "The topics we discussed and poets were read were terrific. On account of the thick syllabus and the class sometimes falling into long but fascinating digressions, however, it often felt rushed and like we weren't able to spend as much time as the poems required. Maybe next time there could be fewer poems or a 2x1.15-hour schedule would be better.",
                "This course was not for me. I like class discussions that naturally evolve and go in unexpected directions. Professor Soles knows exactly what he wants to tell the class before he has entered the classroom (and which Shyamalan-esque twist he will end with), which means that student comments are often only interruptions in the flow of what is basically a lecture. There is little room for students to disagree with any of Soles' views.\r\n\r\nThe poetry itself was interesting, although Blake's Milton was a misguided selection; it took Professor Soles two classes worth to even explain the poem and we were all still confused. This was unfortunate as we remained about two weeks behind for the remainder of the course, which meant our weekly discussion posts (which were not two weeks behind in subject matter) had no bearing on that week's class discussion.",
                "Strengths: The course covers interesting material from a fantastic range of poets. The syllabus is great. The reading load for each week is very manageable. The discussion posts from each week are pretty laid back and allow you to experiment with your writing. I always looked forward to doing the readings each week because of the great selection of poets!\r\n\r\nWeakness: Professor Soles is great, but the class often felt like a high school English class. People were often participating for the sake of participating and not at all listening to each other or Professor Soles's questions. I would have loved it if Professor Soles controlled the conversation a bit more and prevented the class from going on too many non-related discussion points. This class may also be better suited as a more advanced seminar. In addition, we had a great syllabus, but it often felt like we never went into enough detail/depth on each piece. The whole class felt rushed and the analysis sometimes felt very superficial or over-extended. I would have loved to spend more time on each piece. Another issue with the class is that it has a large Bloom influence. Professor Soles talks about Harold Bloom almost every class. While Bloom was a major figure in literary criticism, the class felt very biased toward the \"Bloom\" perspective, and as a result, all the analysis we did in class felt a bit narrow and not very encompassing of the broader literary debate. It felt too much like regurgitating the western \"canon.\" I think in the future, it would be great to include more secondary voices in the conversation about these poets (especially more about the pushback against Bloom's perspectives). Finally, a major problem with the class was that Professor Soles did not have enough time to devote to the class. Due to his busy teaching schedule, he had to delay two out of our three papers so that by the last week of class, we only had one graded assignment with feedback! I understand that his schedule was busy, but without feedback on more writing assignments, we could not improve our writing over the semester. I think I am not the only student to feel a bit frustrated with the pacing and organization of the course. While the idea for the class was great (and I love the syllabus!), I think there is still a bit to be done before students can truly engage with the course and its material. This class has so much potential, and hopefully it will get better in the future!",
                "The course was very well thought our discussions were quite entertaining and thorough. Unfortunately, we were able to get to maybe half of the poems that we read, but this wasnt really a weakness as we use those poems to help us understand how to read the other works By the poet. This class also gives you a good chance to refine your close reading and writing skills.",
                "strengths: professor soles knows a lot, is an engaging seminar leader and makes times for his students, it's awesome to read so much great poetry. weaknesses: 2 hours without a break is a lot for this kind of seminar so would have been nice to have a break. class was pretty big so was sometimes hard to find an opportunity to speak",
                "Strengths: class discussion, readings, workload, professor engagement \r\nWeaknesses: organization (lack of clear syllabus)",
                "The course is discussion-based, which was fun, engaging, and illuminating. The readings were well-chosen: each poet had read all the poets who came before him/her on the syllabus. I liked all of the readings except Blake, but I'm still glad I learned about him because I like some of the people he's influenced. Soles also laid out some frameworks for approaching poems and influence, which were interesting and useful.",
                "Strengths: Readings , Discussions Post , Class Discussions, Professor engagement, Feedback on assignments\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes , I wish we had more time to dedicate to some authors. I think this class might be better off with 2 classes a week rather than one, potentially.",
                "The only weakness was that we didn't meet more often. Every seminar was fun, educational, and academically stimulating and I can honestly say that it was the highlight of my week.",
                "The syllabus selection of this course was excellent, and Prof Soles had clear mastery over each text that we read. The guidelines and structure of discussion posts was ideal in facilitating student engagement both with the professor and with one another. The course felt slightly too large at times and because of that, it felt difficult to have continuous conversation/idea development between students during seminar."

                "This is a class that involves close reading with little to no context. If you are someone who feels that poetry and literature are better understood in context, do NOT take this course. Any mentions of gender and sexuality were EXTREMELY awkward and misguided and at times borderline inappropriate. (Instead of simply calling her an unmarried woman, Professor Soles called Emily Dickinson a \"spinster.\" Multiple times. He also said that, rather than being a bisexual or gay man, Walt Whitman was attracted to everything and everyone, including himself. He then extended this description to Emily Dickinson as well. It felt REALLY weird.)\r\n\r\nPeople idolize Soles, especially DS first-years and post-DS sophomores and this worries me. Professor Soles knows what he is going to say from the moment he enters the classroom. At times I felt like he didn't want people to raise their hands because he wanted to make his predetermined points. There was no room for disagreement with anything he said. If you like lectures disguised as seminars, maybe this is for you.\r\n\r\nWe were behind by two weeks for almost the entire course, and each week we would read poetry that we sometimes didn't discuss until two weeks afterward. Because of this, motivation to read the poems and complete the discussion posts was low. We ended up having to work on our final paper and final project at the same time because of how behind we were. It was a frustrating situation.",
                "No, not in the current state of the course. The class was extremely disorganized and I barely received any feedback on my writing. Class discussions were often very superficial and felt like a high school English class. I hope that in the future, the class can be better developed to be more challenging for students and provoke more thoughtful discussion. I really liked the syllabus and the idea of the class, but I was definitely disappointed with its execution this semester.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to someone. I did not come in having studied a lot of English or poetry, and I still really enjoyed the class. It helped me refine my close reading and writing skills, and professor Soles gives some of the most thorough feedback of any professor at Yale.",
                "YES 100%",
                "I would recommend this course. Prof. Soles is a wonderful professor and this is a great way to learn about a range of poets, many of whom have influenced a lot of writers across genres.",
                "Yes, I definitely would, especially if they havent read much of famous English poetry. Its a wonderful course to get a strong base knowledge of poetry and to read cool texts.",
                "I couldn't recommend this course highly enough. Professor Soles is the single best professor I have ever had. He balances teaching with inspiration with comedy in a way that makes the course an absolute delight.",
                "Yes! This course is a brilliant way to give yourself a very unique yet holistic understanding of Western poetic tradition."
