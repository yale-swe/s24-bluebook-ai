    "I improved spanish grammar, reading, and writing, as well as speaking.",
    "I learned:\r\nHow to cut down on my mistakes\r\nClarify my grammar\r\nVary sentence structure",
    "This course taught me the necessary grammar and vocabulary to speak, read, and write spanish at an intermediate level.",
    "This course was a solid review of the material covered in SPAN 110\/120, with the addition of complementary grammar and vocabulary.  You learn to understand simple, primary sources in Spanish (with plenty of readings and videos) along with building your conversational skills.",
    "I learned how to better speak, read, write, and listen to Spanish using legitimate Spanish tools, like a movie and a book while grasping a stronger hold on the grammatical rules of the language.",
    "I got a lot better at reading and comprehension",
    "I learned a lot about spanish as a spoken language and a culture. It was very helpful and helped me grow.",
    "- Accent proficiency, reading novels in Spanish, conversational fluency",
    "Everything I know about Spanish verb tenses was reviewed thoroughly and I even learned about some new ones.",
    "Good knowledge of intermediate spanish."

   "comments": [
    "I think that more emphasis needs to be put on speaking.  All other aspects were covered well but it would be better to spend class time speaking than going over powerpoints of grammar that we could learn on our own outside of class.",
    "Strengths:\r\nPure repetition\r\nFocus on grammatical structures\r\n\r\nWeakness;\r\nToo much busywork",
    "This course could be improved with clearer instructions on the tests and quizzes. Also some of the required readings were far beyond the L3 level and required students to look up entire sentences at a time.",
    "Strengths: this course is a rigorous building of language.  The professor (Sebastian Diaz) was fabulous and understood how we would actually learnby making mistakes and not being afraid to speak up (always in Spanish) in class!  In addition, the readings and films we watched were level-appropriate and formative in building advanced skills.\r\nWeaknesses: the workload this class demands is simply too high.  Class meets every day and on some weeks homework was >1 hour per night.  For a 1.5 credit class, this is almost too much work, and the department should reconsider how it spreads out workload.  That said, the pacing of the class was never too fast and I felt comfortable learning the grammar.",
    "This was a good course, there werent any weaknesses",
    "Diaz was a great strength and made the course awesome. \r\n\r\nThe cons of the course included the short time to read the book.",
    "Strengths: helpful workload, balanced curriculum that supported engaged learning and progress\r\nWeaknesses: paperwork was not always engaging",
    "Very thorough"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, for someone wants to learn Spanish in a far more holistic\/driven environment than their high school class.",
    "This course is fine if you are required to take it for a language.",
    "If you're looking to concretely build your Spanish skills and understand the workload, yes.  TAKE THIS CLASS WITH SEBASTIAN.  He's an amazing professor who respects his students but also understands their other responsibilities.  I honestly think he made the classit could've been a struggle with someone less knowing of how students learn a language.",
    "I mean, if you have to, then you have to. It takes a lot of time but by the end of the course, you will be pretty good at using conversational Spanish and could probably live in any Spanish speaking country.",
    "Yes, very good course",
    "Yes! Great course",
    "Yes - it provides a helpful platform for continued Spanish learning.",
    "Yes, in my opinion everyone should be required to learn Spanish and this class does it very well.",
    "Yes"
