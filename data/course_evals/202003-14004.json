Super interesting topis about ethnography, dance, and the different ways of thinking about Movement. This class was especially relevant after restrictions from COVID-19 restricted movement. This class made me think about movement in a much larger view than Newton's laws or choreography. Although we were remote, Professor Coates did a wonderful job engaging the material to the medium we were\/are in. This class was the first place I began to creatively consider how we can move beyond\/within the Zoomsphere and how to break the Zoom mold.",

                "Strength: Collaboration and wide-range of students coming from different fields to encourage different types of conversation. Cross-Curricular topics. Guest lectures were PHENOMENAL.\r\n\r\nWeakness: It was a movement-based research class on Zoom. Professor Coates did a great job engaging with this fact and working to create new experiences through the digital medium but at the ed of the day, it was a class on Zoom which is a huge weakness.",
                "Weaknesses - slightly better organised class discussion and weekly assignments. I felt sometimes that, because we were pursuing our own interests, class lacked rigour \r\n\r\nStrengths - readings were really interesting. The structure of readings was also great. Every week my mind expanded a bit as new insights were added.",
                "Professor Coates is an amazing teacher. She is patient and understanding, she cares for and is interested in her students, and teaches well across so many registers at once, guiding the class in synthesizing social science research, artistic practice, and personal experience into meaningful wholes.",
                "I like the class structure a lot. It's very clear to have different topics every week along with readings, assignments, and in-class discussions. The readings are abundant and intriguing. The assignments are thoughtful and interesting. The discussions are engaging and thought-provoking.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness is that the class has to be in the virtual form. I'm curious about what the class will be like if we are in the dancing classroom."

                "This class is one of the more difficult ones to translate to a virtual format. However, I think Prof. Coates did an incredible job at keeping us engaged and constantly learning given the limitations. She incorporated the physical and interactive elements of the class into her teaching, which I very much appreciated.",

                "This was the class in which I felt most physically present this semester. We took time to breathe, to be with each others bodies, and to experiment with all kinds of ways of emulating physical accompaniment through a screen.",
                "It is challenging to move a movement class to Zoom. It would be better if the class can keep some in-person parts especially when we have the movement exercises in the class and I personally feel more comfortable have discussions in-person. There's one time a visiting artist asked us to go out and there's another time we're having break rooms and moving the computers around. It's nice to go out and move around during a Zoom class and maybe it's an interesting way to have class outside or while waling."
