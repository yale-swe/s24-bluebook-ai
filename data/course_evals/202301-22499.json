                "I probably would vouch for the 2 term thesis over the 1 term option; I was quite time-constrained w/ the 1-term option and felt like I could have undertaken a more ambitious project had I had the extra semester.",
                "My independent project was one of the highlights of my Yale career: I learned so much, both relating to my subject and to academia as a whole.\r\n\r\nThat said, the philosophy department can (and should!) do more to cultivate a collaborative environment. Students should be encouraged to share their projects with other students and professors casually, if not in a formal thesis working group like in the religious studies department. Philosophy could also inaugurate thesis awards to motivate hard work and bring together its students under shared goals and landmarks. It would be great for the thesis to not be a solitary effort between student and adviser, but rather something in engagement with the department as a whole."

                "I highly recommend taking the 1 or 2-term senior thesis option; I know it's not a requirement for the major but I found it an incredibly fulfilling and exciting experience to take so much ownership over my own academic project."
