Weekly participation in the discussion section also significantly improved my improvisational speaking skills.",

By using the drama Misaeng, I was able to improve my understanding of Korean business politics and also learn more Korean business words. This class also taught me a lot about traditional Korean tales, and these tales allowed me to have a greater understanding of Korean values.",

                "By far the greatest strength is the professor who is very caring and understanding of every student. Despite the virtual barrier, the class felt like a community and the learning environment was very relaxed, allowing for everyone to improve at their own pace. There are very few weaknesses, except that some assignments may feel like busy work. I could benefit from an occasional vocabulary quiz, since I found it difficult to quickly incorporate new vocabulary into my vernacular.",
                "strengths: fun class, professor is literally the best, fun assignments\r\nweakness: some assignments take way too much time",
                "Definitely the most engaging professor I've had so far. She's incredibly supportive and caring, and the TF discussion section was so much fun. Even if you're terrified of being cold-called like me, the classroom environment was definitely so good that I eventually didn't mind at all. \r\nI didn't mind the homework load too much, but sometimes it got a little tedious. The positives definitely outweigh the negatives in this class.",
                "Strengths:\r\nThis course had different types of engagement every day which was critical to learning more and diverse vocabulary. I was able to speak with my professor and fellow students on a range of topics while also learning at the same time. I did really enjoy breakout rooms and group work, especially during the pandemic. It allowed me to get closer to some of my classmates. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nI would have loved to have more grammatical work just to keep refreshing on different structures.",
                "While I found the assignments challenging enough to build my proficiency, I also felt that they were manageable in terms of workload. I also appreciated the pacing of the course leading up to the final assignment, as the course was structured so that students built up to the research assignment with weekly check-ins, which also helped the workload feel distributed over the course of the semester."

                "Overall I thought the course made the most of the virtual format - discussion sections still served its purpose of fostering conversations and classes were run smoothly thanks to screen sharing capabilities of Zoom. Every assignment and lesson plan was properly prepared for virtual instruction. I can't particularly think of aspects of the course that need to be improved with respect to virtual learning.",

                "I believe that the breakout rooms and group work succeeded to an extent. It was difficult to find time to meet, but that time was spent making new connections. I will say that the time went quickly on zoom, and I believe that we could have spent more time engaging in conversation on some days. I also believe the access to resources on Canvas was critical and really helpful when reviewing work."

The course is genuinely fun and has a relaxed, welcoming atmosphere but you will still get a lot out of it, in terms of improving your writing and speaking skills and your understanding of Korean culture. The professor alone makes this course worth your time. The workload is very manageable and doesn't take up a large portion of your week.",
