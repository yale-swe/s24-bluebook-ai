    "I thoroughly learned what descriptive and substantive representation is, and the literature around minority representation. I also learned different research areas pertaining to education policy.",
    "I learned quite a few things by taking this course:\r\n\r\n1. How to manage my time effectively in order to complete all assigned readings\/ reading responses\r\n2. The relationship between descriptive representation and policy decisions\r\n3. The shortcomings in many studies and literature regarding the academic achievement of students of color.",
    "Wow.  This course was spectacular.  We began the course studying the meaning of representation and how it comes to fruition in our political system.  Then we spent some time looking at the actual political system.  Finally, we switched over to the various bureaucratic and systemic educational practices that either help or hurt representation in inequality, and looked at the effectiveness of each system.",
    "I learned about the philosophy of representation and how racial representation has proven to impact education policy and education outcomes for minority students in U.S. public schools.",
    "Understanding data and qualitative v quantitative, general representation theory",
    "I learned a lot about the varying types of representation in government, classrooms and on administrative boards and their varying impacts on education policy."

   "comments": [
    "The discussion of this class was always amazing, and always flew by due to how invested and engaged everyone was. Professor Miller was an absolute delight.",
    "Strengths: The content covered was VERY interesting and the discussion style of the seminar allowed for students to provide their perspectives, informing my understanding of the readings.",
    "This course was strong because Dean Miller made sure that everyone's voice was heard. She also assigned very interesting readings that pushed me to think heavily about many topics. This course could have been improved if we did not go off on as many tangents. I think some of our conversations needed more purpose.",
    "No weaknesses - great course with interesting readings and assignments."

   "comments": [
    "YES. AMAZING. This course will no longer be available with Dean Miller as she's moving back to Princeton, but I'd say it's worth a shot if Yale offers it again with a new professor. However, I do think Dean Miller was one of the reasons it was so amazing.",
    "Yes, it was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale!",
    "If this course was being offered again, I would definitely recommend it to other students. The topics of race and representation and how they intersect with education\/ed policy are very important areas to understand. Also, it is important to remain critical of the institutions and systems put in place for people of color, and this is what this course challenged me to do.",
    "Yes -- it was a wonderful look into education policy and representation.",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course if you want to learn about racial representation in politics overall (granted that this is the only course at Yale that has touched upon this) or if you really want to talk about how race impacts education policy.",
    "Yes!!! Amazing class and professor.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! Dean Miller will not be here next year but this was a fantastic course so I hope someone teaches a modified version in the future."
