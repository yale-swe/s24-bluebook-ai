Obviously you can't cover EVERYthing but this was so interesting for me and Prof G is such a funny professor and prolific storyteller. From Elihu Yale to Hale to the Morses to more modern day Yale history, this is definitely a fascinating class. There is particular emphasis on how Yalies have shaped the world in different industries and made 'Yale' a true global name.",

                "Jay is a Yale gem - he will speak almost the entire class, but it is very entertaining. He plans some fun adventures including going to Mory's, the graveyard, and a song and dance day about Cole Porter.",
                "this is a great course! no exams and not a lot of work, but you'll learn a lot about Yale history. The final paper is a great way to explore something cool about Yale that you're passionate about",
                "I only have minor suggestions for this course because I really did enjoy it. I think if the professor could utilize Canvas to post readings and images for class, that would make things a lot easier - Prof G likes to send seven or eight emails (no joke) each week with thoughts and pdfs and sometimes the emails get buried. Also the list of assignments on the syllabus is not really accurate - there were other random things we were asked to do like timelines or summaries or readings that weren't listed in there.",
                "Good readings and its clear which are necessary and which arent, Professor Gitlin is passionate and infinitely knowledgeable about the subject. The discussion could be better sometimes, but overall a good course.",
                "Fun course Gitlin is great but not a lot of discussion. Would appreciate more opportunities to participate",
                "Strengths: fun, lots of cool facts and topics, not much work, few (and fun) assignments but very comprehensive feedback on ones we had, very engaged instructor, really a one of a kind class - we had field trips, lots of activities etc\r\nWeaknesses: expectations were not always clear, sometimes class lacked structure",
                "Pretty much all strengths, Gitlin teaches the course well and its great to have perspective of someone who was a Yalie himself and lived through some of the traditions we are learning about!"

                "I highly recommend this course for any junior or senior, even non-history majors! Prof. Gitlin is an absolute gem and his stories alone are worth taking the class. The final paper is a bit long (15-20 pages), but very doable and even a little fun. Take this class if you can get in!",
                "This class is amazing! If you get the opportunity to take it, do not pass it up. I learned everything about Yale's history and got to write about some fascinating, old student traditions.",
                "Absolutely, Professor Gitlin is the best!",
                "Absolutely. Fabulous class and great professor!",
                "Yes. Professor Gitlin is a personality but ultimately endearing and thoughtful. If youre curious at all about the subject matter, then definitely. Also the final paper can be a really good way to better understand the archival offerings at Yale (something I didnt think I wanted at the beginning of the semester, but I now feel like a much better researcher).",
                "Absolutely! If you have any spark of interest in Yale history, Prof G is the man to talk to. And if you don't (why on earth not?), take this class and you will.",
                "Yes! Prof Gitlin is worth taking a class with no one loves Yale or cares about his students more",
                "Yes! This is such a classic Yale course. It is a load of fun and really unlike any other class I have taken. It also has a very low workload. We sang songs, did a tour of Yale spots on campus, saw archives - always something new! Be prepared for lots of fun & unexpected topics/activities!",
                "yes, entire course is really fun. last paper is tough if you don't like long papers but not too bad if you start early enough. Gitlin is best part of the course"
