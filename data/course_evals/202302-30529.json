Class time is mostly devoted to establishing definitions and a few quick practice problems and most of my intuition for problems was built through working through the problem sets. I think this could be either a strength or weakness of the course depending on the student.",
                "The pace of the earlier course sections is managed quite well. The abundance of office hours was also highly beneficial, as both the professors and teaching assistants were patient in addressing inquiries. There was a strong sense of engagement in the classroom. One possible suggestion, as we progressed to the later sections of the course, the pace accelerated and the material became more extensive and diverse, it is a little bit hard to catch up.",
                "The material is clear",
                "The homework assignments were nearly impossible to do with only the knowledge provided in the lessons and textbook. The lessons were confusing and the professor often made mistakes or didn't know how to explain a topic. The TAs were better equipped to teach the class and often had to interrupt the professor to correct him or explain something in an understandable way.",
                "More TA office hours, walkthrough of pset type questions in class would be very helpful too",
                "Strengths: lots of knowledge condensed into a short period of time, I found that I learned at a much higher pace than any other course Ive attended\r\nWeaknesses: quizzes were considerably easier than question sets, which I found a lot of difficulties in doing.",

I feel that the professor was not prepared to teach this course. There were some concepts that I already understood prior to taking this class that he taught in this course. If I did not already have a background understanding of those concepts, I do not think I would have been able to understand them at all based on his explanation of them.",
