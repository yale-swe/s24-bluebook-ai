                "How to analyze visual works, how to create projects from beginning to end, some instruction in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign (though this instruction in Adobe may be dependent on your TAs). How to navigate architecture critiques, basic architectural terms (plan, section, elevation), architectural conventions. We were exposed to famous works of art (paintings, drawings, buildings, film, etc.) that helped shape project ideas.",
                "I considered how we have designed the world that we inhabit (at the scale of the individual, building, city, and globe), as well as the ways in which the world has shaped us. The course presents a wide range of precedents that are aimed to inspire students before they design their own projects. I learned to conceptualize original creations and execute my ideas, giving them physical shape in a meaningful and (hopefully) artful way. In the process, the course introduced me to various methods of making, including by hand (drawing, carving, modeling), and on the computer (Rhino, laser cutting, Photoshop, Illustrator).",

            "comments": [
                "I wish lectures were more engaging throughout rather than just at the end. More discussion of the reading assignments. The midterm report was super helpful!",
                "I absolutely loved this course! The lectures were extremely interesting and generative. The sections were well structured to help us develop our concepts and execute our deliverables, and we were given ample time for each assignment. Although some students expressed projects having too quick of a turnaround, I felt that we had more than enough time when we worked progressively - the projects just weren't conducive to being done last-minute. Each project was both extremely challenging and rewarding, and I loved seeing everyone's varied end products. I was so impressed by the high level of engagement of the students this semester, which is a testament to the course structure and content. \r\n\r\nI have a few critiques about how the class could further be improved. Firstly, the assignment descriptions were wordy and theoretical, which could translate to them being quite vague. I needed repeated clarification on the parameters of some assignments, and would appreciate a bit more concision, or at least a concise through-line of the theoretical part as opposed to just the deliverables. Also, I wish there was a better way to form teams for assignments 3 and 4. We were asked to form teams extremely quickly (sometimes in a 24 hour turnaround) for those assignments with people in our sections, but we had no way of contacting each other for the most part. I would have wanted a partner for the final project, but I had no way to contact anyone until after the deadline for team formation.",
                "Strengths: Readings were fairly interesting, lectures were engaging. TAs will make or break the course - since there is a 2 hour section once a week with them where they will ask you about developing ideas/help you with ideas. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not a lot of contact with the Professor as this is a lecture course. Sometimes felt deadlines were crunched. Projects that used Rhino or other software were mostly self-taught.",
                "One of the greatest strengths of the course was the teaching: Bimal's lectures were amazing, the TA's were so helpful, generous, and committed, and the opportunity to get feedback in studio critiques, pin-ups, and in reviews was enormously helpful/rewarding. Another strength is the chance to learn and be inspired by classmates. The course asks that students share their work at various stages in the creative process, allowing you to marvel at and draw from the talent of a creative group of classmates.\r\nA minor weakness of the class was that I would have liked a bit more practical training in the various methods/softwares beyond the tutorials.",
                "I think more official training on the technical aspects like rhino and Adobe suite would have been beneficial, as not everyone came in having these skills.",
                "There is a lot of independence in this course which I think can be nice but can also be overwhelming. We are also required to learn a lot of programs while completing other assignments. I think it might be helpful to have more smaller assignments at the beginning of the semester that focus on one thing and then they could become more open ended as the semester goes on.",
                "Pros: Fantastic TAs (who I will miss dearly!),interesting lectures, engaging projects prompts\r\n\r\nCons: Last minute changes/updates to section times that wouldnt have been possible to make if my schedule had been busier, lack of communication at times about what to bring to section/assignment prep, often went overtime for crits. \r\n\r\nSome outside professional critics were confusing/were unable to give productive/professional feedback and should not be asked back again  the TAs (and their peers that were often invited to critique work) did an absolutely fantastic job with feedback, and should be implemented into the curriculum as critics in the future.\r\n\r\nFor the assignments (4 total), I would highly suggest raising the class budget to $200 like other design courses. Out of all the design courses Ive taken, the materials for this class was by far the most expensive, and could prove a hindrance to accessing resources/fully realizing a students vision.",
                "you learn by making but sometimes the prompts were very open-ended, philosophical, so it was confusing at times to produce projects with a short turnover rate",
                "Love the assignment prompts. Very individualized feedback from TFs/in-class reviews are incredible. Lectures very interesting, though not always directly related to prompt. Huge time\r\ncommitment",
                "I wish some of the critiques can actually listen and try to understand students' projects before they start criticizing them.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bimal and the TFs were beneficial, the assignments were organized, and the reviews provided clear and valuable feedback.",
                "Strengths of the course are the teaching staff, the grading, the lectures, and the assignments. Some things to improve would be moving lecture so that it doesn't take up all of lunch and including a short break in the middle to ensure continued engagement.",
                "The overall structure needs a massive overhaul as project guidelines in the end were unclear and grading, by extension, made no sense."

I would warn that this course requires full engagement, and what you put into it is what you will get out of it. That being said, the workload isn't overbearing, the slow weeks balance out the fast ones. If you have any interest in the material - go for it!",
                "Take this course if you are 1) a prospective architecture/Computing and the Arts student or 2) generally want to spend a lot of time working on projects/learning software. Projects will be very time consuming, so ensure you are ready to dedicate the time to them. Projects were interesting and intellectually stimulating - especially rewarding and educational is seeing what your peers produce. At the end of the course you are required to make a portfolio, so you will have a presentable way to show your work if you need.",
                "Yes,  this course was a fantastic introduction to creative work. It pushed me to take risks in the execution of my ideas and offered me the opportunity to learn both by thinking and doing, as well as by seeing my classmates creations. It was a ton of fun (and work), and it proved to be so rewarding!",
                "Absolutely, if you like design and are willing to work!",
                "It is required for architecture students so yes. I would still recommend the course to non-majors because I think it is worth taking but it is a lot of work and time so people should prepare for that.",
                "Yes! Fantastic class overall with a few promising tweaks, this would be a wonderful course to take if youre interested in intensive architectural design.",
                "yes if you enjoy quickly physically prototyping philosophical ideas. no if youre expecting a STEM focused or engineering course around scales of design",

                "It might seem like a lot of work on coursetable, but they're all very fun and hands-on. Definitely take it if you have a chance to do so.",
                "Yes. If you are interested in design/architecture and learning how to use Photoshop, Rhino, Illustrator and other software this is the class to take.",
                "Yes! It makes you think in a totally different way than other courses and forces you to get hands-on. The lectures are incredible and the TFs are so very helpful. I love that everyone puts their all in but doesn't have to worry too much about grading. The atmosphere of this class is really wonderful.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course because whether a student intends to major in Architecture or not, building models uses a different part of the brain than essay writing or solving problem sets. This balanced my variety of workload this semester.",
                "If things improve and the TAs are good, yes. Otherwise, it's quite a bit of work for what feels like little to no payoff."
