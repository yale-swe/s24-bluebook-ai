                "I had no idea what phenomenology was before this course, and now I can kinda give a wishy-washy elevator pitch about it. That feels like huge progress. We worked our way through phenomenology starting with its roots in German traditions and extending it alongside various queer, feminist, and decolonial perspectives. My most important takeaway from the course has been working phenomenological practice into my own engagement with philosophy; it has become a valuable tool for recognizing the borders of things and the historicity of those borders.",
                "I learned a lot about the philosophical tradition of phenomenology, as well as close reading, and the practice of embodied reflection more generally.",
                "greater understanding of phenomenology, both through texts from the traditional western canon of the phenomenological tradition (Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, etc.) but also more recent works from phenomenologists such as Mariana Ortega; how to write continental philosophy papers.",
                "I learn a lot about phenomenology in contemporary use.",
                "This course was a remarkable introduction to an interdisciplinary approach to philosophy. I am incredibly grateful to have learned about phenomenology from Professor Khawaja, whose background is in Religious Studies.",
                "I learned the continental history of phenomenology. I also learned about contemporary works of phenomenology that scholars trained in continental thought find legible according to phenomenology's genealogical roots."

            "comments": [
                "Perhaps a bit more direct explanation as to how some of the more complicated frameworks we've read actually function.",
                "The syllabus for this course was great; all of the readings were fascinating, and we clearly followed the trajectory of the phenomenological tradition as it has evolved through the years. Discussion posts on Canvas nicely complimented seminar, as they let us get some ideas on the table before we even walked into the classroom (which was critical as there were MANY ideas to discuss). Everyone in the seminar contributed meaningfully to my experience, but I wonder how discussions might have changed if the class size were slightly smaller.",
                "For those interested in phenomenology (or continental philosophy in general), this course is nearly perfect. There is a lot of reading, and it is tough, but if you are interested (and it is super interesting!) it really pays off. Professor Khawaja does a great job of anchoring the course in the 'traditional' phenomenologists, but really centering more recent, diverse critical theorists for the bulk of the course.",
                "strengths: Prof. Khawaja is wonderful, and very knowledgeable. Her office hours were super helpful, and she was very understanding and conscious of the intimidating nature of phenomenology, which she accounted for in her style of seminar (e.g., not picking on people)\r\nweaknesses: i felt that the discussions did not always have a clear direction, and were quite dominated by grad students at times. I'm not sure exactly how, but i feel that students would have benefited from more lecturing perhaps, and ways of making sure everyone contributed so that the material could feel a bit more accessible",
                "The syllabus set up was not the best, however, overtime students adapted to the classroom.",
                "That this course was a mix of graduate and undergraduate students means that seminar discussions were often dominated by the voices that have engaged with this material for a substantially longer period of time. Though this was incredibly informative as someone who is very new to phenomenology, this environment made extensive verbal engagement rather daunting. The undergrad section facilitated by the TF was a helpful way to allow those students that were hesitant to participate in the main seminar setting to ask whatever happened to be on their mind while working through a week's readings.",
                "I thought this was an excellent selection of readings. I enjoyed reading from Husserl forward (very thankful we skipped the idealists in retrospect), and I appreciated reading feminist and queer phenomenologists. I also appreciated the subtle grouping of postcolonial philosophers within the broader context of phenomenological thought."

                "Yes! If you are interested in continental philosophy (or are interested in philosophy and find most PHIL courses too dry, rationalist, or analytical) you should take this course. Professor Khawaja really knows what she's talking about and the material is just fascinating. Be ready to do a ton of dense reading, because it's only worth it if you do the reading, but trust me that you will be glad you did.",
                "yes, but only if you are interested in phenomenology, and are comfortable with not understanding texts, letting knowledge kind of wash over you. i felt like my understanding of this class almost took the form of osmosis, whereby I let things wash over me without understanding them, and by the end of the class, had absorbed certain pieces of the material which I felt more familiar with, but not all. the texts are very complex, and we go through a lot of them, so I think it is unrealistic to expect to leave the class with a lucid, holistic understanding of \"phenomenology\" itself. That being said, it is worth it for the little insights you get! E.g., now I can kind of say that i understand Heidegger, which is pretty cool.",
                "Yes, one of the most important classes in continental philosophy at Yale.",
                "Yes, if you're willing to fumble over readings that may initially seem elusive. I will say the amount of reading material assigned for a given week was often much greater than what is considered manageable for an average undergrad course.",
                "Yes. The student would need to be an ambitious, careful reader to succeed. They would also need to be self-motivated since many of the readings feel dense and unimportant. Even if reading was a pain, Dr. Khawaja made me appreciate the granular level of detail. That detail makes a world of difference sometimes no pun intended"
