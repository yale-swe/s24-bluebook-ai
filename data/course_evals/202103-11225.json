                "The lectures I felt did not prepare us for the problem sets. The instruction was unclear and I felt like the class could have more cohesive organization",
                "Three presentations for each student within one single semester may be too much.",
                "Strength: I think Sophie and Bob are both very engaging lecturers.\r\nWeakness: I feel like we can go more in-depth in the state-of-the-art models. Also, we only three assignments, covering more basic models. It will be more exciting to get hands-on experience on building more advanced models (though we sorta experimented with those in the project section). Takes quite long to grade assignments (in fact I still haven't gotten the grades for our last assignment)",
                "Strengths: Mix of lectures and actual paper reading was novel and good; I enjoyed actually having to read papers from the field for the course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: (1) Disorganized -- we are still missing grades for assignments due pre-Thanksgiving break and as of the CDF deadline were missing over 60% of our assignment grades. We were told we would have 5 psets, we only ended up having 3 b/c of delays and extensions  (2) Psets are very difficult and time consuming because they are basically massive debugging exercises that feel incredibly disconnected from the lectures themselves. There should be a better way to connect them. (3) Pset design: Psets are ~20 questions each, with each question building on the previous one. This means you're kind of screwed if you get stuck on question 6 or something. Other classes I've done have had like 3 separate questions which makes this a bit more forgiving (e.g. 3 questions with 6-7 subquestions each). (4) Lack of instructional staff -- only two professors for a course that feels like it could use a ULA given how strong demand for help during the week before the pset was due was. This would make a big difference.",
                "Strengths: The material was cool. Bob and Sophie are clearly passionate about the topic, and lectured in an engaging/interactive way. \r\nWeaknesses: The course was a little poorly organized. There were only three assignments the entire semester, covering material which had been presented months before. Some of the material was difficult to digest, although that might have been due to lack of prior knowledge.",
                "This semester the course was incredibly disorganized. We were supposed to have 4-6 assignments and barely got 3. The grading takes forever, and many people skipped class because it is not related at all to the assignments. The content itself is fascinating and the lectures were great, but the rest of the course is lacking.",
                "It's a very interesting course, but sometimes if you get lost in one class it might be hard to get back on track for the next class. The topics are extremely interesting, but definitely make sure you understand programming before taking it.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Frank and Sophie are phenomenal instructors who made every lecture engaging and very clear in explaining the concepts at hand.\r\nWeaknesses: The low workload (three assignments in one semester, plus the presentations and final project) meant that the course became an afterthought at times, and we alternated between periods of heavy homework and none at all. Assignments' releases were often delayed"

                "Good introduction class.\r\nHowever, if you have already taken one or more ML/NLP classes, I won't recommend. This class doesn't teach much beyond basic neural networks and gives cursory introduction to some of the state-of-the-art models, without discussion much about their implementations/details.",
                "No -- see the reasons provided in \"weaknesses.\" Too disorganized for now.",
                "I hesitate to recommend this course because the organization was a bit lacking. Although the material itself is very interesting, and Sophie and Professor Frank are very passionate about the topic, it felt difficult to learn and retain the information. The assignments themselves were well-designed, but there were only three assignments the entire semester, the latter two of which covered material from months prior. Hopefully this will be fixed in future iterations of the course though. I also thought that putting all the journal presentations at the end of the course made it difficult to engage with the course since I couldn't understand many of the papers. It felt like those who got the most out of the class were those with prior experience in the topic.",
                "I think that it is an ok CS elective. If you are interested in data science and want to learn more about neural networks you should. The final project allows you to explore something in depth which is great practice. However, I wouldn't take the course just because. It is so disorganized that you will probably get frustrated.",
                "I would definitely recommend it. If you're lacking in one of the pre-required areas, you can make up for it, but only if you put in all the work. The good thing about this course is that it mixes so many subjects in one.",
                "Yes. If interested in NLP or ML in an application area, this course may be as good as it gets."
