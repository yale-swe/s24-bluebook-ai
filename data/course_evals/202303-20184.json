                "strengths: Dr. Morrison -- his lectures at the beginning, our visits outside of the classroom, the most positive learning environment, class discussions, readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes readings were tough, wish we got a little more background before diving in",
                "I think the course was run extremely well! The nature of the course is that we cannot go too, too in depth on anything, but I thought the move from specifically medicine related texts earlier on to more philosophical texts later was great.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Morrison's enthusiasm about the material and his care for students; the balance of readings that span philosophy, literature, and clinically-focused physicians' experiences; field trips to the Marsh Botanical Garden, libraries, and museums; Dr. Morrison's personal anecdotes from clinical practice.\r\nWeaknesses: not enough time given for group discussion of the readings; discussion sometimes felt like a back-and-forth between students and Dr. Morrison rather than an organic development of each other's ideas; more guidance on the writing assignments would also have been helpful.",
                "This course was wonderful, and I looked forward to every classwhich I really can't say about many other courses I've taken. The majority of students were pre-med, but I think it's a good class to take even if you're not. The class (a seminar) was more or less structured as follows: Dr. Morrison lectured for the first 2/3s of each class, and the latter 1/3 of each class was a group discussion. Dr. Morrison is a great lecturer so I didn't mind this, but I do think this structure could be amended to make class even more engagingand to take greater advantage of the seminar format. For instance, the lecture could be interspersed with discussion. Ie. the lecture could take up the whole class, but students would share their thoughts throughout. On the whole though, the course was awesome. I especially appreciated the many field trips.",

                "Yes. For any student but especially for premed students. Dr. Morrison is a physician interested in implementing humanistic thought in healthcare decisions.  It brings forth a very important and necessary part of the job that may be overlooked elsewhere. The course readings are very interesting, and the guest speakers were great to hear from (ie lisa sanders, henry marsh). As a STEM major, I enjoyed writing the papers for the class.",
