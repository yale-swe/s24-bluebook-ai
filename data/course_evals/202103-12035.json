It was pretty relaxed. You may stay up late-ish working the day before a critique but thats just a handful of days. The rest of the days there is absolutely no work done outside of class. I found it so fun exploring different mediums like charcoal and just creating pieces that had their own style and look. Cant recommend it enough, especially senior year. Its very cool to experience  art space at Yale too if you never had before",
