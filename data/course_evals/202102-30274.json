                "Great course, the professors were wonderful and the course's pacing was manageable. Occasionally the assignments were difficult to understand because they were only communicated in Spanish. Also, I found cold calling a more effective way to complete in class activities, rather than waiting for volunteers, if only on Zoom to keep the group moving.",
                "I understand that the course had an immense workload because it was an intensive summer course but the course organization didn't help with this workload at all. (Sorry to directly compare instructors but one's method of organization was much more effective than the other's which makes comparisons inevitable and necessary.) Yelsy often ended the class with a slide telling us the work we needed to do to prepare for the next day. Sonia ended class by giving a quick, verbal rundown of assignments in (rapid) Spanish. I usually understood every 5th word of this. Even when the amount of work was the same, I left classes with Yelsy better prepared to tackle the workload because I didn't have to search to find out what I needed to start on. \r\nI also think more thought could be put into the assignments. Our first oral assignment for the class was to research and then discuss a painting (in Spanish). We were not allowed to look at any resources during our presentation and we were only given a day to prepare (not even because we got the information at noon and then presented at 10 the next day). Because of the set up of the assignment, it's impossible to give the oral presentation without literally memorizing facts and reciting them in class. Which I can only assume was NOT the intention. If I was allowed to speak on a topic I was already knowledgeable about, I could practice my fluency and fluidity in Spanish. For example, in English classes, students are rarely expected to give a presentation\/speech without any notes for a subject they know little to nothing about. The set up for this Spanish assignment felt counterproductive and occurred throughout the course-- especially for these oral assignments, which were all set up that way. \r\nIn terms of strengths, the combination of assignments worked really well for me. In one day, I would practice vocabulary and basic grammar on Supersite and then I would write a longer-form essay\/post and read a story. This variety in assignments allowed me to grow in fluency and develop my reading and writing skills all at the same time. I also thought the blog posts worked well by allowing us to work on our writing in a low stakes environment.",
                "The course definitely improved my comprehension of spanish and my comfort in speaking. It was really fast-paced and I didn't feel like there was always enough space to ask questions or enough review of concepts in class (this might be part of the zoom experience).",
                "It would have been better if it wasnt all online because the it was a lot of time spent staring at a computer screen. The teachers found a way to keep everyone involved with the content and facilitated learning effectively though.",
                "Online setting is tough, but this course did very well for being online.",
                "The main strength is also the main weakness. It is a very intensive class! I wasn't able to put as much time as I'd hoped into other projects\/summer work, but because of how intensive the course was I ended up learning a lot. \r\n\r\nMore strengths are that the professors are both very kind and supportive, and they worked really well together. Their energies balanced out perfectly. I also loved how much I learned about various Spanish speaking cultures, which I didn't expect going into the course. The course structure had a lot of variety which made it constantly engaging and fun. I loved all of the mini projects we did as a class.\r\n\r\nAnother weakness that comes to mind is that the blog project was a bit hard to understand when it was initially explained, but after the first entry it was very clear and fun to do.",

                "Yes! Especially if you can take it with Yelsy (and Sonia too, but she's retiring, so I don't think that'll be possible). Obviously for a lot of people it'll just be another graduation requirement, but if you put in the energy and the work, your Spanish will seriously improve.",
                "You probably don't have a choice. But you do have a choice in when to take this course so my suggestion is to take this during the year rather than over the summer. I imagine the workload is intense during the school year but it was downright miserable over the summer to the point that I took shortcuts that aren't conducive to learning Spanish, because I didn't have the time and energy to fully devote to each assignment.",
                "I would recommend this course if you truly want to learn Spanish or need the language credit. The professors were incredibly kind, but it's definitely a grind. It's a lot of work and you need to keep up with the concepts as you go in order to do well on the exams. Overall though, totally doable and you'll learn a good amount.",
                "If this student is interested in Spanish and has a understanding of the basics, I would recommend this class to them.",
                "I definitely would. I would warn that it's not easy, but if you want to improve your Spanish it is really well structured and fun. Also the professors don't want to see you fail and as long as you are engaged and ask for help you will get support.",
