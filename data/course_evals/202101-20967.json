                "Strengths: The syllabus was well-crafted, with the course gaining more complexity as the semester went on. I think concepts were clearly explained in lectures, and the professor and TF were always understanding and available. Weaknesses: I really wish there were examples included with the homework prompts; since almost all of us were drawing certain things in certain ways for the first time, that would've really helped. There was also so much work, I don't think it was intended to be a lot of work but it was.",
                "Strength: The TA was great. \r\nWeakness: This course is supposed to be for people with no experience in architecture but the content actually assumed a lot of background knowledge that wasnt clearly instructed.",
                "I think this course suffers a lot from being virtual this semester getting to be in person and watching the professor and TA actually draw in person would have been hugely helpful. One of the assignments in the course was a 'daily themes' assignment, where we were instructed to do a 15-minute drawing every day for the duration of the course. While I love the spirit of the assignment, I wish that we checked in and talked about these drawings during the class because I ended up falling pretty behind a couple of times.",
                "The drawing assignment were very fun! They did take a lot of time and the daily drawings were really difficult to keep up with, especially with the amount of time and effort needed for the large weekly assignments.",
                "Strengths: extremely fun, very open, great material and professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: nothing comes to mind other than the work being time consuming, wouldnt say this is a weakness but rather an attribute to drawing",
                "I appreciated the range of assignments and flexibility of being able to draw a variety of subjects. Could be improved by having better process for showing more of the instructor's work and other creative inspiration. The expectation for the quality of work expected of students was also fuzzy, so establishing these expectations in the beginning would have been helpful."

                "I think this course would've been a lot better in a non-covid year, so take this with a grain of salt. I would recommend this course to another student if they want to be an architect, I think they would gain useful skills. I would probably not recommend this course to someone who simply likes drawing; it's so much work, and you need proper motivation to do 20+ hour drawings of stairs. I would also only recommend taking this course in a semester with a light course-load, I only took 4 course credits this semester and it felt like too much work.",

A number of students dropped the class midway through the semester because the workload was too great. I want to note that even if you find drawing fun, drawing with drafting tools (which comprise about half the assignments of the semester) is not especially fun and very work-intensive. This is really a formidable class, so if you aren't really interested in going into architecture, this probably isn't for you. \r\n\r\n(Additionally, the materials cost a lot of money...)",
                "I would if you are an architecture major or interested in learned how to represent space and structures through in person drawings. This course feels essential for those interested in the subject as it has taught me a lot about the ways architects draw, as well as proper techniques and practices universal to the field.",
