   "comments": [
    "All the teachers are excellent in their own way. While you will undoubtedly develop favorites, each sensei's personal teaching style is effective for learning grammar. The strength of this course is its structure. Very well-organized. The only issue I had is that sometimes the teachers will cover vocabulary or grammar structures that aren't in part A of a given lesson. Also, even though some of the homework assignments say you have to practice the CCs before you do the utilization, not all of them do, so sometimes you will struggle through the utilization until you realized that the necessary grammar structures for it are in the following day's CC.",
    "strength: incredible teaching staff and perfect student to teacher ratio that really helped me learn in the best way\r\nweakness: i did not particularly like the JSL textbook we used",
    "There are not really any weaknesses with this course. The sensees all really want you to suceed and are willing to help at any point.",
    "For speaking part, it might be good to have casual speaking sessions with other students while\/after watching\/listening something fun.",
    "I think this class is very well organized. I liked how students were exposed to many different instructors because learning to communicate with different people is very valuable in learning a new language.",
    "Classes are very engaging, the routine of homework assignments and tests is nice\r\n\r\nReally fast-paced and should maybe slow down.",
    "The strengths of this class include the engagement of the professors with the students.",
    "It was a great course with good structure and I learned a lot"

    "Of course! While it does have a lot of work and you must be willing to do that work on a daily basis, the sheer amount of skills you gain and the pace you gain them at is well worth it. While I felt that doing every single possible assignment (especially those that you don't hand it) was not feasible with my schedule this semester, I encourage you to do the daily drills and take the eavesdropping serious. Not doing so will really hurt your listening comprehension. The instructors are amazing and really care about their students. You can't go wrong with Japanese.",
    "i would definitely recommend if they have an interest in learning japanese and the culture. it is a great program with some of the most amazing faculty on the campus that really care about you and want you to learn. they are all easy to access and make themselves available to help you.",
    "If you want to learn Japaneae, this is a very fun way to do that!",
    "Absolutely! Although there was a lot of work to do, I learnt a lot from this course",
    "Yes. If you want to learn Japanese, I think this class is amazing.",
    "Yes if you really want to learn Japanese you will in this class",
    "I would recommend this to another student while also informing them of the increased amount of work required to succeed in this course.",
    "Yes! Its a wonderful class"
