I always felt like I could send him an email if I had a question or felt like I wasn't performing well. The study halls the night before class are usually quite helpful as well. \r\n\r\nMy main complaint with the class is the large discrepancy in student abilities based on past chemistry experiences and the advantages given to students based on friend groups and residential colleges due to the flipped classroom format. To do well in this course, you must (emphasizing must) have a group of friends who understand the content. If you don't, you're bound to underperform. I wish this weren't the case, but the flipped classroom style and Sapling homework assignments essentially require you to have friends who've taken chemistry before, which I think is quite unfair. The class would be better taught if Sapling were not used for homework assignments and if the teaching method were not flipped classroom. The current method gives great privilege to kids who took organic chemistry in the past, which I did not.",
                "The flipped classroom makes it more difficult to learn the material, since Tim expects you know all the material and does practice during class.",
                "This course definitely has a ton of work. This is not necessarily a strength or a weakness, just something that has to be advertised appropriately to incoming students. Do not take this course if you have never seen orgo before and you already have a rigorous courseload. I had never done any orgo before this class and was surprised to see a ton of kids who had already taken a whole year (some less, some more) of organic chemistry. It goes fast - very fast. The lectures do not stop and wait for questions. But, after rewatching and taking the time to study previous material\/lectures, it is definitely doable. There is also a ton of homework every week (really, every day). Some of it is tedious and unnecessary. Other parts of it are helpful. The TAs are amazing - I am speaking only on behalf of my TA, but he was extremely helpful and very approachable.",

The first midterm was very straightforward, but the second midterm included a few problems we've never seen before in class or had enough practice with (#1 and #4a). The third midterm also had a question that was a bit unclear (#2a), since the epoxidation reactions didn't give any solvent, which would've been helpful for predicting the product since the solvent is usually involved in epoxidation reactions. Overall, I think there was a sense amongst the students that the tests have been increasingly testing us on things we haven't seen before or weren't fully explained in class.",
                "The course moved way too fast. With the pre-class assignments due before each class and weekly sets, I felt like I was just trying to keep up with all the assignment rather then actual learn anything. One strength is the study groups that were created for the course; they were extremely helpful.",
                "There are a large amount of resources (study hall and discussion sections) to help the study understand the content. Classes are also very interesting as they are more brief overviews of the content and instead focus much of what was found in readings to interesting applications. \r\n\r\nProblem sets were done on sapling which could at times be rather frustrating; however, in general it made the process fairly simple.",
                "Strengths: passionate teacher, helpful teaching fellows, a lot of collaboration amongst the students; Weaknesses: flipped-classroom format hindered the understanding of difficult concepts",
                "I enjoyed the flipped classroom model and found it very valuable to encounter difficult problems in class and be able to work through them with my peers and professor. At times I wish there were more lectures in class, especially for harder concepts. There were plenty of opportunities to get help from the professor during office hours, work one-on-one with TAs and peer tutors, obtain practice problems, etc..",
                "I think this class fosters a really deep understanding of organic chemistry (such that when you're doing problems or in lab, you haven't just memorized reactions or patterns or what not but really why something occurs). The Sapling homework is helpful in getting a basic understanding, but it can sometimes be finicky and it is not very relevant to assessments. However, with the reading from the textbook, homework, problem sets, discussion section, and lecture, it does take a lot of time but it is worth it in gaining the understanding. I will say that sometimes the flipped classroom model actually made things a little harder, as it felt like I hadn't mastered the material before class and then was trying to do problems or hear about reactions much beyond what I knew already.",
                "One strength of this course is the fact that there were TA's who had discussion sections and held study halls and were all available to help at some point. The peer tutors were also very helpful and very ready to meet with students. One weakness of the course was that the lectures came after the textbook readings and sapling problems that we were supposed to do, which made it hard to complete the sapling problems many times. Sometimes there were also technical difficulties with sapling which made it time-consuming.",
                "Strengths: Tim goes through interesting examples during class which helps us build a better understanding of the concept. The TAs are very helpful for explaining things and are very responsive.\r\nWeaknesses: Tim doesn't go over some of the concepts we read in lectures, so there may be unsettled confusion. Some exam questions can also feel like a surprise but are usually doable.",
                "A strength is definitely how understanding the professor is. However, I find it stupid that we have to pay to do our homework and problem sets. I also never learned anything from the homework\/ psets because the questions were just bad from the publisher.",
                "Strengths: Prof Newhouse. He is genuinely one of the kindest, most passionate, yet chill professors I've had this year. I also think the TAs and the organization of discussion sections was a strength. It was very easy to pop in and ask questions or work on problem sets together.\r\nWeaknesses: Flipped classroom teaching. I think it did more harm than good - lectures ended up being more concept-focused anyways.",
                "Flipped classroom model was not the most conducive to online learningit only added stress and more work in a time of hardship.",
                "Strengths: Professor, TAs, and peer tutors were incredibly helpful and supportive; collaborative set-up of the classroom; discussion sections helped clarify material; the content; practice exams were pretty indicative of what would be on the exam\r\nWeaknesses: P-sets and pre-class assignments on Sapling; this class was 3x\/week for 50 minutes which didn't feel like enough time when it came to midterms; Loudon textbook isn't too student-friendly unless you're incredibly comfortable with chemistry",
                "This is a very self-motivated class due to the flipped-classroom style.",
                "This is definitely a hard class, content-wise. I think the professor and TFs did a good job of providing resources for class and ahead of each exam, so that we felt pretty prepared. However, I was not a fan of the flipped-learning method, wherein we were expected to learn the topics from a textbook, then immediately apply them in class. For a class where most of the information is new, it wasn't easy to gain an understanding of them by reading out of a book, and I would have preferred being introduced to them in class, in addition to doing practice problems from previous lessons. As was the case, it was sometimes difficult to keep up, and I would not fully understand the live classes until I went back and watched them later.",
                "Strengths: Good practice content for the exams. Professor Newhouse knows the content very well and will answer any questions. TFs are very responsive to emails and\/or questions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: During a lot of classes we'd go into breakout rooms and try problems on our own before doing them with Professor Newhouse but most of the time my team and I would just sit in the breakout room confused and it was an discouraging way to start the class. I would much rather prefer to just see Professor Newhouse do example and then have people ask questions along the way. Sometimes the TFs wouldn't understand problems either which just led to more confusion.",
                "The strengths are the office hours and the study hall with peer tutors and TAs. The weakness of this course is the unclear expectations of what we were supposed to know as Sapling required us to know different things than the things that were on the test while the textbooks had a lot of information which were not mentioned in class. The order the lectures were taught also didn't match up with the textbook readings at times, and this was confusing. The weaknesses are also the things that should be improved.",
                "The material taught was very interesting and the flipped classroom format with many different sources to learn from encouraged deep understanding of the material. The only difficulty was the sheer amount of material to cover due to the nature of organic chemistry itself. I easily worked 4 times as hard for this class as my others this semester.",
                "I think that the course gave students many modes of support and opportunity for learning outside of basic lectures through section, study hall, etc. The teaching fellows were great and offered a lot of support in my learning. One thing that could be modified is to have the professor teach the basics a little more thoroughly during lectures as the class material sometimes deviated from the material we learned from reading the textbook, which was a bit confusing.",
                "Strengths: You will learn quite a lot of organic chemistry by the end of the semester and be quite knowledgeable about the various types of organic reactions. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Unfortunately quite a lot. The class was too focused on the Prof's research (MO theory) which consistently appeared on every single exam. Sometimes, the concepts we were expected to know were not even searchable online and were only briefly and poorly covered in class (Particularly using MO theory to justify every single concept we learned in class even when it was not directly applicable). Often, the TAs were even unable to explain such concepts, and more often than not the TAs even had trouble explaining answers to practice exams. The structure of the class wasn't really organized as the Sapling homework, textbook reading, and class lectures rarely lined up and you weren't really sure what you needed to know and what you didn't. A lot of the grading was also left up in the air and you really did not know how well you were doing until the end of the semester (though Tim curves really well so that is a plus).",
                "There are a lot of office hours for students to get help",
                "Strengths: There is a lot of resources allocated to helping students outside of class, including office hours, peer tutors, TA discussion sections and via email. For the most part, you have a lot of people around you trying to help you do well in this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course requires a lot of work and practice every day to get good at organic chemistry. You need to make sure you don't fall behind, because once you do you will get very lost in the lecture. There were also times when there is confusion about the content (i.e. the practice exams) that even the TAs may be unsure of, so sometimes you have trouble with clarification",
                "Weaknesses: I found it difficult to get actual help. Study Halls and Discussion Sections didn't facilitate that much understanding since any questions asked were usually in breakout rooms and other students would often be confused. Sometimes our TAs also didn't know how to approach certain problems either, which compounded confusion. Strengths: I think the weekly psets and sapling problems did help facilitate understanding and made sure we were caught up with the material before class time.",
                "I'm not completely sure if I liked the flipped classroom format, since there were topics I'd have liked to go over in class that we did not focus any time on. The test questions were kind of abstract (most were fine though) -- sometimes even the teaching assistants had trouble going over them, which was a little frustrating. \r\nTim is very engaging and fun, as are the teaching assistants, so that is definitely a strength. \r\nIn terms of Sapling (the online homework\/problem set website), many of the problems only accepted a very specific answer and marked many other answers as incorrect -- sometimes Sapling went over material that was not discussed in the reading for that day, which was annoying.\r\nIn class, sometimes we went over material that was from the next class's reading, which was frustrating because I did not know what was going on and only understood when I did the reading after the class.\r\nThe class is structured quite nicely, however -- I have heard horror stories about organic chemistry and this was definitely not a horror show. \r\nIt was a nice introduction to college, -- I liked that everyone was a first-year.",
                "This course is highly collaborative and creates a supportive environment with the other students because of its flipped classroom structure. At times, this can be a weakness and can make it difficult to understand concepts as we are expected to do the readings and do homework on the topic before class. I think overall, however, the structure of the class works as Tim uses class time really effectively to do examples, prepare us for exams, and answer all questions.",
                "It's rigorous, and it encourages self-learning. When you figure out how to do a problem, then, it's quite rewarding. However, the drawbacks of self-learning is that it's very easy to get left behind in class. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest weakness of the class is that the homework is a poor representation of the style and difficulty of the exam. The homework ought to be ameliorated so that it better reflects the exam, and\/or more practice exam questions should be made available, and\/or practice exam questions should be made available much earlier in the units.",
                "I think the strength of this course is definitely the students. Most of everyone in 1st year OrgoChem is passionate about chemistry and biology, so the people that you meet with and study have a good chance of having similar career goals as you too. The sections are really helpful too, even though it's understandably hard to motivate yourself to actually go to them. The TAs are responsive, and the section sizes are small enough for students to feel comfortable ask questions. \r\n\r\nPerhaps not a weakness, but one improvement would be to have more practice problems that were available but not necessarily due, such as more midterm practice problems and more past exams for us to work through during high-stress intervals.",
                "I think the flipped classroom worked for some people but not for others, in my experience, it would have been better to learn things in class during class time instead of being expected to come to class knowing the material because it often made it harder to catch up or to follow when there were some fundamental concepts that were difficult to understand by self-study. The exams were often vastly harder and trickier than the practice exams\/practice problems, and so it often felt unfair to have worked a lot and put in a lot of effort to prepare only to be thrown a curveball that no one would be adequately prepared for simply by studying past questions. Even though I'm finishing with a pretty good grade, I felt as though I were way behind the class the entire semester because of these reasons, which was really discouraging and unduly stressful. It also would have been nice to have more organized\/summary-type notes or slides because sometimes I felt that the learning goals, practice questions, notes, and slides were disorganized and not aligned with each other.",
                "A strength of this course was Professor Newhouse and his enthusiasm for the material, which  made lectures enjoyable. I'd say the biggest weakness was the huge emphasis on molecular orbital theory. Since none of the students had the quantum mechanical background to actually understand the theory, the explanations we were given (and expected to interpret and make inferences about) felt more like convoluted hand-waving than a true mechanistic explanation of the chemistry.",
                "Strengths: lots of preclass and post class work so I had to constantly engage with the material\r\n\r\nWeakenesses: there was a participation grade for a 99 person lecture and I don't think this was very productive because the chat was just spammed. I also prefer to process the lecture content at my own pace by rewatching them afterwards, so this participation component meant I wasn't able to efficiently take notes in class.",
                "strengths -- recorded lecture (I could watch it twice to prepare for the exam), TA and discussion sections, sapling (although some questions were flawed), Tim also changed the lecture style (from flipped classroom to a more traditional class) as a response to students' requests. \r\nweaknesses -- the textbook was difficult to understand and unnecessarily complicated, as a person who was newly introduced to organic chemistry. The flipped classroom at the beginning of the semester was also quite difficult to follow, and it favored students who had prior experience of learning organic chemistry.",
                "I believe that a more in depth exploration of Molecule Orbital Theory could improve our theoretical understanding of reactions. However, I do believe that the course spends too much time going over the same content multiple times, rather than exploring more content in depth.",
                "Professor Newhouse is knowlegeable and always enthusiastic during lecture. The Sapling homework assignments and problem sets were helpful in getting  practice with the material, although occasionally a problem or two did not correlate with the assigned textbook reading (particularly at the beginning of the term). The class followed a flipped classroom model, where the majority of the learning came from reading the textbook and most lectures involved working through example problems. Personally, I would have preferred the live class sessions to follow more of a traditional lecture format. The practice exams for the midterms and the final were helpful, although it would have been more helpful if there were solutions posted. There was quite a bit of time pressure on the exams.",
                "Strengths: a great community is formed in this class. Professor Newhouse cracks jokes during lectures and the chat is filled with student questions and commentary.\r\nWeaknesses: this class is structured as a flipped classroom where you read the material and solve the pre-class assignments before you attend the lecture about that subject. This is a very difficult way to learn when there is a lot to read about very confusing material with no guidance until you go to your weekly section. Lectures assume that you already understand the material, and Professor Newhouse uses the time to run through practice problems but that is very hard to follow if you still don't understand the material!",
                "The lectures can have more structured content.",
                "The course is a lot of work, but the professors, TAs, and peer tutors are all very supportive.",
                "This course was generally very strong and very engaging. One problem was that several of the students had a much greater prior knowledge of organic chemistry than the rest, and answering these students' questions about advanced topics took up a larger portion of class time than seemed warranted.",
                "Strength: This class is effective and enjoyable; while the flipped classroom method was a little daunting at first, it became easy to get used to and was highly enjoyable. Professor Newhouse tries to make the class fun and engaging with industrial and medicinal applications of the material. The exams are difficult but manageable, and overall, the course moves at an ideal pace.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sapling Learning for Problem Sets frequently gave us problems, and often times it would count correct answers incorrect. I liked the preclass and problem set organization of the course -- it was just the medium that gave us trouble.",
                "Strengths;The small discussion groups were effective.",
                "The lectures were very engaging and Professor Newhouse was very helpful with answering our questions thoroughly. One weakness of the course was that I often felt like the later exams were not very similar to the practice tests so I wish that additional, more relevant practice problems were offered to help us prepare.",
                "I think the course could have been better organized. Many times during the lectures, materials were referenced that we would not read until later in the week which often left me confused.",
                "Strengths: The course instructor, Timothy Newhouse, seemed to understand that the class was really difficult and was generous with the curves.\r\nWeaknesses: This class is very difficult and I personally did not like the flipped classroom structure because if you don't understand the concept going into the lesson, you will not get clarification and you will be lost for the lecture. You very clearly need to have a very strong background in bio and chem to be able to do well in this course. The communication about how we were being graded was also weak and caused much confusion.",
                "I liked this course because it taught me the foundations of organic chemistry. Some weaknesses would be that there was usually little engagement between the professor and the students, presumably because of the virtual format. The TAs seemed rather overworked and understaffed, and were sometimes unavailable for students. I wish that we did more test review, because we would get our midterms back and not know what our mistakes were due to lack of feedback.",
                "Strengths: Tim was very funny and engaging during class. There were tons of resources available to get help if you needed it.\r\nWeaknesses: I'm not sure how well the flipped classroom worked because I would leave every lecture confused and wouldn't understand concepts until we'd passed them in class so I always felt behind even though I wasn't. It would've been nice to have a brief summary or explanation of the different concepts before diving into in-depth examples and assuming the entire class understood. That assumption really hindered my actual learning because there were so many holes of knowledge not filled during lecture so I felt like I was expected to completely learn from a textbook. I think the success and comprehension of the top students in the class, who may have had previous organic chemistry knowledge, convinced the professor that we were all on similar levels of understanding when that was not the case for the majority of the class.",
                "This course is extremely difficult but Professor Newhouse is super clear about what needs to be known for the exams and the exams, while difficult, are fair. A strength of this course is definitely Professor Newhouse's expertise and enthusiasm and it is also super organized. There is ample support available via office hours and peer tutors and TAs which one should definitely take advantage of sooner rather than later. The Sapling (homework) was a bit of a weakness as it wasn't always reflective of what we were learning in class and I also wish we had more practice exams, especially for the later midterms and final. The flipped classroom format (where we were expected to read all the material beforehand) wasn't my favorite and I wish we would have spent more time learning the concepts in class as opposed to just practice problems, but it was okay.",
                "The flipped classroom style that the course offered fostered discussion and questions about the material that may have not been present in a typical lecture format."

                "Very good adaptation; loved study hall and the ability to pick our own breakout rooms",
                "Tim did a pretty good job of keeping us attentive during class. However, his warmup problems take up way too much class time. Most of the time, students wouldn't know how to do the warmup problem, so we would sit in our breakout room for several minutes in complete silence. Since this class is in the lecture format, it would be much better to teach the content during class, rather than spending time on discussion problems.",
                "Weekly TA sections were very very helpful. TA-led study hall sessions before exams were also very helpful. Lectures were definitely too fast, but at least they were recorded. There was a ton of work on Sapling which got to the point of being annoying rather than helpful (although in general, the Sapling tool was effective).",
                "All the note sheets were uploaded to the Canvas site, which helped students greatly. Especially in Zoom classes, students may have a tendency to not grasp the underlying concepts as well, a fact that is not helped by the pressure to write down everything instead of deeply engaging with the lecture. That all the lecture materials were uploaded definitely helped during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effective use of breakout rooms to facilitate our own thinking as well as to get to know other students is another success.\r\n\r\nAn area that can be improved is making sure students have enough time in breakout rooms to fully discuss all parts of the question.",
                "Everything was fine. Best we could do in a pandemic.",
                "I liked the breakout room format our teacher employed during the lectures--it helped to keep me engaged and enthusiastic.",
                "The study halls could have been improved.",
                "Discussion sections and virtual study halls were great aids in understanding the course material. \r\nIn addition, Professor Newhouse would usually allow some time after lecture has finished for any questions which was very useful.",
                "The live lecture and discussion section format succeeded in communicating content and giving out practice problems. It was harder to set up study groups with other students in the class due to the virtual nature of the course.",
                "I thought the socially-distanced in-person component was useful, but the breakout rooms were equally effective. I didn't feel like my learning was hindered in any way due to the pandemic.",
                "I think the lectures overall were good, and my particular discussion section was helpful in getting experience in the types of problems we encountered on assessments. I think the Breakout Room format could be improved, as we often were not fully prepared to do the problems on our own and then really just ended up seeing what was went over, so I found myself often being overwhelmed and confused by the breakout rooms.",
                "I think that the breakout rooms were a great way to tackle team problems that were assigned, and it was also beneficial to see other people's different solutions to problems in the chat. One thing that I thought could be improved was the participation grade. It was based on people's engagement on zoom with regard to the chat, so oftentimes, there were comments that did not really add to the discussion, and sometimes it obstructed my learning because the chat kept popping up.",
                "Tim handled online lectures well and kept them engaging for the most part. The many practice problems helped to maintain attention during lecture.",
                "The breakout rooms definitely facilitated engagement. However, I would recommend hopping into breakout rooms to get a sense of when people are done\/ not done to use time more effectively.",
                "No flipped classroom design!",
                "All of the lectures were recorded, which was a blessing; I don't think I would have done as well without them. I found it incredibly helpful to look back on them while I was studying for exams to fill in some gaps in my notes.",
                "Study hall was monumental to succeeding in the class.",
                "In a class where student cooperation was very helpful, it was difficult at first to try to meet classmates and connect. I appreciated, later, being able to have static breakout rooms so we could work with the same few people each time. I think it was hard to engage students in this larger class, but the idea of measuring Zoom participation in the call made the chat box become less meaningful. It was sometimes distracting when students were sending unimportant messages in the chat just to boost their participation, and others would just reiterate the correct answer. I wonder if there could be better methods of encouraging and measuring engagement.",
                "I really liked the fact that lectures were recorded and kept up permanently since it allowed me to go back and rewatch lectures to study. Unsure if in-person lecture was helpful since I never opted in.",

                "If anything, the fact that lectures were recorded on zoom and could be rewatched made the class even better than it would be when live and in-person.",
                "Succeeded: Online office hours, chat function on zoom and breakout rooms\r\nCould be improved: Maybe introduce a voting format instead of spamming the chat on zoom",
                "The live lectures were usually pretty engaging, especially with the Zoom chat and the team problem structure. I think Study Halls could have been improved because I would join sometimes and be put into a breakout room with only other students, where guidance from a TA or peer tutor could have been helpful.",
                "Virtual lectures and sections worked quite well -- I would have loved to be in person, but needs must.. However, I would have loved to spend time studying with more of my classmates. As a remote student, I mostly studied with other remote students, while the on-campus students had much more time together and could study. I love my remote classmates, but I would have loved to spend time with other students as well.",
                "I think this class functioned very well during the pandemic. The lectures were engaging even over Zoom because Tim poses lots of questions to the class. There were still frequent study halls so we could always get help if we needed it.  Our assigned breakout rooms were great because it emulated in-class collaboration with the same people, like you were sitting at the same table every day.",
                "I liked that the lectures were recorded. It was handy to be able to go back and watch the videos.\r\n\r\nAt some point in the semester, the professor stated that he would be grading our participation in part based on Zoom chat messages. He claimed that Zoom can measure participation based on the volume of chats sent by each participant. Putting aside the fact that I wasn't able to find any websites that confirm this, this led to students sending many, many chats - often off-topic ones - that were distracting during lecture. It also wasn't a good format for participation because almost everyone would type the same answer. Questions were easily lost in the chat because people would type \"^\" to emphasize the question, but this action only pushed the question higher and made it harder to access. Public chat conversations - again, off-topic ones - would go on continuously during class. All this is to say that participation in lecture via chat should not be encouraged - unmuting oneself and speaking is much better.",
                "The Zoom chat function was immensely helpful during the live lectures because students could ask and answer each other's questions. The lectures themselves were a bit too quickly-paced. Maybe a pre-recorded lecture would have been better than a pre-class reading assignment.",
                "The live virtual lectures worked well, and the discussion sections were extremely helpful. The requirement of participating through the chat was not very effective, however, since it usually just resulted in 50 consecutive answers agreeing with the first one (whether or not this was correct).",
                "I fully appreciated the fact that the lecture was recorded. When I rewatched them, I could catch onto concepts that I missed on live lectures. I also liked that Tim added the participation system as students got to engage in the class more. (Due to the nature of zoom\/online classes, I think people were more or less scared to speak up).",
                "Having the lectures recorded in case we missed them was good, but the participation requirement made this nearly useless.",
                "The exams were very difficult to take online, especially given the limited time constraints.",
                "The live class sessions were organized well, and breakout rooms were used for group work. In the middle of the term, a new policy was created that made class participation 5% of the course grade. Since participation was measured by the Zoom chat statistics, this change prompted the Zoom chat to become much more active, which helped foster greater engagement with the live classes. However, the addition of participation as part of the course grade may have led to difficulties for those studying remotely from other time zones.",
                "The breakout rooms during lecture were very helpful. With the annotate function on zoom it was easy to follow each other as we solved problems in section. I think this course transferred well to a virtual format.",

                "I found the Sapling homework and problem sets very helpful as an alternative pathway to those presented in the textbook and in class. The homework on Sapling was always enjoyable and I still learned a lot.",
                "Start Zoom Breakout rooms earlier in the year! It was great to foster a mini-group setting as it allowed for easier coordination of study times and the development of connections between people.",
                "The zoom rooms were a big strength. I think that the the flexibility to have different sessions catered to solving problems that would be similar to the final exam once a week would have been helpful. This would work almost like the review sessions before the exam, so students could drop in as TAs go over example problems.",
                "The zoom lectures were formatted well to allow for participation and questions and breakout rooms were a great way to foster collaboration.",
                "Breakout rooms were very important for our learning and I appreciated their use during both lectures and study halls.",
                "I wish that the study halls were more structured.",
                "I think the discussion section was a good idea to get into smaller groups and help each other through different problems. On Zoom I've noticed that sections always go better when students are allowed to keep themselves unmuted and have more open conversation engagement is much higher and it imitates an actual classroom more. Since this wasn't implemented, engagement in discussion section was pretty low compared to other classes which sucks because it was much much more needed in this class.",
                "While I definitely wish we could have collaborated with classmates when it came to learning retrosynthesis pathways, mechanisms, MO theory, etc., this class was structured pretty well during the COVID-19 pandemic. A portion of our grade came from our participation in Zoom, through comments in the chat and speaking, but I didn't think this format was too conducive to learning as people just started commenting for the sake of their grade instead of actually answering the questions or asking relevant, important questions. However, the lectures were delivered well over Zoom and the fact that they were recorded made them super useful for reviewing for exams.  The use of breakout rooms during lectures also had its pros and cons. On one hand it gave us a chance to solve and talk through practice problems in a group, but on the other hand because we were with the same breakout group everyday, if we didn't know we didn't have anyone else to ask and couldn't participate in the main room. I would have rather had random breakout rooms so that we got to learn from a variety of classmates with varying levels of expertise in organic chemistry.",
                "The flipped classroom style was not inhibited by the virtual learning format, engagement sometimes faltered due to the large class numbers."

                "Yes! Everyone is very helpful to facilitate learning, and it is probably much more friendly with just the first years (as opposed to CHEM220)",
                "I would recommend this course to students because (a) it's way more interesting than Chem 220, which I attended at the beginning of the year, because Tim genuinely cares about what he's teaching and (b) you leave the class having developed a pretty good understanding of organic chemistry.",
                "Yes, but know what you are getting into. It is a lot of work and it goes very fast. There are resources to help you, but not a whole ton of them. You need to take it upon yourself to study the material and go back and rewatch lectures (because trust me, the live lectures go VERY FAST). If you have never taken orgo before (like me), it is definitely doable, but it will probably be a heavy workload.",
                "first years who test out of gen chem should take organic - saves a year in chem sequence",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student if they feel they have a solid understanding of general chemistry and are ready to take on organic chemistry. It is really interesting and well-organized, so if you keep up with the pre-readings, homework assignments, lectures, and actively think about chemistry, then the class is both fun and not too difficult. This is a crucial class for the pre-med track and chemistry major, so having the opportunity to learn it in your first year at Yale with a cohort of other like-minded first-year peers is a valuable and great experience.",
                "Absolutely--the opportunity to gain credit for two years of general chemistry while taking a freshman version of organic chemistry in which there is far more collaboration and opportunities for fun is unmissable.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they need it for a prereq. If you don't, stay away from this course!",
                "Yes. As a first year student, if you place into the class and are willing to work hard then this is a great way to learn organic chemistry. If you do not fall behind in your readings, you can begin to build that interest in the subject. Be prepared to do a lot of practice before mid-terms. They are not necessarily difficult but you need to be very familiar with the content.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in chemistry and anyone who is a pre-med student.",
                "This class was very challenging but very rewarding. Professor Newhouse is one of the best instructors I've had the opportunity to learn from and I would highly recommend this class to anyone debating between first-year and regular orgo. This class pushes you to your limits and I felt like I grew as a student and scientist throughout the semester.",
                "Yes, if you have an interest in chemistry or sciences, this class facilitates that. As I said numerous times throughout this semester, I love this class, but in order to love it, you have to first understand what is going on, which takes effort from the student's side beyond the bare minimum. So, if you don't have the interest in chemistry, this class may not be for you.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are pre med or have to take it for their major. Especially for first years, there was alot of support from the TA's and the peer tutors that was helpful when things got pretty hard.",
                "ye",
                "I would take it if you really do not want to retake gen chem. However, my friends learn a lot of organic in Yale gen chem classes which will definitely help them in 221. Chem 221 actually goes at a slightly slower pace than freshman orgo too. Taking gen chem than normal orgo will probably be a much easier workload than jumping into freshman orgo",
                "I'd completely recommend it to anyone interested in premed, chem, or any related topic. If not, you might find it a bit too involved because it is a rigorous course with a heavy workload that requires time and commitment to study for.",
                "Yes! No doubt its a challenge but you learn a lot and Tims a great professor. If youre deciding between this and gen chem, take this! Its hard but super rewarding in the end. Since its exclusively for first years, it also fosters a community and allows you to make friends that have similar interests.",
                "Depends on if their learning style fits the flipped classroom setting.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class if you test into it and you need organic chemistry as a prerequisite for a STEM major or for pre-med. I personally felt like it was a better experience than what general chemistry and the 220 version would have been.",
                "Yes, this is a good introductory organic chemistry class especially since you are surrounded by other first years. Tim is an engaging professor.",
                "Honestly, it's a hard class, and you will have a lot to learn. But Tim knows his stuff, and you are sure to be surrounded by a lot of bright, hard-working students. I think it's probably an essential course for many majors, and a prerequisite to other classes, so if you can take this your freshman year, I would recommend doing so. You get more support than the other orgo class, since everyone is a first year. The TAs are a great resource, and so are the other students. If you learn and understand the material, it's actually pretty cool!",
                "I would only recommend this course to a student if they need it for their major. It's definitely a good option for getting organic chemistry out of the way if you need it for your major and\/or med school but otherwise, you should probably take another science class as there are definitely classes out there that will be easier and more enjoyable.",
                "The workload is definitely not to be taken lightly, this course made me work 4 times as hard as my other classes and I went into every exam fully knowing there were still things I hadn't fully grasped. However, for those genuinely interested in chemistry, the course material is very interesting.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other first years. Professor Newhouse is a great instructor who knows how the engage students. The TFs are also really great and provide a lot of support for students.",
                "Although this course is difficult, everyone is in it together and Tim does his best to ensure that everyone is in his\/her best position to succeed",
                "Yes, Tim is an amazing professor and fair on grading. This course ensures that you will not stress about grades but rather about how well you are learning the material.",
                "if needed for a major, yes.",
                "If you need to take organic chemistry, yes.",
                "Yes, this is a nice course for first-years looking to get a head start on chemistry.",
                "I would highly recommend this class! Tim is an amazing instructor, and he really cares about his students. The material is definitely challenging, but the teachers and teaching assistants really care about their students succeeding. It also teaches you how to think about orgo and doesn't encourage memorization as much as actually understanding the underlying theory to how things work, so it's never boring! Overall this is a first chemistry class to take at Yale :)",
                "For anyone interested in pursuing premed, biology, or chemistry in their career, I'd wholeheartedly recommend taking this course. These majors require an Ochem course, and getting it done your first year opens up a lot higher level courses that you'd be able to take earlier.",
                "Yes, if you can place into it, in order to skip through the earlier chemistry requirements.",
                "I wouldn't recommend the course for just a casual interest course- it's very intense and at times frustrating. That being said, you do ultimately learn a lot of organic chemistry, and if you're going to take Orgo anyway, you might as well take it with your fellow STEM-focused classmates.",
                "Yes, but be prepared to work hard. Take advantage of the study halls and discussion sections.",
                "Yes. This course sets the groundwork for much of the chemistry that follows the organic chemistry sequence, while allowing for a good bit of theoretical understanding beyond mechanism and synthesis.",
                "I would recommend this course to those who have a strong interest in chemistry, and particularly organic chemistry (or are pre-med). The course is fairly fast-paced, and many students in the class have previous experience with organic chemistry (although it is certainly not a prerequisite). The course provides a nice community of first-years, and because of that may be a better option than the regular orgo class (though I have not taken the regular orgo class).",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who has a chemistry requirement or who wishes to pursue chemistry. I think it was a good course that increased my interest in the field of chemistry, but it is a lot of work and requires a lot of dedication. Do not take this course lightly.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class. It is engaging and goes far beyond the textbook, and I actually felt as though I were learning something useful.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any first-year interested in taking organic chemistry -- if you are a first-year, this is the course to take  (i.e. don't take the one available for all years). This course fostered a sense of community, and the TA's and peer tutors provide ample help when you don't understand anything. The material is taught through a molecular orbital lens, which makes understanding reaction regiochemistry and stereoselectivity easy and effective. I thoroughly enjoyed this class and would recommend it.",
                "I would. Organic Chemistry is not an easy class but it is very interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course. I enjoyed the content greatly and Professor Newhouse's passion for the subject was really engaging.",
                "It may be necessary for many people in STEM majors, but unless the class was reformatted, I would not take it as an elective.",
                "No.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who wants a good foundation to start off organic chemistry in. If you are a first-year and qualify for this, I would take it.",
                "Yes, but beware this is NOT an easy class. If you're interested in chemistry, it's really cool to learn new material and ways in which molecules react with each other; however, it's a class that you really have to invest time into understanding the concepts. I'd highly recommend a study group and using the resources provided to have greater success in the class",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. This course is a great way to meet other first-years interested in similar majors or courses. Also, the class is very interesting with a variety of resources available to help students. Although the topics and information can be very difficult, the course is still definitely worth taking. All in all, this course is great and don't be afraid to ask for help when needed!",
                "This course was super difficult and definitely requires a lot of time and dedication to review concepts, do practice problems, reading the  and studying the material",
                "Yes, this course is essential in learning early organic chemistry concepts and establishing strong time management skills."
