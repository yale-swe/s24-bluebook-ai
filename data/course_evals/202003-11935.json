It was really valuable to me to learn how to use Premiere Pro (the video editing software) and to think about crafting a story with a beginning, middle, and end. Besides the actual filmmaking process, we also watched lots of documentaries and discussed issues of social justice in class.",
                "I received an overview of the history and methods of documentary filmmaking, learned how to use editing software Premiere Pro, did a workshop on interviewing, and learned techniques to shoot and edit a short documentary. The class also engaged in thoughtful discussions about how documentary film can be  a mechanism for social change and the ethics of nonfiction storytelling.",

                "Professor Steiner and Mickey (TA) were wonderful, so that was definitely a strength. Since it was once a week, it felt like a pretty chill class overall which I enjoyed, especially given the online environment. \r\nI think one weakness is that we weren't really instructed on certain techniques to work on, so if you're looking for a class that really walks you through filming techniques, you might not like it that much. The teaching style was very much just go out and shoot something and experiment with things for yourself. This style was fun though, and a lot of the learning came from seeing what your classmates did.",
                "Strengths - We had a wonderful, welcoming class environment. People gave great feedback on everyone's work. I think the class was really well-structured to help us plan and make our documentaries. We had several assignments and deadlines leading up to the final that helped us plan our work. I also appreciated the chance to watch a lot of films covering different issues. Steiner is a huge strength of this class- she's really helpful and passionate about working with students. Also the workload is very manageable with Steiner. Weaknesses - I think the class discussions got a little repetitive at times. Also, class was really long - almost 4 hours on zoom! I think we could have shortened it some weeks.",
                "The strengths of this class were the workshops on interviewing and critiques of small shooting and editing assignments. Producing a short documentary was also a great exercise in nonfiction storytelling. The weaknesses are that the length of the seminar is difficult over zoom. I think we also could've done more in-depth training on Premiere Pro during class time.",
