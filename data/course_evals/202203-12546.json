                "I enjoyed going up to the board every lecture to work on practice problems in a group. Sometimes it felt that we were switching topics abruptly but overall the flow made sense. I think with time the organization of the course will improve.",
                "I really liked the group questions at the board, and think those could have been done more frequently or for longer periods of time.",
                "Wide breadth of topics. Sometimes switching between the chalkboard and the powerpoint slides got a little confusing/difficult to review later.",
                "I liked the professor engagement. I thought the notes could be presented a little better. I was confused at times.",
                "Strengths:\r\n\r\nThere are many opportunities for practice--including problem sets, presentations, and workshops during class periods.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nThe instruction can be more organized. It appears to me that some materials were presented over and over again at different points of the semester.",
                "The lectures were kind of disorganized. It was difficult to follow the thread of each class period and what we were supposed to be focused on and connecting back to. But the material was interesting and Pat was engaging.",
                "Some classes felt more like lectures with 20+ examples written on the board for us to write down. Otherwise, the classes were engaging and emphasized the why and not just the what.",
                "One of the strengths of this class was the inclusion of some in-class exercises, as they really helped to reinforce the points of the day's lecture.",
                "Strengths: Overall, I would recommend this course for undergrads. The pset workload was pretty manageable; the literature presentation exercise is engaging and a good way to learn more about an organometallic topic too. The in-class exercises, though very difficult, were helpful to provide a break in the lecturing and practice what we learned. Pat Holland is a very nice and understanding prof; he'll give help if you ask.\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were sometimes hard to follow. Only a few lectures had slides on Canvas, and the few slides published made little sense outside of the lecture context. I felt there could've been much more organization in the class structure to better learn. I got most stuff from the textbooks, not class notes.",
                "I enjoyed the problem sets and class participation workshops. I also appreciatr the take home final. The lectures were a bit disjointed though and I feel as if some of the more challenging problems were not addressed properly",
                "This course is among the better taught in the department, and the group classwork in each session helped reinforce the most important concepts. I found the problem sets and exams particularly helpful. The paper presentations were the weakest part of the class in terms of learning materialeach group had too little time to explain its paper in depth, and I didn't retain much at all from the presentations.",
                "I greatly appreciated how knowledge was presented as cumulative in this course, and how the problem sheet questions allowed us to consolidate the material learned in class. I also enjoyed the references to very recent scientific literature.",
                "Strengths- I liked the final project, and Professor Holland is a great instructor (really cares about his students + consistently clear explanations).\r\nWeaknesses- I was confused at times about the \"plot\" of the course. I wasn't sure how the different lectures would connect, and it seems as though the topics were kind of random (or I didn't understand their rationale)."
