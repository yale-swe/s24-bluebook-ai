                "Strengths: clear guidance on tests, notes are also intutitive.\r\nPotential weaknesses: lectures can be a bit mumbly.",
                "The biggest strength of the course is without a doubt professor Loewenberg. His dedication inside and outside of the classroom to connect with his students is truly admirable. Another strength is that the course is not particularly rigorous, which is suitable for this type of an introductory course. This also makes the course very accessible to people of other majors. The grading for the class is in line with the general approach to learning outcome goals for the course, i.e if you put in any effort at all and show up to class it is pretty hard to get a bad grade, which is yet another aspect that makes the course accessible to people of all backgrounds.",
                "The class material did feel very applicable and the professor was great.",
                "The material is really interesting and I love the semi-seminar format. My only reservation about this course was that there were really few office hours per week so many times I wasn't able to go to them and get help on the psets or simply ask questions about the course content."

            "comments": [
                "Yes for ChemE or just engineering majors. While it is hard to see the use now, you learn some intuition that is needed later in ChemE which I would think is helpful in other engineering disciplines. Also, the professor is very nice and the class environment is great.",
                "I would not say that this course gives a very accurate representation of what the chemical engineering major is going to be like otherwise. For that reason, I would not suggest the course to somebody who is looking to try out or get a feel for the major. Rather, I think the course serves as a great option for people to learn some basic analytical skills in a chemical engineering context and would be a good choice for a distributional requirement for people who are not completely foreign to math and things such as dimensional analysis. For this reason, I do not really understand why that course is required for the major. Not many technical or analytical skills are developed to the level that they would be useful for future classes for chemical engineers. If youre going to end up learning all the topics in depth from scratch all over again in other classes anyway, then this course feels somewhat like a wasted credit for an already very course heavy major.",
                "Yes. A lot of what you learn is very practical and interesting.",
