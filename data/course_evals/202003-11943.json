I learned the basics of preparing a lab report worthy of submission to a journal as well as the importance of SI units (always put your units of temperature in Kelvin and units of distance in meters!!!). Additionally, I became much more collaborative. Honestly, working with other students made this class bearable. This amount of work is unbearable at times. Discussing data analysis plans as well as calculated values with other students made me feel less alone and more confident in my data. \r\n\r\nThis course involved some complicated labs with confusing procedures, so I learned how to ask for help but also problem solve on my own. Oscilloscopes are not easy to work with, especially if you have never worked with them before, but by the end of the class I felt slightly more knowledgable and capable. Circuitry, too, will push your buttons. Just stay present and try to learn at least one thing. \r\n\r\nFinally, I learned that I am capable of learning difficult material and formatting a report.

                "This is a very time consuming course with a lot of busy work. I'm not really sure how it could be improved though if the nature of the lab reports are like that. I will say that the first month was really easy while the last one was really hard, so spreading out the workload more evenly across the semester might be good.",
                "First off, I want to say that this course eval is not targeted at Dr. Cooper or Clayton (TA) - both were lovely people always willing to help out and answer any questions and are all-around great human beings. Though a lot has been improved, there are some structural elements of this class that were not ideal.\r\n\r\nStrengths: 1) It was great that this course was offered in person! It was done super safely, and I ended up becoming closer with my labmates and the teaching staff given the small course size. 2) THE TAKE A DEEP BREATH BREAK is a phenomenal idea and should be continued forever. 3) Thank you for giving us Thanksgiving break to work on the final lab reports. Yes, it did take literally all of Thanksgiving break (it took ~70 hours), but it was nice having that time. 4) Final presentations instead of a final exam is a great idea - it was my first time giving a science presentation, and it was a worthwhile experience (and also gives you back some time to devote to other classes). 5) The pre-lab quizzes being on Canvas is a good idea (instead of during class) and helped me zone in on the important part of the very long course packets. 6) The extra credit on lab reports is a great idea - it rewards people who spend a lot of time and go above and beyond. 7) Overall, the experimental results are quite satisfying - it's nice to get values that match literature.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) Why is there a Friday afternoon lecture (that wasn't even recorded)? The course packet is so detailed that sufficient background can be obtained from reading it, and the lecture adds more time to a very time-consuming class. 2) The background for Experiment 6 needs to be built-up: this background is much shorter than for any other lab by dozens of pages, and I was very confused doing calculations (I ended up redoing calculations maybe 3 or 4 times). 3) Each lab report takes between 20 and 40 hours. Some of this time is worthwhile. But it seems like a lot of these reports are unnecessarily extra. Like, you'll be vibing with the VDW calculations, only to find out you also have to do Redlich-Kuang and - much worse - Beattie-Bridgeman. Or you'll be calculating standard heat of formation and then have to apply 3 corrections that end up all being negligible. Or you'll get some nice results from bomb calorimetry but then have to analyze 10 more very similar data sets, which ends up taking a long time. There are some very tedious calculations that don't feel entirely important. And make you hate material that would otherwise be interesting.  4) The error propagation also take an absurd amount of time for very little learning value. 5) Though the lab reports are limited to 15 pages, the appendix always ends up being twice as long and is a pain to do because you're typing equations in Microsoft Word. Even then, you're not sure if you included everything because 6) THERE IS NO RUBRIC, and the TAs seem to take off for different things. You also don't get feedback until late in the semester, so it's hard to improve. Like you'll do your calculations perfectly but get points off for not bolding a caption, even though the example lab report does not bold. Or you'll get points off for not using a statistical concept that was never introduced.",
                "The instructors are most certainly a strength. The previous iterations of the course weaken the current course, though the course is being restructured with time.",
                "This course was a lot. Every lab report ended up being 20+ pages, and seemed quite repetitive after a while. I think I could have have gained the same knowledge with condensed reports that focused on understanding the results. Each lab report took 20-40 hours to do, including calculations, writing, editing, making graphs, error propagation, etc. And at the end, I grasped the concepts of each lab, but I felt like the work was disproportionate to the difficulty of the concepts that we were learning. We had 15 page limits on writing to ensure that the lab report wasn't filled with superfluous information, but it often felt as if the other parts of the lab (appendices, calculations, graphs, tables) were slightly superfluous in themselves, reinforcing concepts over and over again on data sets with minute differences.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper is great, and tried to make the course as digestible as possible. Unfortunately the nature of the assignments was convoluted, and therefore, the class became very tedious and laborious.",
                "Overall, this class was not as bad as I expected, and I think having Professor Cooper made it a lot better. It is still extremely difficult; these lab reports are probably the hardest assignments I have ever done because of time commitment and analysis. I think having the 6th lab be a long lab report was useless. I did not have feedback from any other lab besides 2 so it was difficult to tell if I was doing it correctly. Also, even with thanksgiving break and an extension, it was still too much to handle although I worked on it constantly for those two weeks.",
                "To start on a positive note: Chem330L was engaging, the experiments were interesting, and I strengthened my chemical background. The TAs were also a true strength of this course. I don't think I would have been able to get through the material and fully understand procedures without them. Additionally, having lab partners was a strength. The importance of group work cannot be emphasized enough. WORK WITH OTHERS! Check values with each other early on to make sure you are on the right track. Some of the data analysis instructions are unclear or ambiguous, so it's important to verify you are following the correct methods before analyzing 12 data sets of 1000+ data points each. \r\n\r\nThere are unfortunately more weaknesses than strengths. Firstly, this class felt like academic hazing. I think the workload was ridiculous and unnecessary. It would have been far more intellectually beneficial to do fewer labs but focus and revise them thoroughly. Due to the sheer workload of this class, I felt like I was just trying to get the reports done in time, instead of taking care to the details. Secondly, the instructions for the data analysis were often unclear which made data analysis nearly impossible at times. I am SO thankful to the other students in the class for being willing to talk through concepts and their approaches. It was helpful to spitball ideas and discuss ways of approaching analysis. Lastly, this course was not humane. It is not ok to give students 50+ hours of work a week when reports are due. This course is actually enjoyable, apart from the sheer workload they expect. I recommend they reduce the amount of labs performed and have students put more effort into each report. It would also be beneficial if Dr. Cooper could give an example report, so students could see what an excellent report looks like. The \"report instructions\" were not particularly helpful because they were not in the actual report format. It also seems like the graphs in the manual were created using Mathematica, so it would be helpful if Dr. Cooper could point students towards resources for creating journal submission worthy figures.",
                "Great course. Lot of work, but I feel like thats what makes it a great course in terms of learning and practical skills.",
                "High workload, generally feel that one full lab report should be the final project for the class rather than having so many",
                "The teaching environment facilitated by Prof Cooper and our TAs was incredibly supportive -- they were all very approachable it was evident that they all really cared about helping us learn. The course is inherently a lot of work so be prepared to spend many, many hours writing.",
                "Strengths: Comprehensive experience in laboratory data analysis. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Experiments were dated and not very engaging. The workload is manageable; however, it is in gross excess of what one expects from a single credit course. This is an aspect of chemistry labs in general, and a chemistry student feels as if they are getting the short end of the stick with regard to other courses in other disciplines. Additionally, grading of reports was somewhat inconsistent between TA's for this semester, and it seemed that a student had to adjust their report at times in anticipation of who would be grading it.",
                "The professors and TAs were amazing and the class had a really personal feel, like they really cared that we were learning something. i wish we got more feedback in general",
                "I thought the in-person lab and lectures were well structured and very helpful. They were engaging and informative. However, the lecture was at an odd time. The weaknesses of the course were that the workload was so overwhelming that the course stopped being about learning and comprehending the material and more of just physically completing something. I don't know if this can be remedied, but it was a bad experience that got worse. Words fail me in accurately describing the experience and the mindspace it would put me into."

                "If you're considering taking this course, it's probably because you need it for the chem BS. And it is not worth dropping down to the BA to avoid this course, despite what you may read in other evals. Looking back, I feel accomplished about all the work I was able to produce.\r\n\r\nSome advice for future students: 1) As soon as you get out of lab, do AT LEAST the preliminary data analysis. You will feel better knowing you can make it through all the bare minimum steps and will save yourself lots of time later. If you wait, you will forget what you measured etc. 2) Before starting data analysis, it helps to make yourself a little analysis plan. Make sure you have all your units straight and you know exactly what intermediate calculations you will have to do because they won't be mentioned clearly in the packet and\/or will be mentioned in the wrong order. 3) Start the reports early!! Cannot stress this enough. It takes way longer than you'd think to get it all done, much less formatted nicely... 4) You can take more liberties with the reports than you'd think. Make it pretty. Use programming languages instead of Excel. Do insightful things. One of the coolest things about this class is you will get extra credit for going above and beyond, so your work will be appreciated. 5) Take a statistics course before this to make your life a lot easier.",

                "I think it is hard to justify recommending this course. I think the workload is still too high, but I think that could be fixed with one less full lab report. Most people who are choosing to take this course most likely have to do it due to requirements. I would recommend to take it during a semester with lighter work load. in which case it is not that bad.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students, but with a fair warning: expect to feel overwhelmed by the quantity and the demands of the class. I know the reviews from previous years are scary and discuss how the class changes students, but that is a bit melodramatic. This class stressed me in ways I have never felt before, but I got through it. And students who take this class will too. Work with other students, meet with the TAs, go to the peer tutor. There are many resources available for each student; it's all about using the resources. I will not say that this class is easy, but I will say that students can persevere. If this class taught me anything, it's that I am capable of more than I ever thought. I got through Chem 330L, so I feel like I can face any class.",
