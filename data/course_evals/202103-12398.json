                "sometimes Tolga goes off a tangent and talks about random stuff for way too long. This means his class is really interesting because Tolga have really interesting life stories that is definitely worth hearing. But this also means that when you are sleep-deprived and just want to get your work done, you realized how much shorter the class could have been to cover the same material. Also, 80% of your grade in this class is based on 2 tests only and is curved with only 50 other people, so the curve is really variable, and if there happen to be a few smart classmates, then your grade might not be good. There could be more psets for practice too.",
                "Strengths: each class was very informative, taught in a fun way, and made easy to understand; Tolga was incredibly helpful; tutor hours were also helpful\r\nWeaknesses: exams sometimes included things that weren't discussed in class (but if you read the textbook, you'd find them)",
                "Great lectures, not enough problem sets to enforce the information",
