Also how to say things like \"I look like my mother, but my personality is more like my father's\". I also learned new vocabulary like \"to understand\", \"stepmother\", vocabulary terms related to travel (\"to be convenient\", \"the general price of things\", \"the people are nice\"). We talked about cultural things, like learning about different types of living situations in Korea (boarding houses, apartments, private rentals) and how renting a property in KOrea is different from renting in America. Also learned about how to introduce myself and my family (\"My father has a quiet personality, but my brother likes talking to people\"). Other cultural things included learning about the Korean folktale about the \"daebak\"\/ big gourd.",

                "The course did a decent job of covering different grammar patterns and building on existing vocabulary. Much time was also devoted to developing audio comprehension, which was helpful. While the course was early in the morning, Wednesdays were asynchronous lectures, so this allowed for some scheduling flexibility. The workload is also reasonable, and grading isn't too harsh.  Professor Choi was also sometimes flexible with deadlines, which did help. However, the course itself was very disorganized. While some of this was inevitably a result of conducting the class on Zoom, greater clarity all throughout would have been helpful. Often times there was constant confusion as to when assignments were due. The deadlines on the course schedule rarely matched the deadlines set on Canvas. Sometimes assignments would not be published at all, leaving us quite unsure as to whether we should have completed them. The assignments listed on the course schedule sometimes did not correspond to the assignments discussed in class. Grades were not uploaded directly on Canvas, so we had to manually calculate our final grade throughout the course. Test formatting was also different every time, so this also led to a bit of confusion.  The assignments themselves were also not the most engaging and seemed a bit scattered. One of the most enjoyable moments of the class was presenting our final projects, where student either created a PSA or a drama. It would have been nice to see more of this, as well as more engaging class activities overall.",
                "Strengths: lots of exposure to Korean, Prof really cared about the students and was very prompt at responding to questions via email, also made her office hours by appointment very open \/ flexible. Reasonable difficulty, not too hard and not too easy, felt like a reasonable increase in vocab \/ knowledge from L2. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class felt disorganized, I often did not know what was due the next day because the assignments on the syllabus didn't match what was actually available on the \"Assignments\" tab on Canvas. I also never knew what my grade was, because none of the grades were entered into the Grades tab on Canvas. The discussions that I really normally liked in the in-person class were non-existent, because we didn't go into breakout rooms as often as we did in in-person class. And we often had no idea what we were supposed to be talking about in the breakout rooms.",
                "I think that all of the weakness had to do with Zoom. Choi Ssn did a great job of changing the final assignments and the content in order to meet us where we are (she even dedicated several sessions to review once she saw that we were struggling a bit), but Zoom just made it very difficult to both stay engaged with the material and connect with each other as a cohort.",
                "Using breakout rooms to have conversations in Korean was helpful. I sometimes wished that more things were explained in English because sometimes ssn. Chois instructions were a bit hard to follow.",

                "The use of breakout rooms, in theory, could have served as an opportunity to practice conversational skills. Sometimes this did result in useful practice. However, like is common in most Zoom classes, they tended to devolve into an awkward silence or tangential conversations unrelated to the course. Taking tests on Zoom was also quite challenging. Professor Choi would share her screen and ask us to complete section by section together. However, this proved to be a bit difficult, as Professor Choi would sometimes rush through sections or move from one section of the test. Relying wholly on Canvas also proved to be a bit of an issue.",

THe final project also went as well as it could, given the pandemic. Usually it's a group project \/ vid, but we did our best w\/ social distancing.The prof also did a great job grading our submitted assignments on Canvas, it took her a bit to learn how to do it, but it is impressive that she was able to provide such individual feedback for this many students and this many assignments.  \r\n\r\nCould be improved: breakout rooms, the assignments on the canvas tab should match the assignments on the syllabus, grades should be posted on the Canvas tab throughout the semester, powerpoints should be posted on canvas before the class",

My Korean definitely improved, and I'm glad I can talk more easily with my family members. The class introduced me to new grammar structures that are important to everyday conversation: like \"I heard that she said that...\" or \"It seems like...\" I also had to take this course to fulfill my language requirement (I started from L1 as an ethic Korean who knew no Korean), so it was a mandatory thing for me. Just glad I could get this out of the way. I'd only recommend it if you'er looking to fulfill your language requirement or would like to improve your Korean for personal reasons.
