                "The readings were incredibly interesting, and if you think you'd like the course, the readings will be great! I feel like I've learned so much about the history of gynecology in the US. Unfortunately, the discussions were not incredibly interesting\/engaging for me personally. This is obviously very dependent on the chemistry of seminar members and is made more difficult by zoom seminars. However, I found Professor Eisenberg sometimes tried too hard to force the conversation in certain directions. This sometimes made discussion awkward when people did not have a lot to say but were pushed away from pursuing the topics they were gravitating towards.",
                "Amazing course, incredibly interesting, fabulous professor.  Take this class if you can!",
                "A definite strength of this course is the assigned readings. Although the reading load was a lot, I could tell that Prof. Eisenberg spent a lot of time curating readings for each week, and none of the articles\/books assigned felt useless or irrelevant (I feel this way sometimes in other seminars or history classes). Though I'm sure that the cohort of students each year bring a different flavor to this course, I think Prof. Eisenberg does well at facilitating discussion, keeping us on topic, and asking challenging questions to help us think more deeply about these topics instead of succumbing to popular opinion by default.",

I also appreciated how he took the time to ask for feedback regarding how he can make online teaching better during one-on-one conversations with his students-- not many teachers I know are eager to seek feedback from their students.",

Also if you're looking for a writing credit this only has a midterm and a final paper (with occasional casual reading responses)",

I came into this class knowing very little about reproductive health history, and I feel that I have left this class knowing not just more information but also equipped with the courage to engage in discussions about difficult topics (like abortion and sterilization) with respect and cognizance. I looked forward to attending this class every week, and the ~2 hours never felt like a long time due to how captivating the subject matter was and how engaged the other students were.",
