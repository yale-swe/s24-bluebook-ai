                "Interesting topic, covers a bit too much information.",
                "I think this course was taught by a very interesting and experienced professor that provided a lot of personal recollection on the disorders she treated that we were studying in class. The lecture format worked really well for this class and there were plenty of TAs accessible for assistance. I would say that I wish the lecture slides were clearer\/contained more information. But besides that, I thought this course was great!",
                "Strengths: easy to digest content, very manageable pace \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: no relationship with TAs and late grading of midterm and paper",
                "Strengths are that it is not too stressful compared to other courses.",
                "I dont think much can be improved. Of course this class would be amazing if it was a smaller lecture just so we could talk and be a bit more engaged, but its still a very well done lecture. I thought the reading responses were on really interesting material. Not really any weaknesses",
                "good overview of abnormal psychology but not very engaging",
                "Lectures could have been more engaging",
                "Strengths: I learned a lot from the weekly reading responses. They were a great way to enhance my learning in addition to the lectures. I also appreciated that it was an option to come to class in person or watch the lectures remotely--I did a combination. Watching the recordings allowed me to pause them and take more detailed notes, but it was also good to have some time in class to take the in-class quiz polls and ask Professor Joormann questions afterwards. Weaknesses: This is a pretty specific critique, but I would have appreciated some time spent on the psychiatric manifestations of chronic illnesses and other diseases typically considered to be physical but that have mental symptoms as well. I think this area is often overlooked, but very important. I would also consider breaking the course content into three parts - two midterms and a final - because just two parts meant that each one covered, in my case, 70 single-spaced pages of notes, and it was overwhelming to know where to begin studying. Finally, I found the exam questions somewhat irrelevant to what we actually spent time on in class. It would be better for future students to know what they're expected to be able to demonstrate on the exam.",
                "Great course overall, no weaknesses",
                "Strengths: the topics were interesting and the exams were fair\r\nWeakness: I imagine if we had weekly discussion sections or more interactions with our TAs, the class would be more engaging.",
                "Strengths - this course is a great overview of clinical psychology and mental disorders and the reading responses were very interesting and added a bit of depth to the lecture material; the book\/movie paper was also a fun project; the guest lectures from Dr. Baskin-Sommers and Dr. Kober were great too! Weaknesses - lecture can be a bit dry and boring at times especially in the beginning when we're just going over causal models and assessment techniques but as we start learning about the actual disorders the interesting content sort of makes up for the delivery. Another weakness was the structure of the course in terms of when the midterm and finale exams were. The midterm came after we had learned about one set of disorders (anxiety disorders) and the final exam included all the other classes. This felt a bit overwhelming so in the future this course would benefit from a more even distribution of disorder categories across the two exams.",
                "Great class!",
                "I really liked the routine that this course allowed for. I think the guest lectures however were a bit dry.",
                "I thought the content of the class was really interesting and the textbook was good. I know there are a bunch of students so maybe this is inevitable, but grading was a few weeks behind in the last couple weeks which made it hard to adapt. I think the second exam being on paper probably helped ameliorate the egregious cheating that occurred on the first, but I do wonder if there are additional measures that can help. Overall, I really liked the content though!",
                "Strengths include lecture topics and supplemental videos. HUGE weakness was the organization of the lecture slides - they jumped around and made following lecture extremely difficult sometimes. Things were briefly mentioned then gone into depth then later explained more it was just overall confusing  sometimes.",
                "Strengths- Strong examples in class. The exams were fair. The topic was very interesting and cool to learn about. \r\nWeakness- The course was a bit dry at times, which was due to the lecturing style. I felt like the in class examples were thought provoking, but the lectures themselves felt a bit like professor Joormann was regurgitating information that she had read. I would have liked a bit more concrete and personal examples to keep the class engaging.",
                "Recorded lectures were very helpful if you had to miss class. Slides were also very clear. Would like more comprehension checks throughout each week.",
                "Strengths - the material is really interesting and feels incredibly topical\/important. Weaknesses - it'd be nice if the lecture slides were a little more descriptive sometimes.",
                "I thought the lecture slides were very helpful.",
                "Strengths: learned useful material to identify various mental disorders; learned how disorders materialize; learned subtypes of certain disorders; engaged with real-world examples of disorders to solidify understanding. Weaknesses: material is very broad and sometimes far too generalizable; the complexity of psychopathology sometimes means there are not many concrete claims to be made, and this makes learning the ins and outs of a disorder difficult; lecture format is interesting but can get dry at times; each disorder could have benefitted from watching a movie or having more real-life examples to truly solidify expression.",
                "Strengths: interesting content!\r\nWeaknesses: grading was a bit slow but that's about it!",
                "Topics were covered well and lectures were interesting.",

                "not too hard but not very interesting either",
                "This was a very well taught class that covered the basic mental disorders. One problem would be that our assignments took a lot of time to be graded",
                "I enjoyed learning about what constitutes a mental disorder and what a diagnosis entails. I gained so much insight on the process of diagnosis, and I am glad I took this class. However, there is too much emphasis on each of the midterms. The weekly reading responses and the essay should be worth more of the total class grade.",
                "Strengths:\r\nRecorded lectures\r\nWeekly reading responses keep you engaged\r\nInteresting course material \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nExams were really detailed at times when we had learned a lot of information so it was difficult to keep track of everything",
                "The strength really lies in the content of the course, and the weakness is that its taught in such a huge lecture so you dont get a lot of opportunities to engage with the content besides lectures.",
                "Good course for an overview of clinical psychology.",
                "Strengths: I really enjoyed learning about these disorders. I liked how the class was organized; we would learn about a new disorder every week and then discuss symptoms, presentation of the disorder, patterns, and etiology. I also think all assessments were fair: we had a midterm exam (with a good curve), weekly responses, a paper, and a final exam. I think there are many opportunities to balance your grade.  Weaknesses: Sometimes the slides would briefly touch on the neuroscience of these disorders, but it was so brief that I ended up being more confused by the explanation. We were also expected to know some of this neuroscience on exams (for example, which neurotransmitters are responsible for certain disorders), but it was hard to answer these questions when the information we received in class was so confusing. I also think that the reading responses were due at a weird\/awkward time: Thursdays by 5pm. I would have preferred them to either be due by midnight or be due on Fridays. Otherwise, I think that this was a fair class and the professor was very respectful of all the disorders we studied! I enjoyed the guest speakers a lot!",
                "lectures were straightforward and clear, but unengaging",
                "The strengths of the course are that it was very well organized and informative, sharing a wide array of information, resources, and perspectives. It was also very interesting and facilitated strong discussion. A weakness of the course is that since it includes so much information, it can be challenging to truly grasp all of the teachings. Some concepts or teachings may be overlooked.",
                "Strength is how interesting the material is (at least in my opinion), and there are interesting guest speakers. Weakness is that sometimes the lectures can drone on and prof talks slowly, so it's easy to lose focus at times.",
                "Weaknesses: The amount of time each lecture was was way too long and it was very difficult to focus and learn all the material over such long periods of lecture. Many people stopped going to lecture completely because of this and resorted to watching the videos online on 2x speed afterwards",
                "The class provided a lot of examples and included many visuals and videos in lectures that exemplified the topics, which were all helpful. The class started of fairly slow but once it picked up, it became much more engage it and interesting. The class could be improved with some feedback for the weekly reading responses .",
                "There was a fair amount of material to memorize but after the first few weeks the course felt repetitive. Every class we'd cover a new disorder, starting with case studies, then discussing epidemiology, then etiology.",
                "Lectures were dry",
                "Information in the course was presented with a highly factual approach, which sometimes meant that the tone was far too rational and distant than what may have been appropriate, given the gravity of the issues discussed. However, this also ensured that the information was presented in a comprehensible and formulaic way, making it easier for students to compare the various illnesses with one another and apply them to the assigned readings.",
                "The strengths was that it was a very fascinating course and the pace and workload was super manageable. However, there was so much content that it was difficult to study and was a bit overwhelming at times. There was also very little engagement with the teaching fellows and professor.",
                "the lecture style is very slow and dry - they were recorded, so I was able to watch on double speed, but make sure to keep up with the textbook if you aren't going to lecture. The content itself was interesting, but engagement with the course itself was kind of low. The reading responses each week are very very simple (one paragraph of your critical thoughts), but at first they were off-sync with what we were learning, so that was kind of frustrating.",
                "Strengths: Lectures are clear and well organized. The material feels useful to know - people throw around terms relating to mental disorders a lot in daily life, so I appreciate having a better understanding of what they mean. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like I could have learned a lot of the material by reading through the DSM on my own. Not a lot of personal feedback. Also, the book\/movie assignment felt like it had really specific criteria we had to check off, rather than leaving room to make an argument of our own. It felt like busy work rather than an opportunity to think critically or creatively.",
                "it felt like there was not really anything beyond the lectures tying things together",
                "Not much guidance on the paper which made it a lot more trickier than needed.",
                "Strengths: Fascinating material, supportive professor, and a manageable-but-not-fully-gut courseload (weekly reading responses, midterm, final exam, and final paper). Weaknesses: lecture could be a little dry sometimes",
                "This course was so engaging and so well organized. I always knew exactly how to review material that did not make sense during lecture which was so helpful during study periods. The material was absolutely fascinating and was taught in a way that made me excited to learn.",
                "The recorded lectures were really helpful.",
                "Grading scheme was difficult, very exam dependent",
                "Some of the guest lectures went too fast and the material was too dense to be covered",
                "Strengths: interesting topics, good guest lectures \r\nWeaknesses: presentation of info could be more engaging",
                "Lectures got really slow, but content was interesting. A lot of content was straight from the textbook.",
                "Strengths: professor really knows what she is teaching. Weaknesses: lectures are a little boring",
                "I love the simplicity of the slides, I think regarding the exams, maybe a few more practice questions and examples. The first exam layout was a little shocking, so maybe more practice exams.",
                "I thought the content was interesting, but the lectures themselves could be more engaging.",
                "I really appreciated that the class was recorded. The lecture hall was very large, and even with the assistance of the microphone, it was difficult for me to hear\/understand some of the teaching because of how low it was.",
                "strenghts - course material is very interestin; weaknesses - n\/a",
                "Dr Joormanns engaging lecturing style was definitely a strength!",
                "The lectures were not extremely engaging, but the professor was very kind and helpful.",
                "Lectures could have been more organized, but the content was interesting and the syllabus was very clear.",
                "Strengths: considerate of sensitive subjects. Engaging content.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: little to no feedback on class performance. Lectures could be more interesting.",
                "The material is really interesting, and the topics we cover are fascinating. However, there are two main weaknesses to the course. Firstly, the weekly responses were always due by Thursday evening rather than at the end of the week or at midnight on Thursday, which was an odd due date. Secondly, although professor Joormann was wonderful, lectures often spilled into the next class, and we would end up falling behind on the syllabus schedule quite often.",
                "Interesting material, but not always presented in an interesting way",
                "The strengths of this course include that the content is very interesting to me, and there are always review sessions to attend before tests. The guest lecturers are also very engaging. A weakness would be that I found the lectures a little boring at times, and maybe there could be more audience engagement besides the poll surveys done in class.",
                "Instructors are really nice but this was the only class where I've ever purposely skipped lecture because I got so little out of sitting there. If you buy the extremely expensive online textbook, you can just read that instead. If you have questions, the instructors are very helpful over email or in person.",
                "Our Professors expertise was an obvious strength as well as her and the TAs communication skills. They are both incredibly understanding people, and for that it was a strong class. There were drawbacks, however. Though this is college and it is supposed to move fast, I do think that the lectures couldve went slower. Sometimes information would be bombarded onto the class and that makes it difficult to comprehend.",
                "I think the main thing that I would change is the way that percentages of the overall grade are distributed over the course - each exam was worth 40% and the reading response each week only 2%. Not handing in one reading response was the equivalent of getting 2 questions on the exam wrong, and the amount of effort you put into the reading responses doesn't really make sense for it to be such a small portion of the overall grade.",
                "Needs better direction. Please dont ever using the book. I didnt in the beginning but once I did it was better and more structured",
                "The lectures can contain a little more information than necessary and be lengthy. I think you could get more out of it f they were slightly shorter or sometimes let out early.",
                "While I loved the broad scope of clinical disorders we learned about, I think it'd be helpful to offer a study guide for the midterm and final, because there are SO many disorders. We have to study every single one because we don't know what will be on the test and it'll end up asking a ton about one disorder and the rest about a few others.",
                "Strengths: the exams and assignments are not that hard and instructions are clear\r\nWeakness: the lecture is not very engaging and have little interactions",
                "Strengths: interesting content \r\nWeakness: a lot of content",
                "The strengths of the course were the professor, their lecture, and the TAs. Everything was very clear and the teaching staff were very helpful. Possible weaknesses could be the wording of the questions from the first midterm, but I believe the exams were mostly fair.",
                "I really liked the way this course was taught! All of the major course material was covered pretty well in the lectures, and I really liked the articles we had for reading responses where we got to apply what we'd learned in a real-world context.",
                "Strengths: I LOVED how they offered online videos of the lectures",
                "Lectures were nicely structured to keep students engaged throughout the 75 minute classes, broken up by videos and polls. The professor was great and taught the information well. The weekly papers were nice for keeping me engaged with the material, particularly in encouraging me to read the chapters in the book. Overall I think it was a very fun and interesting course with a reasonable workload. I also appreciated the teaching staff's consideration of external circumstances when it came to deadlinesI was always accommodated when I reached out about needed an extension. The only qualm I had with the course was the final paper being due right after the break. I thought it was unfair to expect us to work on it during our break.",
                "Very boring lectures, longer than I think they should have been given the info that was talked about.",
                "Strengths - very interesting material\r\nWeaknesses- could have been taught in a more engaging manner, lecture slides could be improved",
                "Strengths: The material is interesting and it is easy to be intrigued while learning.\r\nWeaknesses: The lecture style is a little boring so sometimes it was easy to get distracted in the actual lecture.",
                "This was a great course! Very interesting lecture material, and really interesting weekly readings or TEDTalks to write reading responses on.",
                "Strengths: good pace, interesting articles for reading responses\r\nWeaknesses: too much of the grade is weighted on assessments",
                "Weaknesses: The lectures\/textbook just aren't very interesting because there's so much fluff compared to actually relevant information. Psychology courses benefit from discussion and unfortunately there weren't any opportunities for that in the large lectures with no accompanying sections. \r\n\r\nStrengths: Total gut, the exams and assignments are all very easy to ace with minimal effort. Professor Joormann is a kind and understanding professor.",
                "Overall good format",
                "This course was well laid out and easy to follow as a beginner in this field of study. The course material was very interesting, especially the reading responses.",
                "It was really boring and hard to understand because it was a lot of material done in a little time span."

If you're looking for a relatively easy fifth credit or need it for some kind of requirement, I would take it, but if you're looking for something that's intellectually challenging, I would look elsewhere.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in \"real life\" psychology, \"real life\" in the sense of the actual mental disorders people suffer from. You will learn a lot and have a very good understanding of how mental disorders manifest themselves. You will also gain a greater sense of empathy towards mental health patients, which, as you will learn in the class, is one of the best things we can do for people suffering with mental disorders.",

                "a good psychology elective!",
                "Yes, if you're interested in learning about mental illness, this is the essential course, covering many topics from the history of psychiatric hospitals to OCD to depression. It's very solid--Professor Joormann is a good lecturer--and nothing will take you by surprise in terms of the course format, except maybe some of the random exam questions that don't have to do with what we learned in class, but in our case she threw those out, and hopefully she would do that in the future, too.",

                "Yes, I would definitely recommended this course to another student, especially if they want to go into medicine. I think everyone should be more aware of these mental disorders, and mindful with how they talk about them, and the professor does a great job of teaching us the skills for it.",

                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in clinical psychology and need to fulfill the core social science for the psych major. It's also a bit of a gut so if you're looking for a fifth class that can be pretty interesting this would be good.",
                "Yes! This class was awesome.  Some psych knowledge is helpful but not necessary.  This class was awesome, I would recommend to anyone interested in this field of work.",

                "The course is really interesting material and the workload is relatively light but lectures can be hard to stay focused through",
                "I definitely would, with the understanding that this is a survey course of clinical disorders, meaning that you won't learn about these in as great depth as you would in a PhD program for example. Still, I came away with a greater understanding of how to critically examine the DSM-V and learned about how arbitrary some of these categories really are. I think this course really teaches you how to critically question\/examine media portrayals of mental illness.",

                "If you want to learn the basics (we never went into too much depth) of the major psychological disorders, this course is for you. The material could be dry at times, but it always felt like it had intrinsic value. Workload was fair",

                "Yes Prof Joorman is really kind!",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student because the insight I got on different types of psychological disorders was truly very eye-opening, and the readings we have each week are also very interesting and relate to the topics discussed in class.",
                "This is not a class to take as that cool psych lecture. If you're specifically interested in this material or have to take it for the major, it's no problem, but it's not the most stimulating. I had interesting things to talk about from the reading responses and from the paper.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. Very practical and interesting class",
                "Its interesting enough but pretty generalized and broad. I dont regret it but its not a must-take.",
                "Yes, if they want an introductory psychology course that gives an overview of a lot of psychological disorders.",
                "Recommend if you are interested in clinical disorders, but not if you are just taking for a gut or looking for fun, as the lecture is not that engaging, and you need to memorize a lot before exams",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student as Professor Joormann is an excellent professor and the content was very enlightening and intriguing. I greatly enjoyed the course and appreciated the knowledge I have gained, which has already inspired my senior research idea and helped me interact with patients.",
                "Absolutely! The course material was genuinely very interesting and addressed with a fairly high level of sensitivity, and the workload was highly manageable",
                "Yeah i liked it and it wasnt a lot of work. You just need to study for the tests when the time comes",
                "Definitely! It is a very interesting course and a lot of what you learn is important for everyday life. Everyone has someone with mental illness in their life, and anyone can struggle with mental illness. The professor was a great lecturer and always seemed up to talk after class. The class was well organized in terms of the teaching staff, the content, and the lecture slides. The weekly one page papers were great for staying on track and engaging with the material. The workload was not bad at all, and the exams were reasonable as long as you reviewed the material. This was not a stressful class so I especially recommend it if the rest of your classes are.",
                "Only if you have to take it, not a good introduction to psych.",
                "No, I think that the lectures seemed too long because Professor Joormann tried to cover a lot of material in this course. It would have been better if she focussed on a few things but made those things interesting and spent time on them.",
                "If you are wanting to be a psych major, then yes. I could see someone being very interested by the material and it is a good start if someone is wanting to pursue this as a degree.",
                "Yes. Interesting topics and a very manageable workload, especially if you've taken an intro psych course.",
                "I took this class as a non-major simply because I wanted to understand more about clinical psych. It did give me some of that, I suppose, but in a pretty long, drawn-out, boring way; I definitely had higher hopes for this class going in. At the end of the day, it's easy and low stress so if that's what you're looking for, this is the course for you. If you are looking for a solid foundation in engaging material, without spending SO much time reviewing gen psych knowledge, you should look elsewhere.",
                "yes!",
