I also just generally had a great time discussing large ideas that we often see on a day to day basis, and I was very happy to engage with those ideas constantly within my classes",
                "How to analyze a variety of texts and see what they have in common/how they influence each other",
                "My skills in writing about and analyzing literary texts improved, especially regarding close reading. At the end of the last class, Professor Valis gave an excellent wrap-up speech about many of the texts we have read. Through that speech, she helped me realize that literature is not only a deep exploration of different perspectives but also an exploration of the self, how we view ourselves, how we view our minds and thoughts, as well as how others see us and how we want others to see us.",
                "I learned how to write critically, how to think about the text not only analytically, but also spiritually. Professor Valis has a special way of connecting each text to our lives and explaining why that connection is so vital. She has made me an infinitely better writer, thinker, and most of all, person. In all honesty, this question should be reformulated to say \"What knowledge, skills, and insights DIDN'T you develop by taking this course?\" because of how incredible of a teacher Professor Valis is.",
                "I read quite a bit; I gained a general familiar of the modern Western literary tradition.",
                "I have gained insight into the nuances, themes, connections, and references in these wonderful texts. I built my writing skills, particularly my ability to articulate analyses of the text, as well craft an organized and flowing paper.",
                "DRST Literature was a great class! I became a much better reader and writer, and Prof. Valis was an excellent guide in this journey. I have an improved appreciation for poetry, as well as the modern novel. \r\n\r\nI have become better at sharing rhetorical and accurate points regarding literature beyond pointing out items of interest. I have also learned to contrast those ideas with the ideas of my classmates.",

                "The classroom discussions were always excellent; there were times when I would have liked to hear my professor voice more of her own thoughts rather than letting the students take the lead",
                "Strengths: Even if I didn't say much in many of the discussions, I was keenly listening to everyone's interpretations and ideas. I tried to take detailed notes each class because I thought every book was fascinating and I thought each of our discussions about these books were fascinating. My favorite books were Cervantes' \"Don Quixote\", Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\", Lorraine Hansberry's \"A Raisin in the Sun\", and David Walcott's \"Omeros\".",
                "There were no weaknesses to this course, and its strengths were infinite. I felt so welcomed and intellectually encouraged in the classroom. Everyone was immensely kind, and Professor Valis did a wonderful job of teaching us how to really listen to each other's points and how to be more compassionate in academic spaces. She is truly incredible, and deserves all praise.",
                "The seminars were very well run, but sometimes the reading load was a bit too much to do it too thoroughly. But that is sort of just the nature of DS.",
                "Incredible teaching quality and peers. I wish there were more time to delve into and absorb each text, but I also understand the nature of DS is simply fast-paced.",
                "The course has an excellent repertoire of texts; James Joyce and Henrik Ibsen are necessary additions, perhaps in exchange of, say, Flaubert. \r\n\r\nThe Professor's instruction was a strength. She has a wonderful and complete understanding of literature and has mastered the literary discussion.\r\n\r\nA problem in literature courses is evincing real arguments geared toward the truth from students and not merely pointing out ideas of interest; thus, the course must set a higher bar for comments in class to drive toward the actual truth of the text and foment disagreement and discourse. Students should also feel encouraged to share their opinions on ideas brought up in the text  do they agree with the author?\r\n\r\nThe reading is a real strength. I think more context and connection between the texts is important.",
                "Discussions and quality of lectures were certainly he strength of the course. I would live to have focused more on certain passaged to appreciate more the writing.",
                "Fantastic material and student engagement, but too much reading assigned weekly."

Prof. Valis is a wonderful person and professor, and, if the student can manage the workload, they ought to take this course, regardless of their prospective major, so long as they are interested.",
