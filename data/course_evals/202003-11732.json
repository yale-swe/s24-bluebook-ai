Within each of these topics, we proved several key results and used them to prove other corollaries and applications (e.g. the Erds-Ko-Rado Theorem and resulting applications in extremal graph theory). More generally, I improved my ability to think of formal mathematical proofs, especially in the fields of set theory and graph theory. From the complexity (and confusion) of the proofs in class, I developed the ability to understand when proofs were explained to me, and from the challenge of homework proofs, I strengthened my ability to solve problems independently. Additionally, by writing up homework and exam solutions, I built up my skills at explaining these proofs. Meanwhile, despite being seemingly disjoint and confusing at times, the structure of these units did ultimately provide me with a thorough understanding of how they all overlap and intersect, giving great insight into the field overall. However, it was quite theoretical and different from previous iterations of the class, so definitely adjust your expectations accordingly."

                "Office hours were usually really helpful.\r\nWeakness(?): There's too much material - section covered a lot of examples but I didn't have the time (or energy) to attend section. They were also recorded; I just wasn't motivated enough to watch the section recordings.",
                "Strengths: The course materials are decently organized by time and the content is pretty interesting, especially for CS or Math majors.\r\nWeaknesses: For the virtual format, don't expect the material to be delivered that interestingly. Prof. Pohoata is a bit messy which makes the direction of long proofs hard to follow. Additionally, when we approach a new topic, we dive straight into the deep-end, i.e. get started right away on the proof, which can be hard. I would have liked it if there had been easier questions to get us warmed up for the bigger questions.",
                "Psets are related to material, peer tutors are EXTREMELY helpful and perhaps the biggest positive of the course.  Professor is quite awful and offered little support.",
                "I could follow the lectures, but despite feeling like I mostly understood, I struggled to complete the homework questions on my own and I REALLY struggled on the exams. I wish the lectures helped us more with actually knowing how to solve the problems.",
                "I thought the course presented some interesting math puzzles and provided a good introduction to proof methods. However, it was quite a bit more difficult than advertised, and I think Professor Poahata expected more comfort with math than was implied by the Math 115 prerequisite.",
                "Strengths: Joon Lee. Joon if you are reading this, thank you for all your good work. I hope other people express their gratitude too because you deserve a round of applause. Also, interesting material, mostly. \r\nWeaknesses: Some sections were really poorly explained. This was mostly true for the first third of the course. Like the proof of the AM-GM inequality--what on earth happened there. Some other places in the first third I felt equally confused, but I don't remember the names of the proofs. Graph theory was pretty well-explained but some proofs in the Ramsey section were under-explained (e.g. for Schur's I didn't understand that the edges were taking the color of the corresponding vertex in our original set of integers rather than some generic color assigned to a given number, and for hypergraph I didn't understand that coloring subsets =\/= coloring the vertices within the subsets, until I went to office hours, aka Joon). These might seem like basic misunderstandings but we can't all be on a high level all the time when it's our first time taking a proof-based math course. It wouldn't kill Cosmin to spend some more time on the context of the setup. Or even cut down the material by like 1\/15 (I hear there's more material this year than in the past anyway) and spend one class prior to each midterm reviewing the basics of the key proofs. That would be sweet. \r\nAlso maybe I'm missing something but it would've been nice if sample solutions to the exams were uploaded. Also solutions to the homework tended to take a while.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Interesting material, especially graph theory since it is a lot less abstract than most math classes\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Lack of engagement on the students' part. I believe that students should be forced to turn their camera on.\r\n- No use of the textbook\r\n- Very hard problem sets and exams compared to other years",

                "The notes were very clear and the office hours were very helpful. The exams were however very challenging, but I appreciated that they were all take-home. Class often went overtime, and I felt that there was just too much material covered, not all of it useful.",

                "The course material seems like it could be interesting, and it definitely has many applications in statistics\/economics\/computer science\/etc. However, the largest weakness of the course was the lack of quality teaching. I believe this was Professor Pohoata's first semester teaching, and lectures were unclear and disorganized. He did not present the information in a manner suitable for students without experience in combinatorics. Most examples were presented without relevant explanation, and there was not enough energy spent helping to develop methods for proof based assignments. Theories and proofs were presented in a disjointed and confusing way without examples. The level of difficulty of assignments in no way matched what we learned in class. Homework assignments were impossible to do without going to office hours and midterms often covered content not explained or emphasized in class. Assignments did not include clear feedback on why points were taken off.",
                "While I think this course is good in general, more transparency with the grading scheme would've been appreciated as the failure to define the curve ahead of time caused a good chunk of students to drop the course, ruining the curve for everyone else. Additionally, the problems should be solvable given a standard engagement with the lectures and lecture notes, and not impossible special cases that take hours and hours of mindless brainstorming until you get a eureka moment that allows you to figure out the answer.",

                "Strengths: interesting content and challenging topics to understand requiring good amounts of thought to be put in, good notes to view for each section outlining material for class, professor would go over previous lecture material that was difficult at the beginning of each class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very, very difficult exams which increased in difficulty as the year went on, professor sometimes went quickly and often went a bit overtime in lectures, so occasionally had to catch up to fully understand material that was briefly skimmed over",
                "The course was too difficult for the intro level class it was with homework assignments that were nearly impossible to finish on time. The exams were harder than the homework by so much that the class felt nearly impossible. Please, make the class easier and cover the introductory level material before advancing. Also, stop assigning so much homework.",
                "Strengths: Cosmin was very excited about the material, and there were lots of opportunities to receive help in the course. In particular, the peer tutors were phenomenal, but that varies from year to year. There was a lot of time allotted for the exams, which was very much needed. \r\nWeaknesses: The difference between the material we covered in class and the homework\/exam problems was drastic, with the homework problems being much more difficult. The first month, we had a homework each week, which sounds like a normal amount to have, but the difficulty level of the problems was extremely high. Think contest math level problems, most of which required some obscure\/strange trick to figure out that was only possible to solve with help. Having a good TA and peer tutors is pretty instrumental in succeeding in this class, but even with those resources, it would take me around 10 hours to complete the homework. It was also difficult to read Cosmin's handwriting at times, but he worked to try and alleviate that.",
                "Strengths: This course covered genuinely interesting material and had very useful lecture notes posted on Canvas. \r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were not engaging and often felt like they were composed entirely of proofs of certain theorems. While these proofs were interesting, they did not really teach students how to approach and prove similar problems on their own. They also often failed to give a larger context to the significance and applicability of these proofs. This is a lecture format that I have been found to be largely characteristic of the Yale Math department, so I may just have different preferences in terms of my learning style.  Another weakness of the course was the take-home format of the two midterms and final. Though the professor would approach these as \"taking a few hours\" to sit down and do some math, each of the midterms took me over 12 hours to complete, and the three day final engulfed 25 hours of my exam week studying period. I do not believe this workload was unusual among similarly prepared peers. While these large time commitments were entirely of my choice - I could have simply stopped after writing down a basic idea for each problem - the problems in this course are formatted more like riddles and less like calculus problems. Therefore, it is often the case that the only way to improve your performance on an exam is to spend more time \"guessing\" solutions rather than practicing calculations. As a result, these three exams were extremely unpleasant.",
                "Excellent professor, very committed to teaching and very responsible. Incredibly clear and coherent lectures, well-paced and great explanations. Lecture notes also provided, though the lesson material is well-explained to follow along. Office hours were very helpful. Problem sets and exams were thoughtfully-designed, though my only gripe is that they were too challenging and therefore time-consuming, which is not expected for Math 244. Giving a 2-hour midterm vs. a 5-day midterm is very different, but I don't think it justifies making your questions so challenging and time-consuming. You may expect students to work on your 5-day midterm for just 5 hours, but in reality students will work on it for much longer, and it becomes a race to see who can dedicate more time to figuring out the questions. Those who can dedicate all 5 days clearly will do better. Making questions tougher just to justify a take-home exam isn't very reasonable in my opinion. Other than that, excellent course!",
                "I wish that the material taught had clearer applications to the homework and exams. I often struggled with the homework and exams without the help of peer tutors.",

I also thought his notes were quite excellent, with the small exception that some of the proofs in later notes packets e.g. 3\/4 are omitted. I highly suggest he continue teaching the course, but with some adjustments to aid student learning. \r\n\r\nA weakness would be the discrepancy in difficulty between his psets and exams. I suggest he give more pset problems and exam problems that are MUCH MORE SIMILAR to what he teaches in class, rather than much more difficult than what he does in class.",
                "Hard problem sets",
                "the psets and tests were insanely difficult and time-consuming, but the professor was nice and I think he meant well just bc he rly overestimated our abilities lol",
                "Strengths: very interesting material if you're into math\/combinatorics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: unorganized for learning, topics can seem irrelevant, genius kids end up getting the best grades while the rest of us plebs are suffering (the standard deviation for the exams are pretty big), lack of support",
                "Strengths are interesting material, challenging problem sets, and tons of new knowledge. Weaknesses are the difficulty of the exams.",
                "I didn't find there to be any particular strengths or weaknesses -- this is just a very standard math course, with the setup of teaching concepts and going over proofs during lecture and making use of those concepts in problem sets. I don't have any issues with this setup, but these features also aren't \"strengths\" of the course per se, since these same features can be found in other math courses. There was also more than enough help available in the form of office hours, which I greatly appreciated.",
                "Professor Pohoata is amazing. He is far and away the best math teacher I have had at Yale, both from a \"good at explaining the material\" perspective and a \"creating an incredibly engaging course\" perspective. Just be wary that the take home assessments will be really tough, and his expectations for how long they will take are likely off by a factor of 3-5.",
                "This class seemed to jump around a lot between subjects. We would spend the first half of class just reviewing the material from the previous class and never seemed to move very far. We had two weeks usually to work on the homework but then we wouldn't cover the material on the homework or exams until maybe the day before they were due. It was quite frusterating",
                "Lectures and problem sets never fully prepared me for exams, which included concepts not covered in class. We received little feedback on problem sets and exams, which made it hard to improve during the course. Exam solutions were also never posted, so I left the course still confused about some concepts.",
                "the lectures just went in circles and we didn't see the significance for a lot of what we learned",
                "Strengths: TAs were great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were quite disorganized and lecture notes were often incomplete. Assignments were unnecessarily difficult compared to previous iterations of the course, and often did not test our knowledge of the required concepts but rather required us to find different approaches that we were not prepared to find. Lectures always went over time and Cosmin was not respectful of our time.",
                "Very challenging.",
                "The lectures are relatively straightforward to understand, sometimes you need to take a couple of seconds to digest what is being told but you can normally always understand what is going on. Problem sets are harder, since you have to be coming up with insights yourself. I wish there were some more tips about how to approach the difficult problem sets, and what to do if you are stuck.",
                "Strengths: Generally covered interesting material. Problem set problems allowed students to get a stronger grasp of course content.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture notes could also be more comprehensive--they were too difficult to read and understand, even after attending lecture. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the content could be presented in a more straightforward way and lectures could be better prepared. They seemed impromptu and concepts were often explained in a confusing manner. For example, the Schur theorem could have presented in a MUCH clearer way. By simply searching for it on Youtube, one can find a student from the University of Georgia who explained the process, logic, and meaning of the much better. Something which took 45 confusing minutes in class could be concisely explained in under 15 minutes.",
                "Since the lecture material was quite difficult, I attended discussion section but it was extremely hard to listen to and follow. I wished there were TAs for discussion sections so that there were more times and teaching styles available for students.",
                "The subject matter pretty much exactly what is to be expected for an introductory course in discrete mathematics, with additional material at the end on the probabilistic method providing a digestible introduction to more advanced techniques. For students coming in without a background in proof writing (e.g. those who took MATH 120 rather than MATH 230\/231), the proof-based nature of the class might be a bit much at first. Some more \"intro to writing proofs\"-style help sessions or classes would likely be very helpful.",
                "Strengths: interesting topics, pretty organized Weaknesses: assessments were not a reflection of what we had learned at all. they were pretty much puzzles where you had to spend hours trying to find the trick to apply to the problem which was frustrated given the amount of time put into the course also the homework grading was extremely inconsistent where some graders would give full marks where others would take off harshly and graders weren't rotated",
                "The main strengths of this course were the strong overall vision, the cool proofs\/topics, and the generally reasonable and interesting homeworks. Each of the six units went into a decent amount of depth, and they fed into each other quite well. The proofs we did in class did help solve the homework problems, and the homeworks themselves reinforced those same topics with further understanding. In general, as someone with strong previous proof experience, these proofs were still difficult and very interesting, and I was often quite pleased with the final results. Only having six homeworks was definitely smart, as I had more time to really investigate and think about them. However, we sometimes only learned the topics on the homework in the class before it was due, which made it hard to work ahead. Correspondingly, the main weaknesses of this course were the sometimes confusing lectures, the occasionally too difficult homework\/exam problems, and the slightly disorganized overall structure. Sometimes the proofs in lecture were done too fast or skipped important parts, which made them hard to follow, even as an experienced prover. Likewise, some of the homework problems and definitely a few exam problems were just far too difficult, requiring techniques and thought processes far beyond those covered in class. Furthermore, a lot of times, despite having lots of office hours\/sections, it felt like the answers to questions was thats the idea, now figure it out yourself rather than real assistance towards a solution. As someone with friends in the class and a decent background, this was just slightly frustrating and led me to work alone or in friend groups instead, but people without these luxuries got discouraged and many dropped the class. Finally, I think the overall organization of the class could be improved, including the aforementioned homework cadence and lecture structure; the lectures often went over class time for little reason, leading to rushed proofs and additional confusion. Going over the proofs again the next class helped a lot, but that only underscored the benefits some better organization would bring."

This was very helpful in reviewing material when I hadn't understood something\/when the professor froze on Zoom sometimes\r\n\r\nImproved:\r\n- The professor was writing out on a white board during class and it was sometimes hard to read while also trying to listen and understand. He often made mistakes during proofs and had to go back to fix them which made note-taking very messy and sometimes hard to follow.\r\n- During one class, he prepared a powerpoint presentation which was much easier to follow, but he covered the material way too fast. Covering powerpoint slides a lot slower would be the best compromise in my opinion.",

                "The core live lectures were definitely effective, as people could ask live questions and engage through the chat. Likewise, the discussion sections were more informal, less intimidating ways to engage with a smaller group and the TA. However, as mentioned before, these settings and office hours were not ideal for figuring out problems without having a very specific question, as we were often told we had to do it ourselves rather than getting proper direction. I think this was hurt by the open format, as people could not break into groups naturally to bounce ideas off each other. In my computer science class we tried Gather.town to obtain this functionality, and something similar may have been beneficial. However, the ULA office hours were better, with more direction in terms of the proofs and a bit more congeniality among students. In terms of exams, the take-home format was definitely beneficial, as you could really engage in depth with the problems and had time to think them through without stressing about time or uploading answers. Furthermore, the given proofs would definitely be too hard to finish in just a few hours, so this format allowed for more interesting exam problems."

You're one of the people who will succeed in this course. Knock yourself out. \r\n\r\nIf you're a person like me, I would be willing to take this course with careful consideration\/caution. Like me means: \r\n--this course can count towards your major \r\n--you like math and were pretty good at it in high school, but you've never taken a proof-based math course or competed in math competitions or something. You're a very logical thinker but might struggle with using math in a \"creative\" way   \r\n--if something is explained half-decently, you can get the general gist on the first try, without having to get it explained again \r\n--you get mildly stressed about grades but not super stressed. (You won't freak out if you end up with a B+ or an A-) \r\n--you have enough time in your schedule to set everything aside for a couple days and grind for the midterms \r\n\r\nthat was me and although I was tempted to drop the course after the first midterm, I stuck it out and didn't regret it (mostly). If you're basically like that or better than that (e.g. you actually can be creative with math, I envy you) then you can probably take the course. Sometimes the workload can be stressful but since there's only 6 psets, you mostly just have to a) go to office hours and b) be prepared to grind for the exams. However, be warned that two of the smartest people I know dropped this course after the first midterm and didn't regret it. So, maybe spare yourself the trouble if you're on the fence. \r\n\r\n(Oh also, this is already super long but if not for Joon Lee, I would've def dropped this course and it probably would've been the right decision. So if there's any way, maybe try to suss out if the peer tutors are good beforehand.)",

                "This course under Prof. Pohoata was difficult at times but manageable. The office hours were very helpful towards completing the psets and the midterms were difficult but solvable. The final was unexpectedly very hard and I'm hoping the curve will be a generous one. In previous years I believe that >50% of the class receives an A-\/A, so although the topics we covered were mostly theorem\/proof based, there is a nice cushion and plenty of support to fall on. The notes were well formatted and easy to follow, and the material on the midterms was easier than the psets\/class notes. The topics covered include basic combinatorics, proof methods (pigeonhole, induction, etc.), graph theory, extremal graph theory, and the probabilistic method.",
                "Yes! Cosmin was a great professor, and the material is super interesting. If you're comfortable with proof-based mathematics, I'd say this course is well worth taking.

I came into the class without any prior proof writing experience, but you will do much better in the class if you are familiar with proof writing. This was genuinely the hardest class I've ever taken, and I only managed to push through because of the peer tutors and the support system I had found in the class.",

However, if you took 230\/231, felt a little shaky with theorems beyond Bolzano-Weierstrass, and are simply looking for a fun math class to enjoy, I would NOT recommend Math 244. The exams alone can consume a weekend, and the problem sets and lectures are just not very rewarding or informative if you can not allocate 5-10 hours into trial-and-error style problem solving. I took this course as a fun follow-up to Math 230\/231, and (in my opinion,) it was almost just as difficult but was no where near as engaging.",
                "Yes, definitely take 244 with Cosmin Pohoata. Very well-taught and well-explained. Be prepared to spend some hours on psets and exams though, but they're rewarding and office hours are helpful.",

From my personal experience with the course, I would say if not for my olympiad math competition background from high school, I would not have enjoyed this course -- note that many of the problems Professor Pohoata assigns, as someone who loves proofs and has authored such olympiad math style books, is of the olympiad math style.",
                "no I wouldn't. The psets are needlessly difficult",
                "I am unsure if I would recommend because this was probably the hardest class I've ever taken at Yale (difficulty went up substantially from other semesters taught by other professors; I've heard from friends that previous classes didn't even get to graph theory, which was a bulk of this class). You should probably only take this if you need to fulfill a requirement (which is what I did for the BS in S&DS). However, I will say that I did learn a lot, especially because this was my first proof-based class, but it was kind of like getting waterboarded.",
                "No. I feel really bad saying this since this is Cosmin's first year of teaching, but this is one of the worst classes I've taken at Yale. The class is unorganized and the material sometimes seem to be coming out of nowhere. The problem sets and take-home exams are difficult. The professor lives in another world of math, where things that are \"trivial\" for him are things that make students cry at 3am. You will have nightmares of this class. Your dreams will become you solving math problems. You'll find out that even when you're sleeping, you can actually be productive and find proofs to the problem sets\/exams in your dreams. \r\n\r\nI really think Cosmin has a lot of potential to make this class really engaging. The material in the first half seduced me to taking this class until the end. The second half was interesting as well, but I felt the guiding vision of the class was gone. I've always been a math person, but this class has made me sympathize with the people back in high school who always asked \"when will you ever use math in your life?\". Towards the end, I lost almost all my motivation to keep learning the material. The topics just felt too obscure. \r\n\r\nTo those of you who won't heed our words, you are a masochist. Then again, I think the class can be astronomically better next semester if Cosmin really reworks the class, creates slides for the material (his handwriting is hard to read), and connect more obscure topics to more general topics. The class really has potential, but from my experience this semester, I suggest -- no, I beg you -- not to take this class. \r\n\r\nJoon Lee, the ULA, was really the lifeline for a lot of students in this course. Please thank this angel sent from heaven.",

                "I would recommend this course to students interested in math for sure, especially if they are also interested in computer science, since a lot of what we learn in this course has applications in computer science. It can also be a good standalone math course to take for someone who isn't really interested in taking lots of math courses, but does want to have some exposure to it, since this course doesn't build off of material from any previous courses or lead into another course. However, I as a math major found it to be quite challenging, so it could definitely be overwhelming for students who don't have a ton of experience with college-level math, and with proof-writing especially.",
                "YES YES YES. Professor Pohoata Alone is the reason to take this course. I think it would be an interesting class without him, but I would drop everything to take it if he is teaching.",
                "Probably not unless it's required for your major. This class was not what I had been led to believe it was. It has a reputation for being a fun not too difficult math class. This time around, the material was very different and felt a little chaotic. I was taking it with some other difficult classes and felt a bit blindsided. I also didn't feel like I learned that much. We would spend a lot of time every class on just one proof and then be expected to make very significant leaps in our understanding of the material on the problem sets and exams. I wish we had spent more time on subjects or at least gone through more examples rather than always jumping to an extreme case for an idea and spending hours developing that proof.  I think there are many interesting proofs and ideas in discrete mathematics, but this didn't seem like the class to learn them in. There are other Math classes at Yale that would likely be a better use of your time.",

However, in his own lectures notes, he occasionally concedes that he is too lazy to finish his lecture notes and thus leaves them as incomplete. \r\n\r\nAssignment questions are cryptic and seem purposefully (or unintentionally, which is arguably worse) unclear.

Since both midterms and the final were only 5 problems, if one could not figure out the \"trick\" to solve a given problem, it would severely impact their final grade.

For the mathematics major, this is a no-brainer great introduction to discrete mathematics, and is fairly fun and low-workload. For the computer science major, this class covers graph theory, objects which are found throughout computer science. Studying them in greater theoretical depth, though it may not make you a better coder per se, will pay dividends in your logical reasoning ability. To everyone else, this is a great QR! MATH 115 is stated as a prerequisite, but this class exists in a separate realm from calculus and any student who did well in precalculus could probably do well in this class. If you hated calculus, try this out before you write off mathematics completely.",
                "No, as it stands with assessments now, I was very frustrated with the feeling that the assignments and exams were in no way a good reflection of what we learned in lecture or the amount of time I put into the course. It felt more \"tricky\" than fair or effective",
                "I would recommend this course to a student with a strong introductory math background who wants an intensive introduction to formal proofs in combinatorics and graph theory or to a student with previous proof background interested in a thorough overview of these topics. The level of rigor in this course may be discouraging to someone with limited mathematical proof experience\/confidence, but it was actually very interesting for well-prepared students. This iteration of the course was significantly more difficult than previous iterations and focused more on theoretical mathematics. Thus, this course should not be taken lightly, even by those with strong backgrounds. On the other hand, it is also quite engaging and serves as a good introduction to combinatorics and graph theory for more advanced classes."
