The only weakness I could find was the fact that we had to rent some of the movies ourselves. I would expect from an institution such as Yale to be able to provide full access to these media for its students, unless there was access and simply I was not aware of this.\r\n\r\nAlso, some of the movies included very sensitive content and adding trigger warnings on the syllabus would me immensely valuable and appreciated."
