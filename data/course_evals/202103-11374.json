The variety of ways that cultures around the world experience these processesrelatedly, that \"normal\" is a construct. How to critically evaluate a pop science article. How to talk about my own life experiences in the context of evolutionary biology. Perhaps most importantly, learned that biological and cultural evolution, and biology and culture in general, are inextricably intertwinedhow you can't really study one without studying the other.",
                "This is a PHENOMENAL CLASS. If you have the opportunity, you MUST take this class. I not only learned the complex mechanisms behind biological processes in the female body, but also the cultural and social meanings that come with them. I loved doing each and every reading -- I never wanted to miss a single class. I learned so much about my own body and the possible explanations for various functions. I also learned about the biological characteristics of women around the world and how they experience their biological womanhood. I was fascinated by the way our environments and lifestyles influence our biology.",

                "Everything was great.",
                "Strengths are Professor Valeggia's teaching methods, a low-stress environment that prioritizes learning over memorization, and an interactive student-led teaching style. Weaknesses are that for a leminar, I didn't feel very connected to classmates and the T&Q assignments become very repetitive.",
                "No weaknesses. Only strengths. Great course.",
                "I looked forward to this course every single week because of how engaging not only our seminar discussions on Wednesdays, but also Professor Valeggia's lectures on Mondays, were. Not only is this course's material fascinating, it is led in a way that centers student experiences, which allowed my peers to really get to know each other and to learn from and challenge one another. Almost every Wednesday seminar discussion is led by a different group of students (everyone gets the chance to co-lead one discussion), which kept things lively and different from week to week. The critique papers were a fantastic way to improve my ability to engage with scientific research, and I loved that we had the freedom to take the final project in any direction we wanted. Starting every class with meditation was also wonderful. There is really nothing I would change about this class!",
                "Strengths -- The class was very well structured: we started with female anatomy, menarche, puberty and ended with menopause and aging. I was so impressed by Claudia's integration of the biological with the anthropological. This was one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- I literally can't think of a single one.",
                "Only strengths! The class prioritizes learning over rote memorization. Professor Valeggia is the best professor. She and the design of the class are amazing",
                "strengths: highly flexible assignment deadlines, personal and flexible classroom experience, low-stress readings.",
                "No weaknesses! I honestly loved and valued each class.",
                "There aren't many classes like this one at Yale, and that's its strengthit's not conducted traditionally and allows for the students to interact with class content in a full way.",

                "Absolutely!! The way Professor Valeggia designs the course means that you will learn because you want to, not because you have to. At the end of every week you'll find yourself wondering: why didn't I know that?? Material is consistently fascinating and Professor Valeggia is wonderful. Course is highly accessible for those--like me--who have little to no science background, and is also well-designed for those who do.",

If youre lucky enough to get into this class you MUST take it  Claudia and the teaching staff are so knowledgeable, supportive, and kind; the assignments are meaningful and creative and also deadlines are super flexible; learn very important topics that impact how to better understand reproductive health  what you learn from this class will be applicable to everyday life!! You learn so much :))",
