At times I felt I had been thrown into the deep end of the philosophical pool without knowing how to swim. This feeling, however, was crucial to my satisfaction at the end of the course. The feeling I drowning forced me to swim. I feel more confident in my ability to engage with philosophical debate and more interested in looking further into questions left over from the class.",
                "Much deeper understanding of religious and reason philosophy as it appears in the works of many classical Western philosophers. Got what seemed to be a crash course in different philosophers that are crucial to the Western canon. Crucial philosophers read include Rousseau, Descartes, Locke, Taylor, Derrida, Marx, Kant, Hume, Haraway, and more. Definitely an enhanced ability to read and understand complex philosophical thought, as well as apply them in a deeper and more meaningful way in discussion. Certainly changed the way I consider many of the givens in modern society, beyond just the reason and religion and the way we regard them now. Learned how to meaningfully question the foundational concepts of things we all experience every day."

                "Great readings and discussion, could have been a bit larger of a class!",
                "I think the class had a very interesting premise but that premise wasn't always honored. I understand that part of the class and syllabus design was to explore reason, and particularly, religion, in a more conceptual, subtle, gradual way, but I think the effect of that approach made some class reading/discussion feel a bit disconnected from the rest of the coursework. There was very little historical context included in course readings and this was often supplemented by the instructor in class before discussion began, but there were times when the lack of context to go along with the philosophical readings made their application or even allusions harder to understand. In general, the class concepts were very challenging and very interesting but there was a general feeling of ambiguity and disconnection. Definitely understand that this is the nature of philosophy, but I think class thematic connectivity and continuity suffered with the current course design.\r\n\r\nAnother weakness was that discussion often stalled, but that was primarily because there were only 5 enrolled students. Higher enrollment and small-group work within a larger discussion group could greatly improve the course.\r\n\r\nI think another way to improve the course would be to more firmly/more often define the more important terms of the class. There were several times when I felt a bit lost in discussion because I didn't fully understand the philosophical terms being used. I think preliminary clear, simplified definitions of some of these more important, recurring philosophical terms (e.g. ontology, epistemology, degrees of referral, etc. ) would greatly assist oral and written comprehension. Even a cheat sheet of important class terms to be handed out at the beginning/throughout the semester could be very helpful here. \r\n\r\nThat said, the philosophical explorations of reason were fascinating. We had engaging discussions about interesting and new concepts that were very challenging, but rewarding once understood. It was very interesting to compare many different Western philosophers' takes on similar themes, reading their responses and objections to one another. This content was very challenging but very interesting."

                "If you're looking for a strong conceptual challenge about many interesting philosophical concepts, I would take this class. This class was easily the most conceptually difficult class I have taken. The concepts are elusive and challenging, but very interesting once you were able to understand them. This class is about reason and religion in a collective, roundabout way, but on the surface will feel completely devoted to reason. I believe this course should be cross-listed in the philosophy department because so much of the syllabus is devoted to the philosophical exploration of reason.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a class that examines religion in a historical and societal context, I wouldn't strongly recommend this class. It is HIGHLY conceptual and there is very little religious history or much comparison between the two during the bigger part of the semester. I would recommend this class most highly to people interested primarily in the philosophy and application of reason, logic, and practicality. Those more interested in religion, religious history, and historical comparison between the two shouldn't take this class."
