                "The textbook (Griffiths) is really great, and the professor is really good at keeping up engagement and explaining things in a clear manner. When I got to the exams, I really felt like I understood what we had covered and why, which was in part due to the layout of the textbook. Also, the problems on the problem sets were creative and had cool relations to actual lab work going on at Yale. The psets seemed pretty long some weeks, but overall I think the pacing and everything was good.",
                "Professor Moore is fantastic, he is a great lecturer and explains concepts very clearly. I looked forward to coming to every class because he made the material interesting and understandable.",
                "It was a very good course. Professor Moore is an incredible teacher and did a very job managing all the difficulties associated with the pandemic",
                "Professor was super caring and engaging. The textbook was also great. Sometimes I could get lost during really long stretches of algebra in in-class proofs, though.",
                "Strengths: very clear and consistent, great textbook, helpful professor and TAs, interesting problem sets that explore other areas of physics",
                "Professor Moore teaches closely with the textbook, which I found to be really helpful as it meant we had two mediums to learn the material and could easily reference between them.",
                "I thought the lectures were fantastic and incredibly informative.",
                "Strengths: clear expectations and rigid structure from day 1, a very interesting subject and a great professor with a very soothing voice. A very no-nonsense class that you can get a lot out of if you wish. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would definitely have made more use of the TF office hours if they were longer or more frequent (an hour a week is the lowest I've ever had for a Yale STEM class).",
                "I think Professor Moore is an amazing professor. He was extremely talented at breaking down tough concepts and simply explaining the examples. Furthermore, I think that this course was structured well, and the material naturally built upon itself. Over time, I was amazed at how much I learned in the class. The course is tough (exams were always extremely hard), but interesting and well organized. I think something that could make the class more manageable and allow for more interaction is to have more office hour and study hall sessions.",
                "The class is taught very closely to Griffiths which is a strength given the textbook is a great treatment of E&M. Moreover, Moore does a great job at covering the textbook and even his pset questions are super interesting and full of footnotes that show you the real world applications of what you are learning.",
                "This class was organized very well and did a great job working parallel with the textbook. Professor Moore is as good as any physics professor at Yale in explaining complex topics and preparing very interesting lectures."

This was great as it made it easier for students to follow along with the lecture. As a result, I felt that this was the most normal lecture course that I took this year. Due to Zoom fatigue, it became harder through the year to pay attention, but nonetheless Professor Moore did a great job at explaining material.",

But it's more [Moore?] than that), but his method of giving information is really fantastic. The lecture notes are also really great to be able to look back at.",

                "If you're a physics major, you'll take this. If you aren't but are looking to take a physics class, I'd say this would be a better one due to Professor Moore. The content is interesting and he teaches it well.",
                "yes, professor Moore was probably the best physics teacher I've had at Yale",
                "I would recommend this course.",
                "I'm a math major who took this course without any physics background whatsoever for the B.S. degree, so I'll talk specifically to that experience. If this is you, I would say that you should only take this course if you are very comfortable with multivariable calculus (which I know most math majors are not) and integration in spherical and cylindrical coordinates. If you haven't seen E&M before it'll be very hard to have any intuition for the subject and a lot of stuff will make little to no sense (more so than in classical mechanics, perhaps less so than in quantum), so make sure to read the Griffiths along with the class (it's a fantastic textbook) from the VERY beginning. With the Griffiths, lecture, and online resources, I did not feel as conceptually lost as I expected. Be warned that the weekly p-sets can take a fair amount of time, and study the Griffiths carefully for the exams. Classical mechanics is still probably a better choice if you're going for the B.S. degree last minute, but this is genuinely a good class and a really interesting subject if you want to jump in.",
                "I would recommend this course for physics majors and interested math majors. This class is taught and structured extremely well, which makes the course interesting. However, as with every other advanced level physics course, it is tough, so be prepared to spend time working through the material.",
                "Yes, any student interested in physics and particularly E&M should take this class. It essentially goes through all of Griffiths and is a good overview of the subject.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to all students interested in physics beyond the introductory level. This course is Yale Physics at it's best, and is worth the time and effort."
