    "The single purpose of this class is to get the art majors up to speed with one another and talking with each other. Given that, I think there could be more moments for concerted dialogue, even outside of each person's presentation. Maybe we make art together or something.",
    "It was interesting to hear about everyones backgrounds and theses, however I was not a fan of the speakers brought in for career workshops. They were all gallery workers which is one narrow sector of the art world. I wish there was more variety in the professions of the speakers."
