I was wrong! Prof. Neitzke is a natural teacher, and has a way of explaining abstract concepts (manifolds, tangent spaces, differential forms - you name it) in a way that's comprehensible to those who prefer more concrete structures. While I don't necessarily think I'll go into the more abstract side of math, this course has given me a much better understanding of it - and I think everyone interested in math (even if only its applications like CS\/engineering\/physics\/econ) should take this course after linear algebra - it gives you a much better understanding of the underlying structures of the mathematical tools you use in your field.",

I think a lot of students that take 120 are just taught the mechanics of solving problems, which really does make sense for most people, but this class was very interesting as someone who was interested in how multivariable calculus works. On top of that, I feel like I was set up for some higher level analysis courses, since we spent a good amount of time on topics like the delta-epsilon definition of continuity. This was also my first proof-writing course, and while I think the content leaned computation, I feel fairly ready to continue to 300-level math classes.",

                "Honestly the only weakness is the difficulty of the material but that isn't really the fault of the course there are so many resources to help and it is definitely manageable",
                "Strength: Prof. Neitzke taught it this term. Weakness: he doesn't teach it every term. Seriously.\r\n\r\nAfter spring break last semester, when everything moved online, I had the opportunity to start watching his lectures for 225, whether live or in the media library for the class. I was fine in my 225 lectures prior to spring break - between the lectures, the book, YouTube, and the peer tutors, I was starting to get a conceptual grasp on the field - but things really started clicking when I got the opportunity to watch his lectures. 250 was no different.\r\n\r\nI think what helps is that he shows lower-dimensional examples of the concepts he's teaching and then explains things that can generalize (e.g. wedge product) and things that can't (e.g. cross product), so I'd call that a strength. I can't really think of any weaknesses; I really enjoyed the course. (I would only maybe say that midnight deadlines are a bit rough, since in a normal year we theoretically have all night to work on a pset before submitting it the next morning - and inevitably most of us are going to wait until the last day. While the midnight deadline helps us get a bit more sleep, it definitely hurt my pset\/midterm grades, so I'd probably suggest moving the deadline to before class starts. But not a huge deal - and certainly not unique to this class - as midnight deadlines have become the standard for virtual assignments, for better or worse).",
                "Strengths: The lecture format of introducing a definition and then immediately giving a more tangible example was helpful for learning, as were the color-coded and neat lecture notes. Also, Professor Neitzke. In this weird semester, he made every effort to be accessible for answering questions. He tries to meet students where they're at with their understanding of the material. He plans ahead for lectures, explains concepts clearly, and has contagious enthusiasm for the content. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The pacing could be a bit uneven, although it didn't leave you unprepared for tests. Solutions to more problem sets would have been nice.",
                "It was clearly taught and made sense for most students. It was a good class, although the learning curve was steep at times. Cannot think of too many weaknesses.",
                "The problem set grading was slow, so we often handed in 3-4 problem sets before getting the first one back. It would have been helpful so we could've gotten more feedback on proof-writing and apply that to subsequent problem sets.",
                "The class was clearly prepared well in advance, and I really can't place enough emphasis on the coherency of the class. Not only were lectures recorded, but notes were posted and office hours were held regularly, so I really got the impression that students were meant to succeed. The homework problems were interesting, pretty straightforward if you listen to the lectures, and prepare students really well for tests. As someone who gets super stressed about tests, the take home tests were a blessing. Honesty, I looked forward to Math 250 every morning, and left the class with nothing but positive feelings. There was also a really natural flow to the material, and the entrance of differential forms felt natural by the end. My only incredibly minor suggestion would be to spend a day on some of the derivative laws we all know and love",
                "Professor Neitzke was super responsive, he was always available on Slack and through his email which made this normally tough class bearable. There were also office hours, though I'd prefer to have more. He is also a very entertaining and knowledgeable lecturer and I got alot from attending class.",
                "Weakness: virtually zero feedback from student graders on homework assignments - just points off and not even a hint at what went wrong.",
                "Strengths: well-organized lectures, Professor encouraged class participation, Professor presented material in very understandable ways (often providing both the formal definitions and some intuition, and always following with examples), use of slack to easily communicate with classmates and Professors, reasonable and engaging psets\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: pset grading was occasionally a bit slow, but not a big deal",
                "There should be more time dedicated to learning how to write a proof.",
                "I enjoyed the content of this course, and Professor Neitzke was a great and very clear lecturer. The problems sets were nicely sized and reinforced the material well, however I would say the grading was very strict in this class, sometimes unnecessarily. Otherwise, Professor Neitzke and our TA both clearly cared about our learning and were very available.",
                "Professor Neitzke went out of his way to make sure that we had the most assistance possible when seeking help through abundant office hours and a very helpful Slack channel.",
                "Professor was great",
                "Professor Neitzke is definitely approachable and cares but some things in the course are glossed over unless people ask questions. I liked Richards office hours and found them very helpful but wish we did more problems in class. I also think there could have been more commentary given\/support on homework and proof-writing. I wish we had an answer key to the psets prior to the first exam in order to have a better idea of what was required.",
                "Overall I thought Professor Neitzke was a great instructor and ran the course very well. He was very accessible for answering student questions both during lecture and at other times. Part of the difficulty of the course was simply due to it being a virtual semester. A review session before the midterm and before the final may have been helpful.",
                "Professor was great!",
                "A weakness of the course is the grading. We didn't receive grades fast enough to get a good sense of how well we were doing in the class or for which subjects to study harder. Also, problem sets weren't graded and turned back to us before we took the final and midterms, so for problems I was unsure about I couldn't verify if I was doing them correctly. A strength would be the professor's organization and lecture notes. Wow, the categorization and \"remarks,\" \"theorems,\" and \"example\" headings were really helpful, and it even changed the way I take notes for stem classes.",
                "The strength is definitely the professor. Prof. Neitzke is one of the most committed professors I have ever had, period. He stays after class every time anyone has a question and makes himself available for people to ask questions. I feel very lucky to have been in his class.",
                "The lectures and notes, as well as the office hours, were very helpful.",
                "The course provides good intuition and diverse examples for the concepts it teaches, which helps with understanding the material and how to apply it. However, the course was not very formal when discussing the theory of manifolds and differential forms (e.g., some results were stated without proof) and the problem sets were typically computation-heavy for these topics, which does not really help students who are looking for practice with approaching and writing proofs. While providing intuition is necessary, I feel like the course could be improved by making the material on manifolds and differential forms just as rigorous as the material on limits and derivatives (for which most, if not all, results were proved).",
                "Prof is very engaging and enthusiastic, unfortunately, I felt like the class wasnt very into it or the virtual setting decreased participation."

                "Success: engaging lectures; drawing things out by hand instead of clicking through a PowerPoint (so we can keep up with the pace and take notes); keeping the students engaged during lectures for those who were there; and for those students like me, who inevitably slept through the lecture each morning and watched the recordings later, making lectures interesting and engaging enough to where I could watch multiple and not get tired of them. Seriously - while other course's recordings\/live lectures were long, drawn out, and boring (often causing me to set them to 1.5x speed to get through), I would plan to sit down and watch one lecture for this course to stay on track, but instead get excited for the next topic and watch 2-3 lectures at a time. I'm not entirely sure how, but this class was engaging and it's the only course where I feel I did not lose any engagement learning online instead of in person.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Just in general, I don't think sending students to breakout rooms to discuss examples is particularly helpful. This course's material can be challenging, and unfortunately in an online environment the instructor can only monitor one group at a time. Fortunately, Prof. Neitzke noticed this and abandoned the idea, making the latter classes even more engaging than those at the beginning (as if that was even possible).",

                "Recording lectures definitely helped for people with time zone differences.

                "I really think this class was built around the pandemic very well. The live lectures kept things interesting and made sure students who could attend would stay engaged, while the recorded lectures and clear notes made the material accessible for people in different time zones. (I would imagine) the take home exams also kept things simple for people in other time zones.",

                "Yes. You usually have to take this for your major and don't have much choice, but the course was great. Neitzke it amazing. He was very available through Slack, after class, and office hours. The material can be pretty complicated, but Neitzke was really good at explaining things and answering questions in class. He was excited about the content and wanted to engage with us so we could understand it as best as we could. This is pretty rare given the past experience I have had with math professors here.",
                "Take this class! Not only is Neitzke a fantastic professor, but the workload was really manageable. I took Math 222, and I was expecting to be behind the ball with proof writing, but the class really warms you into it. Besides a few curveball questions on PSETs, the homeworks were super reasonable and followed the lecture pretty directly. If you're looking to understand the mechanics you learned in Math 120 in a pretty chill way, this class is absolutely for you.",
                "If this class is offered with Professor Neitzke again please take it. He is absolutely amazing, Yale is so lucky to have hired him last year. This subject is also incredibly interesting, if you have taken Math 120 you essentially can derive everything you learned from that class by the end of the semester. Really give you a better appreciation for mathematics.",
                "I would only recommend this course after a strong proof-writing and linear algebra background. Contrary to the stated requirements, a basic course in linear algebra such as Math 222 is not enough. \r\n\r\nGreat class if you have the right background though!",
                "Yes, absolutely! Calculus in R^n is beautiful, and taking this more rigorous approach helps make this beauty apparent. The material is incredibly interesting, and makes me want to continue learning more math. Professor Neitzke presented the material in an engaging and comprehensible way, and his enthusiasm and energy definitely rubs off (which was good considering the class started at 9:25am EST). If you enjoy math at all, you should definitely try taking this class.",
                "100%, Neitzke is one of the best math instructors I've had in my time at Yale and the content was well-organized and interesting.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course, as I found the material covered very valuable in thinking about vector spaces more generally and having a good foundation of them. I also really liked Professor Neitzke -- he explains everything very clearly, and genuinely cares about the success of his students. I would say the problem sets are often tedious and one or two problems always requires the help of office hours, but our TA was very helpful. I did find the grading rather harsh, though. Otherwise, midterms and problems were fair.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who would like to strengthen their proof-writing skills or gain knowledge of vector calculus for use in a field of interest.",
                "Yes, Professor is good.",
                "I think its a good introductory course to analysis and a good class overall. You need to be on top of things, which can be hard with online school, in order to really understand things, though.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in learning about calculus for arbitrarily high dimensions or manifolds, if they generally enjoy proof based math, if they are interested in taking more analysis later on, or if they are interested in better understanding math that is relevant in high dimensional contexts.",
                "Yes! It was a good intro to math proofs",
                "Yes; it's hard but rewarding.",
                "Yes, please take it under Prof. Neitzke!",
                "Yes.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in learning the concepts (either out of curiosity or to just know that such concepts exist so that they aren't totally unfamiliar with them when they see them again in higher level math courses) but perhaps not at the highest level of rigor.",
                "Yes, good conclusion to intro process to a math major and learning proof based math. If not interested in proofs, probably wouldnt recommend this course to that person"
