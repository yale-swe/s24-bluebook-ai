The course is structured in a beautiful way that facilitates a lot of learning in a fairly low-stake environment.\r\nThe problem sets were challenging but very enjoyable, it was great to be able to work in groups for problem sets and presentations.\r\nThe discussions were amazing and there is very little to critique about this class, if at all.\r\n\r\nThe only very very minor weakness was that Problem Set 1 took a long time to code and to run, but I think Professor Schaefer will definitely fix this in future iterations!",
                "Absolutely loved everything about the class. He planned the lectures very well, and having a combination of problem sets and presentations was very helpful in making sure we learn the nuances of the topics discussed in class.",
                "The simulation-based PSETs were good opportunities to use practical coding skills and develop better understandings of how the algorithms we were actually learning about worked. The presentations were a great opportunity to pick a topic and understand it well enough to explain it to peers, and to learn about things from peers as well. OVerall I think the only way this course could be improved is if there were more presentations - I really enjoyed working on them!",
                "Very interesting and informative lectures. The student presentations were great too but sometimes discussion wasn't great following the presentations.",

Professor Schaefer is kind, knowledgeable, and gives very interesting assignments. \r\nThe workload is also very manageable and pretty well distributed. It even gets lighter after Spring Break, which is so nice as other classes really pick up. Fantastic course.",
                "Yes, absolutely! He is a great professor!",
                "Yes! Great intro course if you are new to these topics and have a good python background. It doesn't necessarily repeat any topics you would have taken from a CS algos class or even an applied math/statistics thing because it focuses a lot more on applicaitons.",
                "Yes it's a very good cs econ intersection course, it really combines topics from both domains and talks about the impact on society.",
                "Wholeheartedly",
