In this art history class moreso than others, we explored the colonial relationships that governed consumption and production of \"exotic\" goods and flora/fauna which constituted a large part of Dutch art inspired by the colonies. I also learned about the development of studying life through microscopes, the group portrait, trompe l'oeil, dollhouses, and many other art forms. I gained new entrypoints into analyzing paintings and other artworks throughout the semester through section, and was encouraged to go outside the box for my final paper.",
                "I learned about works of art from the Dutch Golden Age, as well as some historical and political context for the artists and pieces we studied.",
                "I learned SO much about the Dutch art world and the Netherlands in general! I felt like my art analysis skills improved immensely thanks to both papers.",

Super comprehensive understanding of artistic themes and movements as well as artistic  responses to various political and social climates.

                "I learned so much about Dutch art in one semester! I loved how Professor Bass always put the art in dialogue with historical events. It helped me get a more comprehensive view on the Dutch \"golden age\" and whether it was truly a golden age.",

                "The strengths of this course are Professor Bass and my TF, Joyce Zhou. Professor Bass has a truly incredible command of the room and is by far the most engaging lecturer I've had at Yale. She knew everyone's name in the lecture, was humorous, and is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to all things Dutch art. Sections were also great! We went to Beinecke, the Yale Medical School Historical Library, and had many sections around the art gallery. The course is really helpful when it comes to pushing you to develop new ways of seeing art, and how to write art history visual analysis papers if you haven't done this before. There's really nothing that could be improved about the course.",
                "Strength: Marisa Bass!! Professor Bass is an AMAZING professor and incredibly knowledgeable about this topic. She is an engaging lecturer and makes every topic exciting. I loved visiting the YUAG and Beinecke, as well--who knew Yale has such an amazing collection of 17th-century Dutch art?",
                "This course was amazing. I'm so happy I took this course in my last semester at Yale. Professor Bass is an incredible and engaging lecturer. I can tell that there is so much thought put behind each of her lectures. I also loved how every section was spent in the YUAG and how we got to interact with the works themselves.",
                "The most organized class Ive taken at Yale by far. Professor Bass is incredibly on top of it. She new the names of the 70 people in lecture on the first day of class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bass and the teaching team. She is such an incredible lecturer - probably the best Ive had at Yale. I found the content so so interesting and it was so well organized and presented that it stuck right away. It was super exciting to go to lecture and the materials we saw/got to discuss in section were always really fascinating and right in line with what we were learning in class. Readings were thoughtful and meaningful; class discussion boards were always engaging and fun to write and read. I learned SO MUCH in this class - I really really loved it. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none, save for the final paper being due before reading week.",
                "Prof Bass was a strength -- she was incredibly committed to the course and to talking with the students and replying to their discussion posts.",
                "This class was extremely well organized and the guidelines and feedback were incredibly clear and helped me improve in the course as I went along.",
                "Really great course! The professor was very engaging and she structured the material really well. All lectures were very informative and interesting.",
                "Strengths: Marisa Bass was an incredibly good lecturer. I would be disappointed when the class period ended (!) and often felt like I should clap at the end of class. She's hugely knowledgeable and can talk eloquently off-the-cuff about anything someone might ask about. She had optional discussion boards each week, and she would respond kindly and thoughtfully to every student's post. Weaknesses: The midterm and final exam felt like rote memorization, which was tedious to study for and didn't really reflect the general skills that we had learned in the class.",
                "Strengths: Amazing lectures! Professor Bass's lecture style is very clear, concise, and direct. It is always easy to follow her lectures even though we do cover a lot of material. The discussion boards were also very helpful given that this is a lecture class -- I appreciated learning about how other students thought of the course material.",
                "Strengths: Prof Bass is an AMAZING lecturer! Sections were similarly very interesting -- including medical historical library, Beinecke, and YUAG archives  Weaknesses: The material felt discombobulated - it is organized by \"theme\" rather than time or artist, so we ended up skipping back and forth a lot in the class, which made it difficult to walk out feeling like I fully grasped the material.",
                "Strengths - engaging lecturer \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- hard to catch up on missed work",
                "One strength of this course is simply its approach to the era as a whole. I especially appreciated Prof. Bass' approach of challenging the notion of a Dutch \"Golden Age\" and looking beyond the prominent figures of the era to lesser-known but equally as fascinating artists. Some of my favorite lectures discussed artists whom I had never heard of before.",
                "I found the lectures very engaging! I also loved the syllabus and the fact that we saw various art pieces in person in section. No weaknesses come to mind immediately.",
                "This course is great!!!!!!!!",
                "Very engaging lectures and Ekaterina was wonderful TA",

                "Professor Bass made me like a genre/period of art I have never appreciated or liked before. The class was incredibly well-structured, to the point of keeping students of all backgrounds engaged. Section was always cool. The class covers a lot of ground without feeling overwhelming, contrived, unnecessary... she does a wonderful job of having information build throughout the semester.",

                "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course! Go for the incredible lectures & engaging sections! It was the only class this semester that I really didn't want to miss a single class period of. You learn so much about Dutch art and the sociopolitical climate of the 17th century Netherlands!",
                "PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE. Professor Bass is just amazing. She is an incredible lecturer and each class was jam-packed with interesting and engaging material. I learned so much, not only about the works of art and artists from the period, but also some essential information about the history and politics of the Netherlands. During section we actually got to see some of the works we talked about in class, which was just incredible. I really can't recommend this course enough  it truly changed the way I see the world.",
                "TAKE THIS CLASS. This is the kind of class that will give you a passion for life. I went in only tangentially interested in Dutch art and am left with not only a huge amount of knowledge of the 17th-century Netherlands and its artwork but also a desire to learn more. Professor Bass knows her stuff and delivers great lectures every single time. She has an engaging lecturing style, a great sense of humor, and her PowerPoint presentations are really well organized. She also ends her lectures exactly on time, which is a huge bonus. I was genuinely sad when this class ended.",
                "Please take this course! Professor Bass is incredible and learning about Dutch Art was fascinating.",
                "Yes",

                "I would highly recommend this to any student - whether or not they were majoring in art history. It is a fascinating course that shows why the humanities is important for all students to take.",
                "Yes! Professor Bass is wonderfully engaging, and cares deeply both about the material and about your learning. Its a cultural history class more so than an art history class, and I deeply enjoyed the immersion that brought.",
                "Definitely! My first art history course and I learnt a lot of new things and picked up a lot of skills. One of the most interesting classes i have taken at Yale so far",
                "Yes! This class was very well-organized, Marisa Bass is a fantastic lecturer, and the sections were always interesting and constructive. We visited the YUAG, the Beinecke, and the Medical History Library in section -- it really enhanced the class.",
                "Yes! I think everyone should take at least one class with Professor Bass before they graduate.",
                "This was the first art history class I took, and I would definitely recommend it. Prof. Bass makes a point of looking at various themes through art (such as science, colonialism, politics, etc) so there's definitely a way for those without an art history background to find interest in the course. \r\nThe course is well-organized, and the workload is on the higher end but not overwhelming. I also appreciated that the final exam wasn't cumulative-- it made studying easier.",
                "Yes, I would! It was fascinating, engaging, and challenging but not overwhelming.",
                "This is the best course ever. Take it if you're an art history major, take it just for fun even if you're not. You'll learn so much even if you don't care much for art. The workload is so light and you learn so many cool things!!!!",
                "Yes, wonderful",
                "yes!! every lecture was fun and informative. The content of Professor Bass's class has really stuck with me.",
                "I would! If you're interested in trying something new/random/low-risk/fun, this is a great class!",
