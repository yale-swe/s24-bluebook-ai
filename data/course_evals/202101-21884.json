                "strengths: good class discussion on texts (although this was slightly stilted on zoom). very interesting texts to read, with good themes covered.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: structure not very clearly set out. audio programmes quite long and with required reading in a foreign language this constituted a very high workload. grammar learning seemed somewhat sporadic and teachers and students were not provided with comprehensive grammar sheets until the very end of the semester.",
                "I think the course is generally good.  I found the self-graded homework to sometimes be a little confusing, but that may have been just me.",
                "Strengths: the structure is clear, and it progresses from lesson to lesson well. We get progressively more advanced and build on the knowledge learned earlier. The additional materials were also very good. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Of course, the virtual format was not ideal. The workoad could also be a bit high at times, and it was sometimes hard to keep up.",
                "I enjoyed the fact that class time was used to review terms and learn; although it was difficult to accommodate language classes during the pandemic, I do wish more class time was spent giving students the opportunity to practice speaking French.\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I did not enjoy the audio exercises that were given each day. The recorded exercises were of low audio quality, so it was difficult to hear what was being spoken by the narrators, and even at full volume the recordings were not loud enough for me. Many of the recordings did not even match the provided online worksheet. Additionally, the worksheets were all online, and I do not have a tablet or any way to fill out the worksheets, so I just wrote down my answers on whatever scrap paper I could find. I could have printed each individually, but because the worksheets did not belong to any sort of complete catalogue, I would've had to print out exercises every day (and spend money for it). Many of the recordings were twenty to thirty minutes in excess, which is not a bad thing by itself, but the pacing of the recordings was time-consuming; a grammar rule would be introduced and the recording wouldn't give you enough time to think about it, while for easier exercises an excess of twenty seconds was given in between simple questions, meaning you would sit there and wait for half of the time. Skipping across the recording was practically impossible, as the recordings were not visually divided by the worksheet sections, and the media player for the recordings had a small playback bar and no 10 or 15 second skip buttons. Additionally, I am a more visual person, and it was difficult for me to sit in one place and listen carefully to these recordings of such low quality and amplification levels. None of the daily exercises were checked for completion, so that combined with the prior reasons made feeling motivated to complete the exercises very difficult. \r\nI think if I was given a physical copy of the exercises in one big bundle, and the recordings were amplified and made available on YouTube (or just any better playback tool), I would've had a much better experience.\r\nAdditionally, I wish students were given a better idea of what to prepare for for the biweekly Evaluations. It was difficult and unmotivating to navigate around the Modules in Canvas to find what material to study (because they were all located on separate days, the files section of Canvas was not used), and I think just having a review page or something more tangible for students would have been sooo much more helpful. It was already difficult to manage all of the material online, but if all of the files for a unit were kept in a single folder in the files section of Canvas, so that a student can look over all of the material at once, it would've made everything so much easier and motivating.\r\nWith all of that said, I did enjoy reading/watching the class material (Petit Nicholas, L'Etranger, and Jules et Jim).",
                "I learned a lot in this class, and my French improved significantly. I do think it's tough to have a language class over Zoom; it would have been very helpful to have a full course packet to print out instead of receiving worksheets and assignments sporadically. I definitely found it hard to keep track of everything given the organization of files on Canvas.",
                "I love this class! It seems like you can engage with it as much as you'd like, as there are plenty of supplemental practice assignments for you to do. But none of it is overwhelming, you just have to work hard and get good results. Madame Vysosias was definitely the biggest strength. She cares about every single one of the students, and she is so accommodating when it comes to mistakes or extensions. Office hours could have been more regular or there could have been a spreadsheet to set up appointments, because they are so so helpful for a student.",
                "The seminars were sort of hard to engage with fully as they were all online otherwise it was a great time. Some of the problems were really just the translation of zoom over to a language learning class."

                "It's very difficult to pull off an online language class if students are expected to be speaking the language and feeling motivated towards learning a language. I enjoyed the use of breakout rooms in Zoom, where students could interact which each other while speaking French. Additionally, I enjoyed working on my last Redaction with my partner outside of class over Zoom, and I definitely would've enjoyed more partner activities throughout the semester, as being alone with my partner and working with them allowed me to both appreciate their strengths of French and learn from them.",
                "I think we still maintained a good level of conversation and interaction; I appreciated that it still felt like a relatively well-balanced conversation. The organization of files on Canvas was a little hard to follow -- pages were often posted multiple times, and to find a worksheet you had to go to the page for the corresponding date, so if you didn't remember the exact day that you did a grammar exercise, you had to scroll through modules until you found the correct one. I would've really appreciated it if the full course packet, with all of the semester's worksheets and exercises, were uploaded at the beginning of the semester so that we could follow along that way; instead, I always felt like I was missing a worksheet or was going to miss something.",
