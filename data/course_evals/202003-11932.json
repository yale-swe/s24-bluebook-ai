                "Strengths: I liked the hybrid online\/in-person format. I also thought that given the pandemic conditions, Julian made a great effort to include every student and give everyone a semi-normal classroom experience. \r\nWeaknesses: This class goes over time anywhere from 10-40 minutes every single class, which is a disrespect of the students' time and honestly exhausting given how long we're staring at a screen. \r\nFurthermore, this is my fourth design class at this point where the assignments have been nearly identical to other design classes: poster, book, and then some sort of digital media like video or web. It's really repetitive from an academic standpoint and while it's true that the assignments are never exactly the same each time and that practice is helpful, it might be more productive to explore a wider range of assignments, maybe using wildly different media or encouraging us to make design objects rather than books.",
                "Strengths: Manageable workload, clear feedback. Weaknesses: Not a lot of opportunities for input from other students during critiques, classes often ran over time. Ways to improve: Make room for student comments, be more mindful of time."

I appreciated the effort Julian put into making it work for everyone. \r\n\r\nHowever, also don't think that people should have been expected to come in to class if they weren't comfortable (rather than being on a set schedule). Some more flexibility would have been appreciated.",

                "I would, but I would also want them to know this: this class and most other design classes are pretty much interchangeable. It makes no difference which one you take really and had I known about the assignments beforehand, I may not have opted for this class and instead just taken ART 469 in the spring. \r\nJulian is a good professor but not the most helpful instructor for me personally, and I don't feel like I gained much additional insight from the class besides working on the projects, whereas I would've liked some more guidance when it came to technical design skills or design history. \r\nAlso, I hope this is changed in future iterations fo the class, but the expectations of producing physical printed work during the pandemic was simply unreasonable. This was such a missed opportunity to teach us to adapt to an online-friendly world!",
