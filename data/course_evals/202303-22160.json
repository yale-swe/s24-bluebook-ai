                "I learned how to manage (and sometimes not manage) a very heavy courseload, and find a way to consistently have ways to participate in discussions. Professor Barasch is really good at pushing students to think critically.  This course is also good to improve your writing.",
                "Analyzing how different historians approach writing about history. These are not history classes oriented towards facts and the technicalities of politics, and that's not a bad thing! Just don't have those expectations.\r\nThat aside, you'll (ideally) learn how to skim effectively, write insightfully, and disagree civilly.",
                "I went into this course with limited to no experience reading texts from a political angle. This class allowed me to work on combining my skills in history to ones in the political sphere: allowing me to branch out into a new but exciting discipline.",
                "By taking DS Historical and Political Thought, I became a far stronger writer, annotator, critical thinker, and speaker. I gained a much better understanding of historical events in the Western canon, compromising Greek and Latin culture. Taking DS was a big event for me, stepping out of my comfort zone. Although DS advertised itself as a program that was welcoming to students with no experience in the humanities, as I was, I was still scared of the learning curve I had to surmount in the face of many students who were well-versed in these texts. I learned how to manage my time better and, with encouragement from Professor Barasch, approach each text with curiosity and a spirit to learn something new rather than a sense of just \"getting through it.\" I truly learned the importance of these texts and the significance of learning them. As a lover and writer of historical fiction, I feel that my worldview and perspective on the past have grown exponentially. I also learned how to think and extract political meanings from texts and treatises. We faced a variety of perspectives and opinions throughout the different writers we read, and learning to dissect their arguments and understand where they are coming from based on circumstance, environment, and upbringing is something I feel will benefit me as I prepare to major in Global Affairs or Ethics, Politics, and Economics. Overall, the new knowledge, skills, and insights I gained and developed during this course were invaluable.",
                "I learned a lot about the historical and political thought that have shaped our current realities. I also got a lot better at writing, specifically in terms of organization, clarity, and evidence-based analysis. New insights were too many to count. Every seminar was a chance to change my mind about something, to walk away with an understanding or opinion that I never thought I would hold.",
                "For me, this course was the most essential for growing as a seminar participant and deeper thinker. I appreciated Professor Baraschs moderation of the class, as it felt fun, natural, and incredibly informative. I would absolutely be interested in taking a class with him again, as he has helped me tremendously as a student.",
                "Historical and Political Thought really pushes you to grow your understanding of history. This course really concentrated on learning about how history changed and developed to encompass different things. H&P really forms a strong foundation for future study of related material/concepts.",
                "I developed the ability to approach a large text (or texts) in a short amount of time and generate an argumentative essay focusing on a particular aspect of it. I also learned to understand the ways in which people writing historical texts put forward political arguments implicitly and in a variety of ways other than (and in addition to) just telling you what they think, and to connect each text with others that we read. I learned to consider non-objective ways of writing and understanding history and the influence of myth and history itself in shaping events.",
                "While I did learn a lot about the texts themselves, the main takeaways from DS are the close reading and discussion skills I nurtured in reading, attending seminars, and writing papers.",
                "I'm not sure I developed any substantial skills, but this course provides a great foundation for thinking about peoples and politics. It doesn't ultimately have much to do with history."

            "comments": [
                "I think the discussions were always very fun and organic. At no point did the questions feel forced, and the students' engagement with the content made it so that even more casual discussions were very insightful. Professor Barasch is very very knowledgeable and is overall a great person to have intellectual conversations with. During this section, there was a rule that laptops and electronics were not allowed, and it was a great way to engage more deeply with the texts. One weakness of the course was that we got our papers back quite late as compared to other sections.",
                "Strengths: Always community. Basically everybody is excited to be here and exchange ideas. That's what DS does strongest.\r\nWeaknesses: It's definitely a lot to get through, and it will always feel like you're not going as deep as you want to. But it depends on if you're willing to sacrifice that for the experience of traversing the span of the Western canon.",
                "The amount of reading was kind of high sometimes, and I felt like more time on some of the authors would have been very helpful.",
                "The strengths of DS Historical and Political Thought lay in the syllabus of works, the discussion-based format, the intimate classroom sizes, the professors, the guest lectures, and the essays. \r\n\r\nThe syllabus of works is far-reaching, expansive, thoughtful, masterfully curated, significant, and enjoyable. Each reading built off the last in some way, and my class was always making connections between books we had read prior. The discussion-based format, in my opinion, was the best way for the class to function. The professor started by asking an open-ended question, usually on the context of the writing or author, and our answers would guide the discussion. Our classroom sizes were about fifteen students each. This was really great. Not only did I make some really amazing friends in my sections, but I also felt it gave everyone an equal chance to speak and share their opinions. The professors were amazing and nothing but helpful. This extends into our guest lectures. All were enthusiastic and filled with amazing information, allowing me to conceptualize our readings better. The essays were also a really great part of the course. Professor Barasch and my other DS professors would give us essay topics about two weeks before they were due, allowing us ample time to plan, outline, and write. The essay topics were expansive and thought-provoking, and we were also allowed to propose our own topics. \r\n\r\nOverall, I do not have any weaknesses on the part of the course that I consider. I think the classes would benefit from being longer. At the moment, they are one hour and fifteen minutes long. Sometimes, our discussions would be so interesting, but we would need more time to go deeper or address a certain topic. This is just a nitpick, however. I have no cons about the course.",
                "Strengths: DS H&P offers a very in-depth, rigorous examination of the political canon.\r\n\r\nI wish that parts of the class engaged more explicitly with our current reality. Such engagements would not be hard given the nature of much of the reading material.",
                "I enjoyed every class, and professor Barasch was always excited and ready to have fun leading seminar with us. He was very engaging.",
                "Strengths: Professor Barasch did well in really encouraging the class to think beyond the texts. He was also always available for office hours, and showed that he was there to support us if we needed it. His knowledge on the subject really showed during seminar, and I think it definitely helped encourage very active participation from our section.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think that it was often difficult to choose what topic to discuss in class. With H+P, the readings are so expansive that you miss out on certain discussions. I think that the class discussions would have benefited from being more passage-based.",
                "I think the amount of material in this course was slightly more overwhelming than the other DS tracks. While all of it was worthwhile, it was very difficult to complete all of each assigned reading on time, and it was completely overwhelming when it came time to study for the exam (though that was only a small part of my experience in the course). But a strength of this course was how closely knit each work felt with the others in terms of themes. That helped me really develop a picture of different approaches to the central questions of history and politics, like \"what is justice?\" and \"what is the source of political authority?\"\r\n\r\nOne problem with the readings was also that some of them (especially Tacitus) felt unfortunately fragmented and very difficult to get an overall grasp of; and it was impossible to get a detailed understanding of them in the time we had. This is obviously in part a consequence of reducing the amount of reading, but I think it could be remedied-- for example, in Thucydides, I felt like I understood which episodes were most important and what key ideas they introduced and explored: the Melian Dialogue, the Mytilenian Debate, Pericles' Funeral Oration, the Civil War at Corcyra, and a basic understanding of the plague in Athens and the controversial Sicilian Expedition. Thucydides clearly picked up on the themes of earlier works (like Herodotus) and was easier to understand and retain because of that. But with Tacitus in particular, it was difficult to pick out who the major players were, what we were supposed to make of them, or what the important episodes or their meanings were. Given that his work is so major, more attention should be given to making it (and potentially the other fragmented works) understandable in terms of what we need to pay attention to (as in Livy, the Rape of Lucretia and the Rape of the Sabine women were clearly key and the lecture connected the dots of these and other important episodes to establish a central theme that united all of them). City of God also felt fragmented and difficult to grasp in a similar way to Tacitus.\r\n\r\nA strength of this course was the lectures-- I felt every one of them really improved and changed my understanding of the material and encouraged me to engage with it in new and interesting ways. \r\n\r\nAnother potential weakness is the difficulty for students not raised in a Western context (or even some who are) because of a lack of background knowledge about the civilizations we discuss. It might be helpful to have one or two DS-wide sessions to give an understanding of the timeline and background of Ancient Greece and Rome, for example. This might help in understanding some of the more difficult works.",
                "Strengths: Professor Barasch is a fantastic instructor. His seminar was much less structured than the other two DS seminars I had, which was a strength in that it made us very active in the discussions and allowed us to have a different seminar experience, especially from philosophy. DS in general will greatly benefit close reading and discussion skills.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The DS H&P faculty assign too much reading that we dont end up getting to in the seminars, and some of the readings feel like theyre there just because they are famous (especially battle scenes, which look cool but dont end up being as insightful as some other sections).",
                "The course starts out with a very strong sequence of thinkers, whose work very obviously interacts with preceding authors. That sense of continuity gradually devolves, especially as one reaches the historians writing about Rome. I think the course became significantly less interesting at this point, since there's not really enough time to explore any of the authors in depth, and the connections between authors were not obvious, at least to me."

                "Yes, I recommend DS Historical and Political Thought and Directed Studies in general to another student. The attitude on campus toward DS is that it is a massive undertaking that many do not enjoy. However, I disagree entirely. Through DS, I've met the most interesting professors and the most amazing students and learned so many amazing things. These are books and stories that most people intend to read during their lives but never get the chance or never find the time. The fact that I was able to experience all of these great works at eighteen years old and do it in an intellectually stimulating and supportive environment was amazing. It is a lot of work and a lot of reading. You'll have to think outside the box sometimes, and your essays may not always hit the mark you were wishing for, but overall, DS is a growing and learning experience. DS taught me so much about myself and others, about how I work and how I handle challenges. The self-reflection I gained from doing DS was amazing. I would most definitely recommend Historical and Political Thought, as well as DS, to another student. It's been an experience of a lifetime.",

                "Yes. The texts may seem at first to be rather dull or monotonous compared to the literature track, but I came to change my mind entirely to love many of the texts through the discussions we had in Professor Barasch's seminar.",
                "I would recommend this course -- as well as the other fall DS courses -- to anyone interested in gaining a general understanding of ancient thinkers. You won't come away as an expert in anything, but you will be armed with new ways of thinking about fundamental problems of community and governance."
