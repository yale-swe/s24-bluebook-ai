                "This course was a thorough introduction to phonetics. I learned how to describe, produce, and interpret the sounds of the world's languages, and I learned  the basics of speech production and acoustics. I learned how to use software to manipulate spectrograms and waveforms to better understand sounds. I also learned a lot about experimental methods in linguistics.",
                "I learned a lot about speech and speech production. I learned how intonation, tone, pitch, etc. works and even learned how to use the software praat. I learned the IPA and the anatomy of different parts of the body that are included in speech and speech perception.",

Knowledge of how to understand and talk about various domains of phonetics, including acoustic phonetics, production mechanisms of consonants and vowels, other topics like sociophonetics, sound change, continuous speech, etc."

The lectures and discussions are highly engaging, and the course is well-designed to foster understanding of the material. I can't think of any weaknesses. Please keep doing what you're doing!",

Interesting material covered, lots of examples. I really liked how the homework contributed to the final project in the second half of the semester.",

                "Yes! This was my first class in the linguistics department at Yale and it was everything I hoped for and more. Jason Shaw is a great lecturer and the readings are not too long and easy to comprehend. The final project, a phonetic analysis of a foreign language with the help of a natively-speaking informant, was a great way to solidify and explore the topics we learned in the course. Listening and production quizzes get quite a bit harder once the class has covered sounds not in the English language, but it is so rewarding to be able to recognizes sounds from other languages around the world. If you think that studying the sounds of foreign languages would be interesting to you, you will love this class. In the undergrad version of this class you'll have section once a week and Prof. Shaw has some cool interactive demos.",
                "I would absolutely recommend the course to other students. If you are interested in linguistics at all, this course could be a great introduction, even if you've never taken a linguistics course before. If you are a more experienced linguistics student, you will get a lot out of learning about experimental methods and the acoustics of sounds! I especially recommend the course if you're a phonology student; the courses would go really well together.",
                "Yes! I really liked the class because the teacher was very approachable and the material was hard to understand at times but we learned a lot throughout the class. If you put in the work, you'll get a lot out of this class.",
                "Yes! There were a lot of non-linguistics majors in the class and it seemed to be accessible, although I can't speak for them. As a Linguistics major, I highly recommend this class for everyone on the Phonetics/Phonology side or if this stuff inspires you. It meets all expectations for a solid foundation in phonetics and is definitely a core class. Super solid course with no tricks, Jason is a great professor."
