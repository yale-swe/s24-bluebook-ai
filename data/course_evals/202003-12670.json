The material is the most interesting and definitely the best class in the entire Intro BIO sequence\r\nWeaknesses: There were writing assignments instead of PSETs for the last 4 weeks of the class. It would have been helpful to have some sort of PSET instead of the writing assignment so we could keep up with the classwork and the material on a weekly basis.",

                "I really enjoyed the pre-recorded lecture videos as I think they facilitated more diligence in focusing on the lectures since you could watch them when it was convenient for you. The course also allows students to be introduced to EEB.",
                "The strength of this course was Professor Edwards and all the TAs. Professor Edwards has been the most involved professor that I have encountered throughout the modules. It was very refreshing to have a professor who truly cared that you learned the material in the best way possible, without throwing unnecessarily large amounts of facts and figures. All the information presented was directly correlated with the course content.",
                "Overall engaging class",
                "It was MUCH better than a typical bio sequence because I was able to actually slow down and learn the material at my own rate rather than being lectured at as quickly as possible",
                "The class honestly made me want to major in biology so don't have that many suggestions on improvements.",
                "It wasn't clear how much we needed to know for the final. \r\nThe lectures were really engaging and well done.",
                "Strengths: strong lectures \r\nWeaknesses: Very few examples of ecological topics in lectures and less reliance on textbook",
                "Strengths- This was the BEST format for virtual learning. Dr. Edwards video style was PERFECT, I was able to soak up the material very well. \r\n\r\nWeakness- The exams were unnecessarily long. I wish quizzes were used instead, or the exams were shorted in length.",
                "Professor Edwards made very engaging lectures and did a great job teaching the course.",
                "AMAZING PROFESSOR!!!!!!!!!!! The best STEM class and lectures I have seen at Yale. Professor Edwards is AMAZING! Even with recorded lectures, she is just so thoughtful and hardworking and caring, I actually enjoyed watching them.",
                "While the course felt very rushed and that we were jumping from one topic to the next, that was the only way we could've covered as much information as we did. I felt that the writing assignment was a very nice change of pace as it allowed everyone to choose to study information that they found interesting. By giving students the opportunity to apply the concepts we learned in class to study their chosen examples, I believe my peers and I were far more engaged with the course material.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Edwards' videos were really straight forward and easy to watch and follow along. She's an amazing lecturer and a kind soul. The material isn't terribly difficult other than memorizing the phylogenies and it builds pretty well.  \r\nWeaknesses: i wasn't a fan of some of the discussion section papers but that wasn't a big deal at all.",
                "Strengths - very useful discussion sections and clear feedback on papers, very enthusiastic and caring professor. Weaknesses - for the second half of the course all the work is a paper mostly unrelated to the content so it is difficult to know if you understand the material before the exam. Also during the recorded video the professor using a doc cam which can make taking notes more difficult as it cuts away from the notes to her speaking frequently.",
                "Strengths: engaging content, friendly and helpful professors\r\nWeaknesses: --",
                "great course! I found the lecture format super engaging, and the writing assignment was an interesting way to make us do some of our own research and learn something new",
                "This class was great. no improvements needed!",
                "Having little experience in learning about EEB, I really enjoyed the course and thought it was very well-organized and that the modes of assessments were very fair.",
                "The tree of life section is a lot of information being thrown at you and is not covered again until the review session before the final. Other than that, the course provides a very thorough understanding of evolution and ecology by utilizing many real-life examples to illustrate a concept.",
                "The strengths are definitely prof edwards, prof hartman, and the TAs!! Absolutely phenomenal. Weakness was the really confusing and unneeded writing assignment",
                "Strengths: Professor Edwards is highly engaging. I really liked her enthusiasm and passion about the natural world. \r\nWeakness:  I wish we had study guides that we could refer to. I just found it hard to keep track of the things that we need to know for the midterm\/final.",
                "Some of the strengths of this course was the amazing and incredibly kind teaching staff (Prof. Edwards and all of the TFs were extraordinarily supportive and nice) and the assignments! Even though I dont really like ecology\/evolutionary bio that much, I genuinely had fun with my writing assignment and think I left the course liking the topic more.\r\nCant think of any weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: I thought the class was taught in an order that really solidified concepts. The TFs were really helpful and the papers we read helped reinforce the concepts we learning. Most importantly, I really like the lecture style. Not having slides and having to listen and take down notes was great. But, I think that works because you can replay the lectures. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I think ensuring all the explanations for each topic was difficult because of the online format. So, the professor would have to instruct people on new information during the review sessions and if you didn't go you would miss out on this information. And in regards to the review, I sometimes came out more confused than before \r\n\r\nImprovement: Just prepare more for lecturing.",
                "The class was very well facilitated for online learning and the prerecorded lectures was a very efficient way to learn",
                "fantastic lecturing style!",
                "Strengths: strong teaching team, interesting content",
                "Recorded lecture format was perfect, few writing assignments, informative discussion sections, exams carefully restricted to concepts that have already been discussed. However, the writing assignments are difficult without seeking guidance.",
                "Some of the lectures were a bit too long and that made it really intimidating to get through some weeks of lecture. I really wish that the instructors stayed to the time limit of the lectures.",
                "The content was very interesting, and the chalk-talk style lectures were more effective than I expected at clearly communicating exactly what information we were expected to know. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I thought that format did make the material feel more abstract at times, because there were fewer of the small, short examples that slideshows tend to be full of; at the same time, there were a lot of great examples, but because we tended to focus in detail on a few examples it was sometimes hard to distinguish the overarching principle from the specific example.\r\n\r\nAnother strength of the course was that the exams felt very fair and satisfying to take. I didn't enjoy the writing assignment homework as much (though that might just be my personal taste), and probably would have preferred traditional psets to reinforce the material.\r\n\r\nLastly, I thought that the last section of the class, while full of interesting topics, seemed to jump around a bit without a unifying theme. This wasn't a big problem, but did feel a little odd.",
                "The professor is really caring and amazing",
                "Assignments, Professor, and TAs were all very good but the lectures could sometimes be a little drawn out and get boring",
                "Strengths - straightforward in terms of content material and what was expected to know on exams, strong student support system\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes lectures felt a bit hard to follow; not as much study guides or supplementary materials as I would have liked",
                "This course was well-taught and a good dive into a topic that I had not previously known much about. I think that this course could have benefitted from more low-stakes assessments throughout the semester.",
                "Professor Edwards really put a lot of time into these recorded lectures and I appreciate it. It felt like I was watching a professional documentary and I really appreciate her use of the document camera.",
                "Professor Edward created lectures that were easy to follow and incredibly engaging, and the discussion sections were helpful for understanding the research papers and information further.",
                "Strengths- The professor. Prof Edwards was amazing. She made the lectures really engaging and easy to follow. They were probably the best online lectures I've had yet. Also the TAs were really sweet and good at leading the conversations in discussion section. \r\nWeaknesses- I felt like the exams were a little difficult since they were closed note and we had to memorize a lot of information since the course is mainly facts not concepts. I still thought they were fair assessments of our knowledge it was just a little stressful to study for especially since I had other exams so couldn't dedicate all my time to memorize 12 lectures.",
                "I liked that the lectures were recorded (with super high quality!) and I really loved Professor Edwards style of teaching. I ended up getting very behind on the lectures since there wasn't really anything forcing us to watch them on a weekly basis, maybe if there was a short quiz each week that would help with the pacing and staying on track?",
                "This course adapted well to the online format.",
                "I really liked this course overall, and I personally found it to be the strongest module of the bio sequence. I really liked Professor Edward's chalk talks, since they were a lot more engaging than lecturing with PPT slides as she would often insert demonstrations or actually present physical examples of certain plants she mentioned. In general, Professor Edwards is wonderful since she's a clear lecturer and she brings a lot of nuance to the course content. Plus, you can feel very clearly how passionate she is about her research. I also found the 2 problem sets to correlate well with the material on the first midterm. The writing assignment was a good chance for students to learn to read and analyze scientific literature, and I enjoyed that we had a lot of freedom in choosing which topic we'd write about. I also thought all the exams were very fair since the lecture content prepared students well. Overall, I also found the content of the course pretty engaging since ecology and evolutionary biology is one area that I personally did not have a lot of background in, and it also takes a very macro perspective unlike BIOL 101-103, so it was a nice change of pace. Finally, I think the papers we read for BIOL 104 were much more interesting than those for any of the other bio sequence modules. I really could not find any weaknesses with this class since everything was made clear from the start, and I thought the teaching team did a wonderful job this semester!",
                "The teaching staff was eager to provide help when needed and the tests were mostly fair in my opinion. However, I would have preferred slides being made for lectures as sometimes they were long and hard to follow.",
                "I didnt like the way the material was taught and would have preferred bio slides instead.",
                "The course material was interesting and engaging and taught clearly",
                "Strengths - plenty of opportunities to ask questions, phenomenal peer tutors \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I had a few frustrations with this course. The first is that the professor used a \"chalk-talk\" style rather than slides, and although I get that the \"chalk-talk\" style might in theory force students to pay more attention during lecture, I think just seeing pictures of animals or structures with often zero text was very detrimental to learning even for someone who is very engaged during lecture. Watching lectures was SUCH a slow process because I had to write SO much down because zero info was on the screen-shots we were given of the lectures as \"slides\", and it forced me to constantly pause and restart. The lack of test on slides also made it really hard to figure out what terms were key terms to know and be able to explain during the definitions sections of exams; key terms are usually noted on a slide or in the study guides that are provided for all other bio modules, and this course had both no slides and no study guides. Another really key frustration was the ways in which exams were approached. I am sure that this is not an issue without COVID, but we were given a really long period (36+ hours) in which to do the 2 hr midterm and final, and the instructors shut down all communication (Piazza, meetings with TAs\/peer tutors, etc.) during that period. This meant that by almost two full days before the exam was due, we couldn't ask any questions at all. I understand that time zone flexibility is important, but I think 24 hours would have been much more reasonable, as it is often just not possible to complete one's studying and clarify questions so far in advance of the exam's due date when students have so many other classes and commitments. This exam structure was particularly upsetting for the midterm because the instructors did NOT make students aware of this policy until the night before all communication was ceased. The instructors also did NOT make clear until 12 hours before the midterm opened on Canvas that it was closed note (I spoke with many other students about this issue and all were under the impression that the midterm was open note). The lack of communication was very frustrating.",
                "You learn a lot about the different branches evolution and biology that you havent learned unlike in bio101-103 which is present in high school.\r\nOnly weakness was it was hard to know what had to be studied for the test since there was so much to be learned and wasnt clear what was on the test until practice test was released.",
                "This course was very well-organized and the lectures were phenomenal. It was a beautiful experience.",
                "This course was really fun, even while virtual, and I thought Professor Edwards was a really fun lecturer. However, the course wasn't very engaging, and at times I even forgot that I was enrolled in this course.",
                "Strengths: Great professors and TFs who cared about their students' learning. Professor Edward's lecture format was excellent. \r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked more opportunities to personally interact with the professors.",
                "The lectures seemed to be lengthy at times and although they were entertaining and educative, I felt that they could be truncated a bit. Additionally, not having slides to take notes on made watching the lectures more difficult, but the screenshot pdfs given really helped with this. The course was well organized and allowed students of all levels to become engaged relatively easily.",
                "The class was great in that the lectures and the material covered were very interesting and engaging. A weakness of this class is that sometimes the amount of material covered between each week could be not very well distributed, so some weeks there would be an overwhelming amount of material to learn and others would have much shorter lectures covering fewer topics.",
                "I liked the in-depth examples used to illustrate the wide range of subjects we covered in the course, and I liked the format of the lectures and the way the professor explained concepts. That said, having the screencaps\/slides helps me a lot when taking notes, so I was glad that the teaching team provided those as well. I also liked the paper we wrote, I thought that was a really cool way to explore evolution related to something we were interested in. I think having a clearer theme or more connection between the papers we read in discussion section and the class material might have been helpful, although I appreciated the intentional diversity of the paper authors and getting to learn a bit about their backgrounds.",
                "I really enjoyed the course, and it was clear that the teaching staff was invested in making the course as interactive and enjoyeable as possible, considering the virtual format of this semester. One recommendation I would make is that next semester, the professor include slides or make her notes shareable with the class, since the free-lecture was a bit difficult to navigate.",
                "Professor Edwards was one of the best professors I've had at Yale so far. This course is super enjoyable because it's not unnecessarily stressful like some other STEM classes. Even as an online course I loved it.",
                "Strength: The teaching team cares a lot about the students and offers many different ways for students to receive extra help. Although learning was virtual, the professor went out of her way to demonstrate concepts (like using marbles, live plants, virtual greenhouse tours, etc.)",
                "The course content was interesting, but it was at times unclear how much information we were expected to memorize.",
                "The teaching team is absolutely amazing and so excited to help us learn, which I so appreciate! It's the best feeling to know that your instructors are doing everything they can to help you succeed, especially during a pandemic.",
                "this course is very well taught due to Professor Edwards' great teaching style! I really like her mode of explaining rather than the traditional powerpoint",
                "The strength was the recorded lectures, weakness was the emphasis on animal clade research which was a bit bothersome.",
                "Strengths: Prof Edward's style of lecturing was really engaging, much better than reading off of slides! \r\nWeaknesses: Not a lot of detail provided as to what info we were responsible for. Some study guides or key concepts would have been very helpful."

                "I don't particularly enjoy pre-recorded lectures, but I loved the Ted-talk format of Prof. Edwards' lectures! I thought it was going to make them harder to follow, but in reality it was better to see her face and virtually connect.",
                "The asynchronous lectures were super helpful in allowing students flexibility which I really appreciated. And, the day period to take exams was perfect for allowing students the ability to take their exam when worked best. I am so grateful that this course sought to accommodate its students! The only thing that could be improved is that the assignments all state \"No late assignments will be accepted.\" I think that this really disincentivized students from asking for an extension, even if they really needed it to do their best work and take care of themselves. I hope that in the future the language won't be so discouraging for students to take care of themselves during such a difficult time.",
                "The professor was very accomodating and helpful. She cared about us and wanted us to succeed. The prerecorded lectures were especially helpful because it gave me flexibility",
                "Recorded lectures are always a plus in my book. My home schedule, as a remote sophomore, is nothing like my school schedule and I have many outside responsibilities. Being able to watch lectures at my own pace and on my own time, as well as being able to pause to take notes and stuff, are among the great advantages of virtual learning and make its downfalls much more tolerable than live virtual lectures.",
                "The exams should have either been proctored and closed-book or open-book",
                "So much succeeded. Instead of just lecturing to us monotonously or simply showing slides, Professor Edwards created engaging videos that were so interesting and easy to watch. it felt better than a real classroom. She did amazing to help us through COVID",
                "All facets of virtual engagement were done quite well.",

                "I do not believe that a closed-note exam, especially with no proctoring, is appropriate for the circumstances. It inevitably, directly benefits students who cheat and therefore harms students who are honorable and choose to follow the rules. Of course we would hope that all students would do this but its inevitable that some will. As a student who followed the closed-note policy, it's hard not to feel that several students who scored higher than I did may have used notes during the test.",
                "Professor Edwards recorded her lectures as a type of \"sit down chat\" as opposed to flipping through dozens of slides on a powerpoint. I found this method of teaching very effective. This simulated an in-person session very well as she would write notes on a sheet of paper while explaining important concepts. I would not change anything about the way she recorded her lectures. I think it would have been helpful for the weekly q&a sessions to be a bit more targetted, perhaps as a quick review of the difficult concepts learned that week and then open it up to student questions at the end.",

                "While the live Q and A sessions were a great way to discuss the course content, it was at a rather inconvenient time as many of us were still working through the recorded lectures at this time. The lecture recordings were of the highest quality and discussion session ran well through the online format.",

                "I liked the prerecorded lectures! Normally I prefer live lectures that are posted afterwards but Professor Edwards really made them work and I learned A LOT from them. Section was a journal club and Lourdes (my TA) was really good about going through the powerpoint to explain the paper and answering all our questions.",

                "I think the switch to recorded lectures was helpful, but oftentimes the lectures ended up becoming longer and longer, leading a majority of the class to be behind on lectures for each week.",
                "The live virtual Q&A sessions were really helpful since it made up for the lack of interaction in the recorded lectures. Sometimes Professor Edwards would provide more concrete or specific examples than were provided in her lectures, and these live sessions were also recorded for students who could not attend. I also thought Professor Edwards' chalk talk format of lectures helped simulate an actual class environment, which I found a lot more engaging than just talking through PPT slides. Also, the BIOL 104 usually take a field trip to the Peabody Museum or the Marsh Gardens, and despite being online this semester, I really liked that the teaching team still put together virtual tours of both these places, since it simulated the sense of being on campus.",

The lack of communication for the midterm was very frustrating, although communication thankfully improved for the final. I also was really struck by the lack of an honor code for exams. In every other course I've taken with online, closed-note exams both last semester and this semester, we were asked to complete an honor code as a part of the exam. In this course, instructors said multiple times that they had no way of catching unethical behavior on exams, and there was no honor code whatsoever. I do not believe the instructors at all encouraged ethical behavior, which is very upsetting.",

                "The recorded lectures worked well with the expected due dates to allow both a flexible yet consistent coursework. It really helped being able to watch lectures whenever possible but still be heavily guided along the way.",
                "The course format to accommodate individuals across all timezones was good as people who benefited from attending live sessions could attend the Q&A, whereas others that do well following their own pace could also feel free to do so.",
                "Personally I didn't end up going to the virtual q & a sessions or using piazza very much, so my main engagement was with the virtual lectures. I thought they were very engaging, which was nice, and I liked the other videos we watched as part of the lectures a lot as well - the youtube clips as well as the peabody museum and marsh botanical gardens tours.",
                "I think the teaching staff did phenomenal in teaching during this format of online learning; I really enjoyed how the professors made sure they could include numerous opportunities for students to ask questions regarding the format of the lecture and otherwise.",
                "The live Q&A sessions were great and so were the lectures. This is the first time that I've been so engaged during lecture.",
                "I thought that the teaching team was very accommodating and generous. There was a large window of time to take exams, which was helpful since students were in vastly different time zones. Additionally, the deadline for PSETS was pushed back to help accommodate those on the west coast. All lectures and q&a sessions were recorded.",
                "The recorded lectures were really helpful. More review sessions would have been helpful.",
                "I can't say enough about the resources that were given to us in this class. I felt supported and up to my ears in resources that I could choose from. I thoroughly appreciated their flexibility (recorded lectures, visiting discussions, enrichment sections, available TAs and instructors).",
                "The recorded lectures (as well as the Peabody and Marsh Garden video tours) were amazing and I really appreciate the efforts to produce these videos.",
                "The recorded lectures were nice.",
                "I liked having recorded lectures that I could watch at my own pace."

                "Yes, I would.",
                "I would definitely recommend for those interested in E&EB. I think it provides a really helpful survey of topics and can allow us to better determine our interests!",
                "It is certainly interesting to take, whether for pre-med or major requirements or just because you are interested in the field.",
                "Yes, definitely with Prof Edwards if you have to take this class. She's super enthuastic about the material and helps explain it very well. If you're a bio major (EEB, MCDB, MBB) you have to take this class but if you're not and you're interested about these topics, I would still recommend this class.",
                "Yes, it's pretty interesting and made me think about some aspects of biology in a new way",
                "Definitely. Obviously you will have to take it if you're MCDB or Pre-Med, but definitely was taught so well by Professor Edwards. It is the most interesting and engaging of the Biology sequences - great way to end intro bio at Yale.",
                "Yes! Prof Edwards is a very enthusiastic and informative professor.",
                "yes if you are interested in ecology and evolutionary biology or if its required. The information is interesting and the professors and TAs do a wonderful job.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. The end of the course had very nice applications to medicine, while the beginning of the course presented a very interesting way to approach the tree of life and how organisms are related to one another.",
                "If they are interested in evolutionary biology",
                "Yes, it was really interesting and my favorite part of the bio sequence",
                "Yes, the course material is extremely interesting and taught well.",
                "Yes, if you need it for the Bio sequence, it's something to look forward to. If you're interested in ecology, it's also a fun course.",
                "Yes, very good biology course",
                "YES! One the best taught  bio sequence courses. The exams were not necessarily difficult, but were way too long and took too much time to complete and grade. The exams are the only things that I would change about the course.",
                "Take it with Professor Edwards, if each you can. She was a very good professor.",
                "YES! AMAZING PROFESSOR!!!!! Such a good teacher, one of the best I've ever had. Thank you Professor Edwards!",
                "Since this is the last step in the bio sequence, anyone who stuck with it this long is likely to wind up taking this class anyway but I would recommend this class regardless. The faculty surrounding this course were all extremely cooperative and supportive and the course content is fast paced but very interesting. Even though it may seem a bit pointless if you're premed, Dr. Edwards went out of her way to make the connections clear especially towards the end of the course. It is a great way to wrap up all of the other concepts learned in the bio sequence by viewing biological concepts through the broadest lens in the sequence.",
                "Yes! Really enjoyed this course with Prof. Edwards. It is clear that she cares about the subject and just want everyone to know more about the world around them.",
                "Yes as a requirement.",
                "Yes, this class has opened my eyes to the world around me and made me more curious about life; was a great factor in my interest in majoring in EEB!",
                "Yes, definitely!",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes, this professor is not one to be missed if you like the topic.",
                "yes. learn a lot and manageable",
                "Yes, if someone wants a brief introduction to the field of EEB.",
                "You probably have to take it, so yes. I am an MB&B major and I have found this course very interesting!",
                "I would recommend it if you want an introduction to ecology or evolutionary biology (though I think most people who took it did it to complete the Bio sequence).",
                "Yes. This was great introduction to ecology and evolution. All the topics were really interesting.",
                "This class and professor Edwards were great and I would definitely recommend them to anyone wanting to learn more about evolutionary biology",
                "yes",
                "its a prereq but its a good ending to the BIOL sequence",
                "I'm sure this is much better taught than other classes that teach BIO 104. I would recommend it only to those that need the prerequisite, though.",
                "It definitely was an ok pre-med course. better than the other modules of the bio sequence.",
                "It's probably required for you anyway, but I'd recommend the class, especially with Professor Edwards, who is clearly passionate about the material and teaching it. I think the history of life unit is especially valuable, and some of the evolutionary trends were really fascinating. The class is pretty painless, too (though I found the relatively open-ended writing assignment a bit hard to initially get into).",
                "Yes, if you are interested in majoring in MCDB or EEB, or if you are simply interested in basic evolutionary and ecological principles",
                "Yes, it is a good overview of Evolution and most people have to take it anyways.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless it was a pre-req for a major\/track. This is because I believe there are other courses that do a better job of diving into more specific areas of evolutionary biology that an intro course such as BIOL 104 wouldn't be able to accomplish.",
                "Yes, if you are premed or curious about evolutionary\/ecology bio",
                "Yes! Biol 103 and 104 have been my favorite modules from the bio sequence so far.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if Professor Edwards is teaching. I truly enjoyed learning about EEB and found myself engaging in the topics of the course outside of class as well.",
                "Yes! 103\/104 is definitely the better half of the bio sequence. They're not ridiculously challenging like 101\/102. If you sit down and put in a bit of time you'll do fine. I also found the material and professors way more engaging and interesting.",
                "I would as my second favorite class of the bio sequence (but I am more excited to take upper level bio courses than I was to take this course).",
                "Yes! Even though it was an introductory course, I found it interesting and engaging",
                "Yes! It gave me a great appreciation for a field that isnt always recognized by premeds.",
                "This is a great biology course!",
                "I would definitely recommend BIOL 104, and I think personally my favorite module of the bio sequence. Professor Edwards is a very clear lecturer, and the demonstrations or stories she chooses to add into her lectures make the class very engaging. She's also a very approachable and funny person in addition to being a great instructor. All the assignments and the exams are very straightforward and manageable. I personally found the content to be very interesting, yet relatively easy to understand. I also really liked the choice of papers for discussion section, since the entire field of ecology and evolutionary biology is so different from any of the other biology fields, so you're introduced to an entirely new set of techniques.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as it is a fundamental subject for the field of biology. The teaching staff is also very kind and informing.",
                "Not unless you really like ecology and evolutionary biology.",
                "no",
                "Yes, I will certainly recommend this course to another student. It taught very important lessons and the professor and the teaching team was great.",
                "Only if they are either on the premed track or are majoring in biology.",
                "Yes! Professor Edwards is great, and I learned a lot. I became much more interested in ecology and evolutionary bio.",
                "Yes. This class was very fun, and I learned so much about ecology and the evolution of life. The professors and TFs were excellent. They really sold the EEB major!",
                "Yes, it's a great introduction to evolutionary biology.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it covers a lot of material that shapes the way you think about biology and medicine. This is especially useful for premeds, and the evolution & medicine lecture was really great for me to think deeply about how topics of EEB are deeply integrated with medicine and taking an EEB approach to solving medical challenges might elucidate better solutions.",
                "Yes, I think this course covers some of the most interesting concepts in the intro bio sequence and Professor Edwards did a really good job highlighting the fascinating, beautiful, and important things about ecology and evolutionary biology.",
                "Yes! This is a class on a subject that is so unique, and so interesting to learn about. It also does a great job in introducing the world of ecology and evolutionary biology.",
                "100% yes. Professor Edwards was one of the best professors I've had at yale so far. Even as an online course, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The lectures are some of the most engaging lectures I've ever seen.",
                "Yes, definitely! The teaching team is amazing and I learned numerous really cool concepts.",
                "Yes, it was the most enjoyable course in the intro biol sequence.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. It's a very interesting course and Prof. Edwards and Prof. Hartman are very kind and knowledgeable.",
                "Definitely! I never thought of myself as someone really interested in ecology but a lot of things in this course piqued my interest",
                "I would recommend it. It is interesting to learn about species on Earth and the relative mundane diversity of mammals compared to other groups of life.",
