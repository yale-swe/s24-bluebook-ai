I greatly improved my writing, especially for longer pieces of work, and widened my vocabulary. I also learned all the grammatical concepts I may have missed earlier in my French career, and learned to more consistently apply them in my written and spoken work. Finally, I improved my confidence speaking with my peers and professor during class discussions."

                "I appreciated how this course was structured and organized. It was a rigorous workload, but it was always clear what needed to get done and when. I think that the selected materials were engaging and challenging. I like how the course focused heavily on participation and speaking in French, but I wish that there was less of an emphasis on grammar (it seemed a little repetitive and tedious).",
                "Strengths: everyones French improved over the duration of the course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "It has more workload than a 1-credit course.",
                "The readings were excellent and portrayed well the variety of classic French culture. We couldve arranged more activities outside the classroom, such as field trips to the museum or optional movie soires. French politics couldve been discussed more.",
                "I think if the assigned reading decreased by 10%, the quality of reading done by the students, and thus the quality of the conversation in class would massively increase.",
                "Strengths: engagingly taught and the professor is considerate about students' challenges.\r\nWeaknesses: You basically have to do French every single day, whether or not you feel up for it. This makes for really good practice but a more intense workload.",
                "This course covered a variety of texts that were all very unique, but all contributed to my knowledge of French literature in different ways. Therefore, I appreciated this variety in texts, as it kept me engaged throughout the semester. This course also ensured to cover the parts of French grammar that may be overlooked at times, which certainly enriched my understanding. Finally, this course provided thought-provoking Oral and Writing Prompts, that made me really engage with the texts we studied in class in creative ways.\r\nMy only suggestion for this course is to include even more discussions and spoken work. Whereas we did a lot of reading and grammar rather consistently, especially at the start of the course it was difficult to engage in in-class discussions. Although this got better toward the end of the year, I would still have appreciated more of a focus on speaking throughout the entire semester more consistently."

                "Absolutely. I think the only issue with our section was that we did not have a good classroom dynamic among the students, so we were not motivated to speak in French outside of class. Im not sure what Franoise could have done to promote this, she was so kind and wanted us to speak amongst ourselves. My L4 class had an excellent dynamic, and it made learning French more fun. My advice for prospective students is to build a fun environment with your peers on the first day! Make a groupchat and try to find opportunities to speak with each other outside of class. It would also improve participation for the group (something my class struggled with).",
                "Yes, if you would like to continue working on your French skills.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone with a good baseline level of French looking to expand their vocabulary and fluency in oral expression.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in the French certificate/French major or want to really practice/improve upon their high school french.",
                "Definitely",
                "I would recommend this course to any student wishing to solidify their knowledge of the French language. It covers a variety of literary texts, provides a lot of useful vocabulary, and insists on the final bits of grammar that are needed to make your French just that last bit stronger. Therefore, this course seems like the perfect step for anyone wishing to study higher levels of French, as I will do in the coming years. Thanks to this course, I feel prepared to cover more specific topics, such as film, classic literature, etc. Hence, I would evaluate this course very highly and recommend it to any other student."
