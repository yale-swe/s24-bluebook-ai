While in the previous semester students learn the theory, in this term students will learn how to put theories into action with various practitioners and case studies. I learned how to write and deliver briefings as well as improved my debating skills in the high-paced seminars.",
                "Because of how GS is structured, I spent most of this semester in the social movement unit, which involved learning about how different social movements have succeeded in recent history. There was a lot of focus on the \"how\" of success--what strategies have different movements employed, why did those work for them, and how generalizable are they? Then, in the course of doing the policy brief and presentation, I became very well-acquainted with criminal justice policy and history in NYC. In terms of skills, I learned 1) how to make a historical argument in an op-ed writing style (through the longer paper), and 2) how to help write a policy brief and presentation, which are very different than standard academic writing and presenting.",
                "I learned about leadership, policymaking, advocacy, protest, and, of course, strategy in all of those areas. It was everything the course promised itself to be and more, even in the virtual format.",

What I would add for this semester is that the modules with the practitioners were truly wonderful.

            "comments": [
                "There were so many strengths it will be hard to name all of them. 1) the structure of the course - breaking off into different modules that focus on specific topics like policing, cybersecurity, and U.S.-China relations was a really effective way to learn, particularly during the virtual semester. although the readings in the first half of the program can be somewhat hit or miss, every single reading in fall semester\/second half of the program was fascinating. 2) the fact that we get to learn from practitioners who have real-world experience like Evan Wolfson, founder of the Freedom to Marry marriage equality campaign, Jake Sullivan who will be Biden's National Security Advisor, Ambassador Nuland who has decades of years in the Foreign Service AND they are so eager to teach us and challenge us so we will learn has been invaluable. 3) the guest speakers who came to our course were wonderful and engaging and insightful 4) the final strategy briefing was a lot of work to put together but one of the most rewarding things I have done at Yale. Honestly so much fun and I had a fantastic group. can definitively say that presenting our final strategy briefing was the bright spot of my fall semester.  5) the group of students chosen to be in this class are bright, motivated, and kind and I learned so much from all of them. they all had such thoughtful comments and perspectives on the readings. 6) of course Professor Gage and Professor Brenes. They were always available during office hours, challenged me and my group during our preparation for our strategy briefing, led discussions very well, and Professor Brenes in particular last semester and this semester (Prof. Gage was on leave last semester) was always super supportive with my assignments and during office hours and always gave me very thoughtful and in-depth comments always on my written work.",
                "Amazing practitioners -- unbeatable learning opportunity. The assignments were unclear and felt graded somewhat haphazardly.",
                "GS is excellent because it gives students a lot of exposure to really smart students, faculty, and practitioners from around the country. The spring semester of the class is also great because you read and discuss some of the best texts with faculty who are experts on each text. In this semester, I found the program to be a little weaker (and some of this may be due to the online circumstances) because I think the class material was spread a little thin. I think the course would do better to delineate the borders of what Grand Strategy is, because incorporating various other political theaters (social change and protest movements) seems to water down the quality of the class. Other than that, it's still a great seminar with a lot of resources and really exciting discussions.",
                "Strengths: The small group structure was great. It gave more space for discussion, the readings were great, and there were consistent central questions about strategy that drove our conversations. It was also great to have Professor Wolfson with us, who obviously has had a lot of real-life movement experience. I also appreciated the policy brief and presentation. Especially as someone interested in a policy career, I liked that we had the chance to practice that kind of writing and presenting, which are definitely different in style. I also liked the fact that it was group work; I've rarely had to work on a team in my classes while at Yale, and as a bonus it definitely made the workload not too bad. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The main thing that comes to mind is that when it came to the policy work, there was an unspoken air of, like: \"We're pretending to be government officials in this presentation so we have to take account of REAL constraints and we can't be too 'radical' or 'outlandish' with our requests, and that's good because that makes us more realistic and effective, and that's why we're closer to the source of power, e.g. the mayor of NYC or the president-elect\" That makes sense to an extent, but the problem is 1) I think it would have been good to have more discussion about why some political constraints exist, rather than accepting them as a concrete given, and 2) Some of us in the course might actually want a career on the activist side of things rather than in the government office, and arguably neither of those two options is superior to the other in any objective way (it's never said explicitly that one is, but that's the general ambiance I personally felt)",
                "Strengths: resources, access, professors, course content, the other students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: just the limitations of zoom, which prevented us from engaging in the way we might have otherwise been able to with speakers.",
                "In general the exposure to GS practitioners was incredible. One of the strengths of the course as it is taught this year is that by breaking the 18 person seminar into groups of 6, you really get to dive into the ideas at depth. Often times you'll find yourself defending you interpretation\/strategy and at times, you'll find your own arguments torn to shreds by the professors and practitioners--and that's awesome. It's hard to find a comparable class which requires you to constantly engage and reflect on the ideas introduced in class.",
                "The courses strength lies in its combination of practice and theory: Meeting and interacting with practitioners and the other students in the class is an invaluable experience. No weaknesses.",
                "Second term course (the module!) is really interesting.",
                "I thought the professors adapted it very well to COVID times. I have already sent the professors suggestions when they asked for mid-term feedback. I thought the course was a great experience and I am tremendously grateful to have had the opportunity. I am especially grateful for the detailed feedback of the professors and practitioners, and how generous they are with their time and making themselves available to students."

                "I thought the small groups worked great. I loved how well we got to know the practitioners and I really appreciated the level of depth we got into with our group discussions. The online speakers were frankly not quite as engaging as they had been in person. I wish we had found a way to replicate not just the content but the social experience of the earlier talks, maybe getting everyone uber eats prior to the speaker event so that we can eat and chat casually before the actual lecture begins.",
                "I think everything was successful except for the breakout groups. I did not find those conversations very fruitful -- perhaps this is because they came directly after class or because there was no faculty advisor present to hold people accountable.",

                "Absolutely, 100%. This is hands down the best course I have taken in my four years at Yale and I would even say that choosing to apply to participate in this program is one of the best decisions I've made at Yale. I will truly take the lessons I learned in GS with me throughout the rest of my life. If you are considering applying and aren't sure about your chances, do it!! But be willing to put work in and engage deeply with the readings - this program works so well only because the students in the program are willing to put the work in. There are VERY few courses at Yale that give you such a wide breadth of knowledge but also allow you to delve very deeply into HOW to actually get things accomplished and how to make change, from people who have direct experience and who have contributed to the world in such meaningful ways. This is honestly the type of course that you go to Yale for - to engage in readings and theory in a very intellectual way but then learn from experts in the field, amazing professors, and a brilliant group of students to put those ideas into practice. I truly cannot say enough good things.",
                "This is the better semester of Grand Strategy by far, and the practitioners make it worth your weight if you are interested in the work and realms that they exist in, but the program often lives up to its expectation of being highly consuming and demanding in both time and mental energy. Politics (mostly great power\/elite power) is still at the heart of the program, despite good efforts to diversify, so if that is uninteresting to you, it might not be worth your time.",
                "I highly recommend applying to GS if you are interested in diplomacy or politics. It exposes you to the best people and provides you with great resources, as well as challenging your views on a lot of issues.",
                "Yes, I would. The course has its issues, as any others do, but I think that 1) the format of the second semester makes it really interesting, 2) there are several opportunities to develop your own interests within the course, 3) the practitioners that are both a part of the course and come to our events are really great, and 4) last but not least, the course brings together a great group of people that are really interesting to learn with.",
                "I cannot recommend this course strongly enough. It was an amazing course, I feel like I learned so much both in the theoretical and practical realms, and it has been one of my favorite academic experiences at Yale. I have made my parents read Gaddis' book due to this course.",
                "Definitely! See all above.",
                "It is in many ways \"quintessentially Yale\", for better or for worse. It definitely improves on the first semester by focusing more on strategy in practice as opposed to the theoretical underpinnings of \"Grand strategy\". The course, however, is not content heavy. Rather it tends to focus on experience and exposure to practitioners, and this means that sometimes it feels like you aren't actually learning anything substantive. Regardless, I think that there is a lot of knowledge to be gained from this sort of exposure, and even though it can feel tedious and stagnant at times, it's overall a worthwhile experience.",
                "Yes, definitely. For anyone who hopes to make a difference in the world at a high level, this is a great course.",
                "I think its good to take one of these yale tm courses and grand strategy is a good one. I think it exposes you to world views and ways of thinking but I think you should balance it with more material-focused courses as well",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot from the opportunity to be in small modules with practitioners and receive their constant feedback. The professors are all very generous with their time in office hours and give great feedback on the assignments. The workload is enormous, so plan accordingly so that you can take full advantage of it!"
