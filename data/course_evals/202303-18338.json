I also gained skills in research methods, writing long essays, bibliography management, and engagement with scholarship.",
                "I learned much more about Canadian and American history. Turns out, there's a lot of fascinating stuff to learn about Canada, and the comparative lens of the course is really fruitful! I also practiced my archival research skills in an extraordinarily supportive environment.",

                "I improved my research, writing, reading, and critical thinking skills. The course explores somewhat challenging topics such as sovereignty and voting rights, and forces one to be intentional in their reading and note taking in order to come to class prepared to share insightful takeaways.",
                "This course is a course which teaches various interesting topics in US and Canadian history, particularly the history of voting and political institutions and immigration history."

                "Strengths: Everything! Dr. Shanahan is one of the most devoted, knowledgeable, and caring professors I have ever had. His passion for the subject is incredibly evident, and it's apparent that he thinks about every aspect of the course when crafting a syllabus. The readings are fascinating, the discussions flow, and you leave this course feeling like you learned something valuable and applicable - the knowledge itself, methodology, analytical methods, writing, or navigating archival and research systems. Weaknesses: nothing",
                "The course is phenomenal. My favorite part was the professor. Dr. Shanahan is an exceptional instructor in both his planning/course design and in his discussion leadership. More importantly, he really cares about each student's learning and success, and is very obviously dedicated to running a great course. He grades assignments quickly and provides excellent feedback. He asks thought-provoking questions in class. And he scaffolds the work of the course (with e.g. intermediate deadlines and small assignements) in a way that is very helpful. The term paper research project was the learning highlight for me. Dr. Shanahan supported me in producing a project that I could be proud of, even if it was a little rough around he edges.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the readings and the weekly seminar. I don't know if this would be logistically difficult, but I would be even more excited about a version of this course that meets twice weekly for 75 minutes. Prof. Shanahan does an amazing job at giving us students a little break part of the way through the class, but I think meeting twice a week smooths out the pace of work and readings a little more, which would have been personally helpful. The readings were all very interesting, but I sometimes ran out of time to complete all of them. Having a bit more time every week to discuss would let us talk about more aspects of each reading, and give us more time to complete them.",
                "The strengths were the reading selections and the small writing assignments. The assignments were very useful because they helped prepare for not only the final term paper, but also the senior essay as well as writing in general. No weaknesses",
                "There are many strengths (organization, engaging materials, ...), but the primary one is Dr. Shanahan and his passion for the material and care for the students. He really does have an impressive knowledge of American and Canadian history in this time period, and class was made more exciting because of his interjections and insights. Additionally, he is incredibly attentive to student needs, and provides detailed feedback on all assignments. Especially with the final paper, he provided line edits on a rough draft of nearly 30 page paper -- that is something few professors give their students."

                "If you can take a course with Dr. Shanahan, take it! He's an incredible professor who is at Yale both to learn and to teach. He treats his students respectfully, engages with our points, and is excellent at leading discussions so everyone can speak and contribute. While the reading may seem heavy, and there's a lot of writing, how the class is structured keeps you from ever feeling overwhelmed. Plus, the readings are excellent, the discussions engaging, the first two essays are low-stakes, and he guides you through the term paper (he has an open-door policy of always being open for feedback). I don't think I've ever grown or learned as much from a class or professor as with Dr. Shanahan. And History isn't even my major!",
                "Absolutely! Take this course for the professor. He is truly a magnificent instructor. It's a significant amount of reading and writing, but worth it for the learning. Canada is way more interesting than you might expect!",
                "Yes, Dr. Shanahan is an energetic and passionate instructor that deeply cares about teaching and more so his students. When I rate a course, I look at the actual material, but I look at the instructor more. Dr. Shanahan was, simply put, a phenomenal instructor.",
                "Yes. Especially if you haven't taken a history seminar or written a term paper, Dr. Shanahan is the perfect teacher to introduce you to this long-form writing. He doesn't expect perfection, and really emphasizes improvement from draft to final version.",
                "The course topics are interesting even for those with a strong background in US history; I learned a lot! Dr. Shanahan really makes this class: he's incredibly helpful and dedicated to helping you grow as a writer, and I've never had a professor offer me so much detailed feedback before."
