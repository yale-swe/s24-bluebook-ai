    "I learned a ton, particularly how to read academic articles critically.",
    "I learned about topics in the field of social perception, and more about how to critically analyze articles and work in the field.",
    "Perception is super cool and this course taught me a lot about perception through more than just sight. Learned how to think and critically analyze papers.",
    "I learned a lot about social perception for sure. Lots of interesting stuff about both the overt and subliminal ways in which we perceive social information. I also learned to become a critical consumer of scientific research and to look deeply at how it was produced and whether its scientific methods were solid.",
    "I learned to read critically, brainstorm effectively, and criticize confidently.",
    "From the first day of class we are very attuned to proper scientific investigation. We emphasized how, in both reading and designing experiments, we need to be theoretically and methodologically rigorous by clearly defining the problem were investigating, avoiding pitfalls and spurious lines of reasoning, and restraining our conclusions to the logical limits of the experiments we are conducting\/reading.\r\n\r\nThe course also deals with a number of fascinating themes, across topics, such as the differences between social influences on perception and perceptual influences on culture- top-down\/culture and the integration of different fields which inform and constrain our hypotheses: neuroscience, clinical psych, vision research, etc."

   "comments": [
    "Feedback. Responding to emails within a reasonable amount of time. Respecting deadlines. I loved this class but it drove me insane that I didn't get feedback on a paper proposal for 5 weeks. It felt disrespectful and unfair.",
    "The topics were interesting and discussions were good, for the most part. Prof. Scholl is clearly informed and passionate about the topic, and good at leading discussion. However, a major drawback is that you don't receive feedback on your work throughout the entire semester. There's a reading response every week that counts for a major part of your grade, and you receive no clue as to how your work is being received. I think it's important to make grading and feedback much more intensive in this course.",
    "Discussions are fun and starting with the intro papers\/images\/videos were a great way to start each class. Weakness: too many readings per week. Most days we didn't discuss all of them. Also, the extra reading that we came to class with was sometimes interesting, but didn't seem to add anything to the discussion. Also, it would have been nice to read some better studies since a lot of them were bad or flawed....cool ideas but not good as studies. I would like to see more \"good\" articles and less readings per week.",
    "Strengths - Prof. Scholl is very knowledgeable and can talk at length about pretty much anything related to social perception. The topics were controversial and interesting, prompting lots of questions. \r\nWeaknesses - Prof. Scholl is not very responsive on email and seems to always wait until the last minute for things. It made it frustrating trying to get feedback on our final papers (some people waited as long as a month to get feedback on their proposals, even though he said hed have them to us in a week). He also took up a lot more space in the seminar than was necessary, in my opinion. He brought in a ton of extra interesting research studies that we obviously had not read and talked about them - it was difficult, if not impossible, for us to speak in an educated manner on studies we hadnt read. And as a consequence, I didnt feel that the conversations were very insightful a lot of the time, and they rarely were about the readings he had assigned us. Prof. Scholl would often interrupt students and just generally spend much of the seminar time speaking himself. Id be interested if he looked to see exactly how many minutes he spent talking himself during the seminar. \r\nThis shouldnt be taken to mean I didnt enjoy the course because I did! It just didnt feel as much like a seminar as a lecture, though I certainly learned a ton!",
    "Loved the range of topics. Readings are just difficult enough. Can be difficult to jump into the fast-paced discussion if you're female or younger or introverted or otherwise insecure. But that's just how seminars are, not super specific to this course.",
    "I think we could have done more to talk about the specifics of readings we did for each seminar. Sometimes we got slowed down\/caught up thinking about the big picture or putting things into context (i.e. with more lecture-y stuff). I hope in the future Brian limits the amount of time dedicated to this each class by using this sort of information as framing for the readings before students actually get to the seminar so that more of the time in class can be dedicated to having in-depth discussions.",
    "Strengths: The readings were very interesting, and the professor had a really impressive breadth of knowledge about the field.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Seminar discussions were not very focused. Students tended to state their opinions or ask factual questions, instead of engaging in intellectual conversation with their peers and the professor."

   "comments": [
    "Maybe. It was a really engaging class, but if you're the type of person that wants feedback on how you're doing, this class will drive you bananas.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the topic and can deal with the limited feedback.",
    "Yeah, definitely a good class! Very standard upper level seminar with a good amount of reading per week and having to be reading for discussion but never felt worried coming to class. Pretty chill.",
    "I think I would recommend the course because there are few people more brilliant in the field than Professor Scholl. If you can get past his quirks, hes a really supportive and obviously ridiculously intelligent man. Take this class because you know youll learn a lot, even if you sometimes feel a little bit miffed about how the seminar played out.",
    "If you're interested in Cognitive Science, absolutely. It's a low workload for how much sheer information you get out of it every single week."
