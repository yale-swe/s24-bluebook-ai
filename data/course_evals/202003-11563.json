                "This course was extremely organized and covered many different essay topics. It was also very fast paced and I think the course could have benefitted from an extra revision for one or two of the essays instead of a fifth essay.",
                "All in all, I enjoyed this course and it did push me to become a better writer. The grading standard is however pretty tough, and some days it was demoralizing to see essays I thought were constructed well returned back with a poor grade.",
                "The biggest strength in this course is probably Professor Caplan. The coursework itself is pretty straightforward: do the readings and discuss the technique in class, so the the professor is crucial to making the class experience as good or bad as it can be. Discussions in this class did not lag (thanks to Prof. Caplan's questions), and we were able to constructively look at pieces written by both our classmates and in the syllabus. This was an enjoyable course to take. I can't think of any real weaknesses to this course. The grading was quick and fair, the comments were helpful, and the expectations were clearly communicated to us.",
                "Strengths: The process of writing a pitch before a draft was so valuable and Professor Caplan's feedback was always super detailed and helpful. I appreciated that there was such large breadth in the essays we read in terms of content and length. My classmates were also a joy :)\r\nWeaknesses: Wasn't a big fan of some of the essays we read, some because of content and others just because the writing was a tad bit boring in places. I also felt like discussions could be a bit slow or redundant sometimes, and I wish workshops were a little bit more critical (constructively, of course, but whenever I was being workshopped I didn't think it was the most helpful because people didn't comment that much on what they thought could have been done better). Lastly, for some class sessions I felt as though we focused too much on content and not enough on specific details of the writing that we could identify and apply in our own writing."

If you take it with Professor Caplan, expect to be challenged and encouraged in your writing. I would not take this course if you're looking for a low-commitment course, but if you're willing to put in the effort to improve your skills, you'll love this course.",
                "Yes! My writing improved, and I find myself reading many more creative nonfiction essays on my time. The reading load was manageable and having a draft\/revision due almost every week was not as daunting as it might seem. Professor Caplan is easy to talk to and he always stayed after class just to chat or to answer questions. I loved the different themes we were tasked with writing about--they prompted me to think more deeply about my experiences\/little details about the world I had thought about but brushed off."
