                "I liked how there were many different avenues of learning, we had reading assignments, listening activities, writing activities, but class lacked in speaking activities. I think this was due to the nature of Zoom classes. I would have liked more speaking activities that did not require letter graded weights. This would have allowed my classmates and I to engage and practice in a more relaxed way. I did not like how heavily structured the class was. This made class a bit robotic, and my speaking planned out in advance. I also did not like how heavy the course load was, even on days we had exams I would still spend 2-3 hours just working on Spanish.",

                "I found this course to be very weak.  The instruction was minimally helpful and many of the assignments were on topics we had not covered in class. I think this class would benefit from a slightly slower pace, fewer assignments that are more in depth and less repetitive, and more comprehensive instruction. Overall, I found myself very disappointed with this course."

                "The videos for asynchronous days seemed a little unnecessary but the breakout room feature was good for making sure everyone participated",
                "The class sorely missed interactive asynchronous content. After the first few weeks, there were no discussion posts and very few interactive assignments at all, so these days consisted mostly of watching slideshows that were not all too helpful, since they were obviously not interactive. I would have preferred more assignments that allowed us to work outside of class with our classmates. The few activities that incorporated this were very engaging and enjoyable.",
                "I enjoyed the supersite learning activities and sometimes the activities where we had to work in groups on our own time to practice Spanish. This allowed for peer engagement and speaking practice which was nice, but I don't think it should have been a graded assignment. It added extra stress especially when the video assignments were due in in less than 2 days after the initial assignment day.  I would've liked if the purpose of this practice was solely for the instructor to comment and help students improve after watching the video, as a way to assess where everyone in the class is at for understanding a grammar rule\/sentence construction as well as what should be reviewed.",
                "Although this class is meant to be taken in-person, the professor greatly succeeded in making the virtual class experience excellent.",
                "I appreciated the decision to use synchronous classes to introduce new information, discuss topics, or answer questions (and save worksheets for asynchronous classes). This was an excellent improvement over last year's Spanish class.",
                "I disliked the asynchronous classes. I found them to not be engaging or conducive to learning. I also thought the Professor used breakout rooms too frequently during the seminars in lieu of instruction. Finally, assignments were frequently assigned prior to instruction on the topics they covered and were difficult to find. I found this course did not translate well to the virtual format and I was not engaged."

However, you will have to do ALOT of outside studying and practice on your own. Class on zoom is basically reviewing what you worked on \/ studied on your own. But sometimes it was really difficult to keep up with along with other classes etc. It's a lot of work but its rewarding. I think I learned a lot, despite the non-ideal nature of this language seminar class on a virtual platform. I didn't like how structured exams and assignments were though. This didn't really translate to helping my speaking, but I could read and listen better now.",

I found there to be an unnecessary amount of work and stress associated with a course in which I received little valuable instruction and failed to improve my Spanish.
