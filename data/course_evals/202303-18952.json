                "Strengths: the guided notes for in class, exams are about same level as psets and practice exams, scope of material covered seems appropriate for time there is to cover it. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the pre class videos are way ahead of when the actual content is taught",
                "I think that we covered material quickly and efficiently, but there was not enough time to cover enough depth about each topic.",
                "Strength: My instructor and the MATH 120 course head, Su Ji, was an incredible teacher. I felt I was very lucky to have had her because her enthusiasm and engagement with our section was probably one of the reasons I stuck with this course and always tried hard. I really liked the problem sets and how they mirrored the final examthis was definitely a strength. I also really liked the diverse array of office hours made available by peer tutors and Su Ji. Honestly this is a really hard class, and I could see how it could be a really hard class for teachers, too. I can't think of a weakness, though the material was really difficult but I'm not sure how it could be improved.",
                "Strengths: There is so much content that must be gotten through in the course but there are so many resources available to support students: pre-recorded videos for every section, customized website with great practice problems, in-class worksheets, etc. If I didn't understand something, there was always somewhere I could get an answer and never felt lost. Also, I thought the content was very interesting. Su Ji Hong is an incredibly friendly and engaging professor.\r\nWeaknesses: The workload is high but feasible. If you want to succeed in the class, you must be willing to put in work before, during, and after class.",
                "Strengths: The guided worksheets are great for in-class engagement and as a reference tool when doing problem sets. The pre-class progress checks also help me stay on track with content learning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None, really.\r\n\r\nOne possible suggestion is to have the instructor go over the progress checks at the start of each class.",
                "This course is incredibly well organized, grading is on time and fair with good feedback. I also so appreciated how Su Ji's classes were not really lectures but more like work sessions - I loved it! I also really appreciate the grading scheme: grading psets out of 1000 points rather than the 1100 that were assigned (which allows you to get some things wrong but still get full points in the pset section), weighing the tests you did better on more heavily. Overall I think this was a great course.",
                "The strength of this course is that the material that was covered helped me to further my knowledge and strength at the foundational concepts of Calculus, all while being able to learn and grasp new material. Multivariable concept in my opinion helps the most with being able to understand and work with space and algebra. There is a lot of concept and material in this course, and this could be improved with adding more problems that work on foundational concepts, such as using Ximera more.",
                "Strengths: professor, pre class activities, office hours & review sessions to help students, resourcefulness. I can't think of any weaknesses and how the course could be improved.",
                "The content of this class is quite difficult, but I feel as though it was narrativized and brilliantly taught by Prof. Su Ji Hong. Her handouts and lectures would break down incredibly complex, abstract topics into a few, concrete realizations. \r\n\r\nThe course's emphasis on developing foundational understandings behind the various formulas and theorems of Multivariable Calculus made the content far more manageable.",
                "The psets were way too long and difficult to be just worth 10% of our grade. The exams were reasonable. The course was well organized and I always knew what was expected of me to do well in the class. However, personally, I found this class to be tedious and quite boring.",
                "Very demanding but rewarding.",

Otherwise, unless you want to take this course for fun, there is not many skills or benefits besides more math that you can get from this course.",
                "Yes, the course is well organized and does an excellent job in helping students to grasp the material.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but I would preface that by saying that learning mathematics is incredibly-dependent on the quality and effort of the professor. With that being said, my experience in the Fall '23 Semester with Su Ji was great.",

Even though I was placed into the class and was mostly already familiar with the material going in, I did struggle a bit. I took it to get QR credit and because I thought that taking a math felt normal after high school, but a student shouldn't just take it lightly."
