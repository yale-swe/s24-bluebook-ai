                "A major strength was the quality of feedback given on each assignment, both by students and by the professor. Meeting industry professionals and working writers\/directors\/producers was also extremely valuable. The way that the assignments built upon each other also felt really helpful and intentional. \r\n\r\nI do think that the structure of the class could be improved a bit though. The four hour time frame is really challenging to do on Zoom, and often by the end of the session, everybody had gone quiet and weren't really giving meaningful feedback anymore. I think this also sort of allowed certain moments to drag on past the point of feeling productive. \r\n\r\nWould also love a little more a lecture\/instructional element. In addition to sharing our work, I'd really like from instruction from Jon about effective writing and filmmaking in examples. Similar to what we were doing with the opening sequences for part of the class.",
                "I loved this class and I think its greatest obstacle was the fact that we had to be online! It's hard to be on zoom for 4 hours but Jon made it the best it could be.",
                "I occasionally found that some of the assignments weren't immediately clear, especially not coming from a film background. I wish that we had more time to discuss the projects in advance and talk through their purpose. I think the course was incredibly strong in nurturing a supportive environment in which students could dive into writing with confidence!",
                "The class was fairly long which made it hard to concentrate for the whole time. It was based on doing feedback for each person. One thing that might have helped some of the people in the class was a bit more context\/information about each of the assignments before doing them.",
                "It is sometimes difficult to have a natural conversation over zoom, but being able to give comments through google drive helps with that.",
                "This was a challenging course but also extremely rewarding. It's really whatever you bring to the table. The course is a workshop space that provides a supportive and structured environment in which to map out the creation of a short film."
