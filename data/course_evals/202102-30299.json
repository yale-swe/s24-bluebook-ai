                "I gained a broad spectrum of skills related to poetry- First, we learned how to read and analyze through the \"anthology\" section of the course. Learning about prolific poets and the devices they use to make their words so impactful. Second, we learned how to take a critical eye to our own work and our classmates' work, through the \"workshop\" section of the course. And third, and most impactfully, we learned how to push ourselves to write poetry ourselves, living, breathing, and thinking about poetry nearly every day.",
                "How to read poetry for craft and condense my own words",
                "I read a broad range of poetry from a variety of contemporary poets. In addition, I wrote different forms of poems and refined my discerning eye and ear by participating in poetry workshops.",
                "I learned how to really read and critique poetry not only for myself but also when discussing it with others.",
                "Robust introduction to poetic forms and how to edit poetry!",
                "Knowledge:\r\n- Various poetry forms (reading and writing)\r\n- Poetry canon; the essential (English-language) poets \r\n\r\nSkills:\r\n- Responding to and giving cogent, effective feedback\r\n- Writing a non-traditional essay on the craft of poetry\r\n\r\nInsight:\r\n- Patience is a virtue with both reading and writing poetry\r\n- Less is more, sometimes.",
                "I learned SO MUCH about contemporary poets and their poetry as well as developed a really great foundation for how to express my thoughts through poetry that I hope to use many years past my time at Yale. Professor Zarin is a master at her craft, and it was an honor to have her read my poetry and work with me on it!"

                "Strengths: allowed students to lead discussions\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes, it felt like I didn't know what I was learning and applying to my poetry. Perhaps a document with all things to look out for would have been helpful; more 1-on-1 meetings with Professor Zarin might have been helpful as well, perhaps once a week.",
                "The only weakness was one that wasn't the fault of the structure of the course- I just wish we could have all met in person instead of on zoom! One tiny thing is that I would like to have a bit more regular feedback on how we're doing in the course, but besides that there were no major flaws. The strengths were basically EVERYTHING! I loved the structure, how we had critiques and analysis of other poems to encourage our learning in multiple directions.",
                "The course brought a community of budding poets together to deliberate on each other's poetry and learn more about the craft. It was extremely engaging and welcoming. However, I think we could have done more exercises on rhyme, meter, and other finer structures in poetry. It was kept fairly general.",
                "I think this course was great in its pacing and workload. If I had to suggest any improvements, I'd say maybe an additional, optional readings list of poems people just want to share with the class (outside of the anthology poems each class)!",
                "I really enjoyed the weekly workshop and I think it was a strong class.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Workshop structure\r\n- Depth and Breadth of material\r\n- Community\r\n- Near-instantaneous, accessible feedback\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Discussions often went overtime; not enough time to give proper attention to everyone's poems (this was mitigated by rotating students for workshops)\r\n- Little guidance for the paper or for the final poetry submissions (I understand the reasons behind not providing guidelines, but regardless I think having guidelines would improve student quality of life)\r\n\r\nAreas to Improve:\r\n- Release the new discussions earlier; for those in certain time zones are stuck having to write poems hastily in the morning, sometimes.",
                "This course EXCELLED as a workshop course; I felt like workshopping my peers' poems made me a much better poet myself and made me a lot closer with them! I don't think this course had any weaknesses; the workload was very manageable despite having to write poetry almost everyday, but I felt like that was a really great way to structure this class. You had to keep practicing close together and consistently, making your \"poetry voice\" in your head that much stronger. Even if a student were to take a semester-long version of this class, I would strongly advise them to try and write every day."

                "Yes! You learn so much by reading and writing your poetry of famous poets and of your own and your peers. It's a very chill class, and you determine how much of a better poet you yourself would like to become.",

                "Yes! I really enjoyed having some structure to my writing and reading of poetry, and I loved getting close with the other writers in my class.",
                "Yes! I think this is a good introduction to certain poets and poetic styles.",
                "If this student was interested in writing poetry, absolutely! And even if this student was not interested in writing poetry, I would recommend this course to them anyway because I also came into this course with a dim understanding of poetry, but I ended up learning many things I did not expect to learn at all.",
                "Absolutely!! I loved this class, I made really great friends due to the close workshopping format, and I found a hobby that I hope to continue throughout my adult life. I'm really excited to potentially take more advanced poetry classes at Yale!"
