                "Technical writing skills, knowledge of a broad range of essayists and their styles, and how to analyse/replicate their styles.",

                "I learned a lot about the different ways you can write creative non-fiction, how to close read and analyze text, and how to implement some of the techniques we learned while reading into my own pieces.",
                "Firstly, I expanded my knowledge on writers that I had not known/read before. Secondly, I learned to read essays with a meta-analytical lens, focusing neither entirely on the plot nor entirely on the stylistic details, but rather reading to understand overarching writing strategies. Thirdly, I learned to revise my essays thoughtfully.",

                "Strengths: Craig! He was the best. I loved the system of ungraded first drafts -- it gave me a chance to try out new ideas, writing styles, etc. I also loved the workshops -- reading and commenting on other students' work was fun.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes discussion of the readings were a little circular.",
                "The strengths of this course are the teacher's choice in the selection of readings and the workshop component. \r\n\r\nA weakness of this course is the pacing; sometimes, the class can move a bit too fast or be a lot when taking, depending on your course load. There isn't really a solution to this problem since the choice of taking the class is at the student's discretion.",
                "Strengths: very pleasurable readings, quite diverse authors. \r\nWeakness: discussions lacked focus sometimes, could be improved by analyzing essays more categorically/thematically.",
                "Professor Eklund is amazing! Strengths: Class discussions were lively, any dull moments were quickly fixed by the professor jumping in and helping us make the convo more engaging, read some awesome essays\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings were very long, but the professor recognized that and adjusted the syllabus accordingly",
                "strengths: facilitated deep discussion, included works from a broad range of authors, allowed students to work with students in improving work\r\n\r\nweakness: sometimes repetitive in class structure",
                "A big strength of this course is that since it is split into 5 units with different topics, there is likely to be at least one unit that is of interest to every student. I also think the structure of each unit (reading essays, talking about them, writing a draft, revising and editing, and turning in a final copy) was fantastic and lead to some great writing and interesting discussions in class. The \"workshop days\", in which the whole class was spent discussing and providing constructive criticism about three students essays, were incredibly helpful. I really enjoyed  this course, and do not have any real weaknesses I can remember."

                "Yes, English 120 is a great place to practice and explore different types of creative non-fiction writing. The readings are great, and you have the opportunity to learn about and try various literary techniques to improve your writing.",
                "Yes! I definitely think that I acquired writing skills in this class that have made me a better writer overall, not just in the creative writing arena. I also think that anyone who enjoys the essay format (shorter in length, stylistically very variable, diverse topics) will have a very interesting semester in this class.",
                "Yes with Professor Eklund! He really cares about us students and wanted to help us improve our work.",
                "Yes, this is the first English class I have taken where I feel my writing has significantly improved. My love for English has only grown.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student, especially if that student enjoys writing. I had done very little creative non-fiction writing before this course, and found it to be a great area that is open to a lot of writing styles and topics, while still having a bit of restrictions that help develop important writing skills that a creative fiction class would maybe struggle to provide. This course had a great balance of reading, writing, speaking, as well as feedback from peers and the professor. It was well balanced in topics as well as writing styles and time periods. I felt like I became a much better writer because of this course, and also was able to enjoy the course at the same time."
