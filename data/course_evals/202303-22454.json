                "I gained a new view of the world through learning about queens from all over the planet.  We talked about a lot of things I've never thought about and it was really interesting and enlightening to get to hear so many perspectives that were different from my own, and many of which I had never been exposed to.  I learned a lot on how to skim for important information in longer texts.  Dr. Hill really pushed and challenged my writing and I'm a very different and better writer now than I was upon entering this class.",
                "SO MUCH. This class taught me so much about women, womens history, and just the history and structures of monarchies in general.",
                "I am able to look at history through a myriad of perspectives after taking this course. I learned about how the depiction of women has often been neglected in history, and I can now explore material about prominent women figures.",
                "I made a lot of progress when it comes to approaching argumentative essays and understanding historical texts.",
                "I learned a lot about reading strategically in this course, as well as improved in my essay writing skills.",
                "I expanded my understanding of the extent and the means by which women have ruled in the past, drawing multiple parallels to the struggles women in power face in the present. Beyond the course material, I also developed my writing skills and my research ability, especially with the final project where I chose to write a 12-page research paper about a queen of my choosing."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: discussions, Dr. Hill, and the workload, which I wouldn't say was light but was very manageable (the papers were well spread out).  I can't relaly think of any weaknesses.",
                "THIS CLASS SHOULD BE A LECTURE WITH SECTIONS. I would absolutely love to learn about more queens, but i guess since yale hates women we cant do that since theyre taking this class away.",
                "I believe that class discussions, the selected readings, and instructor feedback made this course phenomenal. Every student was engaged in discussions, and we, as a class, provided women perspectives that added merit to everything we read. I have no notes on how it could be improved.",
                "The strengths are the discussions that were focused on a new queen each week and the clear feedback on essays.",
                "Strengths: Engaging material that was relevant to the course, not only directly through archives on the queens we studied but also contextual documents that served to help better understand the civilization we were discussing and the societal norms at the time. The class discussions were also very engaging, allowing us all to share and collaborate on our thinking. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked to explore more rulers from the Americas, however, this wasn't necessarily a detriment to the entire course.",
                "The strengths of this course include the depth of the discussions, the welcoming environment, the diversity in the queens studied, and the multimedia nature of the class. Specifically, Dr. Hill ensured that even though we studied the queens regnant of the past, we understood their modern legacy, oftentimes through media interpretations such as movies and tv shows. Additionally, the course is a great way to develop your writing skills -- Dr. Hill provided detailed feedback for each paper as well as being open and accessible for office hours so that I could truly improve my ability to write. The only weakness I could think of would be that there is a lot of readings for each class, and sometimes some of the readings felt a little unnecessary or too much. Dr. Hill did occasionally break the reading up between members of the class, responding to the sentiments of his students, but other times it did seem like an overwhelming amount of reading to complete."

                "Yes for sure!  I don't know if it will be offered again, but if it is I 100% recommend.  I don't know of any other course that focuses specifically on only women in power, it was a really interesting new take on history that should be a lot more widespread.  And Dr. Hill is great!",
                "100000000% If yale allows Dr.Hill to teach this OR ANYTHING ELSE again TAKE IT. He is so engaging and explains everything so perfectly. As someone who does not LOVE history, i def loved this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in history. I think that this class broadened my horizons about women throughout history, and I am glad that I was able to take a class centered on women, not men.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course because there is a lot of opportunity to share your point of view about various topics related to the queens we read about. The essays are fun to write because you already have a good understanding of the topic by the time you start writing since you have 1-2 hours of class discussions and a lot of reading material that you can use.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it explores rulership through a gendered lens and allows students to collaborate on exploring our notions of gender, race, and rulers through both modern adaptations and older depictions of famous and lesser-known queens.",
                "YES!!! This has been my absolute favorite class I have taken so far at Yale. While I entered the class traditionally viewing queens regnant as mostly a European concept, I really appreciated how the course spanned so much geographically, from Egypt to Hawaii to India. The discussions are truly engaging, covering not just the queens studied but also concepts such as women empowerment, legitimization, and connections to life today. Also, this seminar was not just a class, but rather a community, as Dr. Hill fostered an environment where everyone in the class wanted to get to know each other."
