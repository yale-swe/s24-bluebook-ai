    "Sometimes, I feel as if by going by the textbook, it limits what we can learn. Thus, I wouldn't have minded if we learned something not from the textbook once in a while.",
    "The course covered a lot of material, which was a positive and negative thing. I learned a lot from it but it was also very fast paced and hard to follow sometimes. It could be improved by slowing the course down a bit when needed. The demonstrations were very helpful in understanding concepts.",
    "I think this course is perfect for students enrolled in summer session."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would. However, I would recommend it for students who are need of an introductory course in chemistry or need a refresher of chemistry topics.",
    "Yes,  but only if you have a solid background in chemistry. There are no prerequisites for the course, but the instructor does expect you to know some chemistry before hand. My lack of a chemistry background caused me to struggle in the course.",
    "Sure. I thing the professor of this course was kind and knowledgeable, and I still remembered my joy and happiness this course gave me."
