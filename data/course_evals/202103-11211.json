                "Strength - the professors are incredibly kind\r\nWeakness - lack of communication of assignments\/grades",
                "I loved how engaging the course was, and Dr. Conlin always encouraged everyone in class to participate in our fun class activities. One thing that could be improved is the Canvas page, as it was sometimes difficult to find assignments\/where to submit assignments.",
                "Strength of the course is the inclusive learning environment and constant practice of ASL skills. The class is taught voice-off, without interpreters, so it requires a high level of engagement. Weakness is that the course is not super organized, which is helpful for just constant ASL input, but can be challenging when we are trying to make sure we understood what was expected for assignments.",
                "The small class size is great for practicing vocabulary with classmates. ASL is also a fun language to learn because of how it used different parts of the body. I wish that we spent a little more time learning and practicing vocabulary and grammar, though, because I think it wouldve made it easier to grasp concepts such as storytelling and media, which we focused on a lot throughout the semester."

                "I would recommend this course, with the caveat that an interest and engagement with ASL and the Deaf community is needed -- you get what you put into this course. Overall, I appreciated the exposure to ASL I had in this course, and I learned a lot in my final project about specific accessibility issues Yale's DHH community faces, different ASL art\/poetry, and tried my hand at ASL storytelling\/poetry.",
                "I would recommend the course. Not only do you learn about ASL, but you also learn about Deaf culture, which people generally know very little about.",
