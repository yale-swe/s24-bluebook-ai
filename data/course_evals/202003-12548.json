                "The course was a great class to introduce basic drawing concepts. However, the class almost felt like an adaptation of basic drawing to the digital space, rather than a course teaching digital-specific drawing techniques. Also, I felt we had too many critiques and having more in-class drawing sessions would be more engaging and helpful. Also, we moved super quickly and many, many ideas were introduced, so I feel like I did not have as much time to polish every piece.",

                "This course tried to do so much and in the end I found that I did not produce a lot of work that I was proud of or wanted to show. It was great that we had a great breadth of tools that we knew about, but we never spent a lot of time on one of them so we ended up using Illustrator for many weeks, but only getting instruction or the chance to use one or two of the tools\/skillsets for it for assignments specifically for class. I felt like my sketchbook was a better use of my time and I enjoyed working on that a lot more than the specific class assignments we were given. It was also really chaotic to have everyone trying to share their screens at the same time while also working in another application on our laptop and also having the professor try and show us something, but Im not sure how that could be avoided over zoom.",

                "This class went from a digital\/studio class to a purely digital class. It succeeded because it is a class firmly rooted in the digital and it was easy to transition to zoom given yale's resources to equip students with the necessary hardware (drawing tablet, VR headset).",
                "The professor tried very hard to make this experience similar to an in-class experience. It worked for the most part, but sharing our screen over Zoom was a little messy, and I think using different software potentially would work more for a class like this. Including traditional modes of art-making in addition to digital was annoying for the students off-campus, as it was difficult to get and work with the material without a dedicated space. Submission of traditional pieces was also difficult without a dedicated camera or photography space.",

Sometimes class would go way over 2 hours for a critique where barely anyone spoke and other times we would end an hour early because only one thing was planned and it wasnt able to be done over zoom",
