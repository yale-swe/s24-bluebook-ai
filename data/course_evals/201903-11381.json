   "comments": [
    "I gained an in-depth understanding of how the music of musicals creates dramatic effect and how this has developed over time and who has contributed to those changes. As someone who has had little interaction with musical theater, I gained a complete appreciation for this art form as I was shown all of the nuances written into these shows that make them so brilliant. My analytical skills also developed greatly as I had to examine art from a very new angle, which challenged me in all of the best ways.",
    "I learned so much about the history of musical theater and how its changed and evolved since its conception as an art form. I learned to appreciate classic theater, especially for what it has brought to modern theater, and I learned how to synthesize across eras of theater.",
    "Understanding of how to read and articulate analytic thoughts about musical theater, as well as the historical context of the development of the form.",
    "A better understanding of the evolution and trends in musical theater. Professor Egan also pushed his students to be able to talk and write articulately about musical theater of all different styles.",
    "This course made me much more analytical about American Musical Theatre. I learned how to critique and develop and appreciation for all of the complex layers that go into making a good show. I became more confident in my ability to discuss music and express my opinions. The writing component of the class allowed me to strengthen my writing skills and ability to make a clear argument in a concise manner."

    "Dan Egan is an incredible professor that everyone at Yale deserves to know. He is so invested in his students, and is also brilliant in the way he leads his class. He's very good at synthesizing material in a clear and interesting way, and brings out the best in all of his students. For me, at first I was afraid of giving a wrong or bad answer in class, but Dan Egan knows exactly how to help his students get to the right place and understand the material in a way that makes sense to them.",
    "Strengths: incredible course, very interesting material, instructor was wonderful and highly engaging, class was the perfect size for discussion, and field trips were both fun and relevant\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very difficult to score well in this class, no matter your level of engagement due to high level of focus on writing style, so its very difficult for underclassmen or STEM majors (of which i am both) with minimal experience writing on the college level, to do well",
    "Great lectures, effective syllabus with about as good a balance of depth and breadth as could be hoped from a one-semester course on a century of content.",
    "I loved this course: discussions were always engaging, and readings were enjoyable. I found the workload manageable and the essays enjoyable to write."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely! Whether you already have a great understanding of musical theater or not, you will gain totally new insights into this world as Dan Egan gives you brand new ways of seeing the music, the intention, and the worlds that these musicals exist within.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course to another student, as it was by far my favorite class I took this semester, but I would just precaution them with the fact that unless they are a very skilled writer, it will be exceptionally difficult to score well, especially as an underclassman with minimal experience writing on a college level.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes, absolutely, no matter what your level of experience is in MT.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone even slightly interested in musical theatre. Prior to taking this course, I had begun to forget why I had loved musicals so much in my childhood. This course revived this love and gave it a new depth because I now have the terminology to describe all the things that make up a musical.",
    "This class was the highlight and joy of my week of classes. I would absolutely recommend it to other students."
