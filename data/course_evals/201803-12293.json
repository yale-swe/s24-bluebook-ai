   "comments": [
    "A deeper understanding of the mathematical concepts covered by the class, which I had previously been exposed too in high school.",
    "From this course, I learned about integration, series and sequences, and parametric curves, but no thanks to my instructor. My instructor was very confusing and I learned nearly all of the content outside of class. I learned these skills from my textbook and Khan Academy. Sure, I learned the math through these out-of-class methods, but I wish Yale would provide better faculty so that I could actually answer this question.",
    "Solidified math concepts in Calculus II.",
    "The ability to analyze integrals and apply them to solve basic Calc 2 questions.",
    "I learned how to study and do problem sets at a college level.",
    "I gained more knowledge into calculus and its applications, as well as some numerical techniques such as Taylor expansions.",
    "Calculus in a much more complete manner than I was taught in school, which enabled me to understand where stuff came from rather than solely to compute.",
    "I was able to experience and see new techniques if integration that I had prior to this class not known.",
    "Further my knowledge of integration strategies and adjusting to the rigors of college mathematics",
    "I learned a lot about calculus and the applications of calculus.",
    "Deepened abilities dealing with complex integrals, trig having to do with integrals, sequences and series, solids of rotation. All seemed pretty standard and curriculum-driven, which was fine.",
    "I learned single variable calculus.",
    "The course was helpful in getting calculus down."

   "comments": [
    "The teaching style felt rushed and was not engaging at all, making the class as a whole unenjoyable.",
    "I believe that Yale could improve this course by providing better instructors. All of my friends from various Math 115 courses say their professor is horrible, except for one EXCEPTIONAL professor whom I did not have: Brett Smith.",
    "Strengths - great professor, psets were helpful",
    "The pacing of the course is not too bad, however lectures were exceedingly boring and it was difficult to keep myself engaged each day when each lesson was so uninteresting.",
    "I think it is very organized and the classes are run smoothly and efficiently.",
    "Explorations were very helpful. The number of hours could however be extended to help with more extensive coverage of course material.",
    "The professor was very helpful and worked hard to understand students concerns.",
    "Strenghts: I felt the course was strong overall.\r\nWeakness: Sometimes excessive focus on deriving formulas",
    "The course is very organized and structured well. However, the exams were often much more difficult than the problem sets and not easy to prepare for.",
    "One of my weaknesses was polar curves but now I feel comfortable doing questions about polar curves.",
    "It's very curriculum driven (probably has to be), so problem sets and exam prep and stuff like that were all pretty straightforward. It's not very exciting or fun, but it's not the kind of thing that really can be with the demands of the standardization across sections, so it was fine all in all.",
    "It is very basic and straightforward. The material is not really delivered in an interesting way.",
    "This course was good in getting practice and understanding the topic. I have no suggestions on how it could be improved."

   "comments": [
    "Not unless it is required for them or they truly love math.",
    "If you are required to take this course for pre-med or econ, yes, take it, but you will have to struggle through it because the teachers aren't the greatest. If you are just looking for a QR credit, DO NOT TAKE IT.",
    "Yes, because math is important to many fields and this was a fundamental course.",
    "Only if you need it as a requirement or have an interest in math.",
    "Yes I would. It is a great introduction to college level math.",
    "Yes. The math in this course is very essential",
    "Yes, it is essential for any student who does not have a very advanced level of calculus.",
    "Not if they were not going into a field that it was required I would not recommend it",
    "The only reason I took this course was to fulfill a prerequisite for my major. Unless it is required, the stress of the course makes it not worthwhile.",
    "Yes I would because it strengthen my knowledge about the fundamentals of calculus.",
    "Yes. It's not too hard or too easy, and it's a solid QR credit (especially if you've already taken calc II in high school. If I had taken it after only one prior year of calculus, I think I would've felt pretty rushed and possibly confused. It's also a prereq for lots of stuff, so it ends up being worth your time.",
    "If they needed the math or QR, yes. It isn't an interest class.",
    "I would recommend this course, but only on the basis on having to get a math credit or another such factor down."
