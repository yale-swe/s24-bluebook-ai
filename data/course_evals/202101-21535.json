                "Strengths were definitely Prof. Zilm and the ta/peer tutors. The only weakness is it got confusing at times but that's from the nature of the subject. The shining star of the course was definitely Prof. Zilm. He's super knowledgeable and really cares about students and teaching. I loved that he made his lecture notes available because it made reviewing much easier.",
                "The biggest strength of this course was Prof. Zilm being a very accommodating professor. His exam policy was fair and his grading policy/general attitude toward the class was effective in fostering a supportive and non-toxic environment among the class. I do think he could have gone a bit further with answering questions, as sometimes it just seemed like he repeated what was in the notes without really going into a deeper explanation. Also, the wording of question (especially on exams) was sometimes unclear, which did provide some general confusion at several points throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths - Professor Zilm made this complicated class as straightforward as possible and really does want every student to do well. He posts clear lecture notes before lecture and gives study guides with topics and practice problems before exams. The psets are much less tedious than semester 1. Also unlike sem 1, there is no lecture during reading week, and the final is a midterm instead of cumulative. Other chem dpt classes (esp sem 1 pchem), take note! Still learned a lot but was less stressful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Lecture always went 20 minutes over time. Section was sometimes helpful, sometimes not at all. I never fully understood what was happening. Some problems were just going thru the motions bc I didn't fully understand the math or the conceptual background. I didn't take diff eq but feel like it would've been useful.",
                "Overall, a solid intro to quantum mechancis and quantum chemistry. It was kind of frustrating that differential equations, multivariable calculus, and linear algebra concepts were used frequently despite not being prerequisites for the class.",
                "The strengths of the course were the breadth of information we were exposed to and the relatively streamlined fashion in which information was delivered. Professor Zilm's notes were particularly useful when reviewing material because his lectures were essentially verbatim from the notes. That being said, because he was not really adding much to his notes, I found the lectures boring. His lectures could be improved if he presented the information more dynamically. The class was manageable but not particularly engaging.",
                "The class was really fun to be in, very amazing professor and Teaching Fellows, super supportive of the learning process. Weekly sections were really helpful to finish the HW and understand/reinforce material from class.",

                "This course was relatively well organized -- I really liked having the notes on Canvas to support lecture material. There were a lot of exams and the psets were challenging, but I'd say the exams were very fair and based on material that we learned during the course. Professor Zilm seemed engaging and understanding, and I appreciate that he cared about his students and wanted to help us do well.",

However, they were pretty inefficient and we went over time significantly every single class, which is definitely something I feel could have been improved upon.",

                "If you aren't required to take this course, I probably would not recommend it. The class isn't unreasonably difficult and the content is interesting, but I don't think it is taught very clearly and I found myself to be confused for the vast majority of the semester. A lot of this I think is because of the teaching team and the way they organized the class, and you can certainly still do well, but it is overall probably going to be a fairly frustrating experience. If you only care about getting a solid grade, I'd definitely recommend it, but otherwise you may be better served looking at other options if you can before you make a decision.",
                "No, mostly bc I didn't find the content that engaging, but, if you're required to take it, it really isn't that bad compared to sem 1. Read the class notes, go to peer tutors to get help on psets, do the exam review problems, and you'll be fine. Psets aren't tedious, exams are straightforward, and final isn't cumulative.",
                "You likely are taking this because you have to, but, nevertheless, I would recommend this course to another student. The topic is fascinating and fundamental to the understanding of chemistry.",

It's not particularly engaging, and there are many other chemistry classes that would be better choices. That being said, the material taught by Professor Zilm is foundational to understanding chemistry writ large, so if you're looking to develop a strong understanding of the field, then it may be worthwhile.",

As a chemical engineering major, I found everything we learned to be incredibly interesting, and I did not mind doing a lot of the work because I felt I was learning a lot. That being said, the material is very challenging and difficult to grasp without putting in a lot of work.",

                "Not if you do not have to, it's just difficult material and a lot of work. It is interesting how quantum mechanics explains chemistry and the elements as we know it in ways like the structure of the periodic table, but other than that it was a lot of pain and suffering."
