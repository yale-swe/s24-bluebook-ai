                "It is too fast-paced. I wish resources were made available to students, or at least in the future, the textbook will be available to purchase before the start of the semester to get a jump start. This semester the textbook was a pilot-version so it couldn't be helped.",
                "I thought the course was fantastic, especially given the circumstances of COVID-19 and the requirement of virtual learning. Prof. Yamaguchi did a wonderful job of recreating the same level of conversation and active language skills practice that you would receive in a in-person language course.",
                "The course was well-organized and lectures were engaging.",
                "Strengths: speaking, listening, writing, all improve at a very fast pace\r\nWeaknesses: none different from any other online seminar",
                "You learn a ton in a short amount of time, and there's lots of support through class, clinic, and the optional language table and office hours. The classes are small and the community you form together is a great part of the course. I don't feel there's any weakness in the teaching or structure of the class, but you have to be prepared for how intense the work can be.",
                "This course made very good use of the online format. My class was a bit large, so we didnt get as much individual attention as first semester, but I still think the class was great despite this.",
                "A very intense language course, I found it very stressful. At times it was very fast and it's very easy to fall behind if you don't really understand something because everything is cumulative. I would have liked a bit of diversity in class activities. We did almost every exercise in the textbook, but that was about all we did during class. The course description said we'd be learning about Japanese culture and language with components of anime and film and lessons about culture but there wasn't very much of that. I would have liked to watch\/read\/incorporate some outside sources from the textbook."

The in-person class time was used efficiently, though a weakness of zoom is that it's hard to ask for help once you're in a breakout room, which wouldn't be an issue if you were in a classroom.",

This was the best use of breakout rooms I've experienced, making us practice grammar in different groups every day. However, it was very repetitive in activities (different grammar, but I mean we always did just textbook practice). Watching videos or reading texts (other than those in the textbook) could have made it more engaging."
