However at certain times, the required daily homework felt overwhelming. I would recommend spacing out the assigned homework and readings so that it remains under two hours a day while still covering all of the topics in the class.",
                "Like all language courses, especially in the French department, this course has the challenge of teaching an extensive amount of material in a short amount of time. Sometimes this causes the workload to fluctuate or rise to a level that makes it impractical to do all of the exercises when combined with a full schedule.",
                "everyday class is both a strength and weakness, i just wish it was set at later times and not all in the morning.\r\ni hope the course schedule was more organized, and the canvas interface was more optimal and organized."

The French department at Yale is difficult, and this class is no exception. Nevertheless, the professor is very supportive and committed to helping all students who take this course to succeed.",
