However at certain times, the required daily homework felt overwhelming. I would recommend spacing out the assigned homework and readings so that it remains under two hours a day while still covering all of the topics in the class.",

Sometimes this causes the workload to fluctuate or rise to a level that makes it impractical to do all of the exercises when combined with a full schedule.",

The French department at Yale is difficult, and this class is no exception. Nevertheless, the professor is very supportive and committed to helping all students who take this course to succeed.",
