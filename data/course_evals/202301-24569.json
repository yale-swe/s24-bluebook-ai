                "Learned SO MUCH about Black feminist literature and read the most amazing books- this syllabus is packed with incredible material but I felt like I really got to engage with all of it",
                "By reading Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments and analyzing Saidiya Hartman's literary and research choices, I learned a lot about how to be a more thoughtful reader, writer, and researcher. From the course, I also learned a lot of American history and a lot about Black feminism.",
                "I learned about bridging archival research and narrative through visits to the Bienecke and reading Saidiya Hartman's Wayward Lives specifically. The notion of critical fabulation has been really inspiring to my creative practice and the possibility to engage multiple forms of narratives and source materials. Close reading was another skill we practiced in reading poetry by Tracy K Smith, Audre Lorde, and visiting artworks at the Yale University Art Gallery. It taught me to read with intention and at times in pursuit of better understanding who the author is, who the narrator is and what the spoken and unspoken themes of the text are, rather than passively moving through the text or simply trusting the narrator's voice at face value."

            "comments": [
                "This course was very helpful in helping me think through a different perspective that diverges completely from the norms of society. I definitely found this course challenging but in the best way possible. I think that there was a heavy amount of reading, but I believe that each reading were important creating a formative experience.",
                "strengths: Prof Edwards has such a warm and bright presence with a lot of helpful context and questions that really make you think about these texts from different perspectives. She is open to feedback and chooses texts that are largely a delight to read. She aims to pace the readings for slow reading and really thinking about Hartman's text especially. weakness: The readings did feel heavy at times and that there wasn't enough time to really closely look into so many things. I think that Edward's expertise and perspective at times made the discussions feel not as free-flowing, but that can be really hard. I wish at times we had a little more getting to know each other and our own experiences (i.e. question of the day).",
                "I think the idea of the course with a slow reading of Hartman is a good one; additionally, the scope of readings and the fact that theyre not all one genre makes for a varied reading list that I enjoyed. Discussions werent always the most fruitful, though. Additionally, the first two novels were very similar and we spent a long time on them, time I wish we spent on more contemporary topics.",
                "It is an upper level English course, so the reading load and writing load definitely reflects it, but the professor was very kind and understanding an it never felt unmanageable",
                "Strengths - Reading the assigned books at a slower pace that usual for Yale courses allowed me to really dive deep in my reading. I think this slower pace allowed me to analyze each text better. The reading load felt manageable throughout the syllabus, and I loved our class discussions as it felt like everyone had room to contribute to seminar.  \r\nWeaknesses - I think the only weakness that stood out was that we didn't get to give adequate time to each of the readings every week. Even with the slow reading, it sometimes felt like we couldn't delve into many of the nuances of a text. I think the length of class or the amount of texts covered could be changed to address this.",
                "The discussions, quality of readings, and the field trips were all great strengths. Dr. Edwards also provided exciting historical and biographical context to the readings and put them in dialogue with other scholars which allowed us to dive more deeply into each work and theme. I also really appreciated the way the course focused on literature but also intersected and did not shy away from art, music, and architecture as spaces of black feminist inquiry. I would love to see the intersectionality of the course expanded even further in consideration of food, curatorial practices, and dance for example. I think at times the quality of discussion were better than at other times. There were moments when Dr. Edwards voice were dominant in shaping the conversation, and while her insights are always astute and insightful I am wondering what ways we might have further encouraged students who tended to lean back to step forward: that said, half way through the semester I could tell Dr. Edwards took that feedback from other students well and organized more small groups which helped. One way I think might be interesting to engage with greater student engagement in discussion and a balanced voice between students and instructor would be to  have students assign themselves to leading discussions certain weeks so that the student to instructor relationship was complicated and further engaged the voices of students who might not otherwise take a front seat. One other small note of improvement is that the final paper paper was perhaps to open ended, I found I had a difficult time making sense of what specifically was being asked of me: in other classes we submitted a one page final paper proposal a month or a few weeks before the deadline for the final paper and received short feedback which helped ensure we were on the right track. I found that really helpful and I think it might support students in thinking ahead and moving into this long form work with greater confidence.",
                "Strengths: Professor Edwards is a brilliant professor and always had really compelling points to make about whatever reading we were doing. She would always very attentively listen and engage with us, and though she would generally facilitate discussion, the authority figure/student dynamic was broken down for the first part and it felt like we all discussed the material as \"equals\". I also LOVED some of the novels and essays we read, and having such a knowledgeable professor to discuss them with was so great. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There were several works in the syllabus that felt sort of irrelevant to the course. While the book we read to guide the course, \"Wayward Lives and Beautiful Experiments\", was brilliant and compelling, the novels we would try to read in tandem with that book (novels we were attempting to read through a \"wayward lens\") often fell flat. For instance, we read numerous novels on racial passing and tried to consider this as a form of \"waywardness\" or rebellion, but that did not feel faithful to Saidiya Hartman's use of the word. In other words, it could feel like we were forcing certain novels to fit a certain \"bill\" that they simply did not. I felt there was so much other material we could have read instead, more radical or rebellious or complex literature that better fit Hartman's idea of \"waywardness\"."

                "Yes; this course helps see into the world of black women that is depicted negatively. As a black woman, I definitely think that this course helped me work through some of my personal experiences and relate it to the realities of so many other black women. Definitely recommend for women of color.",
                "I think that this is a great class especially if people's personal experiences connect to the readings and they wish to share that. I feel like Black feminist texts are a must-read if you've never read them, but if you're already pretty familiar, the course might not be as fulfilling but still has a lot of different texts and ideas. I found Passing and Plum Bun to be very different than texts I'd previously read and interesting to analyze. His Own Where was also very powerful and the idea of Black Feminist geographies.",
                "Yes! Very smart professor, overall good readings, important subject matter. Im thankful I was able to take it.",
                "I recommend this to EVERYONE, even though I had already read the main text I still learned so much and enjoyed every reading assignment",
                "I would definitely. You get to do a close analysis of several amazing texts, which I greatly benefitted from. I feel like the slower reading process was also greatly beneficial to my reading and, overall, I feel like I grew as a researcher and writer by examining the works of other scholars.",
                "I would definitely recommend! This course was really wonderful, I felt like I built relationships with other students intellectually and was able to see how black feminist literature and theory was being practiced on campus even through the participants in our class and extracurricular events like the For Colored Girls Play, the JT Roane talk on June Jordan, and the Christina Sharpe talk. I was also really grateful to see Dr. Edwards engage in my own practice by visiting my studio. Dr. Edwards was engaged in students intellectual practices both in and outside of the classroom when they were able and it speaks a lot about the care and intention they bring to their students. It was a gift to take this course. I was also deeply inspired and moved by the texts that we read both personally and intellectually: Audre Lorde's \"Uses of the Erotic\" and Wayward Lives, most namely. Finally the scope of how black womanhood was defined felt broad and inclusive of white passing people, trans women, and blackness in both rural and urban geographies: I am curious about how this intersectionality might even be further expanded (I am thinking about the absence of narratives of migrants, not including the Great Migration here, for example)  but I was delighted by its presence.",
                "With an adjusted syllabus, yes. Professor Edwards is really great, and I loved the book the course is structured around."
