                "The strength of the course was being able to practice different types of writing and different writing voices. The workshop method definitely helped improved my writing because I was constantly exposed to different critiques and feedback. \r\n\r\nThe weakness was definitely the conversations we would have about the famous essays we would read. They would get redundant at times because it felt like the authors were employing the same methods. I wish we were given more space and time to critique their works and talk about ways they could've been made more effective.",
                "Honestly I felt the course was structured well. I enjoyed the in-class discussions, group activities and workshops. My only suggestion would be to do even more group work in class; those activities were a lot of fun and I enjoyed bonding with my classmates.",
                "Strengths: great selection of readings, wonderful classroom environment\r\nWeaknesses: maybe a bit more structure in class? An hour and 15 minutes is long, so more structured activity & group discussion time would be appreciated.",
                "There were many strengths of the course, including the workshops, writing exercises, and readings in general. Not any weaknesses I can think of beside maybe cutting a few readings for times sake because I know a few were rushed. I understand the difficulty of that though because we are trying to see all of the different styles."

Your writing will definitely improve, which is super satisfying to watch. The class atmosphere is great, very friendly and engaging. Plus it's English at Yale! Even if you're not an English major, it's worth checking out what all the fuss is about and why our program is considered top-notch.",
