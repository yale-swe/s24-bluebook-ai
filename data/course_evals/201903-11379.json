    "This course presents a nice view of the musical developments and key figures from Beethoven to the present, and it gave me a much richer set of tools to think about music and its place in history.",
    "I learned what western art music is and the main developments over the past two centuries.",
    "A general survey of the history of Western art music from 1800 to the present day.",
    "I learned a lot about music history and found some new pieces to listen to. It would have been cool to learn about some composers who have been excluded from the canon due to their race, ethnicity, sexuality, etc.",
    "Solid understanding of western art music history throughout the 1800s, 1900s, and even branching into the new millenium.",
    "This class was a great survey of western music since 1800. I learned a lot about different composers, what makes them distinctive, and how the tradition of western music has changed in the past 200 years.",
    "History of early music",
    "Music history from Beethoven to the present day. We learned about how the history of western music fits into the history of larger socio-political events. Even though I've been playing an instrument for a while I realized from this class that I didn't know how to listen to musical pieces as well as I thought I did.  We practiced listening a lot to different pieces and talking about their harmonic language, structure, mood, etc.",
    "I learned about many different trends and styles in 19th and 20th century western art music.",
    "Learned about the social, artistic, and political forces that have shaped the course of Western music throughout the past two centuries through the medium of an assortment of musical examples.",
    "A comprehensive understanding of the evolution of classical music from 1800 to the present.",
    "Learned how to listen to western music more critically and identify forms in music and trends throughout the history of western music.",
    "A great overview of Western music since the 1800s, starting with Bach and ending with recent times in the early 2000s!",
    "An insightful overview into the development of Western classical music.",
    "This class, as the title suggests, gave an overview of Western art music starting with Beethoven and reaching all the way up to the present. We looked at individual pieces and composers as well as larger trends, learning both the actual information and, more generally, how to listen to music.",
    "I learned a huge amount about the history of western music from 1800 to the present, so the class worked exactly as advertised. I also gained a nuanced view of the stories behind different artists and genres through the commentary from Professor Kreuzer, and also learned to recognize the music by ear."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Kreuzer is very patient! We could have spent some more time going over how to identify keys, as that seemed to play a large role in analyzing music pieces. However, I get that that's a skill that takes more than a couple of days to develop.",
    "The listening assignments were always fun to complete, and I enjoyed the pieces that we had to listen to. The structure of one midterm and one final was great. I wish that there were slightly less readings some weeks.",
    "This is a great course, especially for people with some background in classical music. The workload is very manageable, and the lectures were engaging.",
    "Strengths: The content was really interesting, and Professor Kreuzer is an excellent instructor. I can't really think of any weaknesses.",
    "The professor and the TA were very engaged with the course and genuinely excited to teach. The lectures, for the most part, were very engaging. It was hard to follow along when the professor would discuss a piece of music and get into the details of the notation, the chords, etc and I'm unsure that it really contributed to what I learned in the course or discussed in exams. I also think the format of the exams was a bit much as I felt really rushed to complete each section.",
    "The class is very interesting and has a low workload - however, the work that you do is graded somewhat unfairly. There are no clear rubrics or general grading schemes that inform students of how we would be graded, so at times it felt like the grading was almost arbitrary.",
    "Too much content, very difficult to know all the material. \r\nBut very interesting, learned a lot of cool stuff",
    "The primary strength of this course was Professor Kreuzer. She was very detail-oriented, came to class clearly very very well prepared, very organized, and very experienced. Another strength was how diverse the list of composers was compared to the standard music history class (more composers of color and women than I had expected - for example William Grant Still, Clara Schumann, newer composers like Missy Mazzoli). Even though the class was a broad scope look at music history, I feel like we learned about a lot of topics in depth. Another main strength - the music!!! I've been playing in orchestras and chamber groups for many years, so I got to listen to pieces I had heard or played and was really familiar with, but the vast majority of the pieces were one that I was unfamiliar with. So many beautiful pieces of music. I loved the opera unit and will be listening to Verdi's La traviata for probably the rest of my life. One thing that could be improved is a more clear connection between the readings and the class material. I think the readings were generally super strong in that many times they elaborated on or restated things that Professor Kreuzer had covered in lecture. However, sometimes there were some more difficult theoretical readings that maybe we could have touched on more in class.",
    "The course effectively covers a lot of material with a good amount of depth. I found some of the supplementary readings to be redundant sometimes, could have been shorter sections.",
    "Prof. Kreuzer is one of my favorite professors that I have had so far. She is endlessly enthusiastic about what she's teaching, and turned me, someone who used to hate opera, into someone who tolerates opera, which is big. Very few apparent weaknesses, but I thought that grading for the midterm was kind of  harsh in its subjectivity.",
    "I found the lecture style of the course to be quite engaging, but because there were so many students in the course I found it difficult to participate. A seminar version of this course would probably be even more effective because it would increase each students ability to engage with the material.",
    "While Professor Kreuzer is a really great speaker, if you lose attention even for a bit (which is relatively easy in a 75 minute lecture), you won't hear the material again. Sometimes she summarizes things at the beginning of the next lecture, and sometimes it is in the textbook, but for the most part, it's not as detailed as it is during the first explanation. I would recommend having more notes on the powerpoints to make it easier to follow the lecture if you have to miss a day or miss a few minutes of the class.",
    "This course was awesome! It's a great overview of Western music since Beethoven and you really delve into listening to pieces and discussing how they reflect the history of the times and the styles of the times.",
    "I loved the mix of listening to music and learning about the history.",
    "Lectures are very engaging and include listening to musical pieces in class.",
    "The course was really excellentI thought the lectures were well thought out, and there was a good balance between historical context and listening to pieces.",
    "The class was very effective overall. I learned a lot and, as someone who rarely takes humanities courses and has not learned about music since high school, this class was very accessible and interesting. The assessments and assignments definitely require some use of humanities-style literary explication (as opposed to the brevity and precision customary to quantitative courses), but this was appropriate to the course. Grading was perhaps more difficult at times than expected, but altogether a great class."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes -- was very interesting to track the development of (WESTERN) music throughout the past couple of centuries.",
    "Definitely music history is a colorful and exciting subject, and this course provides an engaging survey of the major pieces and characters that staked their names in history.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. You will learn so much about music history but also music in general if you have no prior experience in music like me. I have certainly gained a greater appreciation of all types of music from this course.",
    "Yes, particularly to students with a background in classical music. Since most of the class had prior experience with classical music, the lectures assumed a certain amount of knowledge, and it's helpful to be able to read music.",
    "Yes, especially if they are interested in music history. The workload is fairly low, and the content is very interesting.",
    "It was a good course, an easy class to round out your schedule.",
    "Great course if you would like to have an overarching knowledge of romantic\/contemporary music.",
    "Yes! If you have any interest in classical music, I would definitely take this class. Prof Kreuzer is a great lecturer, and very good at engaging the class.",
    "Only if they feel really passionate and are willing to grind for exams",
    "Definitely, Gundula is incredible",
    "Yes!!! I looked forward to every class meeting. Professor Kreuzer is brilliant and so well-versed in this topic. The fact that you also get to listen to beautiful and interesting music that you would never otherwise be exposed to as part of the homework is such a blessing. It's such a nice break from the rest of readings or psets that you may have to do during the week.",
    "Professor Kreuzer does a good job with this course! She describes the material in a memorable and interesting way, and covers a lot. I have a much better understanding of how western music today came to be.",
    "Absolutely. Although, I would only recommend it to those who have a solid music experience or have taken theory\/history courses. It just makes the listening assignments ( and ~60 required piece recognition for the final) that much more doable.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Western Music History BUT I would also consider auditing it.  If you're taking it for fun the course does require work and is not a walk-in A.",
    "Yes, especially if you are a musician. It will develop your ability to identify composers and their compositions, along with providing you with a very detailed historical context for those compositions.",
    "One of my favorite classes at Yale. Coming to class was always a relaxing time because we would hear about really interesting material and listen to good music.  While the class moved fast, the music excerpts gave you time to relax, calm down during a busy day, and just focus on the listening. We would go pretty far in depth into many different composers, movements, and forms which I enjoyed, especially because you did not need to know all of the material to do well in the class. Overall, I feel like I gained a lot but did not put too much effort in. Additionally, the music assignments were short -- about a page or two each -- so it was never too much on top of my other classes.",
    "YES!!! You get to survey different trends of Western music, listen to some great music and discuss it with Professor Kreuzer and your classmates, and develop a better ear for listening critically to music.",
    "Yes for sure! The work is interesting and the material is great.",
    "Yes- it is extremely interesting and music theory knowledge is not necessary",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Students with any level of musical background will get something out of it, and Professor Kreuzer is excellent. The workload is light, but the content is legitimately interesting.",
    "Yes, definitely. I learned a lot and, as someone who rarely takes humanities courses and has not learned about music since high school, this class was very accessible and interesting. If you are looking for a Hu credit and want to listen to interesting music, this is the class to take. Certainly, the classics are concentrated at the beginning of the course while the latter half includes more experimental acquired tastes, but definitely a course worth taking."
