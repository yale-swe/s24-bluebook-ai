                "Compared to other social science\/humanities departments at Yale, I think WGSS provides much more support to undergrad thesis writers. Enrolling in the junior methods course and then the senior colloquium gave me the tools to develop my initial research area into a reasonably contained research question. I think future WGSS majors would benefit from explicit labelling of the methods earlier on. Many of us scrambled to identity our methods courses as seniors, trying to articulate our path through our Yale coursework after already have nearly completed it. The main methods of the department are ethnography, archival research, literary analysis\/close reading, visual analysis, and film. Perhaps professors in the department could identify courses that could satisfy methods requirements and provide a list to WGSS majors. While I think there should be space for students to propose their own methods courses, I believe this structure would offer necessary support to students who don't have a solid understanding of what \"methods\" means as a concept.",
