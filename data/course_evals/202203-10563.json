                "An understanding of real world  global-justice problems from incredible guest speakers with vast experience in their respective fields. Got to hear from people in industry working to fight climate change, election hacking, global drug policy, kleptocracy, refugee flight, tax dodging, and transnational crime.",

            "comments": [
                "The classes were not very interesting; many of the guest speakers all spoke about the same thing, so a lot of the time it didn't feel like we were learning anything new. Also there was no student discussion. It felt more like a weekly lecture series that always ran 20 minutes over time.",
                "I enjoyed this class, and thought that having a few students really research each guest beforehand was helpful. It allowed for a thoughtful discussion that got to some deeper questions. The guests came from vastly different backgrounds, though were fairly ideologically aligned. The addition of a more conservative guest, to demonstrate how conservatives approach these questions, could have been valuable. The course ended in a significant essay (7-10k words), which I would have appreciated more guidance on throughout the process. This class is a graduate level one, but it had mostly undergraduate students -- many of whom have not written a paper of that length before. I also wish that there was more feedback on our response papers.",
                "The strengths are of course the incredible guest speakers. This is the kind of course that makes Yale special -- the ability to talk with a French parliament member, former senator, and other world renowned experts in their fields was inspiring. Weakness of the course is that the course felt very disjointed, each week jumped to an entirely new topic, not really a seminar where students participate and give their own thoughts, more of a seminar where you ask one or two questions at the end after listening to a really long lecture. The final paper was too long and I definitely started it way too late.",
                "Strengths: - Guests speak on a wide range of topics -- everything from journalism to art to global economic development to US politics. There is something in this course for everyone. Many of the guests come to campus and have dinner with students after class, which is very insightful and a great way to learn more about their subject matter area. And the professor and Global Justice Fellows are happy to connect you with the speakers and other subject matter experts, who can help you in your research both this semester and beyond.\r\n\r\n- As is common with graduate seminars, about 80% of the course workload occurs in the last few weeks of the semester. So don't leave it till the last second. If you are good with time management this shouldn't be a problem, and can even be an advantage since the course allows you to focus on one complex research project instead of dividing your time between a bunch of smaller assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- This course is not taught by Professor Pogge in the traditional meaning of \"teaching.\" The professor is present, but (with a handful of exceptions) does not actively participate in the discussion between the students and the guests/Global Justice Fellows. I'm sure he spends a lot of time and effort on coordinating their visits and presentations. But if you want to learn directly about Professor Pogge's research and ideas, this is not the course for you.\r\n\r\n- From my experience, the course seems to be biased towards the universal framework of \"corporate involvement in [x] bad,\" and generally pushes the idea that most or all issues in emerging democracies, climate change, politics, and law are the fault of multinational corporations and big banks. From a social scientific perspective, I find this questionable -- social scientists should begin with questions about why phenomena occur, rather than immediately concluding that virtually every global problem under the sun is the fault of big banks. Though maybe it is unfair to hold philosophy courses to the same standard of rigor. I know this is an unpopular position to take, but I encourage you to challenge the idea that one group of people or institutions can truly be implicated in every global justice issue across the world. The course doesn't necessarily examine counterclaims or other causes, such as domestic corruption, game theory/bad incentive structures, and monetary policy disasters.\r\n\r\n- The guest speakers (particularly those on Zoom) often lose track of time, so the course occasionally runs 15-20 minutes later than expected. Keep this in mind if you make plans for right after the class meeting time.",
                "I liked the set up of the course a lot and really enjoyed the weekly guest speakers. However, I wish wed had more reading in advance of classes rather than little work throughout the semester and a long final paper. I really enjoyed collaborating with other students on the short papers, but found writing such a long paper at the end of the semester rather difficult.",
                "The only way I think this course could be improved, is with a more clear understanding that it basically is a lecture series. There is very little concrete instruction, or commentary from the teaching staff on the guest speakers. It is basically just a series of guest speakers every session. That made for a very interesting and exciting class, but I didnt quite realize that was going to be the format when I registered.",
                "Perhaps instructor feedback on assignments could have been improved (more detailed for example)",
                "Strengths: I loved the guest lectures. All the guest speakers are experts in their field and seemed eager to pass on their insights to students. The students who were selected also came from diverse backgrounds, which helped enrich our learning by hearing from diverse perspectives. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None that I can think of."

                "I would not recommend this course. I was really excited about the material coming into the class, but feel like I completely missed out. Every class was centered around 2-5 guest speakers who would give a presentation about their specialty (somehow related to wealth inequality, corporate tax evasion, political corruption, etc) and then students would ask questions. Some of the speakers were cool, but many of them were incredibly boring, and they tended to all say the same thing which made it even harder to focus. Student engagement was incredibly low throughout the entire semester. With that said, it's decently low-workload; all you need to do is two collaborative essays and then a long final paper.",
                "no",
                "I would! I enjoyed it, and felt that my breadth of knowledge on the field of global finance -- from art trade to investigative journalism -- was vastly increased. It is also nice to take a seminar with a different format than most seminars; it made for a welcome change in pace.",
                "Yes for the guest speakers, but start on the final paper early.",
                "I would recommend the course with the caveat that it is effectively taught by the guest speakers rather than by the professor, and that the guest speakers' presentations are meant to provide inspiration for your final project; their content is not tested in any meaningful way. (So in theory you could never pay attention in class and still do fine -- this is either good or bad depending on your learning style.)\r\n\r\nAnother point is that guest speakers often promote their own philosophy or interests without subjecting it to rigorous testing of ideas; in other words, they promote their own viewpoint and it is your job to probe them with potential counterclaims.",
                "I would absolutely! You get the chance to hear from interesting people and to gain a lot of real world knowledge.",
                "Yes, I think I would. I think the most valuable thing about this course is it gives you the ability to write a thesis before you actually have to write a thesis. Pay attention to the 7,000 to 10,000 word range of the final paper. I came away from this course with a better understanding of major issues, facing the world and a piece of writing I felt proud of. I did not, however, gain an in-depth knowledge of how the global financials or tax system works, though I would have had a written my final paper on it. This to me was not a negative, but it is something you should be aware of if you want to take this class. Also, you have the whole semester to write a paper and very little reading so dont be worried about the workload.",
                "Yes I would",
                "Yes. This was a very interesting class that I think any student could benefit from by participating in the class."
