                "The course is really well organized and thorough. It has a good balance of assignments and lots of feedback. While the grammar can be tough at first, the course is set up so that you have many chances to practice before you get a grade. It's been the best Spanish class I've taken at Yale and probably the most I've learned in Spanish in such a short time. The only weakness is that there is a lot of work, which is very understandable but can sometimes become busywork. The other thing is that assignments or in-class essays are often very specific in order to fit the theme of a short story or movie from the syllabus. I think those assignments would be more useful if they weren't so constrained by the topic.",
                "The structure of the course is logical and helps build grammar skills, reviewing and strengthening basic concepts before moving to more advanced concepts. The material in class builds on the textbook and homework assignments. The class has a lot of homework that is fairly laborious.",
                "The explanations of concepts was good and the chats with native speakers were extremely helpful. The emphasis on filling in blanks on worksheets should be completely abandoned. There is very little opportunity for students to improvise and reinforce the concepts in a communicative setting in the classroom, but there is absolutely no reason why this could not happen. Simply replace the excessive worksheets with more activities such as the debate, where we were actually implementing the concepts that we learned. Forcing students to create sentences on their own using the concepts is much better than asking them to identify distinctions or make minor applications of the concepts.",
                "Two strengths are that the exam structures were very fair and the homework assignments helped me ensure that I understood each lesson. \r\nOn weakness is that it was extremely time consuming, and the hour-long conversations per week on top of additional work got to be a lot."

Focusing on the structure of the language was very helpful for my learning process."
