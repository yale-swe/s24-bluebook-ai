                "There is a LOT of material covered in this course. Paring down to the most important\/interesting things might allow for more in-depth explanations rather than having to speed through everything.",
                "The course was structured and organized well.  Pace of the material was also appropriate.  A better review of the lecture slides to remove errors could have been done.",
                "It was just a lot of information that seemed to be irrelevant at the moment, but I know it can't be taught any other way due to regulations",
                "It was nice that the fundamental ideas of engineering were clearly communicated and emphasized.  The psets were straightforward and were a good complement to the lectures.  Tests were difficult even though they were open note (probably because of the time crunch), but that just forced me to study before.\r\n\r\nI liked the real-world focus of the course.  If I had one recommendation, it would be to include more examples of where engineering ideas are applied directly to the navy\/real world.  Definitely keep the nuke presentations, and maybe more analysis of casualties?  That day we talked about the USS Cole and DC was a perfect example of tying the lectures to real world events.",
                "Strengths: Extremely well-organized slides with good visuals that helped me understand the concepts. Instructor used personal testimony to help illustrate the relevance of the course to the fleet, which I extremely enjoyed. Instructor breaks down intimidating, complex topics in engineering and applied physics into understandable and enjoyable content for a non-STEM major. Small class size was nice for Q and As. Workload was extremely reasonable as well. Also, the class slack page was extremely great for collaboration. Organization of curriculum was excellent. Weaknesses: Few, if not any even during a difficult time of the pandemic.",
