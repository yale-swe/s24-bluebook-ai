I enjoyed when the professor told stories about himself or provided specific examples, but the class felt a bit redundant and more historical than topical, which I would have preferred. I also enjoyed the idea of group work, but in practice, found it difficult to coordinate and ultimately stressful. The Canvas page also often had conflicting deadlines for assignments, which was confusing.",
                "Group projects were very disorganized and frankly unfair. Many students were left to pick up the pieces of other students because their grades depened on it. Grading system was also very random and unstructured.",

                "Strengths: interesting content, the professor has a lot of lived experiences that lend well to the course, light workload.\r\nWeaknesses: there are 3 group projects for this course, one of them being a 15-20 page final paper, and I had a terrible experience with my group.",
                "Lectures were very disorganized and lecture slides were not posted to gain a better understanding of the class. I often left lectures realising that I had not really learned anything.",

There are 3 one-page homework assignments to be done individually and two group papers (5 and 15 pages).\r\n- Virtually no math. If you can add and subtract, youre good.\r\n\r\nCons\r\n- There are surprise quizzes during class. These are easy and usually last a minute (their true goal is to foster attendance), but they can still be a source of unneeded anxiety.\r\n- The final paper is a group project and counts for 40% of the grade. You will either be in a good group or a bad group.\r\n- The readings are really old. Some were published in the 1960s.",
                "This class is the actual worst, ignore people telling you to take it b/c it is easy. It is easy - there are just four total assignments, all of which are super short and not that hard + one group paper at the end. But, grading makes no sense and feels totally random/arbitrary, plus working in a group is so unnecessarily challenging. You will learn NOTHING in lecture, even when they're about topics that should be cool. Basically, this class is NOT AT ALL worth it, you will learn nothing and there are many other guts (including within the econ department) that are at least kinda interesting. Seriously, no one should take this course, it is by far the worst class I have ever taken at Yale.",
