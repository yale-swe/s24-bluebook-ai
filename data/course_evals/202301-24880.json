                "Strengths: the course was very well-organized, with the professor and TA offering continuous prompt feedback. The professor was very accommodating for assignments, and the feedback provided helped immensely for the development of my writing. The grading was very generous in this class for a writing course. The assignments built on top of each other and had a lot of flexibility built into their prompts. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wished the other students in my class participated more. The readings were so interesting and the professor was trying her best to be engaging, but the students just did not reciprocate her enthusiasm. Granted, it is a Monday 9AM class, but still, there were so many times in which I wished that the other students would just contribute more to the conversations we were having in class.",
                "If you don't mind the early hour, it's a great course with no real weaknesses. You learn a lot and the micro-essays can later be used for the finals, which was a huge help during finals. You get to pick from a wide variety of work to write about, many of which are works I would not otherwise seek out myself and that I found very informative and interesting to read.",
                "I think the course was very engaging and insightful. I think the class was a little messy itself",
                "Strengths are that she is an incredible lecturer and really makes an intellectually rich space. For this reason, I really really enjoyed going to class every Monday. The readings were also incredibly insightful and profound, and she recommended some beautiful and underrated works that really should be discussed more in academic settings."
