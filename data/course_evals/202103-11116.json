It was Han's first time teaching this class and it showed. Otherwise, it is a fine class that I would probably only recommend taking if and only if you need it. If you are looking for a writing credit as a STEM student, there are probably better options. The labs were insane and took forever to write.

I learned very little about large-scale, long-distance power-transmission and high-voltage circuits. Some other core concepts included phasors, complex impedance, Thevenin equivalents, Ohm's law, circuit analysis via loop and node equations, power dissipation maximization, and different types of power.

            "comments": [
                "Very great intro class for EE\r\n\r\nSince it was the Professor's first time teaching the course, he did not really know at what speed to move so regularly fell behind in lecture.",
                "It needs to be improved by slowing the pace down and ensuring students actually understand the material.",
                "Loved the content, how it was taught, and the engagement with the professor. The lab can definitely improve. The instructions were sometimes lacked information and the students are often left puzzled.",
                "One of the best textbooks I've used, didn't cover too much extraneous details but was still very thorough.\r\nCourse content was well-organized and of suitable difficulty.\r\nSome of the labs weren't very well organized, TAs however were very helpful.",
                "I think the amount of homework was very appropriate and the lectures were good. I also enjoyed the labs and learned a lot in them.",
                "The course covers a lot of material and there is a big jump in the difficulty of the course. Spending more time on some of the latter material would make this transition easier.",
                "The course was pretty straightforward and what one would expect from an engineering course. Labs were fine and related to what we did in class (although I had an early in the week lab section and sometimes the lab was on something for later in the week which was slightly annoying). Psets were weekly and related to the class which was great.",
                "The lectures were well organized and the lab work helped us understand the material better.",
                "This class should be better organized. Han was using slides that he did not even make and he was often surprised by the content on the slides. It should be better organized and labs were often really annoying and advice was not clear for what we should be doing for the assignments to improve.",
                "Strengths: detailed lecture notes, clear what would be tested on the exams, instructor took time to explain what we needed to know\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: often found the course lagging behind where it was supposed to be in terms of lecture materials",
                "The course was poorly related to the lab, the lecture was disconnected from the homework, and the exams were strikingly difficult",
                "Strength: The course is structured well and it's established at the beginning what the topics will be for each week. \r\nWeaknesses: Almost every lecture, the professor did not finish going through all the slides. Near the end, this led to the postponement of some psets as we did not learn the materials required to complete them. The midterm did not reflect what we learned from the psets and lectures well, while some pset questions did not reflect what we learned in lecture either. Some of the labs felt very disorganized, resulting in many having to use the help of the lab TA for every single part of the lab. The textbook also does not aid in understanding the course material.",
                "This course should clearly be divided into multiple courses. I think it should at least be divided into a 1-credit lecture course which meets for two 75-minute sessions per week, and a 0.5-credit lab course. JH and all students would agree that there was no way to get through Mark Reed's slides in just two 50-minute lectures per week. Nor should that be done; I think it's really foolish to try to teach the fundamentals of electrical engineering with so little time. I also didn't appreciate how quickly we brushed over large-scale power transmission, high-voltage circuits, and high-voltage safety mechanisms. That seems like a very important part of electrical engineering. At least an EE elective about those topics should be added.\r\nOverall I learned a lot, and the labs were pretty well designed. I think it would be nice to give the students a little more structure for the lab report, like maybe templates. I'd like to see the lab reports graded out of 100 points instead of 10 and for more comments to be given about them. I didn't get any comments for 4 out of the 5, and felt like some of them might just be graded hastily for completion. \r\nLecture format was good, but maybe Mark Reed's powerpoint could be edited or trimmed down. Some of them had typos and didn't match the conventions used in the textbook. The lectures were too short, so I had to teach myself a lot of the material outside of class. The problem sets should probably be more extensive. Part of the the reason the midterm scores were so bad is because none of the problems on our homeworks really taught us how to to do the second and third questions of the midterm. So definitely add some homework problems about complex impedance analysis, phasor analysis, and reading current and voltage signal graphs.",
                "Strengths: lecture notes were very thorough, good reference to go back to when reviewing\/studying for exams. Peer tutors were clearly knowledgeable about the material and very helpful in their office hours. Prof Han clearly wanted the best for all of us. Labs themselves were very helpful in cementing\/applying the concepts learned in lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: although the labs did force us to solidify our understanding of the topics, the reports felt unnecessarily lengthy at times. Also, the long delay in grading them meant that any mistakes made in early labs could not be corrected in future lab reports.",
                "Strengths of this course include the breadth of teaching methods (lectures, labs, office hours) and relatively succinct material delivery.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of the course largely stem from the kind of work assigned. The exams for the course demanded that we were familiar with solving relatively complex circuit problems requiring great comfort with the methods we were taught in order to apply them in niche scenarios. The homework problems, however, did not contain such difficult problems, leading to a disjoint in capability and expected capability. Luckily, the labs made us more familiar with solving more difficult problems, but since there were only 5 of these labs (resulting in 5 big chunks of work with only some of this work being the difficult problem solving), they were insufficient for conditioning students to solve more challenging problems.",
                "The labs were great, the lectures were mostly informative and effective but the 50-minute format of the class made it such that we were always running behind and Professor Han had trouble fitting all the material into the class it had been prepared for. The textbook could maybe be changed as it felt a little outdated and didn't always match the material we covered in lecture. The lectures were much more helpful than the textbook. I especially appreciated the worked examples in the lectures.",
                "Strengths: really well set-up curriculum, a great level of depth for an introduction. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: problem sets were incredibly short and often trivial; did not at all prepare us for exams. Lab report guidelines were unclear, and prior knowledge in MATLAB was expected despite being an intro course.",
                "The course covers concepts that are quite important in the world of EE. The lab component is interesting and useful in cementing concepts learned in lectures. The course can be a bit disorganized and definitely feels rushed a lot of the time. I think trimming lecture slides and targeting the most important concepts might help, and I think that it would be useful to assign more applicable and comprehensive practice problems.",
                "This course is good at giving students a good idea of what electrical engineering is all about. However, there was so much material to cover that we did not have adequate time to master the material. Each class was a new topic, which made it incredibly difficult to keep up. I think students would benefit from covering fewer topics in greater depth.",
                "Strengths: Recorded lectures are a huge help, material was easily accessible online, teacher obviously cared about his students, grading was very fair\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Initial disconnect between what the professor thought we knew and what the class actually knew, which resulted in that low score midterm. This was understandable, though, given it was the prof's first time teaching this class. He also was generous in the retake and curve (thank you)",
                "Slides are excellent companions to lecture, but aren't helpful on their own (reviewing beforehand or after isn't very helpful). Lectures were often unclear and we would fall behind.\r\n\r\nOverall, did its job. Taught electronics. It was a shame not to have professor reed.\r\n\r\nThe lab portion of this class is excellent. It requires real hands on skill and thorough understanding of the underlying concepts. Lab reports were difficult.",
                "Overall, I greatly enjoyed the course. However, as I had hardly any hands-on experience with electronics prior to the class, our first lab session caught me off guard -- a thorough rundown of core tools\/skills we'd need in the lab was not given. Also, I believe there could've been a better bridge between the content of the lectures and lab reports."

                "Yes, definitely! EE\/ME majors, this is a core requirement, so definitely take it. For STEM majors, this can be a pretty chill WR class that can be intellectually engaging. You'll learn a lot about basics of electronics, which is no harm if you are a STEM major.",
                "Very good intro to EENG, would take if you're considering the major",

Nice to get a writing credit out of the way and now I'm able to take other writing credits as Credit\/D\/Fail as I don't need them for the WR. It is a pretty standard engineering course and I think will be useful for future mechanical engineering classes for myself as I feel more comfortable with circuitry and building it while having a better understanding of what is going on. A pretty practical course in the sense that I learned how to apply and build circuity.",
                "I would recommend this course if you want to learn about fundamentals of electronics or need this information for other, more advanced courses you want to take.",
                "Only if you need it. There are better classes. It helps explain E&M concepts, but its just a lot.",

The textbook is great, and even if you don't learn much in lecture, you'll learn a lot by doing the problem sets and lab reports. I definitely recommend reading some of the textbook readings; they help a ton. JH is nice and cares about students. You'll definitely learn something as long as you care.",
                "Yes! even if you're not an EE major, it's good background for many other upper level classes in other engineering disciplines. Overall, I felt the material was well-organized and presented in a way that made sense. You gain a really good foundation for electronic circuit analysis that can be applied in many ways!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student only on the grounds that they would 1.) very much like to be introduced to the basic functionality of circuits\/how to analyze basic circuits and 2.) be okay with an occasionally demanding workload. It is certainly possible, however, to space out the work in this class (largely the work from the labs) in a way that would make it very manageable.",
                "Yes-- with the stipulation that they should be ready to put in a lot of hours. Between lab reports and studying the material, this class has a bit of a heavy workload. It is rewarding though, and worth it if you are an electrical engineer or an applied\/experimental physicist.",
                "I think this is a great course for anyone going into an engineering field.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course if you enjoy quantitative work and physical sciences overall. It's a solid science and writing credit, and you will come away from the course with a general understanding of basic circuits. There are certainly easier science credits, but I don't regret the work I put into this course at all.",
                "Only take this class if its required for your major because the workload and difficulty are both very high imo. Definitely not a class to take for fun unless you have a lot of spare time and effort to dedicate to it.",
