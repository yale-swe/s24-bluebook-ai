It taught us the danger of homogenizing different groups and not to understand the world through a Western lense full od standards. It also taught a lot about the different ways that love has evolved in the world and what effects modern technology has on the rest of the world as well as the effect of the West on the rest of the world."

Technology was an issue but in the future in non-Zoom classes hopefully it will not be the same. The other main weakness was the amount of time per class- but again I think that is a result of Zoom."

Even if you have taken no WGSS courses before (I hadn't), Prof. Savci creates a wonderful learning environment, and her discussion questions really make you digest the material in a way other courses have not demanded. Your assumptions about the way the world works will be challenges by this course, which is always a good thing.",

Additionally, if you are in the human rights program, you can petition to have it count as an elective because it complements the required gateway course SO well!!!",
