    "This course helped guide us through the early stages of our senior essays, from selecting a research subfield and topic through to making an outline and first draft of our senior essays.",
    "I learned how to embark on a major research project, planning long-term and short-term goals and executing them along a time-line.",
    "Very useful class (though required), biggest things gained by this course were: practice writing grad-school statements, ongoing structure and encouragement for thesis work that keeps you honest, a sense of what your classmates are up to and a corresponding sense of perspective on your own work."

    "I appreciated the structure of this course, which forced us to stay on top of things and made the process of working on our senior essays less daunting. Overall, I am happy with the progress I made this semester, which would not have been possible without the weekly deadlines and progress updates we gave. I also appreciated the chance to learn from and give feedback to fellow classmates.",
    "This class is the stepping stone to writing a year-long senior thesis, so the strength is that it got me significantly closer. I went from no topic or idea to having a full-fledged topic, research question, hypothesis, research, and more questions."
