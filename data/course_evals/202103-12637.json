                "The literature is amazing and I will miss our class discussions! The paper prompts give you a lot of freedom to research/write about what you would like, and Prof. Habchi is very open to meeting and giving advice/feedback. The syllabus begins with three weeks of pretty in-depth theory (Sylvia Wynter's writing can be particularly hard to untangle), before getting into the literature. I think this is an intentional choice to have that grounding in theory, but I might suggest restructuring it so the theory weeks are evenly interspersed between, or alternating with, the literature weeks.",
                "1 novel a week is quick, so tradeoffs have to be made - workload is very manageable and professor habchi is REALLY supportive",

                "YES, absolutely take it! Great books, and whether or not your academic focus is on the Caribbean, it is such an important site from which to understand colonialism, diaspora, enslavement, racialization, and resistance. A lot of content on patriarchy/gender/queerness as well if you are interested in this. The only reason not to take it is if you do not feel like reading a book a week. I imagine that the course tends to attract people who are interested in thoughtful, collaborative discussion, and Prof. Habchi is great.",
                "If you are interested in diasporic studiesno matter how much you know about it, because I knew nothingand are able to commit to reading about a novel a week, then yes! If you don't think you'll have time to do the majority of the readings, I might not suggest the course because I think you will get a lot less out of it. (Class discussions are grounded in the literary texts, and in connecting them to the theory that we read at the beginning of the semester.) However, the books are WONDERFUL and there isn't an insane amount of work for the course beyond reading, so doing the reading is WORTH IT!",
                "Yes, I recommend this course!",
                "yes!! any class w prof. habchi",
                "I would, if you're interested this is a great introduction to the region through a variety of perspectives",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It has been one of my favorite classes at Yale so far. If you are interested in understanding the role literature has in teaching histories, then this is the course for you. Professor Habchi did a fabulous job grounding us in postcolonial and diasporic theory in preparation for later discussions, but she also did such a great job pointing out how each novel did its own kind of theorization. I took a lot out of this course because I was able to read all of the novels (one a week) in their entirety. If you are not able to put in the time to do so, then I might discourage one from taking it only because it may not be as impactful. I LOVED this class!!!",
