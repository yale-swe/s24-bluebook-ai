                "Strengths: broad scope, engaging readings and discussion",
                "Strengths: Covered a variety of topics to cater to many interests, informative lectures, great reading selections\r\nWeakness: None",
                "Readings are great.",
                "I wish we had talked more about Latinx history and less about high-level terms and definitions and literary analysis. I wanted to hear more about US involvement in Latin America and about the Chicanx movement, for example. At times this class felt like a class on literary analysis.",
                "THIS IS A GREAT CLASS! It's wonderfully designed and gives you a real preview into lots of interesting topics in Latinx Studies, allows you to explore based on your personal interests, and exposes you to cool ideas and figures you might not be aware of. A real strength in its design is that students who don't speak Spanish don't feel excluded. \r\n\r\nOne note: I would have love to revisit Latine characters from my Disney childhood in this class!",
                "This class is very accessible. Its concepts are not difficult to grasp, but that isn't to say that you have have profound moments of discovery along the way if you put in the work. It could be improved by some more cohesion between the weeks. While we can only cover so much ground between all of Latin America\/Latinx studies, it would be helpful to know why there's a focus on Mexico, Cuba, and Puerto Rico throughout the course. These nationalities may have the largest numbers of Latinx people, but I still wonder if more variety could be included in this respect.",
                "Strengths: The course covers such a wide array of topics.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes its hard to find the readings that Professor Laguna doesnt provide on Canvas.",
                "strengths - syllabus is well-structured with assignments, TAs are great, topics covered are great \r\nweaknesses - music unit should be integrated throughout the course or at the beginning rather than at the end, since more detailed knowledge of dembow\/reggae would have been helpful for some people who did assignment 1 based on music",
                "Strengths is that it is an interesting and engaging lecture. All of the readings are also very relevant. The final paper prompt was a little too broad however.",
                "No weaknesses. Strengths: engaging lectures, interesting and manageable assignments, helpful TAs, clear structure to class and chronology of lectures, etc.",
                "strengths: Professor Laguna, the set up of the course, the amount of support offered by TAs, the TAs themselves, the timing of the assignments, the engagement with the course \r\n\r\nweaknesses: none",
                "The strength of the course is the material. It is very interesting at times. I especially enjoyed the Disney movie and the presentation on Central America and  the social movements. The weaknesses of the course could be that some topics seem to deserve more time, but besides that, everything was great.",
                "Strength is that it is very engaging and offers a perspective we dont hear much. A weakness is that I think it focuses too much on Puerto Rico, and I wish there was more emphasis on other parts of Latin America. I understand it is a survey course, but one of the four days dedicated to Puerto Rico could have been a lecture on other regions.",
                "Strengths: lots of readings to thoroughly engage with each subject and get to know the literature around it. A good mix of fiction and nonfiction. Well-developed lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: slides or recordings of the lecture should have been sent out to everyone.",
                "The slides are crammed with information that is sometimes unnecessary.",
                "This was one of my favorite courses ever at Yale. It was incredibly human and engaging thanks to Professor Laguna, especially as a Latino student. The breadth of the course would make it very easy to feel like specificity and critical evaluation of any one subject was sacrificed, but Professor Laguna made every lecture feel detailed and rich.",
                "Strengths: Professor Laguna is an AMAZING lecturer. He always makes sure to be engaging in his lecture and includes a variety of ways of lecturing. Moreover, the readings for this course are super interesting and vary. \r\nWeaknesses: The one weakness I will say this course has was that sometimes some topics were quickly brushed over. I wish we were able to cover topics such as Central America and Brown Power for more than one or two classes. Additionally, I felt that the three books that were assigned to us to read were not all too effective and it would have been better to just assign a selected chapter.",
                "lectures should be recorded, ir slides should at least be posted.",
                "A strength is professor Laguna who is a prepared and great lecturer who makes the class a great intro course.",

                "Comprehensive history about Latinx contestations and political struggle",
                "Very engaging course especially with Albert Laguna!! My only gripe is that we didnt have access to the slides so it was difficult to organize what I have learned.",
                "One of the strengths of this course was the breadth of histories that we covered about the different communities under the Latinx umbrella. Although this came at the expense of the amount of time spent on each topic, it was a wonderful introduction to Latinx studies. I also loved that we got to read some literature and watch movies, in addition to reading journal articles.",
                "Strengths: It covers a wide range of topics, so there is something interesting for everyone. There is a good mix of materials to learn from, from ads to movies to personal essays.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The readings, especially towards the end of the semester, were long.",
                "Lecture classes provided a lot of information within a short period of time. The TA was helpful. The professor tried to make the classroom engaging by utilizing unique methods.",
                "I absolutely loved this class and nothing comes up when I am thinking of a critique. The course itself, however, does have many strengths.  The Professor consistently maintained the lecture's attention and it was an amazing course for Latinx-identifying students.  I also appreciate the course's use of sources outside literature and written work.",
                "Strengths: draws from a number of disciplines, great organization of class content",
                "It was very interesting and had a good pace.",
                "The biggest strength was definitely how smart Prof Laguna and the teaching staff were. They had so many interesting insights that even \"basic\" lectures were fascinating. I was always sad at the end of our 50 minute lectures because I just wanted to keep hearing what they had to say about the topic we were covering for that day. That kind of leads into a weakness, though. As a survey course, we covered a ton of different topics, but our lectures would seem a bit rushed since we only had 2 classes max to cover most topics. I can't really blame anyone for this but I do wish we could've had more time for the individual topics.",
                "This course is laid out perfectly from beginning to end and the lectures are neatly set up in chronological order. I enjoyed the historical context discussed within each class. We covered a lot of literature in the last few weeks and in the future, I would recommend spending more time on each piece rather than skimming over the literature.",
                "The books given to read were too long in the time frame given to do so.",
                "one strength -- sections; definitely give more time to deeply consider readings and context behind them as well as to look at other helpful materials such as music videos, interviews etc. I think offering even more suggested texts would also be helpful.\r\nweakness -- I think lectures could be a little more diverse in terms of regions. Though a survey course on Latinx history in the U.S., I was left wondering about the role (even if peripheral) of other Latin American groups within the U.S. outside the core four that seemed to be the focus of this course."

It might be a bit repetitive if you've taken lots of Latinx studies\/ER&M\/etc. classes, but even if you have you'll learn something new from this class  if not from a different perspective. Again, there's a focus on cultural productions that you might not get elsewhere from other Yale faculty.",

                "Take this class. Please. Especially if you are Latin American. I cannot recommend it enough, it was the highlight of my semester. One of the most fun classes you will ever take.",
                "YES!!! This course is so amazing and Professor Laguna is truly the best. Especially as a Latino, you get to learn so much more about the hidden ways that Latines have been marginalized and learn about movements of resistance as well. Overall, a class that you will not regret taking and it. has assignment that are not too hard.",

                "Absolutely!! It was an eye-opening experience taking this course and it was my first time learning about important topics such as the Puerto Rican debt crisis and the formation and criticism of labels such as Latino\/a, Latine, Latinx, etc. Definitely would consider!",
