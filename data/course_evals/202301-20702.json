                "This class was great in that it gave us lots of opportunities to practice speaking and talking through issues that were interesting to us. The homework online with automatic feedback was helpful for the more mechanical aspects of language learning, and I appreciated that that was kept for us to do on our own and in-class time was reserved for what is actually valuable to do with in-class time. \r\n\r\nI think we could spend more time practicing grammar and expressions in class and seeing ways in which they can be helpful\/useful to us in broadening the range of things we can say. Grammar mostly involved going over the homework assignments associated with the grammar, but those were relatively mechanical and I think we could be pushed more to actively use the expressions and constructions in new ways. I think that kind of targeted practice in addition to the more free-flowing general discussion in class would have been helpful. We got used to speaking in class, but I think it was easy for us to become complacent in our level of speaking and while we learned new vocab, we did not actively work that much at increasing the complexity, precision and accuracy of our speech.",
                "Sarab was lovely, always very kind and supportive. It's very much a course where you get out what you put in. If you do all the assigned work and study regularly outside of class, your Arabic will definitely improve.",
                "The daily homework was helpful but I felt like it should be more intentional in the future. Some exercises felt unnecessarily repetitive and simply time-consuming, without adding much in terms of learning."
