                "I improved a lot as a reader and writer of poetry. I learned more about distinct forms (e.g. villanelles) and how to listen for the sonic qualities of poems.",
                "I improved my creative writing skills and understanding of poetic forms in this course.",
                "I gained a greater awareness of the craft of poetry, both as a poet myself and a reader of poetry. The poems we brought in for each class exposed me to a wide variety of poetry in English that I may never have read if not for my fellow classmates. This class was the first time I had ever participated in a poetry workshop, or a workshop of any kind, and it showed me the powerand utilityof sharing poetry with a wider audience. It was also the first time I had ever revised a poem: a practice I will take more seriously now that I have seen what it can do to a poem (or any writing).",
                "I learned how to read poetry in a way that would allow me to use the techniques of experienced poets to enhance my own poetry.",
                "I learned so much about what goes into the craft of poetry and the elements that lead to successful poetry writing. Through the workshops my classmates helped me implement this into my own writing!",
                "I think this course definitely helped me to think about writing poetry in new and exciting ways. It allowed me to think more carefully about how to revise poetry but also how to think about form not just as a metrical form but as a way to find energy in writing towards and against the form itself. I find especially the exercises writing Sonnets and Sestinas to be extremely helpful at thinking of how a form itself can help break free the poet to think more creatively. So in terms of skill, these assignments allowed me to think about poetry in deeper ways, and to consider the process of revising poems to be absolutely fundamental. I found the set limit of writing 20 lines or under for poems to also be really helpful as far as writing, as well as reading poems and beginning to think syntactically about reading other poets. I found the workshops themselves to be extremely interesting and I felt that over the whole course I was able to improve my attention to detail and close reading when it comes to listening and analyzing the work of others. I felt that the course provided a really important insight into some poets whose work I hadn't heard before and the level of analysis into their poems informed the way I approached each workshop."

                "The structure of the course is excellent, the people lovely. The main issue is that it feels like we are learning to imitate poets, and not quite how to write our own poetry. I think it would help if the balance was a bit more towards overall writing technique (how to go about writing a poem, what to include/not include), and towards encouraging students in writing their own style.",
                "Strengths: self-guided reading, writing workshops every class, fun and warm atmosphere\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I only received feedback on poems I submitted to workshop, unless I scheduled a separate call with the professor, even though I was required to send her all of the poems I wrote during the class.",
                "The workshop section of the class worked very well to receive multiple perspectives and feedback on your work. Alongside bringing in weekly poems from other authors and your own writing, individual meetings helped with more individual, specialized critique.",
                "Honestly, no weaknesses in my mind. I enjoyed the structure of each person bringing in a poem for every class, talking about those poems, and then moving on to the workshops. If anything, I would have wanted more than the 3 hours we had to talk about poetry, but that speaks more to the class's strengths in encouraging an enthusiasm for poetry than any weakness.",
                "Strengths: well-adapted to be a Zoom/online course; student-driven lessons in which students chose which poetry to study; engaged and knowledgable professor\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes repetitive; sometimes only skimmed over certain poems and we weren't able to truly look at them in depth; some students felt slightly targeted by negative comments on their own writing just based on their writing style",
                "Strength: the small class size was elite. everyone got to workshop every week which was really special and we all grew very close. i also think this helped my writing improve immensely. Weakness: probably just that it was on Zoom, but even then Professor Zarin did a lot to make it feel more intimate even though our class only ever met through computer screens",
                "I think there were many strengths to the course. I thought that the idea of students bringing in poems each week from a set list of poets was a really helpful. I thought that having the workshop come after this worked really well. The assignment to work on a Sestina came quite early in the course and I think this was helpful at making people begin to consider form. I thought the workshop was run in a respectful and interesting way, that allowed everyone to feel they could participate. I thought the timing of the one on one sessions was handled really well. The only small weakness of this course was sometimes the fact it was online created a few sound issues for people being able to hear each other."

                "If you are at all interested in writing poetry, please take this class! Whether over the summer or during the academic year, this class is special. If you happen to have a good group of people in the workshop (like we did), then it will be even better. I came into this class with (1) no workshop experience, (2) no creative writing experience at Yale, and (3) no one every having read ANY of my poetry. It is such a wonderful opportunity for growth as a poet, as a reader of poetry, and as a participant in the creative process. Such a good class!",
                "Absolutely. I did not have much exposure to poetry before coming to this class and the way I think as a writer has completely changed because of it. I'm sure even for someone who has a lot of experience in poetry there is still something to gain from this class!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I think given it is taught so well and the workshops are run so expertly, it will make writers better writers and also give students who are not studying writing, a chance to think poetically. It helps introduce a student to many exciting poets and the analysis of their poems is masterful. I think especially with the size of the class and the way it is set up, there is a strong focus on everyone's voice being heard. I also felt that there was a very strong sense of learning to notice things about the world more carefully, which is a practice that has been very helpful to me in applying to other parts of my learning and writing."

I now have a working knowledge of poetry that will inform not only my future poetic writing but also my writing in general. I'm definitely thinking a lot more about how my writing sounds and the words I choose more generally which has absolutely improved my writing.",
                "One of the biggest things I learned in the class was to trust my own poetic images and sometimes there are lines that are not necessary, which are only there because I think I lacked some confidence in allowing those images to stand on their own. I realized this especially in a very helpful one on one we had, as well as the feedback in the workshops. The class also taught me how important it is to be taking classes such as these to practice my craft and learn more about poetry by reading poems. The course opened me up to several poets I hadn't read much before. I also felt the skills I learned in the class, especially clarity, form and the idea that everything in the poem needs to work together have been really helpful in terms of how I am approaching poetry going forward. I felt the workshops were extremely well structured and I felt so lucky to be part of such a great group of people, which I think has helped me to think about how I approach workshops going forward."
