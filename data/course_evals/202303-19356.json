                "I gained valuable insight on how to develop my writing process to craft a paper that I am proud of- Professor Vogel did an incredible job of formatting the three papers in the course to each target a specific skill of paper writing (how to revise, how to build conversation with primary sources, how to understand and comment on scholarly sources) to prepare me for writing papers not only in this class, but in my other courses as well."

                "The strength was Prof. Vogel's \"lectures.\" It's a seminar, but Prof. Vogel uses thorough slides to offer interesting background knowledge. I found the slides to be engaging (even if, at times, they limited the scope of conversation). The weakness: the class was too big. With 20 students, my section was a little too large to have free-flowing discussion.",
                "One strength is that the course covers a wide timeline of American Literature while also delving deep into specific writers and their works. Additionally, the authors come frrom diverse backgrounds and utilize distinct styles.",
                "The readings for this class were the perfect length and the selection excellent. The assignments were superbly designed to improve essential writing skills- I loved the transition from close reading, to reading with a historical text, to reading with literary criticism.",
                "Professor Vogel was great in guiding us through the readings and the assignments.",
                "Strengths: Professor Vogel's syllabus was incredibly well-tailored, and his assignments were well-organized so the material flowed well, and I genuinely enjoyed the course's readings. The in-class powerpoints to help contextualize our readings were also very helpful, especially in helping us to develop our close-reading skills by analyzing specific portions of the text."

                "Yes absolutely. The professor was great and formed close relationships with us and provided great feedback. The readings were well selected and the assignments helped us improve our writing skills while also educating us on American history.",
                "With Professor Vogel, absolutely yes! This course is a great introduction to the American literary canon, and Professor Vogel's syllabus is specifically tailored to analyze key themes and aspects that helped develop an \"American Identity\" (oneself vs. the whole, Blackness, self-identity). Overall, this is a really great course for both English majors and non-humanities."
