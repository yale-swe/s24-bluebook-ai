                "This course could be improved if Professor Collins moderated the class discussions just a little bit more. This is not always necessary, but sometimes I felt like as a class we would go in circles or get a little bit off track. So, if Professor Collins had some conclusions that he wanted us to reach through discussion and then guided us to get there, I think that would be great",
                "No weaknesses- the best seminar I've taken at Yale. The readings were engaging and very manageable, which meant that all the students actually did the readings. Since everyone actually read the course material and didn't have to phone it in during discussions, there were always extremely engaging conversations about the material. The assignments were manageable, and the professor gave amazing feedback.",
                "Well-researched and well-conceived course with many key landmark cases. Theoretical foundations (Locke, Kant, utilitarianism) were weaker but probably unnecessary for the goals of the course. Section was too big, some people did not speak or participate. Too much reading. Material tested on in the midterm examination was unhelpful, there should have been more essay writing spread throughout the course.",
                "Strengths: class was organized extremely well, the Supreme Court cases were very interesting and thought-provoking, discussions were well moderated, and readings were a decent amount\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this class is definitely for those who are well-spoken and good at defending their arguments, many times it was scary to have to back up your opinion against students who are a part of mock trial orgs and such. Professor Collins did a great job at moderating, but sometimes it was still very intimidating to have casual debates in class",
                "Manageable reading load that felt both necessary and relevant, very interesting class discussions, could be improved by more structure in the discussions so that individual students don't get carried away",
                "Interesting material. Was difficult to participate in class if you do not enjoy debating.",

                "Yes! If you like con law, take this class. Specifically, if you have already taken con law with Akhil Amar then you will get a lot out of this class. If you haven't then this class might be a little harder. There are a lot of constitutional law concepts you learn in detail in Amar's class that are useful in this class but aren't explained as thoroughly. All in all, though, yes, take this class. Professor Collins is great and so passionate and he really cares about his students",
                "Absolutely",
                "Absolutely- if you have any interest in constitutional law, then this class is a must take.",
                "A good introduction to constitutional law. Give yourself extra time to do the readings.",
                "Yes, this is a great overview of constitutional law and economic liberties, and thinking about how the courts should or should not regulate economic liberties in favor of equality. I was able to learn so much about how the courts function!",
                "Highly recommend, Professor Collins is an amazing instructor and the material is very relevant and interesting. If you're at all interested in going to law school, this is a much more intimate and discussion-friendly course than a law school course. The emphasis is not as heavy on ethical theories as other EP&E courses, however, so keep that in mind.",
                "Yes. I enjoyed it.",
                "I definitely would! I learned so much about Supreme Court jurisprudence. What I loved about this class is that you engage so directly with the actual Supreme Court opinions and dissentsand then you judge for yourself which side is correct. Pretty much everybody does the readings, which makes class discussion more interesting and engaging. The class has a higher workload (and tougher grading) than many other seminars, but I'd say it's certainly worth it."
