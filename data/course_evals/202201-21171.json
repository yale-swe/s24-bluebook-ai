                "I learned a lot a bot the inner working between words and pictures in art forms. Throughout the course of the semester we talked about a lot of different ideas regarding the specific ways art is presented and why choices are made in the visual representation of the piece, but also how words can be sprinkled in to accentuate the meaning. I also learned how I could incorporate these ideas into my own pieces and sort of develop my own artistic abilities to help share my thoughts and feeligns",
                "Helps you analyze works of art, and related readings analytically.",
                "The readings for this class helped me gain useful knowledge when it comes to graphic art and designwhether that is understanding the general nuanced relationship between words and pictures, or the technicality of color, composition, and space. Beyond the actual course content, creating my own works of art was insightful in my own journey as an artist, student and thinker. Through the art assignments, I believe I grew in my ability to think creatively and meaningfully.",
                "I have a very thorough perspective on the relationship between words and pictures from ancient art to modern comic books, zines, graphic novels, etc. I understand how words can become pictures and have a better sense of how to emit feeling in art through visual structure, medium choice, etc. I understand why certain artistic choices are impactful.",
                "How words and pictures intersect, are similar and different, and are portrayed in media.",
                "I developed a keen sense in noticing the relationship between words and picture, and form and image. As an artist, I also grew in productivity and efficiency."

                "I like how every week we talk about something either we create or we read about and it is a very fun and chill environment to discuss something full of depth and meaning. I think the course can be improved by sort of connecting the readings better to some of the assignments in terms of applying some of the things we learn in the readings clearly to some assignments.",
                "The professor and TA are very understanding and will accommodate you if you are unable to attend or if you have an inconvenience.",
                "This class was way too long. There is no reason for it to be an hour and 50 minutes. I believe it can be a 50 minute class, 1 hour and 15 minute MAX. Class discussions on the readings dragged and lectures for basically two hours put half the class to sleep.",
                "I think it would have been easier to be fully immersed in the course had we started with a graphic novel unit since those are more intellectually accessible to those with little experience with art. I also think the course did not need to be 2 hours twice a week and could have succeeded as maybe a 90 minute twice a week course. Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this class. Conversations were interesting and so was the course material. The projects were incredibly fun and diverse enough that I felt I was able to find what I naturally gravitated towards making throughout the semester and found my niche as an artist.",
                "Strengths was the ability to make multimedia art\r\n\r\nWeaknesses was that the class felt too long sometimes. It could have been effective at a somewhat shorter length.",
                "The weaknesses of the course is the close proximity in due dates and student engagement. I often found myself rushing or staying up late to finish an assignment even though I started it once it was assigned. As for student engagement, the majority of the class was very silent when it came to contributing in the seminar and critique parts of the course."

                "Yes. It is an amazing chill class where I had the opportunity to learn more about art and be able to now appreciate more the depth and beauty it has to offer. I learned that each piece sort of has its own story to it and the way the artists present these pieces is so complex but intriguing and I feel this is something essential to enjoying life and to not just go through it so focused on getting into a good law school or postdoc program or having a good job but being able to appreciate the things around you and find joy in that. Art is one of those ways to connect through time and space and I feel grateful to have further explored this connection.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are truly interested in participating in the discussions about the readings, peer reviews, and artworks. This course does take up quite a bit of time for readings and assignments, so just make sure you are able to dedicate the necessary amount of time to complete everything you have to do that week.",
                "If a student is looking for an easier, creative outlet type of class then yes, but if they are looking to be really engaged and excited by the professor or content, I would simply recommend picking and choosing some of the readings and not taking the class at all.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in making art, I absolutely loved this class and felt that opinion and intention were valued over technique and this made it very welcoming to people wanting to get a better perspective on art in general.",
                "Yes! It forces you to be creative weekly with dynamic project prompts and student critiques.",
                "Yes, it's a super fun and encouraging art class for students of all majors.",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if the other students in the course were committed to participating and giving constructive feedback to their work."
