                "The course is very well-designed. I liked the variety in methods and subjects of study and the variety in assignment type as well.",
                "Strength is !! She is a very kind and engaged teacher and more than happy to get to know you\/help you outside of class too",
                "This is a fun and flexible class, and it is designed for students to learn the skills and vocabulary that are most useful to them.  The class built a really strong community, and that really enhanced our cohesion and learning experience.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lee! She's an amazing and caring professor and does an excellent job of creating a welcoming environment. I liked the organization and structure of the class- with a new K-pop song we would learn new grammar and vocabulary. I also thought the assignments and quizzes really helped us practice what we learned and apply our new skills. It was also really nice to have weekly clinics\/tutoring where we could practice our speaking with a TA.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "No weaknesses! Kind and understanding instructor who is willing to help you meet your goals alongside a welcoming classroom environment makes for a wonderful learning experience.",
                "Strengths - a lot of speaking practice, excellent professor, interesting way to learn Korean through reading kpop lyrics\r\nWeakness - the workload was too low, so I didn't learn that much outside of class.",
                "I loved this courseI found it very engaging and was motivated to learn.",
                "The course is practical and fun, incorporating lots of different assignments, learning materials, and content infused with Korean pop culture. The course environment was warm, encouraging, and flexible, with lots of opportunity for speaking. A weakness might be the relative lack of structured in-class review to go over the concepts and vocabulary from previous lessons. I think something likes a short, ungraded review quiz on the vocabulary\/grammar patterns at the beginning of class might have helped to encourage retention!"

                "Yes! If you want to learn how to speak and write and think more creatively in Korean, I strongly recommend!",
                "Yes! Absolutely take this course. The professor is among the best at Yale, you get to become good friends with all your classmates, and there are a lot of opportunities to practice speaking Korean.",
                "Yes definitely! It is a great classroom environment and I learned quickly.",
                "The course is a lovely way for students with a strong basic grasp of Korean to color in their vocabulary and understanding with new expressions and ideas, especially for those with an interest in Korean pop culture. Lee Ssn's enthusiasm and personalized passion for student learning pairs wonderfully with the course's ethos of healthy, natural learning."
