Also, hearing from people in industry was also great, as it provided another perspective on what biomedical engineers do outside of academia. Finally, this class offered a great opportunity to reflect on my own goals and consider why I really want to pursue biomedical engineering as a major.",

                "The speakers were all very informative and helpful. The array of topics chosen was diverse and addressed multiple interests in the class. The virtual format was a slight weakness, and I'm sure it would have been even more engaging in person.",
                "There was a lot of great guest speakers and upperclassmen involvement which was great.",
                "The strength of this course is Professor Miller-Jensen herself. She was open to providing her incite and guidance to all who asked!",
                "This course brought in a lot of expertise throughout the BME world and I found it to be very insightful.\r\n\r\nThe projects we did in class were appropriately challenging as well, given the nature of the course. \r\n\r\nIncluding student panels about research and internships was also a great segment.\r\n\r\nAs an addition to the course, I would include a panel on first jobs out of undergrad and a panel about graduate school opportunities. There is a lot I am curious about that I didnt get to learn in this seminar.",
                "This class does a great job of incorporating various types of insights such as bme professors, students currently pursuing a degree in bme, students who have started bme ventures, bme proffesionals in industry, and more.",
                "There wasnt always a universal structure to the guest lecture, but many were very engaging and informative.",
                "The assignments could use more direction. I struggled with the group project as others were not engaged as I was, so it was a struggle.",
                "The strengths of the course was that it was not a stressful class and it was an introductory of showing the diversity of BME.",
                "One strength of this course is that the assignments were not very challenging, yet offered good opportunities to self-reflect on what interests us about biomedical engineering. Also, I really enjoyed having the different speakers come and talk to us about their work, as in my other classes it is often hard to connect course concepts with real world translation of biomedical technology. I do not have any weaknesses to list, as the flexibility of this course actually benefited me a lot. This is because I was able to take the time to consider why I am choosing BME and also consider some potential career paths that I can pursue using this major.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I would have liked to seen is more information about the non-traditional career paths that Yale BME grads follow (for example, consulting, finance, law\/medicine, etc.). It was nice to hear about research and industry, however as a pre-med student also considering other career paths such as consulting, I would have liked to hear more from past students who chose a job that the typical BME major does not take up.",
                "There is a low course load and the speakers were engaging. One thought would be to move this earlier in students' careers, starting in freshman spring perhaps, so students have more time to decide what they wish to purse in undergrad.",
                "I really liked the guest speakers. One that stuck out included Prof. Campbell who's presentation was amazing because he took his project all the way from one patient to a commercialized lab technique. Another was 3Derm which was inspiring because of how well spoken Liz was and of course since it's a Yale startup story. A weakness was that I don't think we as students engaged with the speakers as much as we would have if we were in person. It's also a bit of a setting the tone kind of thing where after the first couple classes it became a set routine that only one student would ask questions and everyone else would stay silent. Really getting people to engage on the first couple days could be a way to set the standard for the rest of the term.",
                "The course is strong in that it allows students to gauge their interest in biomedical engineering and discover whether this major is the right one for them. Another point that is both a strength and weakness of the course is that the level of engagement is pretty low, so depending on what you prefer, this may be an issue.",
                "The Q&A panels were very great  I enjoyed them the most. The pre-class questions were helpful in making sure that we had a little introduction to what was going to be talked about that day",
                "I enjoyed the format of this course. There would be guest speakers almost every seminar, which gave really fun and helpful lectures in terms of their field. I learned alot!"

Whether you're a BME major and have to take it or if you're simply interested in the field, it's a great overview of biomedical engineering and very helpful in deciding what areas of BME are most interesting to you. Also, it's a fairly low-stress environment with only a few major assignments throughout the semester, so if you're taking a heavy load, don't sweat also taking BENG 280.",

It shows you not only professionals in this field, but also are exposed to older students who tell you more about the major as you move through college, and as well as tips for internships\/labs\/ etc. which are super useful! also helps you network with older students and professors\/professionals!"
