                "The teaching team was fantastic! They were super accessible and easy to talk to, but I feel like they did little to accommodate other time zones in terms of office hour times. This is obviously a COVID concern, and hopefully will not be a concern in future semesters. Other than that, all the TFs and instructors were awesome. I loved the set up of quizzes and homeworks and it made the whole course very manageable and stress-free.",
                "The videos were good and so were the discussions. The final project could be communicated better.",
                "Strengths - the dropped discussion section, homework, and quiz grade. those really came in clutch. additionally, having an open note policy for all the quizzes was so nice. the embedded quizzes and due dates for the lectures motivated me to actually watch them on time and pay attention. having the slides printable was also helpful. \r\nWeaknesses - having the benchmark and pset due the same day. I'd suggest having one due on friday and the other due on Saturday. other than that, I can't really think of any other weaknesses.",
                "Strength: Personal project\r\nWeakness: No professor live classes",
                "I feel like the course set up was effective and beneficial to me because it gave me flexibility when I wanted to watch the lectures if I was particularly busy one day. I feel like the way the final project was set up was helpful as well and made sure we were not flooded by work at the end of the course.",
                "Weaknesses are that the lectures are asynchronous, it was difficult to stay engaged. Strengths: the peer tutors' office hours really helped a lot with understanding the concepts and reviewing material for the quiz!",
                "The course was very interesting and I thoroughly enjoyed the material and instructors. I would not improve anything as there were plenty of resources that students could utility to succeed.",
                "The lectures were really good, although they did seem to run long all together.",
                "Outstanding course overall! We should still be able to place out - I personally did not learn anything new",
                "I really liked how neatly planned the course structure was and how many resources there were to prepare.",
                "This course overall is very strong. The quizzes were conceptual, so studying for them helped to grasp the concepts that I couldn't simply gain from a textbook reading. Also, the enrichment sections held by Prof Loreng went a long way in helping me cement my knowledge.",
                "Introduction made sure no one fell behind",
                "The later lectures with professor kabeche were confusing",
                "I thought lectures and sets and discussion were quite good. I was disappointed in the final project not be clearly tied into the course at all points and teh lack of mentorship I got.",

                "Strengths - the course was very well-organised, accessible and interesting. \r\nWeaknesses - I wish the course had spent time on photosynthesis and cell respiration, two important biochemical processes",

                "good.",
                "Strengths: Low-stress environment. Got to watch videos on own time. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The quiz questions are obscure and stray away from scientific convention to prove youre a scientist who truly understands the concept. There have been times where the quizzes flaunted questions that were the OPPOSITE of normal convention. Another issue is the faux focus on explanation and open-ended quiz questions. Several questions on the quizzes are multiple choice with little recourse for partial credit. Very few of the questions end up being explanation based.",
                "The strengths of the course were that it was organized and material was always easily accessible. A weakness is that there were so many deadlines that made everything more confusing.",
                "It did everything as asynchronously as possible, but included a lot of menial, busywork.",
                "Of course, there is always the difficulty of online recorded formats being daunting to get through each week. However, this was not a serious issue with BIOL 101. The lecturers are constructed in such a way that they were fairly easy to follow.",
                "Strengths: I think that the bulk of professors for this course (especially Prof. Koelle who was my favorite!) were extremely knowledgeable and always willing to help students out. The recorded lecture format was very accessible to work at my own pace, and the lessons were very smooth and well-explained. I also think that there were a tremendous amount of opportunities to improve grades for this course through assignments other than quizzes!\r\nWeaknesses: Firstly, the information, modules, videos, PSETS, benchmarks, and files were FAR too all over the place compared to my other courses  some centralization would be appreciated. While I appreciated the vast array of professors, I think it made the lectures incredibly inconsistent, and thus, I would say that having 4 professors was actually a weakness for this course. Additionally, not all professors were created equally, obviously, so some were definitely kinder and more willing to admit mistakes than others. Also, the workload for this course, along with most .5 credit courses at Yale, was FAR too much for credit we received. The final project seemed a little like busy work, but not having an exam was certainly preferable, so I really cannot complain about that. And lastly, there always seemed to be a problem with the synchronous quizzes, which was incredibly frustrating.",
                "Strengths: course content is well-structured and taught very effectively, and the final project was a neat way to apply what we were learning each week. I also found the enrichment to be a very helpful resource.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the weekly quizzes often included technical difficulties and the questions themselves were confusing / worded weirdly.",
                "Strengths: Engaging discussion sections, organized course structure",
                "Strengths: Great support system from TAs/TFs and Profs for an intro level bio course.\r\nWeaknesses: For students with absolutely no background in bio, this course is not as beginner-friendly as it is fast paced and sometimes assumes prior knowledge of some bio terminologies.",
                "The benchmark aspect and final project focusing on associating the concepts learned to a protein was amazing! Do not change that!",
                "I really liked the study guides provided to us. I also thought the lectures and lecture slides were formatted very well and each topic led into another smoothly. However, I believe that the problem sets could be slightly more difficult to better prepare me for the quizzes.",
                "Weaknesses - final project wasn't really engaging, would have appreciated more guidance reading the landmark papers; Strengths - appreciated Michael, Leah, and Lilian as lecturers",
                "Strengths: Word limits on PSETs, accessibility of peer tutors and TFs, live discussion sections, low emphasis on grades (easy to do well and learn)\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it would be difficult to maintain focus during recorded lectures.",
                "Strengths: extremely well organized and well paced. No major weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: There are many components to your grade, and nothing is graded too harshly, so you do not need to stress over your grade. This makes it much easier to focus on understanding and learning the content. The fact that there were assignments/quizzes every week also helped ensure that I did not fall behind in content and paid attention to the content. Weaknesses: None considering that this is was done in a virtual format.",
                "The course had a lot of interesting content and was taught well. A weakness could be how the homework and quiz questions were written, sometimes they were just confusing due to wording and a lack of clarity of what is being asked, not the content being asked about.",
                "I think that the recorded lecture format is obviously not ideal, but considering the short term nature of the pandemic, it worked out well. I think the 10pm Saturday due dates were somewhat strange, as it made it somewhat hard to",
                "Strengths included the recorded the recorded lectures that included understanding questions. The questions in the recordings made lectures more engaging. Also enjoyed the help of the mentor who assisted with the final project. No major weaknesses.",
                "A strength of the class was the flexibility. I was able to watch the pre-recorded lectures on my own time. Also, the homework help sessions on Thursday were very helpful.",
                "The lectures are very well explained, I really enjoyed this class.",
                "Strengths include mini quizzes at the end of lectures to reflect on the content that was covered, there were also collaboration study halls where students would work together alongside help from the TAs to ask questions about the psets.\r\nWeaknesses include little explanations on quizzes as to why certain answers were right especially on the multiple choices portions of the quiz.\r\nThis course could be improved by (if time allows it) possibly going over missed questions on discussion section to understand why a certain answer is correct or not.",
                "The strengths of this course were the preciseness of the content provided in lecture, which helped the student's understanding of topics in biochemistry and biophysics, ranging from easy to difficult topics. The homework problems and final project, including the benchmarks, supplemented learning in lecture, and helped improve student's performance on quizzes. One of the weakness of this course was the discrepancies between the teaching of the various instructors, as well as the lack of a clear grading policy, which should have been presented in the syllabus.",
                "I loved the organization of the lectures and the discussion sections. The amount of effort put into the weekly to-do list was amazing.",
                "Strengths: The checklist each week made it super easy to see exactly what you had to do, and the workload was pretty light, maybe 5 hours a week plus lectures. The quizzes and homework were also pretty easy if you watched the lectures (even if you didn't do the textbook readings), and they didn't have gotcha questions. Not having a final was also nice. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Writing the short essays for the final project was a drag, and it took a while for them to give feedback on homework. You also didn't have much interaction with instructors unless you explicitly sought it out. Sections were boring and didn't really help you learn the material.",
                "Good considering the online format. A clearer guideline for the final project would be nice, although it was graded very leniently.",
                "The strengths of the course are ease of understanding, availability for support, and applicability of the knowledge (Especially during this pandemic). The weaknesses would mainly be attributed to the online format of the course.",
                "Strengths: very straightforward lectures and collaborative \r\nWeaknesses: p-sets due at 10pm on Saturday inconvenient, wording on quizzes were sometimes confusing",
                "The course was very well organized, with \"modules\" that clearly outlined everything expected. The main weakness was the absence of almost any contact/communication between instructors and students.",
                "The recorded lectures were sometimes hard to follow.",
                "Since all the lectures were pre-recorded last term, it would have been helpful if the professors had released all of them and allowed us to work through them at our own pace. The lectures were released on Monday and we had to finish watching them on Wednesday, which gave us fewer options for spreading out the work than if we were able to work ahead (or even had the weekend to start watching them).\r\n\r\nThe word limits for the short answer responses on quizzes were sometimes quite restrictive. While I agree that the ability to explain a concept concisely can be a sign of true understanding, the 30-50 word limits meant that I often spent far more time cutting down my answers than thinking about the actual concepts. It became an exercise in tweaking sentence structure, which seemed less valuable to me than the content of my answer. It was also a strange that the sample answers were often far longer to the allocated word limit.",
                "The course was very organized and what we had to do was always clearly written down. The TAs were really strong and I felt that the material in the discussion section was helpful and not a waste of time.",
                "Although this is largely due to the nature of online classes, one weakness of this course was that the recorded lectures were rather unengaging. A strength of these lectures was the embedded quizzes at the end. I thought the integration of reading scientific papers that related to what we were learning was quite a strength. The discussion sections that revolved around these papers were the most engaging to me, as there was significantly more discussion and engagement by students.",
                "Nothing. Everything was great for the most part.",
                "The final project was a huge strength, I really enjoyed it and it was a great way to apply what we learned to a new topic",
                "recorded lectures could be more engaging, would have been nice to present our final project to our discussion section",
                "The lectures were released on Monday and due by the end of Wednesday of the same week, which was usually enough time to complete the lectures but it might have been nice for workload management if the lectures were released during the weekend. \r\nThe final project was a fun way to learn more about a specific protein and really apply the concepts learned from lectures while also digging into other people's research.",
                "I think this course was very well organized. I really enjoyed the material. My only complaints were that (a) Instructor Kabeche presented in a way that felt very confusing to me as she seemed lost in lectures and (b) I wish there was a more consistent format on how to write our Benchmarks as I felt there was a lot of guesswork on the students since each TA graded each assignment differently.",
                "I liked that we could watch the lectures on our own time.",
                "The quality of education seemed very different for each professor. I felt that some important topics were glossed over very quickly.",
                "The course wasn't as engaging as I would have liked (possibly because of the virtual format)--it accelerated a little too quickly and very often the weekly quizzes left me in confusion.  I struggled to study, largely because the class placed such an emphasis on general key concepts yet tested me on so much minutia.",
                "Strengths: great lectures; Weaknesses: not a lot of peer-to-peer interaction",
                "It's tough with remote learning but more engagement is always appreciated. I really think it was a well taught course though.",
                "The entire teaching team is so helpful and this course provides a great introduction to complex biological topics. Also, the course was focused on teaching rather than grading which was so important to me. Also preparing the final project was a challenging yet fulfilling experience.",
                "The course lectures were super clear and organized, and the quizzes were very good assessments of the lecture material. A very fair and organized course overall.",
                "A strength was that the modules were rather well thought-out. However, I wish there had been more synchronous engagement times with the professors of the course.",
                "This course was phenomenally adapted to the virtual format. The weekly synchronous quizzes ensured that students were still learning the material while the transition of the final exam to a final project alleviated stress for students. The discussion sections each week were also a good \"check-in\" point that helped to make sure all students were still on track. This class provided immense amounts of student support and accommodation.",
                "Weekly quizzes are great because they push students to keep up with the material! Benchmarks for final project could get redundant at times.",
                "The strengths of course is that with pre-recorded lectures it allows you to pace yourself each week as to when you watch the lectures to learn the information. While the course was recorded lectures, there were still synchronous Zoom oppportunities to interact with the professors and ask questions. The only weakness was that I felt some weeks the lectures were very long and draining to watch, not being in a class-setting, which made it a little more difficult to fully learn the information.",
                "Many quiz questions had word limits that were way to short (30 words) to convey an answer in full which was difficult to do. The sample answers themselves were over the limit.",
                "this course was set up very nicely",
                "I think that this course can provide more ways for everyone to participate in discussion section--sometimes it was just one person from a group who was able to talk. One strength was that there was support on ed discussion.",
                "The class is really well organized. There is a weekly schedule that almost never changes, so it is really easy to develop a study/work routine. \r\n\r\nThere is variety in how the different professors explain things or would like the students to explain things in our homeworks, which led to some discrepancies.",
                "Remote format discouraged engagement and investment. Course was very watered-down",
                "I found this class to be significantly better than I was expecting.  Strengths are that the recorded lecture videos were well-structured and content was generally explained clearly.  Although teaching styles varied, I sort of enjoyed seeing different professors in each video.  The final project, although it took up a lot of time, pushed me to think more about the ways in which Bio 101 concepts relate to the world around us.  I appreciated the option to choose our own proteins of interest.  For example, I am not much interested in human/cell biology, so I did my project on biodegradable plastic, a topic that aligns more closely with my intended field of study.  Also, I appreciated the weekly quiz format instead of having a midterm and/or final.  It allowed me to synthesize much more information without being stressed about memorization.  Weaknesses weren't significant, but I wish that some of the quiz questions were more clear and that not as much readings were assigned (watching lectures + discussion section + textbook readings + paper readings + problem sets + weekly project benchmarks + studying for the quiz took up a lot of time each week).",
                "I very much enjoyed the discussion sections, where professor Loreng was very good at keeping us engaged and keeping the content light and interesting.",
                "The strengths of this course were the detailed lectures.\r\n\r\nOne weakness in this course could be the lack of information on the upcoming quiz. Maybe a small heads up on what would be on the next quiz would allow students to understand what they should focus on.",
                "One strength of the course is that being asynchronous makes it more accessible for those in different time zones. I think that this course would benefit from having explanations to answers in the quiz so that students can understand their potential shortcomings.",
                "This course was very engaging and had very easy to follow lectures that were a good length. The discussion sections found ways to apply what was being learned in lectures and applying it to real life research. The final project was also very fun in that it was nice to research something of interest while finding ways to apply lecture content.",
                "I personally really enjoyed the format of the course because I learn best at my own pace. Even though all of the material was learned through pre-recorded lectures, the discussion section provided a balanced amount of engagement for the course. The grading and formatting was very reasonable, despite having so many people taking the course.",
                "Within the context of this year's learning environment, a strength in the course was the prerecorded lectures. It meant that we could watch them on our time and at our own pace, and if we missed anything that one of the lecturers said, we could rewind and watch the lecture again. I also think the introduction to scientific literature was a helpful component, but it might have been more useful to read through more contemporary literature that does follow the modern standard format. There were not many glaring weaknesses to this course. I think that some more enrichment content throughout the recorded lectures would have been nice in breaking up the monotony of the lectures. I believe the largest weakness to this course was the strict word limits to some of the quiz questions. While I understand the need for a word limit, the limit was often so strict that I could not get my ideas properly expressed, and I think that the word limits should be more expanded for next year's quizzes.",
                "I liked the online forum where we could ask questions. That was very helpful. Also taking quizzes that were ungraded helped me learn."

                "The splitting up of lectures was great: 2 hr long continuous lectures would have been much worse.",

                "The lectures were great, I really enjoyed the psets and the final project, and I felt the professors did a great job with respect to virtual engagement.",
                "The course was perfectly geared for learning during COVID-19",

                "more engaging activities",
                "The recorded lectures worked well (and I prefer that format to the live lectures that are recorded for people who cannot attend). It allowed me to pause and rewind when content was difficult and speed it up when the topic was pretty simple. I also appreciated the synchronous weekly quizzes. The fact that I had to take them during a certain period forced me to prepare for them well in advance and helped me create a routine for doing biology (asynchronous work can sometimes be hard to schedule). I also appreciated that for these quizzes we had a zoom we could join if there was an issue but didn't need to be on zoom, that worked nicely and meant I could start the quiz a little later if I needed to.",
                "I appreciated the asynchronous offerings and embedded quiz questions",
                "I think that this course worked well through the remote format. Given that everything was asynchronous, it makes it very accessible to everyone in different time zones.",
                "The asynchronous lectures were good, but only making them available 2 days before the lecture quizzes were due was not; since they were pre-recorded, they could have been released earlier and students like me who like to get their work done in the weekend before it is due and have a very busy lecture schedule from Mon-Wed would not be penalized.",
                "I think breaking out into breakout rooms during discussion section was incredibly useful, as it allowed me to have more interaction with my peers, and be able to learn from them. That said, the topics of discussions section were less useful to the topics at hand, in my opinion. I think that the virtual lectures that were pre-recorded were made well, but not having a live lecture does limit engagement with the material to some degree.",
                "The hybrid between recorded lectures and synchronous discussion sections was very effective during this time. Also, we had a small unit on the biochemistry and biochemistry of  SARS-CoV-2 which was really interesting.",

The quizzes at the end were really nice to figure out what should have stuck after the lesson and good to see if I actually retained  the concepts spoken about.",

                "Really appreciated the prerecorded lectures and open-note quizzes",
                "The course directors utilized a wide range of technological functions (such as embedded lecture miniquizzes), which made the learning process very engaging. There is not much more that could have been done to improve course practices in the context of virtual engagement.",

                "I think this class was very well-formatted, and would not say anything needed to be changed.",
                "Practices that succeeded were the weekly pset collaboration study halls where students could work together and ask questions to TAs which allowed for more engagement with the material. However sometimes the psets would be due before discussion section in which most students weren't able to collaborate on those psets sor maybe take into consideration timing and possibly making the zoom a bit earlier in the week for those weeks.",
                "The recorded lectures were successful, and they allowed students to watch the lectures and complete the embedded quizzes on their own time. This was especially helpful for students in different time zones, which might have prevented them from taking the course, if the lectures had not been recorded. The live virtual discussion section was a great practice that allowed for virtual engagement, and it was my favorite part of the course.",

Correcting errors in the automatic transcription (especially for the biology terms) would also be nice. Also, it was frustrating that the instructors didn't bother updating the lectures for the unit on Covid-19 -- the rest of the class is recorded, couldn't they take the time to use the most current information? \r\n\r\nThe material covered in sections felt pretty basic, and it felt like we were just rehashing information most of the time. Making section more productive would be nice.",

                "Unsure of how a normal year looks like, I believe this course did an amazing job trying to compensate for the lack of in person classes. The biggest problem I had was not being able to get to know my professors.",

                "I preferred it when my discussion section assigned a present for each break out room; that helped ensure that everyone was participating.",
                "I think that the recorded lecture and mini quiz format was a good way of learning the material and ensuring we were paying attention to the lectures. The quizzes were difficult but I think for the most part were fair (except the word limit was way too short for answering a lot of the questions). The one-on-one benchmark meetings were very helpful and I would recommend continuing that.",
                "The recorded lectures could definitely be improved. It may be more engaging if the embedded quizzes were throughout the lecture. The quizzes were set up well. I appreciated that I did not have to sit in a Zoom room while taking them but was still able to pop into a Zoom room if I had any questions.",

                "The prerecorded lectures and chunk of time for the weekly quizzes mostly allowed students to work off their own schedules.",
                "I would have preferred online lectures as I feel they would've helped me remain more committed to the material. Also, I don't like that we had weekly quizzes on assigned lecture times because it made it more difficult to assign time to watch the lectures.",
                "The recorded lectures",
                "I wish I could have an longer official planning session with my mentor for the key concepts in the final project. I wish to have some more help with learning how to read scientific texts that are more recent.",
                "The lecture format was very tedious, adding hours of extra screen time to my weekly workload.",

                "Lots of office hours and other contact time.",
                "I liked the final project style with the benchmarks. It made the writing process easier and better since we got feedback at each stage of our project. I also liked meeting with the TFs about the project, they were very helpful. The other elements of the course including the quizzes and homework were doable as well. I think I prefer this much more over a final exam. I also feel like I actually learned something tangible, like writing a scientific paper about a protein that can be applied in the future. Overall, I think this was a good course during the pandemic.",
                "The recording lectures were helpful but they were sometimes really long. In order to increase virtual engagement, I feel like some of those long lectures could be replaced by more synchronous components.",
                "The recorded lectures were very structured -- I always knew what to expect. The weekly discussion sections also added a nice synchronous element to the class.",
                "Almost all of the practices designed for the COVID-19 virtual-class format succeeded. The only recommendation I would have is to ensure that quizzes are running and functional before the designated quiz day. Other than that, though, this class was great and a wonderful educational experience.",
                "The discussion sections and other opportunities to interact with professors for questions were successful in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic as they paired nicley with the pre-recorded lectures. The online synchronous quizzes could be improved as sometimes it was difficult to be able to ask the professor questions within the time slot for the exam as there was a wait with many students seeking to ask questions.",
                "I think the recorded lectures were pretty engaging and the quizess helped me pay attention. However, I think the quizzes could be improved in how they were not running smoothly.",
                "Pre-recorded mini lectures made learning more convenient as we could view them on our own time. Enrichment sessions, peer tutoring, and office hours were also well done and very helpful. There is not much, in my opinion, that could be improved.",
                "Having real-time remote lectures instead of recorded lectures",
                "The recorded lectures helped because students could go through them at their own pace and schedule and go back to topics they were confused on.  I also appreciated the live enrichment sections.  Nothing I can suggest to improve!",
                "I think having everything asynchronous was nice, but it was kind of a challenge keeping up with everything entirely on my own while having to live at home for school.",
                "I enjoyed the one-on-one meetings with our tutor. That made sure we had space to ask questions.",
                "I think that having peer tutors is the best thing one could have since sometimes professors cannot understand the mindset of an undergrad. I think that an area of improvement is having more engaging lectures since the video content was a reading of slides which is not helpful.",
                "The recorded lectures and quiz questions embedded within them were very helpful. The discussion sections were also very good and informative.",
                "The lecture length and format worked very well. I never felt screen fatigued while watching the lectures. The lecture slides contributed greatly to how focused and how I could take notes. The slides were clear and concise and were easy to understand.",
                "I particularly enjoyed the format of this course and how we could learn at our own pace, but was still provided enough recourses if we needed them. I personally do not think anything needs to be improved.",
                "The Ed Discussion forum definitely remain a mainstay in the course, even in the post-COVID era. It provides a convenient channel for students to get their questions answered and for students to read through the questions that others have asked in order to clear up any misconceptions.",
                "The online forum (ED) was very helpful."

                "Yes, especially if you want a chill class",
                "Yes! You learn a lot, and it's an enjoyable class!",
                "Yes! Maybe not to someone just looking for a science credit, but STEM majors should look forward to this prereq as opposed to the others.",
                "Yes. A great way to learn the very basics of biology if you have not already. No need to be afraid if you have very little knowledge.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I don't know what it will be like next semester since we should have a pretty normal semester, but with COVID everything really was good. I hope that they stay this lenient and organized for future students because it really emphasized learning over performance.",
                "Yes, it is a wonderful introduction to biology",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I feel like I learned a lot about the subject area. I also feel like this course has given me a greater sense of appreciation for the study of biology.",
                "Yes! It helps refine any misunderstandings/unclear topics you've learned in high school bio.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students!",
                "It is a requirement but I would recommend it regardless. Extremely organized course and useful knowledge delivered in an engaging way",
                "Yes! I thought this course gave a great, solid foundation in biology.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student! I think it is taught in a way that benefits both people coming in with very limited biology knowledge (like myself) and students who come in having completed advanced courses like AP Bio.",
                "Yes, great intro to bio",
                "Yes",
                "If you need to take it for a bio major, yes, but it would not be the most enjoyable survey course because it has a stronger focus on learning techniques and preparation for more advanced biology.",
                "Yes it is a very interesting course if you are interested in biology",
                "Yes, the course is required for a variety of majors, and it was a very fun and low-stress introduction to the basic principles of biochemistry. The professors for the class are great and very helpful. Specifically, Professor Kabeche is incredibly nice and genuinely interested in your success in and beyond Bio101.",
                "Yes, I liked what i was learning and i bet that in person it is even better.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, it lays a strong foundation for later biology courses. Even as someone who had a lot of biology exposure in high school, I learned a lot in this class.",
                "In its online format, I'd definitely recommend the course even if it's not a major requirement.",
                "Yes absolutely, if you want a basic understanding of biochemistry which is essential for both biology and chemistry majors.",
                "I think this class is a wonderful way to refresh or learn the fundamentals of biology, an important skill for those anticipating a career in the sciences or even just for general understanding of how our bodies work.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! It is mandatory for most biology or biology related major and there's no longer a placement test so you have to take it. I think for students who weren't exposed to biology in high school it's necessary to understand higher level content. As someone who had taken the AP exam and had some experience reading scientific papers and writing about biology, the course was definitely easier but I still learned a lot about applying these topics to modern science research (like with COVID) and I generally improved as a writer.",
                "yes.",
                "Im sure many will have to take this class as it is a pre-requisite and to them I say that you will do fineso long as you come in knowing this class is not as straightforward as advertised.",
                "Yes. I think this course provides an important foundation for subsequent biology classes.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in Biology, regardless of major or pre-med status. I think it's quite digestible for most students, even though some aspects can be frustrating. I think the course is designed for student learning, as opposed to harsh grading and weeding out, so that was very much appreciated. I'm not sure how that would be in an in-person setting, though.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. As someone who did not take AP Bio, this course was really well-taught and I learned a lot.",
                "Yes if you are interested in biology.",
                "Absolutely, there is ample support for all students in the course",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, this course provides a good foundation that extends off of basics AP bio ideas from high school.",
                "If you're pre-med or a bio major, you have to take it. Otherwise, no. I mean, this course is alright, but there are other courses to choose from if you don't have to take it.",
                "Yes, they made this course super accessible and manageable for the pandemic.",
                "Yes! It is a prerequisite for a lot of STEM majors and it is very well organized and makes learning the basic principles an engaging process.",
                "Yes, this is a great course to begin the biology sequence that focuses on your learning rather than stressing over your grade.",
                "Yes, if they enjoy biology and would like to take the course, as well as if they need it for their major of pre-med.",
                "Yes",
                "If you have to take it for prereq yes, otherwise, there are better science classes to take to fulfill your requirements",
                "Yes absolutely. It was not too difficult, but the various pieces and work given by the class give a great overview of intro bio material. It is also a great prereq for higher level classes.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, I would recommend. Work load was manageable and there were many resources to do well.",
                "Yes! This course was very interesting and the professors are very kind and flexible.",
                "Yes, I felt like this course helped me build my foundation in biological concepts and being able to apply these concepts to todays sciences. Also, the TAs and professors were extremely helpful in answering questions.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The lectures, discussion sections, quizzes, and all of the assignments helped boost my understanding of introductory level biochemistry and biophysics. These aspects of the class, in addition to helping me understand the content, helped me gain a higher sense of critical thinking and synthesis of information, and they were enjoyable as well. The workload for the course was average and not overwhelming. The intellectual challenge was present, but it was also not overwhelming or burdensome.",
                "Yes",
                "It's a decent class. The material is a little interesting, and the gene expression stuff was pretty cool. The workload is pretty light, especially if you have some biology/chemistry experience, but it's not a gut, since the final project essays take some work/reading. Take it for your major and don't expect to make it the focus of the first half of your semester.",
                "Yes",
                "Its a good course if you are lacking a foundation in biology. Most of the content is covered in greater detail in AP Bio, but it is a good refresher and/or alternative. Not an unpleasant class even having learnt all the material before.",
                "I would recommend this course only to people who are interested deeply in biology. The topic is not so widely applicable that everyone needs to know it, but if there is some interest in biology I would recommend taking the course.",
                "Yes, gives a clear and straightforward introduction to biochemistry",
                "Yes, it was effective in establishing basic biology concepts.",
                "I would! Youll get a great grasp of introductory biology.",
                "I would recommend taking 101/102 in the spring off sequence. I have been told by people who took it in the fall that it was much harder and the information seemed to be taught and presented better in the spring.",
                "If the class were in person, I would definitely recommend it. The material is interesting and enjoyable to learn but virtual learning makes it pretty difficult to be interested by a bunch of slides on my computer.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, you learn alot about bio and it is not too difficult.",
                "Yes, I now feel like I have a strong foundation in biology",
                "this is a good course that covers a lot of important concepts that will set you up for success in higher level biology courses",
                "Would recommend; It's a good intro biology class and you really get to apply the concepts that you learn. You also get a good glimpse of biology research happening through the published papers that are assigned for reading as well as through the final project.",
                "Yes, I would because it is a well structured course with a good teaching team.",
                "Yes I would recommend",
                "It's a prerequisite for pre-med.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who needs to satisfy their pre-med or major requirements.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, especially if it remains in the same format.",
                "Definitely! Especially if the student is intending to major in a STEM area.",
                "Definitely. This course is great as an introduction to fundamental bio topics. It is not overwhelming, but you will learn super important/interesting concepts.",
                "Yes, I would recommend for anyone wanting a foundation in biology. The course does not assume any prior knowledge about biology, which I liked as a baseline.",
                "This class was great and is a great indicator and stress-test of potential majors/interests. If you are at all interested in biology, this is a great class to start with.",
                "yes",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it provides a strong foundation in biology and the information is not too difficult to be able to understand with the resources the student has.",
                "Yes, this class was set up for a student to get as much learning as possible",
                "Yes I would if you are pre med and need to get your requirements done.",
                "If you are pre-med or going into any of the natural sciences, I would recommend this course. Otherwise, it isn't the most intellectually exciting course as it is only an introductory course.",
                "Not bad as a major requirement but  I would not go out of your way to take this course",
                "You're likely taking this for a prereq, but I would still recommend.  It's organized well and the course covers what I believe are the most important introductory topics in biology.  An interest in the subject of biology is a plus, but I didn't have a particular interest and still generally enjoyed the course.  Be prepared to keep up with all the weekly assignments though.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who want to pursue the biological sciences because it is a very good introduction to build a foundation.",
                "This class was fun and very helpful for people starting out in biology.",
                "Take only if you want to do STEM, otherwise, take something else.",
                "This is an introductory course and if you are interested in biology this would be a good course to take.",
                "Yes. I loved the content and the project. There was a really nice balance between workload and how intriguing the topics covered were. I especially enjoyed the final project.",
                "Yes, it is a great way to be introduced to biology and I recommend it to anyone regardless of major!",
                "Disregarding this class's status as a prereq for many major and medical school, I would recommend this course for any student who is looking to develop a basic, conceptual understanding of the biochemical processes that makes life, as we know it, possible.",
                "Yes. It's important to a basic Bio understanding."
