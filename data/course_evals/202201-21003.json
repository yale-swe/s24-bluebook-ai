For students interested in vocal performance, this is truly a must take class at Yale.",

                "This was an excellently structured course, and Professor Grant Herreid makes the class incredibly rewarding and entertaining as well.",
                "It was such a wonderful time to sing and make music with everyone! There werent any weaknesses per se.",
                "The course is fantastic in covering a wide variety of music in a short amount of time.  This does require adequate sight singing ability, but that makes the performance incredibly rewarding.  The music is beautiful, the professor is funny, and the students are talented.  This class is relaxing yet interesting, a rare balance at Yale.",
                "Strengths: very interactive, with the ensemble setting and engagement between the instrumental and choral sections.\r\nWeaknesses: none to note!",
                "I thought this course had mostly strengths -- I loved the structure of classes and wish we had been able to perform in a concert setting, but I think we did the best with what we could do given COVID conditions!",
                "This is a great course that needs no improvement. It brings early music to the masses of students, which is a mission that is very near and dear to my heart.",
                "Strengths: this course is very well-taught. Students get to play beautiful, rare music and instruments, an experience that is difficult to find elsewhere. The workload is super low and every class is very enjoyable--an opportunity to get together with other musicians in the Yale community and make incredible music. Grant is a great leader for the group and incredibly knowledgeable about this music and time period. All the lectures/non-performance aspects of the class were incredibly informative and aided us in improving our performances. I got to learn the viola da gamba, a beautiful instrument that I probably could not have learned elsewhere. Weaknesses: none! (take this class.)"

I learned new things about music after years of intense study, and I now approach all music I perform very differently.  Professor Herreid teaches you how to enhance your musical expression.  Also, the course is very manageable workload-wise.  There is almost no homework.",
                "Absolutely! This course is amazing if you want to learn about earlier period music and also want to have some practical experience participating in a musical ensemble.",

                "Yes, great and unique class you can probably only take at Yale.",

                "I would. To take this course, you need to be somewhat musically inclined, but if you are, I would definitely take it. As Yale undergraduates, we have the rare opportunity to play baroque instruments in order to play early music authentically. It is a very rare thing to think, \"I want to take up the theorbo!\" (or the lute, or the viola da gamba, or the recorder, or the harpsichord, etc.) and simply be able to do it. This is a type of music that I personally find beautiful and compelling, and so if you can take this class, you should.",
                "Yes!",
                "If you play an instrument and are at all interested in music history, this is class that you must take during your time at Yale. Playing Renaissance instruments and music is a great opportunity that you will likely not find elsewhere. The class requires little commitment beyond showing up every week and performing with the group. Grant is a great professor--super flexible and knowledgeable about the material."
