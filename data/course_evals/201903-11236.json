    "I felt like I got a very good understanding of basic calculus from this course. Although most of the content I had previously learnt before in high school, I felt like I got a better understanding of it all and understand why everything works more",
    "How to manipulate equations and find variables using helpful \"rules\" in math.",
    "Math skills improved",
    "Among other things, this course taught me how to take derivatives, use logarithmic functions, and optimize functions. All of this will be useful to my future professional life as I prepare to apply to doctoral programs in a field that requires some level of ma thematic literacy.",
    "I developed better algebra skills and recognition of when to use them.  I also developed specific skills such as linear approximation.",
    "Greatly helped my maths knowledge and has improved my maths across a lot of areas",
    "Review of algebra and intro to calculus",
    "How to expand from basic formulas into complex questions."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Content taught at a good pace. Workshops are very useful and are a beneficial part of the course. Quizzes were also good as they made me briefly review what we did in class the previous lesson which probably helped me to retain the information. Office hours most nights was also very useful\r\nWeaknesses:",
    "This course was excellent in that is encouraged student group work and conversations about math in the classroom. I really enjoyed this class because I felt engaged and challenged the entire time, and the classroom environment was comfortable and welcoming.",
    "A strength was having a new lesson everyday and being able to ask what you need. A weakness was the 5 minute quizzes at the beginning of every class.",
    "I took some basic math courses during my undergraduate at another university; however, the way that this course is taught is vastly different. Here, the actual section size, and the professors are themselves available for offices hours. Additionally, this is the first time that I took a math test on pencil and paper rather than online. I am thankful that the exams are conducted as such as this forced me to, before the exam, make sure that I knew exactly why I was doing. Now, I can truly say that I have a good grasp on the material that I was responsible for.  The only critique that I have is to let us see our final grade on GradeScope. As the finals are released anyway, as study material for the next set of students, it would have been nice to see the final to see how I progressed throughout the semester.",
    "I thought the daily handouts provided a solid framework for content and made studying and the original mathematical discovery really well facilitated.\r\n\r\nI thought the instructor couldve put the math we were learning into context more, explaining not just how to do things, but what we were doing, and what those processes would allow us to discover.",
    "Strengths are the small class numbers, the homework, and our discussion section. I feel like this course has been set up very well to encourage students to achieve well within this course and the resources are fantastic if you are struggling.",
    "Strength- homework helped review materials \r\nWeakness- too much group work",
    "I did not previously take AP Calc and fell behind, even though I was told this was a class presented to students as if they had no previous engagement in Calculus."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would, very good for getting a good base understanding of calculus. Lots of support in various ways if you are struggling or get stuck",
    "YES! Math 110 is the perfect pace for anyone that feels that their math skills are not yet developed enough for Math112. This may depend on the professor, but my classroom environment heavily stressed collaborative working and problems solving, and my favorite parts of the class were trying to think conceptually about math topics as a whole group discussion. I feel like I learned so much in this class and can apply what I've learned to higher level classes for sure.",
    "Yes, Professor Ochoa de Alaiza is an excellent teacher and has made time for me and my questions whenever I needed help. No doubt one of the best Professors I've ever had. A teacher that ACTUALLY care about her students.",
    "yes this is a good basic math course.",
    "Yes, if they need to take math courses at the level of 110\/111\/112, I will recommend the 110\/111 sequence. There are genuinely some fields where knowing how to take derivatives is not worth the opportunity cost of sitting through a semester long course.",
    "yes, It is good for developing calculus skills even if you have none.",
    "Yes I would, I felt as though my maths skills were very rusty coming into this semester and I feel like they are much stronger now, as well as having improved numerical and strategic thinking skills. My instructor was fantastic and passionate about the work and I felt as though she really cared about the success of the students within the class.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students.",
    "Yes, overall the lessons were beneficial even though there was too much group work everyday in class.",
    "I would ask them to look carefully into what kind of teacher would work best for them."
