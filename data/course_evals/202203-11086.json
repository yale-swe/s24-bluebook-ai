We get consistent, daily practice with all the ways we use language--reading, handwriting, typing, listening, speaking. Vocabulary and grammar concepts build at a steady pace. The course is fast-paced but gives a lot of support and opportunities to practice, and the asynchronous day in the middle of the week lets you review anything you didn't understand from earlier in the week. It's 1.5 credits but the homework load is very reasonable. It's hard to imagine a better introduction to a language! Weaknesses: none."
