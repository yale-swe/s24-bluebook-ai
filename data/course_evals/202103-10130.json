                "An introduction to urban studies, which itself is not a fully defined field. Generally, the course introduced me to a new way of thinking about urban issues and practices. It made me notice and question everyday things that I had previously never given thought to.",
                "I became a much more critical observer of urban environments. I learned about the history of urban renewal/displacement, how classism and racism are embedded in cities and discourses around them. Also learned a good bit of New Haven history. The class is mostly guest lectures, so many of the sessions are about wildly disparate topics and might not be the same in future iterations. You don't learn a lot of concrete skills/facts -- it's much more about ways of viewing cities and discourses around them.",
                "I learned how to communicate ideas through multi-media (photography, map-making, soundscapes, written critique, etc.). I also learned about the many fields that involve urban studies (public health, activism, journalism, etc.).",
                "I learned how to critically analyze urban representations. We were encouraged to be critical and look beyond face value to see bias and stigma. We learned how interconnected urban systems are and how many problems can come from the same root cause.",
                "A good introduction to the field of Urban Studies and the academic possibilities within it.",
                "Insight into urban studies and different problems facing urban planners today",
                "I learned so much about built environments, social and cultural factors affecting urban environments, and many careers in urban studies.",

                "I learned various topics regarding urban studies and the components that make up urban spaces.",
                "Very broad exposure to different concepts, themes, and ideas in the growing field of urban studies.",
                "The ability to read the urban landscape from a variety of perspectives (historical, environmental, ethnographic, social, cultural, public health).",
                "Introduction to a wide range of methods of thinking in urban studies and the problems facing modern cities.",
                "In this course, I got an introduction to architecture through a sociological lens, and I learned about elements of the built environment that have social impacts, public transportation (and its inequities) the pedestrian experience, urban sprawl, public housing, and how to analyze any type of public space. Everything was so interconnected, and we even talked about things like school choice and feminist architecture. I learned so much in this class and saw overlaps in all of my other classes as well.",
                "I gained an overview of urban studies and its relation to (but not limited to): redlining, gentrification, city planning (past, present, future), public arts, political activism, natural disaster management, public health infrastructure, and neocolonialism. We developed skills in archival research, reading and effective writing about the development of cities and city life, and map reading as well as making.",
                "I learned a lot about potential career paths in Urban Studies from guest lecturers in this class and the ways in which Urban issues intersect with many other areas of study.",
                "Getting a better understanding of what urban studies is and how to more critically evaluate different types of medias. It's interesting to see cities in a different light and understand how certain aspects can say a lot more about the state of a location.",
                "Whoa I learned so so much in this course -- cities, the built environment, public transportation, equity, remote sensing, access to healthcare, gentrification, architecture, photography and other methods of capturing cities, mapping, ethnography, and so much more. The lectures were thought-provoking and fascinating, and each one touched on a different facet of the urban environment. Walking around cities it's easy to not inquire how everything came to be the way it is, but this course taught me to dig a little more and understand the backstory.",
                "I developed a wide range of introductory understanding of urban studies topics. I learned the elements that come together to form an urban space",
                "Urban studies survey",
                "I learnt how to think critically about cities and space, and just more generally about the key tenets of urban studies. Guest lecturers and Elihu touched on a wide variety of themes - racial segregation, immigration, health (access/equity), sustainability, the effect of the built environment on social life etc. The course covers a wide variety of majors (probably more so than any other class here) at a very high level.",
                "A deeper understanding of the many multilayered factors and forces that define the \"urban\". The varied perspectives that can be used for urban analysis, and the way that each one contributes to a different vision of the city in theory and in practice. The many scales that urban issues can be approached from, and the ability to overlap these scales in one's work or analysis.",

Urbanism needs to start with an understanding of the local community and needs to involve affected citizens.\r\nAn underlying theme was the tension between technical skill/academic theory/top-down planning vs. local needs and community insight.",
                "I developed an interest in the way humans interact with the world around them, with the built environment. I learned to consider many different aspects of the relationship between history, race, housing, the environment, etc. and how those fit into the way we as people take up space. This class makes me want to major in urban studies.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: guest speakers and Scrapbook assignment. The guest speakers were awesome and it was fun to go to class knowing that rather than listening to a standard lecture, we would get to be audience to an interview of sorts between Prof. Rubin and an expert in some field related to urban studies. The scrapbook assignment was great because of the flexibility in its requirements and what we could choose to focus on in them. Also, the assignments were different from the standard papers and writing assignments you find in other social science and humanities classes, which was refreshing. \r\nWeaknesses: The two biggest, I would say, were the disorganized nature of the class and the abstractness of some of the content. These were not destructive to the course but sometimes it made doing the work and staying engaged with the course difficult.",
                "Strengths: many of the guest lecturers are fascinating, the assignments give you a lot of free rein to explore your interests, lots of attention paid to Yale's role in historic injustices\r\n\r\nFlaws: very slow grading, very few guidelines on assignments, generally a little disorganized. I would've liked to learn a few more concrete skills instead of just a lot of interesting historical information/abstract content, although that was also great.",
                "I enjoyed the many speakers that visited the class they each provided a new perspective on the life of cities and how they are represented. \r\nI felt this class could be improved by having more clear requirements for each assignment (I never received a rubric and I only got feedback once from my TA).",
                "The biggest strength of this course is its breadth. The guest lecturers were all so knowledgeable about their respective fields, and you could tell they were passionate because of their enthusiasm in lecture. Although I greatly enjoyed the variety provided by the guest lecturers, I also would have enjoyed it if Prof Rubin lectured more. His lectures were always very interesting and organized in a unique way that illuminated connections between seemingly disparate ideas.",
                "The content was pretty interesting most of the time. If you are into Urban Studies, it's definitely an engaging and worthwhile course to take. However, I felt like many of the lectures ended up saying the same thing over and over again. I would have been interested to hear from other points of view (maybe a local developer perhaps) that didn't just repeat the same mantras and talking points that all the other guest presenters had - it's a very \"Yale: Respect New Haven\" lineup as you might imagine. \r\n\r\nThe course also seemed pretty unorganized. Due dates were constantly changing (thankfully always later, to our favor) and assignments wouldn't be graded until literally months after they were submitted. There is really only one assignment for the course -  a big \"Urban Scrapbook\" -  so be prepared for that. I just wish my TA was kind of on the same page as everyone else to give better feedback. \r\n\r\nI also found my section to be horribly unengaging and an absolute waste of time, but my section might be an anomaly.",
                "I loved how they had guest lecturers every class that were experts in the fields, it made class super engaging.",
                "The course is very interesting and the information is fascinating. The format can be a little all over the place, but I guess that makes sense for such an interdisciplinary field.",
                "The course has many guest lectures, which create a very interesting semester. You will certainly find something you enjoy because many different parts of urban studies are touched upon. The course could perhaps contain a few more sessions led by Elihu, he is an excellent lecturer. He could cover how to make analyses from the urbanist perspective. I also think a quiz with some of the key course concepts would help the attendance rate remain higher.",
                "Strengths included the range of topics covered during lecture, the array of engaging and inspiring guest lecturers, and our trip to the Trinity Church. Weaknesses were the long period of lecture, the long and drawn out lecture discussions, and sometimes inability to go into depth in topics.",
                "Strengths: wonderful selection of guest speakers and lecturers; each lecture featured a vast range of information, readings, and content that were interesting to learn about. Weaknesses: the course was poorly structured (felt like zero ties between any lectures) and there was little to no organization; actual \"work\" was limited to five assignments and a final project, which didn't really assess any of the concepts or skills we had discussed in lecture; too many readings that never ended up being necessary; left the course slightly more confused about what \"urban studies\" exactly is.\r\n\r\nIf there was a more cohesive curriculum, more frequent applications of skills and materials learned in class (with feedback), opportunities to expand on areas of personal interest within urban studies, and an overall structure to the course, it would be much better.",
                "strengths: diversity, creativity, flexibility, you can explore the topic of your interest\r\nweaknesses: guests invited weren't always engaging/ readings felt esoteric and not grounded, no concrete skills learned",
                "Strengths: multiple speakers from a variety of backgrounds, interesting topics, variety of topics, variety of readings; Weaknesses: lack of cohesiveness, professor could have spent more lectures tying the guest lectures and topics together. Maybe have more lectures in between the guest lectures that ground our conversations and offer some through line between the topics.",
                "I really enjoyed the assignments which seemed can seem less structured than other assignments in other courses but allow you to be creative / pursue something that really interests you which was refreshing.",
                "I think the simultaneous strength and weakness of this class is that every class was with a guest lecturer. I really loved hearing from so many perspectives and Professor Rubin was incredible at asking questions and shaping the lectures, but I wish that the class would be re-structured to where Professor Rubin lectured once a week and there was a guest lecturer the other class. Professor Rubin is also an incredible lecturer and I'm leaving the class wishing I had heard more from him, even though the majority of guest lecturers were also engaging. Additionally, because every lecture was from a guest, there didn't seem to be any coherence between lectures or like we were learning in any type of 'order,' which wasn't harmful but was slightly disorienting. Another strength was the urban scrapbook, which I felt was a fun and engaging way to practice the analytical skills we learned in class. This was much better than if we had had a quiz or written more formal essays.",
                "A strength of this course is its ability to get you acquainted with all the facets of urban studies: the guest lecturer model makes sure that each class session will introduce you to someone or something in the field that might interest you. We always had the opportunity to ask further questions of the guests who were experts in their fields.\r\nHowever, if you are already decided on a major in urban studies, you might find this class to be too broad or too general but I am pretty sure you will be very engaged with the assignments if not reading materials; we had a semester-long scrapbook that was virtually up to each student to decide what they wanted to focus on in depth.",
                "I loved the guest lecturers in this course!",
                "Strengths: a lot of interesting guest lecturers and topics",
                "I loved all of the guest lecturers in this course, and I'm also very glad that Professor Rubin led some lectures so we got to hear some of his insights. I think that the expectation of student participation in a large lecture course left some awkward silences as many students were uncomfortable speaking up or did not take the course very seriously. The workload of the course was very fair for an intro course, and there is plenty of room in the assignments to do something you are passionate about. I would say that we never received any feedback on our work except for a grade (and this often came well after the next assignment was due).",
                "The speakers that came to our class were fascinating. They were all true inspirations in their field and we were lucky to be able to engage directly with them. However, the lectures and material of this class did not come together to form a holistic understanding of any concepts. It all felt slightly disconnected.",
                "Really flexible, able to learn about whatever you'd like.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting to hear from very important people in the Urban Studies / Architecture world (the class consists of guest lectures).\r\n\r\nAlso really nice that there are no exams and you can learn through projects at your own pace.\r\n\r\nGrading all depends on TA.",
                "Strengths\r\n- Wide variety of guest speakers means we cover the entire field of urban studies \r\n- Elihu Rubin - truly one of the best lecturers at Yale, incredibly engaging and passionate\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- INCREDIBLY unstructured - often meant we covered the same topic from similar angles multiple times, and much of our time was spent on redundant topics\r\n- Homework/assignments often changed as the class went on, meaning you had to do it somewhat close to the deadline.\r\n- Readings often didn't tie in with discussion, though most people never did them (myself included).",
                "Strengths: I really loved the way the class was structured around speaker presentations. I enjoyed hearing about a wide range of research and work, and learning about the same topic from many different perspectives. Section provided a good opportunity for discussion with classmates and to think about what we had learned that week. Weaknesses: This class felt a bit larger than it was set up to be. It often felt unorganized and assignments seemed unclear. The number of people made it difficult to have class discussions, and it often felt that students didn't feel the need to come to class. I also wish we had been provided with definitions of some terminology in order to better structure our discussions.",
                "The course benefited from a great diversity of guest speakers and topics. This meant that there were countless \"ins\" to our learning about cities and urbanity, allowing numerous interests to be explored in the context of the class. At the same time, this made the central challenge of the course organization and coherence between the different topics and approaches brought to bear. Without a clear framework or structure guiding all guest contributions, it was sometimes difficult to locate an \"arc\" to the course. I think that making such a framework more evident throughout the class, and using it to contextualize the speakers and their contributions would improve student comprehension. Another strength of the course was its openness to student participation and collaboration, in both lectures and sections. Given the size of the course this semester, I think that this aspect could be improved by increasing the number of opportunities students have to meet and work with each other in small group settings (especially outside of pre-existing friend groups). Another suggestion would be to increase the number of learning opportunities outside of the classroom, through visits to different sites in Yale and New Haven for example, and breaking these up in such a way that small groups of students would be able to choose which opportunities interested them the most and pursue those somewhat independently before regrouping as a whole class.",
                "I loved the colloquium format of the course and all of the guest speakers who lent us their time, knowledge, and perspectives on current urban issues. I also liked that the assignments were very much focused on us developing our own perspectives on urban issues. However, I think that this format also made the course feel a little disorganized as it was hard to find themes that linked together multiple lectures, and a lot of loose ends weren't tied up until the conclusion lectures.",
                "Strengths: Amazing (and famous!) guest lecturers and regular lectures by Elihu, interesting content to talk about in sections, lots of freedom in assignments to do what interests you\r\nWeaknesses: Almost too much freedom in assignments at times means that you might be searching a lot for what to do, especially if you don't take the class with an already developed interest in urban studies",
                "Strengths: fun lectures, discussions, assignments,  and readings; you are encouraged to think and learn outside of your typical academic context; strong social justice and environmental emphasis\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked to learn about urban design and planning a bit more, somewhat disorganized",
                "This class is so open-ended, but not in a way where I feel overwhelmed by choice. This is a very difficult thing to manage in a course, but this course did it very well. I think it had a lot to do with the variety of readings and guest speakers we had; there were so many ways of thinking of urban studies/the built environment, and you can choose your favorite lens or experiment with different ones.",
                "Incredible colloquium style... this structure makes it a true introduction to urban studies rather than a dry powerpoint slide deck week after week",
                "The material is very broad, so you get a glimpse into a lot of topics which allow you to find something you like. The course was organized well except for the assignments, which were very vague and so it made it hard at times to know what to focus on. I also really liked the lecture at Trinity Church on the Green. It brought the content into the real world and was really immersive.",
                "This course's strengths and weaknesses stem from its breadth. Professor Rubin brought in speakers from a wide variety of fields and professions: historians, journalists, architects, urban planners, statisticians, public health advisors, sociologists, photographers, public artists, and environmentalists. I personally had expected the class to be more focused on urban planning principles, transportation systems, and applying a critical eye to urban design. As such, I found the lectures from urban designers, artists, architects, and photographers (all together about 1/4-1/5 of the classes) to be very engaging. However, most of the lectures and conversations were text-based and very humanities-and-social-sciencey. I am sure others felt opposite to me and enjoyed the sociological lectures far more and the visual/spatial ones far less. This is just to say that there is definitely something interesting for you in this course if Urban Studies sounds appealing, but other parts of the course may fall flat. \r\nI personally wish the class had allowed for and encouraged more spatial reasoning. I also wish there had been a bit more depth, such that I felt like I had a solid mastery of Urban Studies vocabulary and skills by the end of the semesterI'm not sure I can say this is true. There was a lot of talk about \"Urban Processes\" but I'm not sure I learned anything new about what those processes are and how one can identify themthis is true for a number of the central concepts to the class.\r\nThe assignments are enjoyable because you can really take them in whatever direction is most exciting to you, and I kind of wish more of the section had been spent discussing our projects with one another instead of what often felt like generic, filler conversation about the readings. \r\nI also think it's possible that this class would have been more engaging and provided more value to everyone in it had it been a bit smaller and closer-together. Instead, in basically every lecture we were spread out and far from the stage (this may have been covid-related) and Professor Rubin struggled (by no fault of his own) to get students to engage and contribute their own thoughts or questions during lectures. More class participation in lectures would have highly elevated the experience and atmosphere and I think Professor Rubin knew this and tried his hardest given the circumstances to encourage itI don't know if there is a way to better set this up for success, but if possible it would be rewarding.",
                "The strength was the flexibility of the course. I wish Professor Rubin lectures more but the guest lectures were nice as well.",
                "I thought this course was really interesting in terms of learning the different facets of Urban Studies, but it did not really feel like an introductory course because we did not learn any theories or terms that directly related to the foundation of Urban Studies. I still felt like I learned a lot.",
                "The readings and the assignments were always very interesting and fun to do. The only thing I would criticize would be the frequency of guest speakers. I think guest speakers are important and useful, however, we had a guest speaker every single lecture. I would appreciate more lectures led by either the professor or the TAs, giving us more structured plan of the course.",
                "The speakers all offered really interesting insights and perspectives, but I wish that Elihu spent more time synthesizing what we were learning and giving more guidance to the themes we were hearing. I wish I knew more about how each speaker fits into urban history and had a more clear roadmap of the various themes and approaches.",
                "More engaging lectures"

                "Yes, if you are willing to deal with some disorganization and some feelings of abstractness when discussing the content. It is a great introduction to a new field, a field that is not even fully defined yet. Generally, it is somewhat similar to political science classes, but also different enough that is provides a feeling of uniqueness / difference that I enjoyed. Overall, the workload is also not too high which makes the class engaging but manageable.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in cities and how we exist in them! Very approachable overview of urban studies, especially good if you are interested in New Haven/Yale history.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student because I don't feel that I gained any skills or expanded my knowledge enough for an entire semester of work. \r\nI would recommend auditing this class to hear the guest speakers and Elihu Rubin lecture but I would not recommend it for an intellectual challenge.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this class to anyone who is at all interested in urban studies, activism, or social justice. Every lecture was so impactful and engaging, and this class exposes students to so many topics that is likely many lectures will correlate with future career interests.",
                "I would. But you get out of it what you put into it. You really don't have to do the readings or even attend lectures if you don't want to. But for people who genuinely want to learn more about Urban Studies, it's a fine course.",
                "Yes, solid introduction course. Interesting topics especially with the guest lecturers everyday.",
                "Yes, it is a very good way to gauge whether you want to pursue Urban Studies.",
                "Yes, I would reccomned this course to someone with an interest in the environment, architecture, anthropology, ethnography etc.. It helped me to connect the dots between many subjects I am interested in and see how complex problems really are, especially those relating to urban policy. \r\nEven if a student wasn't hugely interested in these topics I think the broad nature of the lecture makes it a useful tool for gaining knowledge across multiple disciplines.",
                "Yes, if you are even the slightest bit interested in urban studies.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone interested in a comprehensive overview of urban studies. Many of the guest speakers were very interesting and the workload was sufficient without being overwhelming. I also think this course is better the more you engage with it, so I would recommend it to someone who is self-motivated",
                "As it is, I would hesitate to recommend URBN 160 to another student. Urban studies, itself, is such a fascinating, emerging field that encompasses a vast range of topics and ideas; I think every student at Yale would benefit from exposure to the subject. But this course, even as an introductory class, was just non-cohesive and often felt like a waste of time. If it was structured and content was delivered differently, then the course would have been majorly improved (i.e., students would actually attend the lectures). I genuinely would have loved to be more engaged with the course and regret that I was not.",
                "I would. It gave me a variety of perspectives that I normally would not have about topics that fascinate me.",
                "If you are someone that is not aware to the problems facing cities and the intersections of race class etc. that shape these problems then you should definitely take this course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone. It was a fantastic introduction into Urban Studies, and the course concepts were relevant to sociology, architecture, women and gender studies, ethnicity race and migration, and even public health. Because this class is so independent, you really get what you put in, and if you attend lecture and do the readings, you can really learn a lot without having the stress of busywork or intentionally intimidating work.",
                "100% yes!! I might be biased as an urban studies major but this class definitely offers something new to everyone's course load. The workload is manageable, the material accessible, and the teaching team extremely helpful. If you're a science major looking for a humanities/social-science credit this class is for you-- if you're humanities, you might find that you major still aligns pretty heavily with the study of cities",
                "Yes! I think this class is a great way to understand that everything really is Urban Studies!",
                "Yes, as a STEM major who needed a humanities credit, I enjoyed this course! It's low workload but still interesting and I feel a worthwhile class.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course, especially for non-majors. The content of this course is relevant to everyone and forces you to show up to lecture thinking in a different way every time. The guest lecturers are fascinating.",
                "Yes!! Especially to a first-year like myself. You get to hear from professionals in such a wide range of fields, which can help determine which direction youd like to take your learning in.",
                "Yes!! It's a great low workload class that you still get a lot out of, hear really interesting guest lectures, etc.\r\nElihu Rubin is great too.",
                "Not really, at least not in its current form. The course is very much a work-in-progress - it lacks even the slightest amount of organisation and planning. I found that we were hopping between topics with no relevance between often, and that we covered the same topics at a similar depth multiple times. Discussion sections just failed to go past throwing around lingo, and my friends experiences in other discussion sections line up perfectly with mine. The homework tasks were very broad - to the point of which there was basically no clarity. All the homework tasks were extended or altered in someway during the course. Though, the general idea of the scrapbook and the process/research was a LOT of fun. I (like many) picked my hometown, and found out so much about my city. \r\n\r\nOn a more positive note, the heavy emphasis on guest lecturers was great. It was a lot of fun getting different viewpoints on these topics (even if they were sometimes repetitive) and Elihu is an INCREDIBLE lecturer. To me, this course could be one of the best at Yale - it just needs structure to avoid the needless repetition.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in urban studies. It was a wonderful opportunity to be introduced to urban studies, and the class provided a good overview of many different topics and possible research areas. It gives you the questions you need to think about the cities around you more deeply.",
                "yes",
                "Yes; it was really cool to get so many guest speakers to come in and lend perspectives on current topics in urban studies, and it helped me realize how broad the field was and that there are so many intersections between what seem like individual issues. The workload was also relatively low, but also be warned that things can change quickly.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn more about cities (including New Haven) and how they operate. There are so many things going on that we don't really pay attention to but to which this course will call your attention. It can be an easy class if you want it to be, but the assignments also leave a lot of room to go above and beyond if you're really into the content",
                "Yes! It's lots of fun; if you like cities you will enjoy the course. However, know that it is not a crash course in any one discipline so you will not necessarily come out with a clear knowledge of planning and its history, or urban design etc, but rather you will explore different perspectives on American cities and their contemporary issues.",
                "Absolutely. The material of this course is so much fun to engage with, regardless of your major.",
                "The depth and breadth of the speaker list alone makes it worth taking the class",
                "Yes, if you like cities and learning how they work.",
                "This class felt a little bit disjointed throughout the semester because every class was a different guest lecture. This meant that each day was a hit or a miss. Additionally, I had a hard time understanding how all these ideas connected. I would recommend Elihu's other course, American Architecture and Urbanism over this intro lecture course, which I had taken the semester before.",
                "Yes, it gets you started thinking about lots of relevant and interesting ideas, even if it doesn't give you huge depth in any one field. It also allows a space to be thoughtful and critical about the built environments that we live our lives in, which I think was very cool and rewarding. It also has a pretty low workload, fun, interesting assignments, and interesting readings and speakers.",
                "Yes. It is a very interesting course and its not too intense.",
                "I would recommend this course if they are interested in Urban Studies because if they are not it could be a lot sitting through the lectures.",
                "I would recommend this course as it is very interesting and enjoyable. The workload isn't huge and the material studied can give you a better understanding of your surroundings not only in New Haven, but in any city around the world.",
                "Yes easy class"
