                "The class was disorganized, with no clear goals or objectives. When asked at the beginning of the semester what the format of the course would be, and how grades would be assigned, the professor seemed not to have considered these at all, and did not give an answer. Throughout the semester, he assigned 1 assignment to about half of the students, and no assignments to the remainder. He had about 3 distinct lectures, which he reused every class throughout the semester. These lectures were often reviewing content that any graduating mathematics major could reasonably have been expected to have seen before, but there were often several critical mistakes in the proofs.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Jones is extremely nice and fun guy. The class is also very easy -- for many seniors who are busy possibly with theses, this is a strength. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: almost no material is covered. For reference, on the syllabus it says the following:\r\n\r\n\"The course will begin with the following subjects:\r\n Dyadic Grids and Martingales on [0,1] . The use of Haar functions for constructions of martingales.\r\n A rigorous construction of Brownian Motion using Haar functions and the method of Paul Levy. Also a discussion of various properties of Brownian motion.\r\n Harmonic functions on bounded domains and Kakutanis theorem: Given a function F on the boundary of a bounded domain, how to use Brownian motion to find a function f such that Laplacian(f) = 0 on the interior of the domain, and f = F on the boundary.\r\n Random Gaussian vectors and a discussion of their use in in Mathematics and Data Science.\"\r\n\r\nWe covered martingales on [0,1]. We covered Brownian motion, but didn't really discuss the various properties of it, except for non-differentiability + continuity (though perhaps this is what is meant). To be maximally fair, you could say we covered the first two bullets. The last two, to my knowledge, we did not cover at all (we did something sort of(?) related to bullet 3 but I don't think we really covered what is described above). Certainly we did not cover random Gaussian vectors. And it says the course will BEGIN with those topics -- we didn't even get through them all! (To be additionally extra fair, we also discussed contractions a bit). But overall we did very little.\r\n\r\nFor approximately the first 5-ish weeks of class, we basically did the same thing each class. No, this is not a joke, or even an exaggeration. We would discuss martingales on [0,1] via the exact same diagram each time. There was no progression of material as you would find in a normal course's presentation of mathematics. (e.g., in analysis you have sequences then functions then continuity then derivatives, or something like that). Nothing like that here. I will also mention that in addition to not covering much material, it is hard to follow Prof. Jones' exposition. Super nice guy, but I found it hard to learn in class (even when we were actually doing new things).\r\n\r\nA bunch of people stopped coming to class regularly after that -- I think probably the average attendance hovered at or below 50%. Even when students were in class, they seemed to mostly did their homework for other courses. For the record: I do NOT think that an acceptable way to deal with this is to make attendance mandatory -- the right way to do it is to have a course that people are LEARNING in.\r\n\r\nOverall, I felt that it was an incredible waste of my time and that I got very little out of the course. \r\n\r\nHow it can be improved:\r\n\r\nThe first option (in my mind) is just delete the requirement. Just let students take another elective -- I would have been much better off taking a different math elective and actually adding to my knowledge. The projects we end up doing are things that have been proven already (of course, many of us are not capable of doing original research). But what that means in practice is that the final project is just learning a proof that we study on the internet and reproducing it. That doesn't *really* contribute much to our understanding. While of course in a class like analysis the results on problem sets have also been proven before, because it is organized in a way where material builds on itself, the student, via doing those proofs, gains familiarity and comfort with the ideas involved. For a one-off final project proof, that doesn't happen.\r\n\r\nThe second is to keep the course but CHANGE the teacher. Prof Jones just is not organized enough and does not explain the material well enough to make class productive. Don't read my comments to say that it should be a lot of work -- I don't think so. But it should cover much more material.",
                "Professor Jones is very passionate and knowledgeable about analysis and the world of math in general--it was nice getting to hear his stories about the math world and different important mathematicians, particularly at the end of the major when having the context to understand most of them.",
                "The strength of this course was its rather calm pace compared to past math courses Ive taken",
                "I think the course should be run as its title suggests, i.e. as a seminar. This was a lecture course with the sporadic (<= 3) group presentation assigned here and there. Often the lectures repeated and covered the exact same material as a previous lecture. Final group presentations were packed into one class session at the very end of the course, making it impossible to present on anything mathematically meaningful. Each presentation was a short proof rather than anything all that interesting given the time constraints.",

I felt like the class was a massive waste of my time. Prof Jones is nice and has fun stories, but he isn't very organized and he doesn't explain things very well. We ended up spending like the first 5 weeks of class doing the exact same topic over and over again. If you need a class that is basically not even a real class then sure, go ahead.
