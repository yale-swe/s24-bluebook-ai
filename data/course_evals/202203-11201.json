                "Strengths: It's a relaxed class. This could also be a weakness?\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is not terrible, because the professor is very kind, but he talks a lot, leaving little time for students to talk in a foreign language class. I recommend asking students questions about the text each class period, as that keeps us engaged. Lastly, the workload is a bit imbalanced. During the semester the class was very laid back, but the last couple of weeks were brutal. A final presentation on your research paper, an exam, a group video project, and the final research paper is a lot! Hopefully in the future the workload can be more balanced during the semester such that students don't have all this work to do for one class.\r\n\r\nI still liked this class, but the last week has been rough!",
                "It was very current and organized. One way it could be improved is by allowing more casual conversations between students to try out the new vocabulary words",
