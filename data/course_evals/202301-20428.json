                "I learned how to improve my Russian speaking, grammar, presentation, and writing skills quite substantially. I feel like I left this class being far more confident in my russian skills, and getting to finish learning the grammar was so helpful. The professor also gave tailored advice and graded based on your individual needs/ improvement (i.e. you were only competing against yourself and all progress was based on how you improved). And most learning is based on personal interests (e.g. we did final presentations for 10-15min based on a topic of our own choosing). I also liked the short readings we read (we read Iyonich and The Meek One by Dostoyevsky in Russian) and we got to see some films and read some poetry! It was really really great!",
                "This course greatly improved my Russian speaking writing and reading abilities. Highly recommend!",
                "Improved my grammar and writing skills, finished learning cases, and read literature (Dostoevsky)",
                "I learned more about Russian and vocabulary, comprehension, and reading. I learned more about how Russian",
                "I learned a lot about Russian grammar and strengthened my reading and writing skills."

                "The course felt a little disorganized at times but overall was fine",
                "The class was really good and well tailored to each student!!! I think that meant that you could learn quite a lot. I also really appreciate the way the professor was very receptive to discussing the books we read and was always receptive and excited to discuss them, clarify our knowledge (even if she has read them many many times). And I really really appreciate how she always made us feel like our ideas were valued and interesting even if we did not always fully understand what we read (there were a couple times I missed the premise of the chapter and she was kind and good about helping me reunderstand it with more clarity). I really appreciate her hard work and diligence!",
                "I loved this course! The instructor does a very good job at catering to the diverse abilities of the class (as its a heritage course  everyone is coming in with different abilities). Very personalized instruction with a small class size. Great feedback.",
                "I thought this course was super very helpful in improving my speaking and grammar skills. I also loved how close we all got after two semesters of being together <3  The only thing is for less Lingco assignments and more handwritten/worksheet work that we can go over more in-depth over class time",
                "I think the course really benefited my speaking comprehension and was a great addition to Russian for Heritage Learners I. The different assignments were really fun, and I learned different vocabulary for different situations. \r\n\r\nOne thing that would help is fixing our learning module, Lingco. It often had errors or had very strange HTML. I think if it was edited, it could be better. In addition, learning of the cases could be spaced out better.",
                "The course is great for heritage speakers, especially when it comes to strengthening reading skills. The class was not always the most organized in terms of assignments and how the grammar was being taught, but I would still highly recommend it for the students that come from Russian-speaking households but did not want to go into L5."

So so helpful and professor does an amazing job of tailoring to your needs and helping you work on your own improvements!",
