    "This class was extremely difficult, the exams were so hard, and the material wasnt particularly interesting.",
    "Taught E&M like a good physics course.",
    "I realized that the physics I learned in this class was barely applicable to MCAT physics. At least I know how to find\/use eigenvalues......barely.",
    "I gained knowledge about a variety of physics concepts and laws from electric circuitry and magnetic field to optics and light. I learned how to be a better critical thinker and problem solver through the psets, class, and exams.",
    "Knowledge of waves, Lin algebra, schrodingers equation, circuits",
    "I learned a lot, especially about how to problem solve and think quickly and work hard. Also I leaned a lot of cool phyics (and learned I really like physics) but the most important takeaways are the confidence in myself and my critical thinking skills from this class.",
    "I learned basic physics with some application to biology and chemistry",
    "General physics knowledge about circuits, flux, etc",
    "My math skills developed as it required quite a bit of math which isn't my strongest topic.",
    "I learned to approach basic physics problems.",

    "We mostly learned about circuits (electricity and magnetism) and waves.",
    "A continuation of our physics curriculum from PHYS 170, an in-depth knowledge of circuits, optics, and how to solve differential equations. Applications to biological systems but I felt that there were less applications this semester than previously.",
    "I think I have learned a lot about eigen values, and also electromagnetic field, gauss' laws, etc.",
    "Honestly, I learned to push through some serious discomfort in order to achieve what I wanted to achieve. I learned to never let up on any assignment, and I learned to use all of my resources (TAs, Peer Tutors, instructors, peers). I learned to struggle with physics problems for a long time, become extremely frustrated, and return later.",
    "Good all-round understanding of general physics concepts (also somewhat related to medical fields)",
    "I learned how to apply difficult concepts to new problems and analyze equations piece by piece (not just accept them for how they are)",

    "I learned how about electricity, magnetism, and other topics through the lens of a physicist.",
    "I learnt various physics concepts such as circuit analysis, waves, and quantitative mechanics.",
    "none. this class was ridiculously difficult and I still do not understand why it was required for my major of E&EB.",
    "This class taught me how to think critically about concepts in physics and how to apply them to everyday life. It also taught me how to think like a physicist and sparked my interest in the field of physics.",
    "I learned how to build models to describe the physical world.",
    "I learned basic EM physics concepts as well as some of the basics of quantum physics and optics.",
    "I learned about oscillatory motion, waves, circuit elements, light, and quantum mechanics. I developed my ability to solve complex, application-based physics problems based on physical and mathematical models. I improved my skills in differential equation-solving. I gained insight into the connections between physics and other sciences, particularly biology and chemistry.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Have a textbook! The course notes are not enough, and they try to do too much random bio\/chem applications without first giving a solid understanding of physics itself",
    "The exams should reflect more of what we learned in class. If they were the same level, we wouldn't need to get 50% of our points back in order to pass.",
    "Weaknesses) Switch between instructors was rough. Rona Ramos was a really great lecturer, and Daisuke was not. Also, the class got significantly more difficult in the second half in a way that was ridiculous and too high of a work-load. Lecture often unuseful but mandatory.\r\n\r\nStrengths) Well-taught, great modules, useful assignments, reasonable exams.",
    "TOO FAST PACED please put more emphasis on UNDERSTANDING the material not just blowing through it",
    "Study hall and clicker questions are definite strengths. The way the course material was presented was a weakness; it was often very hard to digest and unpack.",
    "The formula sheets need to be in the exam and distributed at the same time as the exam.",
    "The strengths of the course are it's collaborative nature, extensive tutoring resources, and passionate instructors. The weaknesses of this course are the modules were not as helpful as in PHYS 171.",
    "Strengths Welcoming, so much support, so many resources and aides \r\nWeaknesses a bit fast paced at times, sometimes everything in the module isnt covered",
    "Honestly it was great as is. Maybe we could do more group projects or clicker questions because I realized I learned physics best in a group.",
    "The TAs, peers, and professors were all really supportive and kind. The modules are pretty confusing and honestly kinda unhelpful for learning the material, but the lecture slides and problem sets are very important for doing well",
    "This course is well structured but sometimes the lectures were unorganized or hard to follow.",
    "I didn't think the lectures were taught as clearly as in 170. I don't think we were prepared as well for the exams as we were for 170. Often, stuff came up on the exam which we had hardly practised before or done in lecture which I thought was unfair as despite studying an awful lot, I always got caught out on the exam.",
    "The biggest strength was the amount of resources provided to students. I greatly benefited from the numerous peer tutors and the teaching fellows. I really appreciated meeting with the peer tutors one-on-one, and I highly recommend that future students taking this course should take advantage of the peer tutors. This course could be improved by having one professor teach it, like last semester. Having the switch halfway through the semester forces students to adjust to an entirely different lecture and examination style, which was difficult.",
    "The strengths are the study hall community--there is typically help available for those who need it. Weakness: the modules start out mediocre and get worse--a definite decline from 170, and they're really less helpful.",
    "Strengths: Great system in place to help learning and ensure no one falls through the cracks. Best environment of any STEM class I've taken. Instructors who actually care about you (how refreshing).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: second semester seemed to be harder to understand, the modules became less helpful.",
    "Strengths: very supportive environment with many outlets for help and instruction outside of class. \r\nWeaknesses: very fast pace that is sometimes difficult for student with little background in physics and math.",
    "One weakness is that I felt like it was hard to express all my knowledge in the tight time constraints during exams. One strength was the study halls which allowed me to talk through problem sets and course material with other students and professors\/TFs.",
    "strengths: study hall, availability of professors\/ta\/peer tutors, fairness, growth mindset. this is a good class",
    "It is very similar in structure to physics 170 which I liked. The quizzes and exams felt harder than last semester though. The TA's were slower at grading, so it was hard to know our grades.",
    "strengths- great format of working with other students on psets, professors and TFs are extremely helpful, dedicated, and kind \r\nweaknesses- topics don't have as much as biology focus, lectures could be presented better",
    "This course had two instructors with drastically different teaching styles. The second half of the class was difficult material and to understand. It would be helpful to keep the instructor consistent. The physics study halls and office hours were a major strength of the class.",
    "Poor poor poor problem sets. Wildly unlike midterms. Significant discrepancy between TAs in grading. Good collaborative environment with an emphasis on support.",
    "The study halls are the most helpful part of this course and the professors were always very willing to support us and help us with the material. The professors I think need to be a bit more forceful in lecture in getting the attention of the class, as sometimes the students would not be paying very good attention or talking, and it was very distracting for the rest of us. Also I felt that the homework grading between the TAs was inconsistent both this semester and between the two semesters. Would be more helpful if the lectures lined up with the lab material.",
    "I think the class structure is fun, but the weakness is that the material is not very applicable to life in my opinion. Well, not my career. This is supposed to be a pre-med physics course but i did not learn much about physics in anatomy or physiology as I would have wanted to.",
    "This course was incredibly time consuming, stressful, and intense. The quizzes set a tone of panic and stress at the beginning of the week, which was carried through during too-long psets, and started again with the next week's quiz. The cycle of physics stress defined my weeks and my year. I found that the instructors did not work through helpful examples during class, leaving us struggling by ourselves during psets. These were longer and harder than necessary, and impossible to complete alone. I understand why you are trying to get us to work together, but this isn't fair for those with other time commitments or classes. The strength of this course, I suppose, was teaching me how to juggle a ton, be pretty miserable, and keep going anyway.",
    "Very good organization of course content, study halls and reviews. Sometimes, however, the derivations of equations can lead students astray.",
    "Study Hall was amazing",
    "It was a great course, its a lot of work but any physics class will be!",
    "The course is taught well and the instructors and resources available are phenomenal. However, there simply are not enough problems with which to practice and the problems encountered on the problem sets are usually much different than the problems encountered on the exams.",
    "The strengths for PHYS 171 lay in its dedicated teaching staff and its commitment to helping the students. Everything was made to facilitate student learning.",
    "The class lectures are good and engaging, the clicker questions are definitely good and help us maintain interest in the material. The TA and peer tutors are also a big strength since they are super helpful. The problem sets are definitely excessive in length, compared to other classes, and the fact that it is not possible to solve many of the problems without help is very frustrating and to me a weakness of the class.",
    "This course takes up an incredible amount of time (at least 10 or more hours outside of class) because this class has an inverted class structure in which students learn how to do problem types outside of class. It would have helped me if more of the class was dedicated towards learning the basics of different problem types. Also there NEED to be more TFs at every study hall.",
    "Strengths: highly engaged and enthusiastic teaching staff, excellent support system for individuals who need extra help, reasonable homework load and exams, interesting applications of material to life, option to do exam corrections, collaborative nature of problem sets and other learning, lots of feedback on my work\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of seemingly unnecessary derivations on the board, the course felt disorganized and behind schedule for the second half, poor synchronization with the Phys 166L course (lecture content was always behind lab content)",
    "This course really did not fulfill what was promised in the syllabus, as there were absolutely no biological applications unlike PHYS 170 so I'm not sure how it even differs from 181. The only biology module was cut out because we ran out of time and we were constantly behind compared to the lab! Unlike Simon who discussed biological applications in depth in class and tried to integrate them into the psets, the instructors made no effort to do so (one or two applications were mentioned in the last 5min of class). I thought the lectures were also quite poor - we went into endless derivations of equations which were not helpful for the psets or exams. The clicker questions were really helpful but I think the material emphasized in lecture should really be chosen better. Additionally, I felt like a lot of the quizzes were quite unfair - we were told to use the clicker questions to study but they rarely had anything to do with the questions or the lecture. Instead, they were based on pset questions which requires you to have started the pset on Sunday to do well on the quiz. I learnt the most doing the psets at study hall and peer tutor hours (who are the highlight of this course) because the lectures were so unhelpful. The first midterm was very fair but the second midterm and final felt much too difficult, with tricky questions applied to new situations we had not been introduced to in lecture. I also wish Professor Nagai had been more organized during the second midterm (forgetting the formula sheets and starting the exam late) because it put some of us at a significant disadvantage).",
    "Lectures could be slightly clearer",
    "Strengths - The material is organized logically and the exams are helpful in solidifying concepts!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - This introductory course demands a disproportionate amount of time.",
    "Information density seems to taper off as time goes on in the class.  By the end, it felt like I didn't really gain anything by going to lecture.\r\nThat being said, everything you need to know is in the modules\/lecture slides and the exams pair well with the material presented.",
    "The course material is more difficult than the previous semester. I think lectures can be improved to help students conceptually understand the material. The modules could also be more detailed to show the reasoning and math used to solve different problems.",
    "The notes supplied do not match up with the questions that will be asked. The notes for this semester lacked examples and were very hard to follow. Also, we spent too much time proving equations before using them in class.",
    "Students are extremely well supported in this course, and it is very evident that a lot of thought has been put into it, which is quite unprecedented for STEM courses. One weakness might be the decreasing relevance of the modules with respect to homework problems and exam questions."

   "comments": [
    "only if you need to take it",
    "If necessary, take PHYS 171 over PHYS 181.",
    "do not take this course  unless you have to. i can think of NO reason why anyone would choose to have this experience. please please please if you want an intellectually challenging SC credit find something else. anything else",
    "Not as good as 170, but still definitely a good course.",
    "Not even to my worst enemy",
    "If you do not need the course, I would not recommend it, but if you are looking for a challenge, ready to work hard, and are passionate about physics, I would recommend it.",
    "Yes. More reasonable than 181. Wont consume your entire week. Interesting material.",
    "I would as an alternative to 181. The math is easier and most of all, this class creates a community!",
    "Yes, it is so much better than 180\/181 so if you have the choice between the two definitely take 170\/171.",
    "I would recommend it 100% over 181 just because the grading is more transparent, the material is probably easier, and I really found that I made a lot of good friends in this class. It was probably one of the least painful STEM classes I've taken. GO TO THE STUDY HALLS THOUGH. And do the problem sets. Honestly, I learned everything through working the p-sets.",
    "Don't take this unless you have to, but if you do, it's not that bad. Just go to study hall regularly and take advantage of TF and peer tutor office hours for the psets.",
    "Only if you need it for your major",
    "No, I would not recommend this course. It caused an excessive amount of anxiety and frustration throughout the semester, but if you absolutely have to take PHYS 171 or 181, shop both.",
    "Would not recommend, but if you're reading this you probably need to take physics. Both professors tried their best, but lectures were not always interesting. Psets take an enormous amount of hours and require TA help almost without fail. Weekly quizzes are often frustrating. So glad to have completed this class. You will learn things that are interesting, but it is not a light class.",
    "Take it if you need to. It gets dense and lectures start getting really confusing toward the end--they try to derive things to show significance but don't adequately tell us the importance\/relevance of each equation. My engagement definitely declined by the end--not the best, not the worst, take it if you need to.",
    "If you have to take physics and biology, take this over 180\/181. It shows you how cool physics can be.",
    "This class is a lot of work, but the grading and exams are fair and you'll learn a lot. I'd recommend this to any students looking to take introductory physics and interested in the sciences.",
    "Yes, the course taught me physical concepts without going into super rigorous calculus.",
    "You do what you gotta do. But PHYS 171 is a million times better than PHYS 170, there is hope yet.",
    "yes...take physics 170\/171. you will learn a lot about critical thinking, and they're extremely fair courses. great teachers and peer tutors!!!1",
    "Yes. It is a good class especially if you are pre-med.",
    "Better than 181 unless you want to do really difficult calculus. Great to work with others.",
    "Don't take this class unless you need to.",
    "You probably have to take it. So just take it.",
    "If you are pre-med definitely take the 170-171 sequence! It is much more manageable than the 180-181 and you learn a ton without begin stressed out with impossible problems or difficult math. The professors are very supportive and understanding and I felt that there was a real community in the class and at the study halls. The fact that there are corrections on the midterms and so much help on the p-sets makes the work very manageable if you put th time in the class. This was a natural extension of 170 and I felt that it was either as or less challenging.",
    "The first half is good. If Rona is teaching it , yes. Professor Daisuke is chill, but he is a mess. He forgot to give us formula sheets for the second exam, which is why the average was so low.",
    "Do not take this course unless you are in love with physics, have to, or have a TON of extra time on your hands you are looking to kill. I mean 25+ hours a week time. It is hard, boring, and relentless.",
    "Definitely if you are a pre-med.",
    "Yes! If you have to take physics, best way to go!",
    "You should take this course if you are a pre-med. Beware that this class does not deal with quantifiable measurements like 181 does (we never encountered resistors that had a resistance of 30 ohms; we would simply call it \"resistor 1\"). If you took Physics 170, though, you should probably also take this course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend PHYS 171 to anyone interested in medicine and the life sciences. It was definitely more applicable than PHYS 181 for someone who is pre-health.",
    "no.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student interested in obtaining a solid foundation in physics. It is a heavy class in terms of workload but definitely worth it especially as a premed.",
    "It's required for a lot of people and I doubt you'd want to take it otherwise unless you haven't ever taken physics and think you might be really into it (but also have a decent multivar background)",
    "I would absolutely recommend the Physics 170-171 sequence to anyone who needs to take introductory physics courses. The material does not assume any background knowledge of physics, and all necessary math is taught in class. The teaching staff (instructors, TAs, and peer tutors) are phenomenal and make it easy to seek help when needed. There are many opportunities to improve your grade, whether through study hall or exam corrections or appointments with the instructors. The course makes the material interesting and relevant to students who enjoy chemistry and biology. The teaching staff were kind, enthusiastic, and welcoming.",
    "While PHYS 170 was actually enjoyable and I feel like I took a lot from it, PHYS 171 was very disorganized, had no biological applications and harder\/unfair exams. I don't know how it compares to PHYS 180 but I do not recommend this course unless you absolutely have to take it.",
    "People seem to find this course poorly-structured, but I actually thought the wide variety of topics was really interesting. Problem solving is emphasized over rote memorization, and class engagement is encouraged.",
    "Honestly, I ended up enjoying this course (barring the time demands)! They really try to enrich the student experience and you will actually learn some cool things given you invest the time, which is the hard part. All in all, would recommend if it is a part of requirements for your major or pre-med!",
    "The material is harder than the previous semester. The lectures were not that helpful for me. I had to look through the modules multiple times and work through many problems to understand the material.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. A lot of the material had to be inferred, which was very frustrating for me as someone who had never seen many of these concepts before.",
    "Not really but you probably have to take it as a requirement anyway."
