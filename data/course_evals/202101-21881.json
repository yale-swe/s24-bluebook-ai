                "Strengths: the Professor is a wonderful instructor and was very accommodating to the needs of the students. I really appreciated how she took time to explain some of the nuances and differences between actual spoken French in France, and the French we learned in class. Weaknesses: we received very few grades throughout the semester, so it was difficult to gage our standing and receive feedback. It would have been nice to have had more feedback on our spoken exams and compositions in order to know where we needed to improve. We could not see our cumulative grades in canvas for the whole semester. In terms of the general L2 curriculum, it seems like the French Department values quantity over quality because we learned a host of new tenses this semester but I did not feel like we spent enough time learning about the nuances of each and how to properly employ them, which made the course more challenging than it needed to be. Overall, I did enjoy this course, and would take another class from this Professor as well.",

                "Yes, I would, but I would urge the French department to reevaluate the amount of information covered in the L2 curriculum in order to allow us more time to become comfortable with everything presented.
