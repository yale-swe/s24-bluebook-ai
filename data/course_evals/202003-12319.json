While the focus on grammar is pretty challenging, it is definitely useful and I feel like I gained a better grasp on the French language.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course is embarrassingly euro-centric. For a language that has been imposed on so many different people around the world, it was so upsetting to see that the readings and other media that we engaged with were both outdated and focused on white (European) narratives. There was only one text that focused on non-white people and that took place after 1970. There are so many French writers of African and Asian decent that easily could have been incorporated into the curriculum to teach similar (if not more dynamic) lessons than the ones this course focused on.",
                "I wish we would have learned more about modern France and other francophone countries, rather than only focusing on historical pieces.",
                "A strength of this course is the course book\/textbook, which had all the vocabulary lists and grammatical information and was structured well. A weakness of this course is that it is structured so that the students primarily learn the grammar by themselves, and are expected to understand and utilize it in class.",
                "The small class size improved conversation. I appreciated the varied works we studied, from film to short story to literature. I wish that the reading\/watching list had been more representative of the diversity of the Francophone world as we focused mainly on European stories.",
                "The books you have to read are pretty interesting and discussing or writing about them can be fun. The grammar exercises are a bit excessive and probably should be cut down to reinforce certain rules or exceptions. The videos and movies are pretty fun to watch too.",
                "this course does an excellent job of building vocab, but there could have been more in class attention given to ensuring that students understood the grammar formations they review for homework"

The work is very self-motivated, so in order to improve, a student would really need to do every single assignment, read all the books, and watch all the films.",

They should already be proficient in French as the course does not allow much time for re-learning grammar. The student should expect each of the three exams to cover a lot, perhaps too much material. The inclusion of short grammar quizzes could help alleviate some of this pressure.",
