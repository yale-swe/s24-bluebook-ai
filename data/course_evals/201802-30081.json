    "Coming into this class as a high school student taking the summer course I had minimal lab knowledge. Through this class I learned how to pour a protein column, run protein gels, do immunoblots, and how to use advanced microscopy to view urchin, mouse and human cells. I also learned how to better give a talk\/presentation in front of an audience and how to fertilize sea urchin eggs.",
    "I learned a lot about the different ways in which to wrk in a lab s well as how they relate to the principles in biology. This course in conjunction with the bio 101-104 sequence really helped to put the concepts to work in the lab setting rather than simply learning about them in the classroom. I think my technique and knowledge of lab procedures improved immensely during the time in this lab."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course include its fun and interesting curriculum. The course also has excellent equipment and a great teacher. It could be improved with time managment and planning at least in the summer course since we always ended about an hour later than usual.",
    "All strengths!",
    "Strengths were that Professor Wolenski was very thorough and made the things we were learning about applicable without having realistic expectations. A weakness would be that the class went over time frequently"

   "comments": [
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student who enjoys intense hands on lab work. This class is most definitely not a lecture class, as every minute was filled with doing a lab and learning by hands on interaction. Each student gets to run their own materials and do everything the teacher mentions, so it is very rewarding when the entire class yields exciting results together.",
    "Yes! Wonderful course with a wonderful professor. Wolenski is excellent and makes the class fun, relevant, and engaging.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student because it was a great basis for how to work in a lab as well as how the different lab procedures were done. The expectations were very fair and when there was outside of class work it was all in relation to labs we have done in class or ways in which we can prepare to one day work in a lab ourselves"
