                "This course is an introduction to a series of study areas in science and technology studies, including foundational texts and case studies.",
                "So much! I learned about how ideologies of race/gender/capitalism can be reinforced/reflected/challenged in the technology, both commonplace and speculative, we use on a daily basis -- from Uber algorithms to robot butlers. This course encouraged me to pay more attention to/be more critical of technological innovation and think carefully about how it might be otherwise. Learned a lot of foundation science & technology studies/WGSS concepts (e.g. I finally read some Donna Haraway) and applied them to a range of technologies.",
                "I learned a lot about feminist science and technology studies. The course started with a lot of readings that gave me a strong foundation in the field and I really enjoyed exploring different areas in the field.",
                "It was a great survey course for being introduced to science and technology studies, and I learned a lot about the cult of technoscience and how the expectations and hopes we have for a technology come well before the technology itself.",
                "this was a great, slightly more advanced course in feminist sts. I learned so much about how technology reinforces differences in race, gender, etc. but more importantly how we can imagine technological systems that challenge normative subjectivity. something really cool was how professor vora encouraged us to apply the theories learned in class. instead of typical reading responses a lot of the weekly assignments involved creating our own technoimaginaries which was really cool",
                "I learned about feminist science and technology studies (fSTS); the colonialism, misogyny, and racism inherent in many commonplace algorithms, robots, AI infrastructure, and media; and some interventions that we can take to counteract these influences"

            "comments": [
                "The course is a good introduction to current issues in STS and a history of the field, but it doesn't go very in depth on any topic.",
                "Strengths: Professor Vora is a passionate and engaging instructor! The readings were interesting and varied. \r\nWeaknesses: I would've appreciated more scaffolding surrounding the final paper, and a better idea of our grades going into it. The student presentations during each class were enjoyable and relevant but sometimes felt like they took too long and didn't leave enough time for discussion.",
                "Strengths: one of the best seminars I've taken! Especially at the beginning of the semester, Dr. Vora did a great job structuring discussion (and introducing interesting content) so that it wasn't aimless, allowed everyone to share, and still felt natural and engaging. Reading were mostly fantastic and pretty manageable. Final essay was flexible, and Dr. Vora provided adequate support both in and out of class. Usually we had some sort of out-of-class 'lab' that provided an interesting topic for small-group discussion, although sometimes the whole-group discussion was so engaging that I wished we had more time for it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: My only critique (which I have of a lot of seminars) is that we all had to present on the readings at some point. The presentations were pretty redundant if you'd done the readings, and they kept getting longer (and including fewer whole-group discussions) over the course of the semester. Maybe it'd be better to have different students lead a discussion each week, or else put a stricter time limit on presentations, since they felt like a waste of valuable class time!",
                "I really loved the readings and the professor had really engaging, thoughtful contributions. However, the structure of the course relied a lot on student-led discussion presentations that I think ended up taking time away from what could've been very engaging conversations.",
                "Strengths - student presentations, interesting & diverse readings, cool guest speakers, working groups, wide range of assignments \r\nWeaknesses - I think the course could have benefitted from a more of a leminar format. I would have liked to hear more from Professor Vora.",
                "strengths: really great set of readings ... so much freedom with the final paper! super interesting topics covered in class + i learned a lot from others in this class because everyone seemed to approach the challenge of creating better technological futures in a way that was unique to them. weaknesses: sometimes it felt like I was only dipping my toes in such an interesting field -- i actually wish the assignments challenged us to go a little further... also, so much of the class is taken up by student reading presentations and on one or two occasions the presentations were a little substandard (that said, prof. vora did a great job with filling up the 2hrs with other activities as well and some really interesting guest speakers!!),",
                "I think the course would benefit from being longer and smaller and/or changing the class structure. I appreciated the beginning and end sections of class for a summary, but I think that it ultimately took away from my learning in the course. Sometimes, the questions we were pondering felt so large that we couldn't even begin to address them in the ~30-45 minutes left we had for continuous discussion. I would also have benefited from formal mechanisms for feedback- I never knew if I was doing well in the course or not, which is true even as I write this review."

                "Yes!",
                "Yes! One of the best seminars I've ever taken. If you're interested in science & technology studies, want to take a pretty approachable WGSS/ER&M class with a tech lens, or just generally like thinking about tech, you'll enjoy -- the class included a range of STEM majors, HSHM majors, and random people like me. You get to read some of the STS classics (e.g. Donna Haraway) and some newer writers. This class encourages you to think more deeply about the tech you use everyday.",
                "I would recommend this class to any student in the science. This course offers a fruitful framework for considering your own engagement with the science in a new light and your expertise also contributes to a richer class discussion.",
                "Yes I would! The material was very interesting and Professor Vora was really good at answering peoples' questions and thoughtfully approaching nuanced topics. I just think the class would benefit from less student-led discussions to make the most of class time.",
                "Yes - I tjink the material was super interesting and highly relevant for anyone living in the modern era. The reading could be a lot sometimes, but the class was a low-pressure environment that made me feel pretty comfortable sharing my thoughts and approaching the assignments. We also had sick guest speakers, and it was amazing to read a chapter by an author or watch a documentary and then have the author or director speak to the class.",
                "ABSOLUTELY!!! so much to learn from this course!! so many important issues that we really need to consider that we often overlook!! take it take it take it!! i learned so much not only from the course materials but also from my peers! our wednesday seminars were definitely a highlight in the week for me :)",
                "I think I would. The topics are fascinating and the reading material is excellent, but I do think the course structure should be changed in order to get the most out of the material. I left the class feeling that it was just 'good', but I feel like it has so much more potential. There was also literally zero feedback, and as I write this review I have no idea how well I did in the class."
