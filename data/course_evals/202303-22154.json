It was a great introduction to college seminars and I learned a lot from my classmates and my instructor. Professor Thompson leads a very student-focused seminar that allows opportunities to explore new ideas and question each other around key passages.",
                "This course made me a better writer, reader, and thinker. I am eternally grateful to Prof. Thompson for her insights, mentorship, and skilled classroom leadership. Prof. Thompson runs the most organized, engaging, and interesting seminar I have ever participated in. Her notes for each text discussed were longer than the text itself! With her guidance, DS H&P gave me an invaluable understanding of the development of historical and political thought from the Hebrew Bible to Aquinas. I now have an in-depth understanding of the intersection of religion, politics, history, and storytelling.",

A lot of people complain about the workload for DS, and doing the reading is very important in this section because pretty much everything is covered in class, but I think the workload (while intense) is certainly manageable, and I feel like I gained something from every reading because we talked about it all.",
                "The strengths are so numerous they would be impossible to list here. See my answer to Question 1 for more detail. The only (minor) weakness which comes to mind is the length of the readings. It was a struggle every class to discuss each section, and at times, some of the sections assigned (especially from \"City of God\") seemed superfluous.",

                "I would highly recommend this course to other students. Anyone who seeks a greater understanding of our world in all of its political and historical complexity needs to take this course. You will leave Prof. Thompson's class with a deep understanding of what it means to be a \"political animal\" and a citizen.",
                "If you can, take H&Por really any classwith Prof. Thompson. She is a gem. The reading load in DS is heavy, of course, but Prof. Thompson does a phenomenal job of picking out important sections and guiding the class towards them without overly controlling the discussion. Of my three fall DS seminars, I would say that this was the best as far as student participation, largely due to Prof. Thompson's ability to engage everyone and lead a marvelous discussion.",
                "You have to be ready to do a lot of readying and work, but if you are interested in history its a really cool form of learning."
