                "This is the only English class I have ever taken that has actually taught me how to become a stronger writer. The Genre of the Sentence hones in on the words themselves, what you are trying to say, what you are intentionally not saying. Now, I feel as though the sentences I write have meaning. Beyond the improved execution of writing, the consistent weekly assignments spurred my creativity. Selecting a topic to write about  totally unprompted  was a struggle in the beginning weeks, but soon, topics come naturally. In the middle of the day, something happens to you and you think \"Oh, this would make a great piece.\" That is what makes this class stand out  you become a creative.",
                "this course helped me become more confident in the act of writingsometimes it is enough to just write something down instead of waiting for what feels clever or beautiful to hit you.",
                "I learned how to write a sentence. I got much better at listening for the rhythm in my writing, at reading prose through the lens of the sentence, and observing without exaggerating or sentimentalizing reality.",
                "I became a much better writer through this course. Verlyn stripped away almost everything that was hindering our writing and then helped us build back up towards complexity, all while teaching us how to write as clearly as possible. I also learned to trust myself more as a writer.",
                "You will learn to write much more succinct and powerful sentences. Throw away everything you know about writing academic papers. Beautiful language is born from beautiful ideas written simply.",
                "A big increase in my ability to craft excellent sentences and to write creative nonfiction as a whole. My prose got much clearer and more efficient.",
                "I certainly became a better writer! I feel like I have a better grasp at writing interesting, engaging, narrative prose, and have a better ability to write about myselr.",
                "I learned to be both a better writer and a better reader. I also learned how deeply intertwined those two skills are.",
                "I became a more confident writer. I learned how to edit pieces, what questions I should ask when I'm reading, and what stylistic choices I should be paying attention to. I developed practical skills on reading and writing. Additionally, I learned how to have a feel for reading and writing that only comes with continuous practice.",
                "So much, of course, so I probably don't need to join the chorus. But obviously this is the best creative writing class at Yale. Why? Because Verlyn holds his line. He is a hard-ass in the exact was that he is a softie. And I think that is a combination that makes most people (subscribed and sucking up to a more conventional work-writing practice...) feel very *weird*. By weird I mean, insecure. By insecure I mean, threatened. Anyway: that's all to say: it's possible to encounter all sorts of defensiveness and untoward criticism and stuff when walking Verlyn's path, so, that's the only Warning I'd give. Can you tell?: The insights gleaned here are mainly psychological. They are insights about what motivates writing, what goes into and what comes from writing, and also how much random whackassery is smothering writing/writers/artists/creative people/everyone. It's about being gentle with yourself, which a very scary concept for everyone deeply invested in disciplinarian penal workaholic low-self-worth capitalist culture. I'm loading this with my own opinions, obviously. But, see, I feel alright about my own opinions within the context of Verlyn's class -- there's a good gardening practice that he invites, cultivating things like opinions and perspectives. Oh, I should just say what we really learned: to notice. That's what he would say probably. To notice things and write them down. It's just that being able to do that requires a slow deconstruction of mental/emotional/psychological blocks. Sometimes it's not slow; sometimes it's precipitous, but there's care in it. Etc etc! Take this class if you can get in and leave mommy issues at door: humility or bust*.   *waste effort resisting the good."

                "There is actually no weakness to this course, but I would recommend going to office hours to get personalized comments with Verlyn. The class structure of workshopping and discussion of failed sentences is amazing. I personally love line edits, so I believe that to be a top strength of this class. But, and not to be reductive, having Verlyn teach is the strength of this course  he is an amazing instructor and will help cultivate your sentences and writing in such a way that you will be better able to discover your voice!!!",
                "verlyn is an incredibly kind editorgo to his office hours every week. thats where youll get more specific feedback and ask questions about your writing.",
                "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to everyone at Yale, regardless of major. Verlyn is a wonderful writer and teacher who truly cares about his students. This class changed the way I see and interact with the world. One of the biggest strengths of this class is the people. Throughout the semester, you could really see everyone's voices develop in the pieces that we workshopped. It's such a uniquely vulnerable space and I loved the people in my seminar.",
                "The strengths of the course are the workload, which is curated to give you lots of time to write, the instruction, and the experience of reading other students' work. I'd say that the pieces Verlyn chooses for us to read each week could be a little more diverse in subject matter (he's interested in nature, so there was a lot of nature writing on the syllabus.)",
                "Strengths: small class size, a lot of trust and vulnerability in the classroom, getting to produce two pages of work every week for an entire semester. \r\nWeaknesses: It would have been nice to have spent less time chatting about process at the beginning of the class and instead to have used that time to workshop more people with more frequency.",
                "strengths - Verlyn is a very caring professor who creates excellent seminar and office hours environments. Great syllabus of readings, consistent class structure was great. No weaknesses I can think of, except it would have been nice to have gotten some end of term summative feedback from Verlyn.",
                "Only strengths. The Google Drive format where everyone can see each others' works can be a bit intimidating at first, but after the first week you realize how wonderful it is. Everything about the way this course is structured develops you as a writer without needing to resort to the crushing intensity other writing classes sometimes do.",
                "Verlyn's class structure is the foundation for class success. It is simple, there are no surprises. You know what you are getting into each week.",
                "Many of us did agree that we could spend even more class time in workshop. There was (maybe) a craving to read everyone's piece every week, not two people's. But maybe it was better this way; maybe three or four would be ideal. It's not exactly clear. The class did all it needed to do, regardless, and there's something good about its initial semi-privacy. Audience, but not too much audience. Just the threat of audience! (The hope of audience.) There's definitely a more direct relationship between a student and themself, and between student and Verlyn, more than there is between student and peanut gallery (though peanut gallery becomes beloved). \r\n\r\nWeird little feelings (disappointments) about pronouns from two or more non-binary kids in class, in such a discursive/intimate group. All the students were in-the-know so to speak but not our professor. Self-identifications were... ignored? Forgotten? I can't tell, but, to incoming students: if you want to be referred to in a certain way, I think you can be, but you need to say so out loud in class, not just in your writings. Not really much of an issue, but still. \r\n\r\nAlso you have to go to office hours. It's still worth your time if you don't but it's exponentially more valuable to visit Verlyn in person. He's great don't be shy."

To be short, I am concerned that no class at Yale will live up to \"The Genre of a Sentence.\" This is a serious concern of mine that my schedule peaked too early, and that this is the best class I will ever take. I genuinely would not know how a course could be better than this one.",
                "If you take this course, youll never be able to escape Verlyn. When you write emails, academic papers, course evaluationsyoull think, How are my sentences? Would Verlyn approve? AnythingANYTHING!that you wrote before this class wont live up to your new found standards.\r\n\r\nThis class is the crown jewel of Yale creative writing. Of any Yale course, Genre of the Sentence has the most intentional workload. Theres no busywork. No final project. The reading load is light and always helpfulan unusual occurrence at Yale. There are no reading responses. Just two pages of writing a week. Two pages of supposed-to-be-perfect sentences.\r\n\r\nEvery week, Verlyn will line edit the sloppy metaphors, dependent clauses, and poor word choices. The first few pieces have many embarrassingly bad sentences. Verlyn shares these miserable bits of writing with the classeveryone contributes. Over time, the poor-sentences handout becomes shorter, then disappears. Verlyn, the scribbling editor, becomes Verlyn, the confidence booster. \r\n\r\nMidway through the course, everyone sounds alikelots of short sentences. Should I have listened to all that advice? Its a bit disconcerting. At the end of the course, those doubts vanish. Everyones writing truly becomes their own. The sentences get longer, but remain clear. Garbled writing transforms into writing that shows humor, sorrow, love, kindness, joy, and happiness. There were more laughs, awws, and even some tears during the weekly workshops.\r\n\r\nIts impossible to not become a better writer during Genre of the Sentence. I enjoyed every moment of the class.",

                "Yes--this class was amazing. The environment is a very comfortable and collaborative one. Verlyn doesn't try to break you down in order to build you up, you just work on building up together. You will develop a strong ear for rhythm and a critical eye for sentences. By the end of the semester, you can write confidently in your own style while keeping in consideration the suggestions Verlyn makes. I would highly recommend going to office hours as much as possible.",
                "YES! I recommend this to anyone who is serious about improving their prose on a micro level. It's probably the best ratio of learning to hours of work of any class I've taken at Yale. Verlyn is such a wonderful teacher (especially if you attend his office hours), and he cultivates such a wonderful and supportive group of students in his seminar. This class was truly like therapy for me this semester. Take it not just to improve your writing but to learn more about yourself.",
                "YES! completely recommend it, if you want to be a better writer this is the class for you. At first you feel like everything you know about writing has been deconstructed, but don't be dissuaded, you are built back up with an amazing skillset by the end.",
                "I cannot recommend this course highly enough. If you can get in, you should take it. Between the great format of the course, the fantastic readings, and the environment you create as a class, it's one of the most enjoyable classes at Yale. Not to mention the enormous growth you'll definitely experience as a writer.",
