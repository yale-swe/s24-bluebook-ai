                "Perfect course because I can't think of any ways I would alter it.",
                "The course is taught enthusiastically with a lot of content. It could be improved maybe by providing more office hours - many other classes outside of the BIOL sequence has many office hours with graduate TFs. The BIOL sequence stands alone in having absolutely no office hours with graduate TFs.",
                "strength: the first class was inspiring\r\nweakness: no practice exams",
                "The professor is awesome and the lectures are great.",
                "Strengths: lectures were interesting, material is thoroughly explained, and concepts are pretty clear. Also, because there is a midterm and (noncumulative) final, there is a manageable amount of material on big assessments. Psets were straightforward and relevant. Weaknesses: lecture videos are not made available until right before the midterm/final, section papers are unhelpful/often feel unrelated to the material. Also, midterms/finals are graded very harshly, despite being not that complicated.",
                "Strengths: Provides the general information needed to have a basic understanding of evolution and ecology, some interesting topics\r\nWeakness: I felt like some of the questions on the exam didn't question you on the broad topics in general but focused on tiny details that were barely touched on",
                "great class, lots of memorization",
                "Strengths: very engaging lectures that were very easy to follow. Weakness: we were given a LOT of examples of species when learning different concepts and it was difficult to discern what we were expected to know.",
                "The weekly discussion sections where we read the paper was really helpful for understanding key concepts and learning how to read and analyze scientific papers. One thing that could possibly improve would be to have more guidance on the final writing assignment where we analyze a clade of our choice, although I thoroughly enjoyed this project nontheless.",
                "Strengths were that the lectures were well organized in terms of using lecture slides. It could be improved by making it more explicit what would be tested on exams.",
                "Strengths: I actually really liked the writing assignment and the papers were pretty interesting as well, the lectures were pretty engaging, \r\nWeaknesses: I think it could be helpful to have some sort of weekly outline like we had in other parts of the bio sequence, I think that would help a lot with reviewing for exams and having checkpoints of what we need to know as we go along",
                "Good pacing; streamlining content would be helpful",
                "This was the best course out of the bio sequence, but I still found myself bored at many of the lectures.",
                "Strengths: concepts well highlighted that we are expected to know \r\n\r\nWeakness: no practice problems posted to help with the exam (other than 2 psets that weren't too helpful). wish classes were more engaging (maybe with vids). expected to know so much vocabulary and info",
                "Strengths: the topics presented in lecture were never too confusing, the professor was engaging during lecture, the assignments were reasonable in difficulty/length and due on dates that made sense with the course; Weaknesses: the course is very memorization focused, evolution and specific evolutionary events were covered much more in-depth than systems of ecology",
                "A strength of the course is that there are a lot of examples for each of the concepts or terms that we learn so we can really understand what they mean and why they are important. A weakness of the course is that too much content gets packed into the half semester that the class runs for, however the content is well presented; it's just a lot to keep track of especially if you are taking a few other STEM classes in the same semester.",
                "The course required a lot of memorization rather than comprehension of concepts. The vocabulary was the main way it went beyond high school biology courses, not providing much new material.",
                "Strengths: topics can be well organized and mesh well together, I enjoyed the content \r\nWeakness: can require quite a bit of memorization. On exams I found it annoying when non-english names were used for animals or species, it seemed like an unnecessary challenge for an exam",
                "I can't think of any weaknesses. Very well taught with a manageable workload. It is very memorization heavy, which some people may not like but I think it's just a different way of learning the content.",
                "very interesting\r\na bit repetitive",
                "Strengths:\r\nExams were not too difficult and the work was spread out every week so we got different types of assignments \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nA lot of memorisation especially of the trees but this is understandable since it is important",
                "Strengths: The professor was engaging and the material was clearly conveyed.\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Super great TAs, great professor, interesting content. Wish class was curved because I think there is a big learning curve coming from the way you study for 103 versus 104.",
                "Strengths are great lectures Tommy Near is the GOAT.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses are discussion sections. I dont feel like engagement was that high or TFs were adequately prepped. Also the final test had a lot of typos.",
                "The actual midterms that were given were not very close to material that was reviewed in class. Some of the stuff we had never seen before, and was it was odd that the general theme of the class was placing an importance on critical thinking, but the midterms required us to memorize quite pointless things like all the species in a certain phylogeny, what is the point of that? I understand memorizing terms, but trees? Weird move.",
                "Engaging lectures, lots of content and information, professor didn't make his expectations for the midterm clear, midterm exams weren't completely accurate representation of the material",
                "This course was presented very well and the homework assignments were both a good learning experience and quite fun!",
                "I loved the interactive format of this class where there were moments for reflection on the slides before we proceeded. I also think that the breaks were very nice to have as I could ask my classmates for clarification between the lecture. There were no weaknesses, overall it was a great course.",
                "The slides were not amazing and I feel like we often learned information out of order.",
                "This course can be improved if students were given more practice questions for the exams we have to take and if we had the chance to do more problem sets instead of the tedious writing assignment. I would love to see more transparency in the course when it comes to how exams were graded.",
                "Each class felt extremely long and content heavy and sometimes it was hard to parse out.",
                "one strength is the workload. There was usually only one assignment due a week, but it was unfortunate that we had a pset due the same week as the midterm. One weakness is discussion sections. Reading scientific papers wasnt helpful especially when the content itself was confusing. I think discussion sections would be better spent going over lecture topics even part of the time.",
                "This course used Ed Discussion to answer student questions; but, whereas the forum was a reliable site to ask questions in BIOL 101-103, a good portion of student questions simply went unanswered in BIOL 104. Helen Stone (a TF) answered a ton of questions, and Prof Near answered a good number, so I would highlight them as being very helpful. But while Ed Discussion proved very effective in the rest of the bio sequence, it was poorly monitored in 104.",
                "Strengths: Prof Near was clearly enthusiastic about the material, and so it was taught in such a way that students could engage with it too. \r\nWeaknesses: none in particular",
                "I loved this course, I thought the professor explained the concepts very well and had very detailed notes for us to reference. I do think it would have been helpful to have the lecture recordings released prior to the week of the exam.",
                "The course was genuinely super interesting and taught in an engaging way. As with all of the BIOL modules, the giant lecture format is never the most inspiring but perhaps that's just the way it has to be as an intro level course.",
                "Not enough clear instructions as to what would be covered on the test. Everything was literally on it but to an exaggerated extent. DId not assume we would need to know every single listed example of the latin names of species.",
                "This course is well-organized in that it follows the format of the biology sequence. I thought the content covered was uninteresting and found it challenging to engage with. I also disagreed with the decision to make the \"final exam\" on the last week of classes, which to me, increased the stakes and made the last week of classes quite stressful because I had to juggle studying for this class' last exam and also finish up all the work for my other classes. I wish finals happened during finals week.",
                "Well taught but needs to be structurally revisited, syllabus and assignments felt disjointed and discussion sections were not at all connected or coherent with the rest of the course",
                "Good professor, not too challenging",
                "A lot of readings from scientific articles which was helpful",
                "The strength of this course is that it was more direct and straightforward compared to the other intro Bio courses; certainly a break from the molecular material weve covered for 3/4ths of the year.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course lies in the terminology we are assumed to know already.",
                "The tests are very difficult, and the TA's make various mistakes when grading the exams.",
                "This course was taught well and was engaging.",

                "The course was taught well and had quite a bit of support, but discussion section often felt unhelpful at times. I found enrichment to be a great resource.",
                "Professor Near was a great professor that made his lectures very interesting to follow along with. The required readings for discussion section also helped my understanding of the course.",
                "Strengths: Prof Near is the best, most engaging professor in the BIOL sequence\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures are a bit too long",
                "The strengths of this course was Professor Near, who did a great job directing the class. The class was structured in an effective way to allow students to understand each concept with relation to each lesson.\r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by the use of weekly discussion sections. These could be made to more effectively allows students to ask questions about the week's content and engage in relevant discussion. Often, many of the students had not read the assigned paper prior to attending discussion.",
                "Strengths: Homeworks are very reasonable and the material is interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The exams are a bit too difficult even though bio104 is supposed to be the \"easy\" module of the bio sequence. The writing assignment was educational yet very tedious.",
                "The strength of this class is that the material is interesting and applicable. The weakness of this class is that a lot of information is based purely on memorization of the material, including minute details that you wouldn't expect on exams.",
                "Great balance of workload compared to other courses in the bio sequence. Lectures were pretty boring.",
                "I love prof Near. Sections could be better used as help with concepts then learning new stuff with papers.",
                "The strengths were the problem sets and homework. It could be improved if the class was more informed on what material presented in lecture was relevant and would be tested.",
                "Professor Near is incredible and made the class easy to understand. The work was light as well, though it would have been nice to have more practice problems before the exams. The exams were fair, though lengthy.",
                "The lecture style was great!",
                "Amazing course that always pushed me. The discussion sections could have been a bit more engaging.",
                "Lots of memorization. Content is pretty clear though.",
                "Strengths: Professor was engaging and gave lots of breaks which were super helpful\r\nWeaknesses: In Bio 103 we were given short study guides which were amazing and I would be nice to have those in Bio 104 as well.",
                "The strength of the course that its a good foundational course to biology major and most people take it as a pre-requisite. The weakness is that the course is heavy on memorization.",
                "I thought the assignments were reasonable and the course content was interesting. I would've preferred if the lecture recordings were released the day of each class, because it was very easy to miss things during live lectures. Also, it would've been helpful to have some sort of outline of what topics to study for the exams, similar to in earlier BIOL sequence classes.",
                "One strength is that many real world examples were provided, which made it easier to understand complicated topics. Additionally, the class was very interactive, so you were always actively thinking during lecture.",
                "The lectures were enjoyable. I felt the professor was really engaged in the content himself, which inspired me to engage with the content much more thoroughly.",
                "Strengths: clear slides, engaging lectures\r\nWeaknesses: some course content did not feel relevant/applicable; exams emphasized detail-oriented, rather than conceptual questions",
                "Weakness: Exam rubrics are not released so students can not see what they were being marked off for",
                "I think that one of the strengths of this course is that it feels more straight forward than BIOL 101-103 (certainly more so than 102 and 103). BIOL 102 and 103 are very focused on applied knowledge and experimental techniques, which can definitely be challenging at times. While BIOL 104 could certainly be tedious at times with all the terminology you have to memorize, I still enjoyed learning the material more because I thought it was more straight forward (and perhaps because I like the areas of biology covered in 104 more than the areas covered in the other three modules). I don't think this course really had any weaknesses and I can't identify anything that I think should be changed.",
                "Tests were hard.",
                "The exams weighing a good portion of a grade put too much pressure on me throughout the course.",
                "Very manageable but much memorization and not enough application",
                "The strengths of this course were the discussion sections. Learning about evolutionary processes and examples of them in class was very informative but I found the information really coming together as we discussed them in section. The weekly paper that went into depth about these processes cemented my foundation and them and helped me recall how they function during the tests.",
                "Strengths were the distribution of assignments (the problem sets, the essays, and the exams were spaced pretty evenly), the lectures (Professor Near was a very engaging lecturer and was very intentional about what he taught and using strategies to keep us engaged during lectures), and the discussion sections (I thought the papers were fairly interesting and on topic). Weaknesses were how crammed the last week felt, with the final exam being moved up to the last day of class, which I think hurt our performance more than benefit it."

                "Yes. Great professor, interesting material.",
                "Yes and no - it is an interesting class, but if you don't need it for a prerequisite, it might be a slightly difficult class.",
                "Yes! For students interested in biology and possible STEM majors, the entire BIOL sequence is a great thing to take.",
                "I would only recommend it if it is necessary for your major (which i think the bio sequence often is). Otherwise, there are more interesting courses in biology and evolution that would allow you to go more in depth, in a smaller, more intimate classroom setting.",
                "I would only recommend this class if you need it as a prerequisite",
                "yes, if you need to take it",
                "Yes, this was the last of the BIOL introductory modules and perhaps the one I enjoyed the most because it helped me better appreciate the diversity of life around me.",
                "Yes! But not if they have to suffer through the whole bio sequence lol.",
                "Yes. It gives a different perspective to STEM that I haven't seen in any of my other classes and taught a new way of thinking.",
                "Most students take this class because they are required to, and because they have taken the rest of the BIOL sequence previously. This is definitely a class to look forward to if you need the BIOL sequence!",
                "Yes, out of the entire bio sequence, this was by far the most interesting one. I'd recommend this to non stem majors and non pre-med students.",
                "I would recommend it, I think it's definitely a fun part of the bio sequence that prepares you well for other classes and helps you understand biology on a different level than you're probably used to thinking about it",
                "Yes-- intro course for alot of things",
                "Only if it is necessary for a major prerequisite.",
                "I would recommend this course! Very nice way to end the biology sequence",
                "Yes, if you have taken BIOL 101-103 and need to fulfill a prerequisite for a major or for medical school",
                "Yes. It was the best in the bio sequence. Most interesting. Be prepared to make quizlet and not fall behind. It is hard to cram this info for the exams",
                "No, but you probably have to take this class as a prerequisite and it isn't too bad. The class is just very heavy on memorization and emphasizes the memorization of specific evolutionary events and relationships (especially in the second half of the term). The class also focuses more on evolution than ecology just like 103 focuses more on development than genetics.",
                "I would recommend it to someone interested in biology or general science.",
                "If required for major, yes. Otherwise there are likely more specific ecology classes that are more interesting",
                "Many people have to take it for course requirements. I think it's an enjoyable course if you have to take it though. I don't know if it's worth it for people looking for a Science distributional credit; there are other courses that may suit your interests better. But still a well structured course.",
                "I would recommend. The professor was amazing.",
                "Yes. You need the class for most bio majors and it is the most interesting and least stressful of the sequence",
                "Yes. I think out of all of the BIOL 101-104 sequence, 104's content is the easiest to understand, and the workload is very manageable.",
                "Yes! Super interesting, just a good amount of work.",
                "Ecology is my interest but this course actually made it a little boring to me. Because BIOL104 is a prereq to E&EB 225, I guess you should take 104. I stronly recommend ecology courses that come after 104 as they are much more interesting and facilitate learning.",
                "Only if it is a requirement",
                "YES! This course was really fun, and by far my favorite part of the biology sequence.",
                "Yes, I think this would be a great start to biology and would be friendly for both beginners, and those who have previously taken biology. Its highly engaging, and the broad range of topics assure that you will like at least one of them. I also think that there is a very direct method of doing well in this class, and if you are not doing well there are plenty of resources to help you.",
                "If they are required to take it as a pre-req for something else.",
                "Only if they have to take it for their major",
                "Yes! This is the best course in the bio sequence. It is a lot of memorizing, but the concepts are really interesting.",
                "Yes, every part of the fundamentals of biology sequence including this one has taught me usable, unforgettable knowledge. I would recommend the course to anyone, even for those students that are just looking to fulfill a science credit.",
                "Yes, even if it is required for ones major, this material is very applicable, engaging, and designed to encourage curiosity about the subjects discussed in class.",
                "Yes because of the amazing professor and interesting course content.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students because the material is very interesting and engaging. I enjoyed the writing assignments and discussion sections as well.",
                "Only if it's a requirement.",
                "I would recommend this course to students interested in the E&EB major or students that have to go through the bio sequence.",
                "I do not think this is a class anyone willingly takes, if you have to take the biol sequence, then this certainly isn't the worst one.",
                "Yes, Prof Near is very interesting and the content is also interesting",
                "Yes, it is very good at teaching phylogenetics in depth.",
                "Absolutely  this course changed the way I think about the environment around me and what change really means in terms of time and adaptation.",
                "No. The exams are not in line with the material learned.",
                "Yes. It was a good introduction to the subject.",
                "Yes, great insights!",
                "Yes",
                "Its a good class.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless you have to take it for your major. I feel like there was not much support for the students. We were not given practice tests for the midterm and final. The midterm and finals were all memorization. For the writing assignments, whenever someone would ask a question, they would always say to refer to the rubric, nothing more, and when I got my assignments back, I got points taken off because my writing wasn't good enough but all I did was follow the rubric, as they said.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students, since it was really interesting and engaging in many ways.",
                "Yes, 104 was a great class that I actually found to be very interesting. If learning about plant and animal evolution is your thing, this class will keep you interested.",
                "Yes! really not bad",
                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in ecology and evolutionary biology.",
                "I would recommend to premed and/or mcdb majors.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless necessary as this is an introduction course and it feels like one.",
                "Only if required",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in learning more about the evolution of life.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in ecology or need it for a prerequisite. It is well-taught and is a good introduction into the topics of ecology and evolution, and is worth learning.",
                "Yes I would recommend",
                "Yes! Extremely interesting and rewarding",
                "Yes, evolution is very interesting and the professor was incredible!",
                "I would recommend this course as a pre-med and biology major pre-requisite. Additionally, I would recommend this course if you are truly interested in evolutionary biology.",
                "Yes, even though it's not the most engaging class, the content is interesting even if you're not going to be an E&EB major.",
                "I would recommend this course because it goes into topics that none of the other biology courses cover. I think it is important that everyone understand the processes that govern the evolution of our environment.",
                "In all honesty, youre probably only going to take this course if you need to complete the bio sequence, so my opinion doesnt really matter.",
                "If you have to for major or premedical requirements. Otherwise, your time is likely better spent on another STEM or biology class.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student if it is a requirement for their major or if they are interested in evolution, ecology, environmental studies, or anything similar. I would not recommend this course to a student if they really don't enjoy having to memorize lots of terminology.",
                "Yes, it is required for a lot of majors.",
                "I would-- the course was filled with interesting material.",
                "Yes, the course was pretty interesting even if not a science major",
                "I would recommend this course to other Yale students. This course presents biology in a new light that I had not before learned. Professor Near comes to class every day with energy and enthusiasm (and some great fits) that make class entertaining and fun to participate in. The grading seemed fair and the tests reasonable, so there is nothing I would tell people to avoid about this class.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in ecology and evolutionary biology. I don't think the course is necessarily too hard to succeed if you have any interest in those subjects and are willing to put the time into studying and improving your knowledge. I don't think this class should be limited to only pre-meds or people who need this for a requirement. However, it may not be worth taking 103 just for this class. But I really enjoyed what we learned for the most part, the exceptions being the absurd amount of detail in the tree of life that we had to memorize."
