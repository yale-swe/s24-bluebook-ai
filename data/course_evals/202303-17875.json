                "No weaknesses, in my opinion",
                "Strengths: the second half of the semester was very interesting once we applied the mechanics of language and the dense philosophical texts to contemporary issues\r\nWeaknesses: the class conversation was not super accessible most of the time",
                "Strengths: Professor Stanley is fantastic including being very funny and entertaining. Readings are great and lectures help digest them even if you didn't get it the first time. Papers and midterm offer great opportunities to engage with the material on a deeper level. Really tough to think of weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: Amazing and important readings. Great depth of content. Stanley is excellent (and very funny). Despite the course being a lecture, it is more of a leminar as Stanley wants all the students to participate.  Weaknesses: The class builds up towards excitable speech, which I imagine is particular to a Stanley-taught philosophy of language course. If one is particularly interested in social theory, then this is definitely an upside. Personally, while I enjoyed the end of the course, I would have rather looked at more canonical philosophy of language (Perhaps a look at Wittgenstein, Gareth Evans, Quine, Searle, Putnam, etc...). This is just my personal interest, so not a general weakness of the course.",
                "This is a very intellectually engaging class that covers both analytical and practical problems with philosophy of language. It has great readings and lectures, but the class is a bit disorganized and you won't get a lot of assignments back on time.",
                "Professor is super engaging and funny, and makes very difficult material fairly understandable in a quick way. However, sometimes classes can get derailed by people asking too many questions for the entire class period, and especially in the back half of the semester, since the professor isn't very organized, lectures can be a bit rambly and hard to understand. As well, you won't get feedback on many assignments, and the instructions/dates for assignments may change throughout the semester.",
                "It was good to get some background in philosophy of language, but I would try to take the course with someone other than Prof. Stanley, since he doesn't seem to put a great deal of effort into his teaching."

This is material you can use in many other classes as well as in your daily life; language is everywhere and this course will allow you to better use and understand it. This is one of those classes that will change the way you see the world",
                "I would. I definitely wouldn't recommend it as someone's first philosophy class ever (as it was for mine), but I was pretty engaged by the end of the semester and genuinely enjoyed writing the final paper.",
                "I would HIGHLY recommend this course. The lectures are the most entertaining I've seen at Yale, and Professor Stanley, in addition to being an expert in the subject, loves to call on students and genuinely engage with what they have to say. The reading list is great too, a really wide scope of ideas even though it's largely from the last century or so. The \"Leminar\" style is rarely effective but it works great in this class. I think anyone from any major will really enjoy this course. It has something for everyone.",
                "I would recommend this class. Class discussion was lively, and Prof. Stanley was very engaging and broke down dense texts in an approachable manner. Even though I had already encountered some of these readings in other classes, there was always something new and interesting to talk about!",
                "This is one of the best philosophy courses I have taken at Yale. In fact, I think that it should be mandatory for philosophy students to take. Whilst it is primarily directed towards philosophy students, Professor Stanley does an excellent job at making it accessible to students in other departments, going so far as to encourage students from other disciplines to engage with the class. Stanley is an awesome professor, resulting from his engagement, humor, and depth of knowledge. The material is enlightening (although some of it may seem esoteric to non-philosophy students), and not only brings up problems in the philosophy of language, but also demands the students to think deeply about such problems. I never found the workload to be very high, despite covering a vast array of topics. The only caveat I would consider is that the final third of this course is different from most introductory philosophy of language courses in that it focuses on excitable speech. This, I would imagine, is particular to Stanley's syllabus. While Stanley covers most of the most important early developments in philosophy of language, if one wants a more traditional (analytic philosophy oriented) introduction, I would imagine Professor Szabo's version of this class would be in that direction. Nonetheless, take this course.",
                "You get what you put into this course. If you do the readings and show up to class with questions, the material + Stanley's interactive teaching style is great. If you need more guidance/check-ins to stay up to date on your work, this course might not be for you.",
                "Yes definitely. It is a super fun and engaging philosophy class with lots of opportunities for class participation.",
                "If you want to learn a bit of philosophy, have a really fun and engaging time, and don't mind hearing random anecdotes for 10-50 minutes of class, then I would highly recommend. The course content itself is really essential for understanding other projects in analytic philosophy, and Stanley does a pretty good job covering Frege-Russell-Kripke-Austin. But if you're the type of person that would get annoyed if you don't get an assignment graded for 2 months or your prof doesn't end up discussing a paper that you were assigned to read in detail then maybe pick another class.",
                "I think it is important for philosophy majors to have some basic understanding of philosophy of language in order to understand 20th century and contemporary philosophy, but I was not a fan of Prof. Stanley."
