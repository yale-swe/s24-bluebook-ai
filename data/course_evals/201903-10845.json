   "comments": [
    "Ability to analyze microeconomic situations.",
    "Learned the proofs and assumptions behind basic mircoeconomic theories. Also learned about incentives in auctions and public good provision.",
    "This class taught microeconomics at a pretty advanced level. I learned a lot of the proofs and saw where basic aspects of the theory came from.",
    "This class provided a strong theoretical foundation for microeconomics, from consumer\/producer theory to mechanism design. The concepts were presented in the form of theorems\/proofs, very much like a math class. Since there was little high-level discussion in class to ease students into the concepts, a lot of the intuition came from self-studying the lecture notes and reading the textbook. The P-sets involved thinking about the material from a high-level, which was definitely challenging since I usually did not have a complete grasp of the concepts in class when I was working on the homework. However, it did helped me solidify my understanding. Overall, this course has made me more interested in economics (and potentially econ research) and made me more comfortable with econ from a theoretical perspective.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of microeconomic theory from a mathematical perspective. We also covered the basics of game theory."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Teaching is good in that it is proof-based. However, problem sets often require independent reading of the text, which is often unclear.",
    "Layout of the course and material learned was good. Longer problem sets with more interesting questions could help solidify what we learn in lecture.",
    "Its the most boring class ever and way too hard. The things we learned were interesting but sometimes too much. Also, it says the only pre reqs are math 120 and intro Econ, but it should not be taken by anyone who has not taken a proof intensive math course before. The psets were so dense and impossible to tackle for me personally.",
    "The course makes you dive head-first into mathematical theory. This makes the learning concepts difficult, especially if you haven't developed the intuition first (which the class spends very little time on). However, this also forces students to develop their own intuition in a good way. The class size is also very small, so it is easy to ask questions during class. \r\n\r\nI wished there was some more high-level discussion of the economic concepts. I get that there is a fine balance between intuition and rigorous math, especially if you want a strong theoretical foundation, but it would have definitely helped if students had some more context for the concepts we were learning, e.g., how is a particularly concept fit into the broader picture? or current research in the area? These were questions I could answer myself for the most part if I read the textbook but I wished the professor would provide some insight during class that I would not necessarily be able to find easily, especially as a beginner econ student.",
    "The course was very rigorous (we used a graduate textbook), which could be either a good thing or bad thing. I wish we didn't spend so much time at the beginning of the course on mathematics as it seemed to be irrelevant to the big-picture. The class definitely became less mathematical as it went on, though this could just be due to the more concrete nature of those topics. Also, the grading was really easy and the tests lined up with the practice tests the professor posted."

   "comments": [
    "If they have interest in economics, then yes. Without decent initial interest, however, it is likely to be unpleasant.",
    "Yes if you want to do a more mathematically oriented course.",
    "Yes. Just a more in depth version of intermediate micro economics where the essentials are learned.",
    "Not really. Its a cool class and I learned so much but the workload and rigor was not worth it.",
    "This class is great for any econ student who likes math and likes self-studying. I had taken AP micro in high school, but this class goes a lot deeper. For example, we started off with a thorough analysis of consumer preferences and utility, which is something you gloss over in AP micro (and never a mathematical treatment at least when I took it). In micro theory, we only started talk about supply and demand curves well into the class (after the midterm). And I realized supply-and-demand curves are a very small part of microeconomics, even though its basically the only thing you learn in AP micro. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the work load, you definitely have to put work into the class because you either understand the concepts or you don't and the professor doesn't really baby you to learn the material. Also, the exams are pretty straightforward since the TA is very clear about what you do\/don't need to know. I seriously considered dropping down to Intermediate Micro with Chalioti, but looking back I'm glad I stayed. Yes, the first 4 weeks of the course were kind of a struggle but it definitely got less intense over the course of the semester. The main challenge with this course is just learning the material and developing intuition, everything else really isn't that bad.",
    "If you are an Econ\/Math major, you have to take this class. Otherwise, this class is only suitable to students with a lot of mathematical maturity who are looking for a rigorous introduction to microeconomics."
