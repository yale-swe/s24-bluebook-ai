                "strength: professor cunningham provided such a supportive and welcoming environment during class discussions. Especially during the workshops, I feel very safe to share my work with my class. We first discussed the various elements involved in fiction-writing with some very helpful handouts written by the professor himself, and then put the skills into practice in writing our own story which was a very helpful class structure. My classmates are also such insightful and compassionate readers - thus the nickname \"SWAT team\". \r\n\r\nweakness: not much, personally I'd appreciate a little more constructive feedback for workshop, but I also have come to realize that at our stage, it might be more important to validate what we did right instead of removing what we did wrong",
                "Strengths- The reading selections, and the format of work shopping. \r\nWeaknesses- I feel like we could have maybe done some more writing exercises before jumping straight into writing a full story, but I also think the workload of the class felt really balanced throughout the semester, and it was good to just jump in, so I wouldn't necessarily change that. Just felt like I was flexing a muscle a little farther than we had been all semester.",
                "I thought this course was overall very strong. The workload is reasonable, the content is engaging, and Professor Cunningham is a very encouraging writing instructor who gives excellent notes.",
                "cunningham was the best teacher ive ever had. the course was accessible for writers of all levels - all it required was a desire to learn and engage"

                "Yes I would. Personally, I have developed a new understanding of what it means to write a story - to grow a story - and it feels tremendously liberating to me as a writer. Also I was exposed to a range of good short stories all with their own interesting flavors, which branded my perspective.",
                "Highly recommend if you have any interest in writing fiction and are ready to contribute actively to a learning community.",
                "Absolutely. You will become intimately familiar with the short story form, and Prof. Cunningham is fantastic.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who loves reading or writing fiction. It doesn't matter what your skill level is; this class is meant for those who are invested in Fiction in general.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in writing. Professor Cunningham genuinely cares about his students and facilitates engaging conversation surrounding each reading. The workload is very reasonable, and I looked forward to completing each week's assignments because his short story selection was brilliant. The class was two hours, but it always felt like it flew by. I found his feedback to be very helpful, I think I've learned a lot from him. I also appreciated that he took the time to get to know us all, not just as students or writers but as people. He respects his students' opinions, as well as our time.",
