                "This course assigns an unnecessary amount of work. lab reports are often unduly long. I probably ended up doing 3x the amount of writing that I would in a normal seminar for a half credit lab class...",
                "While the concepts covered for this class were really interesting, it either needs to be worth a full credit or not give so much work.",
                "Strengths: The wide breadth of skills, experiments, and model organisms made for something new each week and a very good introduction to biological research methods. I have never taken a bio lab nor done any research before so this lab was new everyday for me. Professor Moreno is also very knowledgable and willing to answer any questions, as well as talk about her passions in research and hearing about yours. She, and my TA, provided a welcoming environment to learn and make mistakes despite the sometimes chaotic nature of Professor Moreno running two labs at once.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: as noted above, there would be delays in lab procedure due to Professor Moreno needing to jump between labs and the TAs often consulted her to know what was being done at a given time. Also, because of the ongoing pandemic, we were not able to do as many things for ourselves and instead were just lectured about them which made some topics not as engaging. Despite this, the class was still very good and I would recommend it (given a student has already taken BIO sequence or has a strong foundation in it).",
                "it is very collaborative but feels like it is almost too guided",
                "The strengths of this course are the diversity of experiments and the abundance of information regarding how to write a lab report. However, this course is weakened by the tremendous amount of writing involved and somewhat of a lack of clarity with feedback.",
                "This is a decent lab to take if you need a bio lab for pre-med. I think Dr. Moreno really cares about students. I also learned about some really interesting topics and got a better sense of the different techniques used in bio research. That being said, lab could sometimes be inefficient, lab reports could be tedious, and sometimes directions and/or explanations were unclear."

I definitely learned a lot and am glad that I took it, but it was also a great deal of work, which sometimes felt overwhelming. So, if you're interested in biology, do take it, but with the awareness that it might be a lot of work!",
                "It's a fine lab to take if you need to fulfill a lab requirement. It's a fair amount of work, but the work isn't really challenging.",
                "If you need it for a bio lab its not bad",
                "Yes! As long as you have already taken the bio sequence or feel comfortable enough in your foundational knowledge to take the lab concurrently with bio lectures. The concepts presented in terms of lab technique make a lot more sense in the context of a broad base of biology knowledge. While there were quite a few lab reports, the frequency of the assignments helped with figuring out how to write and format more efficiently the next time around.",
                "If you need a bio lab",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in building their writing skills. This course is intensive but I do feel as though my ability to write reports had improved. I have become a more clear, effective, and streamlined writer."
