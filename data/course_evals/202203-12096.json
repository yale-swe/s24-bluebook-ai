Through this class, you will learn that this is just not true. You will learn to read scientific journals better and have thought-provoking discussions on current cancer treatment and the future of cancer care.",

The focus of this course on the hallmarks of cancer centered the material allowing us to form connections from one topic to the next.

                "Strengths: I loved Nadya. She was a great lecturer, very engaged, and super passionate about her field. Her sharing her personal experiences with cancer had me hooked onto the class from Day 1, because you really get the sense that she cares about this course and knows her reason for teaching it. Weaknesses: The exams are hella challenging. She says she designs them purposefully that way, but my self-confidence really took a hit from my test grades. The way she frames her questions are confusing and not the easiest to understandto say the least.",
                "Professor Dimitrova is a great teacher that really cares about her students. Sometimes I wish she would put more information on slides.",
                "I wish we had more homework or practice problems to better prepare for exams.",
                "Strengths: Nadya is a terrific lecturer; there was a nice variety of assignments, including a short paper and presentation along with the relatively short exams; good balance of hard biology content and personal/societal impact\r\nWeaknesses: this class can be stressful because it makes you confront the harsh realities of cancer (hypochondriacs beware)",
                "I think the lecture itself was very strong and Professor Dimitrova is a great lecturer. I also think the TFs made an otherwise horrible section slot (Mondays 7pm) a bearable thing. \r\n\r\nAs for cons, I would say the exams weren't the most lenient with grading or the easiest to understand. I struggled throughout the course a lot to gleam exactly what was expected of me in order to do well on the exams and felt that the grading was harsher than it has been in other STEM and MCDB courses I've taken at Yale.",
                "Strengths are the professor. She does an amazing job lecturing. Content is very interesting. The tests are HARD, to the extent that I would study, feel very repaired and still get around a c. Tests were only 40-50 points and all open ended.",
                "I really like the structure of the class, from the lectures to the final project.",
                "The course is thoughtfully and efficiently designed by Professor Dimitrova to cover a wide variety of topics that will really expand your view on cancer. I really loved the format of the class, and the final classes taught by students were really fun.",
                "I wish lectures were recorded so you could review them when studying for the exams. Also I wish grading had been a bit clearer.",
                "Adjusting to the style of exam is a little challenging at first, but the feedback is pretty helpful!",
                "Prof Dimitrova is the true strength - her lectures are so eloquent and well prepared and full of up-to-date information that tells a true story about cancer in the past, present, and future.",
                "No weaknesses! I really liked Professor Dimitrova's lecture pace and how open she was to helping students",
                "The course was good and interesting and covered a breadth of topics. I really liked the tie-back to the hallmarks of cancer from the beginning to the end of the course. The course could have given students more feedback. The exams were also graded strangely and the questions were confusing to interpret what she was actually asking.",
                "Practice exams were not representative of the actual exams.",
                "Great professor, not too difficult assignments, amazing content. Only weakness is that exam questions were pretty open ended, but if you mussed one buzzword you would lose most credit. Just a different kind of exam style to get used to."

If you get test anxiety or don't plan on going to lectures, don't take it. It's not for those who don't want to put in time to understand and learn the material as well as know how to interpret her exam questions.",
                "Not really. This course gives you a very broad level understanding of cancer, but if you genuinely want to learn about cancer, I would pick a different course. This class is low workload (weekly readings for section but no psets) but it's not necessarily an easy A.",
                "Yes! I learned so much.",
                "I would highly recommend! The course explores a field of oncology that is not talked about in many other courses at Yale. Also, this was the first course I took that integrated a lot of information that I learned from other classes, like genetics and molecular biology.",
                "Yes, definitely! It is the best MCDB lecture I have taken, and I think it could even be a good course for interested non-majors to audit.",
                "Yes and No. I loved what I learned and don't regret taking the course in the slightest. Again, the Professor is amazing at her job and makes a complicated topic accessible. However, it caused me unnecessary stress given I took the class for fun. If you do need an MCDB credit I do recommend it though. Or if you're Credit/D'ing.",
                "Yes, wonderful course and such an important topic.",
                "Over the semester, I felt like the class was very accessible, even to those without extensive background in cancer biology. Professor Dimitrova is really passionate about the course material, which made lectures very engaging and enjoyable. Generally speaking the class is chill, and what you take out of it depends on the time you put in. Given that the class focuses on understanding concepts over memorizing details, I think this is an excellent class for those who are truly interested in learning about cancer biology.",
                "Definitely take this course if you are interested in cancer biology or healthcare in general. Most other classes at Yale don't really explore the topic of cancer enough, and taking this class will give you a better idea of the field.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, it is a fantastic MCDB elective -- the best I've taken.",
                "Absolutely! You learn so much if you put in the right amount of work into it",
                "This course is good at giving an introduction to many topics in the cancer field. I liked the Cancer assignment which was fun to watch a video about a cancer topic you are interested in. The only con is that you don't get much feedback and the exams are confusing and even if you feel like you know the material you can do poorly on the exams.",
                "Yes! Its a great intro to cancer biology course",
                "Yes. I took this as a non-bio major because I was interested in the topic and it was very enjoyable. I really liked the content and lecture. Exams can be a little difficult because of stye of questioning, but overall a great upper level MCDB class."
