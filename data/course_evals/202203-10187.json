                "This course offers a good introduction into three types of creative writing: the short story, the poem, and the play. I feel like my writing skill developed greatly over the course of the semester, particularly in playwriting, a genre I'd never attempted before. I also feel like I learned how to analyze texts for craft and offer constructive criticism in workshop."

                "Strengths: Deming is a fun professor! He has a very dry sense of humor, and I feel like he was very good at keeping discussions of texts engaging. His feedback too was quite clear and helpful. I feel like the amount of time we spent on each of the units was logical, and the assignments and small writing exercises in general were enjoyable. Weaknesses: I felt like the way workshops were divided up wasn't entirely fair. Some people got to have a first draft of a piece for the final portfolio workshopped, but others only got to have their monologue workshopped, which was not included in the final portfolio. As a result, I feel that the feedback a workshop is meant to provide was more useful for some than for others. This issue could be rectified if there was a set schedule for workshops, such that everyone got to have a portfolio piece looked at."

It proved a strong introduction to poetry, fiction, and playwriting, and felt accessible to students, like me, who hadn't tried writing in one of those genres before. Also the guest lectures were super interesting and often quite amusing, and they provided good food for thought as we analyzed pieces for craft throughout the semester."
