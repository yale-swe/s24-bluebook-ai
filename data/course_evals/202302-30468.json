I found the classes and readings very engaging and the professor explained everything clearly.",

I think it would be interesting to anyone, even those not interested in philosophy, because of the way the class is taught. Professor Mahon engaged the class in all his lessons, asked our opinions on various subjects, was very energetic, was excited to talk to students outside of class, and showed a great amount of knowledge in his field.",
