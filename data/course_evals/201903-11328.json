    "Strengths: Yong's segment of the course was a great introduction to X-ray crystallography and Cryo-EM. As someone who does not personally conduct structural biology research, I found it very valuable to learn how these two important techniques actually worked. His segment of the course along makes this class worth taking for anyone interested in learning about structural biology. The TA's for the class (Chris and Josh) were also exceptional and incredibly dedicated.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Overall, the course was pretty disorganized. Lectures between different faculty members did not necessarily hold together cohesively in a continuous thread. Also, the nature of the problem sets and exams also varied greatly depending on the professor. Increased coordination between the different professors would have been much appreciated."

    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in structural biology (specifically x-ray diffraction and cryo-EM). Yong does a great job covering those topics, and you will definitely come away from the course with a greater understanding of how they work."
