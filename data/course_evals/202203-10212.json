It can almost ruin your experience pleasure reading going forward---you'll try to pick up some random light contemporary novel to enjoy and find yourself interrogating every choice the author has made in writing every individual line. It's kind of incredible.",
                "I learned the fundamental components of storytelling: 1. a character with a need 2. everything else: steps taken to achieve that need, setting, etc. More than that, I gained insight into the editing process, the sense of a 'writer's room', read stories that have changed my outlook on storytelling, and felt part of a really supportive and strong community.",

                "Strengths: Fiction is fascinating topic. Prof Sexton has some great insight into what makes it good. Trying your hand at writing your own is a wonderful culmination.\r\nNot many weaknesses - more feedback in the first half of the course would be great, but you get plenty in the latter.",
                "Absolutely no way this course could be improved beyond getting to take it twice. Engaging, interesting, and an absolute blast.",
                "This class is utterly amazing. Easily the best class I've taken at Yale so far. The creative writing exercises, readings and discussions were extremely rewarding, and the in-class workshops were completely invaluable. I really appreciated how collaborative the class felt, in that we were learning from each other as well as from Professor Sexton. Sometimes I do wish there were more opportunities to write (shorter) short stories leading up to the final project.",
                "Strengths -- curriculum was fabulous, class vibes were incredible, feedback from Sexton was supportive and helpful, class organization was great.\r\nWeaknesses -- honestly, for this sort of intro to fiction course -- none.",
                "The format of this course if fantastic! I love the front half of it -- the selection of fiction we read is excellent and getting to discuss these works with classmates is both fun and productive. The second half, though, is even better. Getting to read and workshop everyone's pieces for the class is incredibly helpful for becoming a better writer. It's also exciting and interesting to read everyone's pieces.\r\n\r\nI can't think of any weaknesses for this course."

                "Yes!! Favorite class I have taken at Yale so far. Adam Sexton is an amazing teacher and helped to create a very fun, comfortable, and supportive class dynamic that made me excited to come to class each day. I always left feeling inspired.",
                "Yes! If you want to break down what makes a story and try writing one yourself, this is a wonderful environment to do so in :) Sexton is a Yale gem!",
                "TAKE THIS COURSE. The class is designed to allow you to both improve your writing as well as make great connections with your classmates and the prof. Having taken creative writing courses prior to this one, I still learned crucial techniques that had not been covered previously and definitely feel that my writing improved.",
                "YES. I already go around recommending it to everyone I know with even the slightest interest in writing. This class is absolutely wonderful. It was the one class I could always look forward to every week. It's very discussion-based, and as someone who loves talking about writing, it was a perfect match. The readings are amazing---you'll find yourself recommending them to friends and reading them over in your free time. The creative writing exercises are fun and challenging in the best way. The class environment that is cultivated is so warm and collaborative. There's something about sharing personal writing that makes you feel closer to people. And Professor Sexton is literally amazing. If you get the chance to take literally any class at Yale with him, take it.\r\n\r\nAlso, this class is what ultimately made me decide I want to become a writer.",
                "I WOULD SO STRONGLY!!!!! It was really fabulous -- I often say it was my favorite class I've ever taken at yale (and I've loved all my classes). Thank goodness one creative writing class is lottery admission -- I particularly loved that this meant not every student was an English major. The student diversity really added to the class.",
                "Yes! It's both an extremely fun and rewarding class. I got to know my classmates super well throughout the semester, (which I think is a natural result of the class format) and which made it all the more enjoyable. I cannot stress enough how great the selection of fiction we get to read for the class is. And, the opportunity to read serious pieces from classmates and to have your own piece workshopped is invaluable. I would highly recommend this class for anyone who enjoys writing or wants to become a better fiction writer."
