                "Learned environmental history of the Americas from pre Columbian Exchange up to the admission of California to the United States. That being said, we only briefly cover pre columbian environmental history and the course mostly focuses on North American history. Specifically, I learned a lot about commodification of natural elements like land, animals, and plants, and how this progressive commodification played an essential role in North American history and the globe. I think this lens of history is essential for anyone trying to gain a comprehensive grasp of North American history."

                "Great class overall. A lot of material and reading which became hard to grasp all of toward the end of the course",
                "Strengths: Professor Peterson is an excellent lecturer. He is simply one of the best teachers at Yale: his lectures are engaging, have \"a-ha\" moments, and don't make you feel like you could get the same material from a textbook. In a lot of Yale courses, you feel like the professor is just pouring out basic historical information he knows (especially in history lecture courses). This class was nothing like that. Professor Peterson makes exciting theoretical claims, historical arguments, and you really feel each component of the course matches some other component. A great course.",
                "strengths: some really great books (Scars on the Land, Creatures of Empire, Nature's Metropolis), interesting topics and passionate professor. Tests had some challenging parts but felt appropriate for what we covered in lecture and readings. \r\nweaknesses: some weeks the readings didn't seem super connected to lecture, whereas some were really well integrated, which makes sense for the first run of this course. I have no doubt he will shuffle some things around it will be smoother in the future. The book on the New Madrid earthquakes also felt a bit out of place in the course overall.",
                "Strengths: Professor Peterson is a great lecture, and I felt that he was able to synthesize the material we had been learning in a very engaging way. Weaknesses: Some of the readings were very long and didn't feel entirely relevant to the course, and I thought that the first essay was not explained in a helpful way and I didn't love the prompt.",
                "Strengths: Prof Peterson is a joy. He is passionate and deeply knowledgeable about American history. His lessons are well organized and his power points are excellentthis makes learning in his class very seamless. His teaching style is engaging and fun. He is very good at distilling complex historical and economic concepts down to their essentials. The books list is also a highlight of this course. Each book was excellently written and offered an interesting, important, and often unexpected or overlooked perspective. I looked forward to doing the reading each week, and would (already have many times!) recommend the books to people not taking the course. The assignments are well spaced out throughout the semester and promote learning. \r\nWeaknesses: It was sometimes challenging to stay fully engaged for the 1hr 15 min lecture. I wish there was somehow more student discussion/interaction. I also think a final essay prompt that asks students to trace some aspect of the env history of a familiar place would be a great way to finish the semester. The current final essay prompt felt too broad, especially given the lack of sources we had available to focus on one specific element of env history. This alternative essay prompt would still require the student to trace how some aspect of env history changed through time and would firmly connect the history/concepts of the class with present day ecological realities."

                "Yes! Definitely a cool and mostly neutral perspective of early American history",
                "Take this course! Professor Peterson is an amazing professor. If you want an engaging history course with interesting essays and fair exams, this is the course for you. You will probably see a few reviews here talking about how the workload is too much; I completely disagree, and think this course had less reading than is usual for a history lecture. Well-taught, great TFs, and held together by interesting arguments made by Professor Peterson throughout the course. Loved it!",
                "Absolutely! Students from any major would benefit from this course, but is a must take for EVST majors!!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. While there is a lot of focus on economy and demography and other non-environmental elements of history, I found those interesting for the most part, and they always had an environmental connection. Peterson is a great professor and chose some really fascinating books and readings. If you are interested in looking at American history through an environmental lens and seeing how we got to where we are today climate-wise socially and historically (less so scientifically), this is a great class for you!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in how the environment has affected American history, but not if they are expecting a more science-focused class.",
                "Yes!! I already have multiple times. The material is very interesting, relevant, and not at all just a repeat of AP US History. Prof Peterson is a joy. He is passionate and deeply knowledgeable about American history. His lessons are well organized and his power points are excellentthis makes learning in his class very seamless. His teaching style is engaging and fun. He is very good at distilling complex historical and economic concepts down to their essentials. The books list is also a highlight of this course. Each book was excellently written and offered an interesting, important, and often unexpected or overlooked perspective. I looked forward to doing the reading each week. The assignments are well spaced out throughout the semester and promote learning. I think this lens of history is absolutely essential for anyone trying to gain a comprehensive grasp of North American history, or even just to understand how we created the ecological crisis we are in today. This class touches on a wide variety of env concepts/themes."
