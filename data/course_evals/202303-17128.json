Class examples and problem sets explore course topics through problems with interesting applications. Through this course, you also learn to apply skills from prior coursework to topics covered in this course.",
                "This course includes topics in thermodynamics, transport, single stage separations, separation cascades, absorption, distillation, liquid-liquid extractions, membrane separations and adsorption. There is also a distillation lab demonstration where students get a chance to see a live application of topics taught in class. Problem sets are not assigned every week, so when they are assigned, they tend to be quite challenging as the problems cover more than what is taught in class. You'll have to be resourceful and manage your time well to complete the assignment by the due date.",

                "The syllabus was closely followed and the lectures were organized nicely. The textbook and the lectures used different variables which got confusing.",
                "The workload was very manageable, and the course was paced really well for understanding. The lectures were clear and organized, and the exams were all fair. I wish there had been more practice problems in addition to the problem sets to help prepare for the exams. I also wished we would have learned how to use some of the simulation softwares mentioned in the textbook problems.",
                "Strengths of this course include the teaching, detailed examples in class and discussion of interesting applications. Weaknesses include that the problem sets sometimes involved plotting and analysis that was not covered in class. Overall, this was a great course.",
                "The syllabus includes schedule and which topics will be taught when. Dr. V.T. sticks to this schedule and uploads the lecture notes after every class which is helpful if you miss a class. Problem sets are usually due 2 weeks after they are assigned, giving you time to go to office hours and ask questions. Problems set answers are also posted after the due date. A clear list of topics, problems sets and textbook sections covered in an exam are posted on Canvas in advance. Extensions are easy to get if you regularly show up to class and turn in most problem sets on time. The points grading policy is also quite generous and is based on homework, and 3 exams which will correspond to an A, B, and C depending on how many total points you get. There are 3 exams which are not cumulative with the 3rd exam during finals being worth more points than the first 2 exams. An improvement that could be made is having practice exam problems before each exam and more direction on how to solve assigned textbook problems which often involve Excel.",
                "I think that this class does a great job teaching skills that are practical and could be used as sanity checks in real life. I felt, however, that there could have been more focus on computational aspects and how to use modern software in class. It often felt like we were left to learn all of that stuff on our own on the homework, where we might end up learning suboptimal procedures. I understand that it's difficult to implement stuff like this in a class though."
