This class makes you think a lot about how we engage with medical technologies, and how technologies have shaped our medical field.

                "I really liked the reading list for the course and appreciated the weekly reflections (I think it helped me - and everyone - engage more with the week's materials and be prepared for class discussion). I also loved the paper prompts.",
                "Weaknesses - None \r\n\r\nStrengths - Seminars were extremely engaging (often very funny too), the readings were the perfect balance of interesting without being too much, and the topic was different every week",
                "the strengths of thsi course were the readings and the professor, there are no weaknesses that come to mind, but I think some of the readings could be rearranged to help with how students conceptualize medical technology, particularly moving the ones from the last weak nearer to the beginning",
                "I loved how the course was structured to explore a new medical technology each week because it kept the course really engaging. I also loved how we were able to Zoom with some of the authors of books that we read."

                "I would definitely recommend this course - there are two papers, one shorter and one longer, which is a big load for the times that they are due, but other than that, it is definitely a fun course. I even enjoyed writing the papers, since they were topics that I was interested in and got to delve deeply into. If you are interested in medicine, society, and history, I would definitely recommend this course. Professor O'Donnell is wonderful and very kind and knowledgable in guiding discussion. She was very thoughtful in the readings she chose and the topics covered and I very much enjoyed the class.",

                "Yes! Professor O'Donnell is a very personable professor and made the seminar discussions feel less like class and more like a book club (but based on articles and personal experiences rather than on books). It is a very relevant topic that I think all students should learn more about, and the workload was very low while it still incited engagement at the same time.",
                "Yes",
