    "I learned a ton about the history of Latin America, especially in the context of its relationship with the United States.",
    "I learned a lot about U.S. interventionism in Latin America, and some history of the U.S. and Latin American countries individually.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of U.S. Latin American relations, largely through much reading and listening to Professor Grandin in class.",
    "The course provided us with a really strong overview us U.S.-Latin American relations, with strong insights into many dimensions of this history",
    "This course encouraged me to be critical of historical texts, understanding them within their contexts and the perspective of the author. More specifically, I learned to understand texts in the context of the Americas, and US-Latin America relations.",
    "How to read, discuss, and write about Latin American relations with the U.S. from the 19th to 21st centuries.",
    "I developed in countless ways as a writer, as a reader and as a thinker. Professor Grandin has become one of my mentors and I will be forever grateful for all that he has taught me!",
    "I learned a lot about US and Latin american relations that was very interesting."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the readings were engaging, Professor Grandin is engaging, and the course is well-organized to give students an overview of the history of Latin America in the context of its relationship with the United States.\r\nWeaknesses: we rarely discussed readings in class, the class was usually a lecture instead of a discussion.\r\nI also kind of wish we had 2 shorter papers rather than 1 long final paper. I feel I've had trouble consolidating what I've learned so far and that makes the final paper intimidating.",
    "This is an amazing course! I did expect it to focus less on U.S. history and more on U.S.-Latin America relations throughout the 20th century. I do understand that U.S. history and politics are very closely tied with U.S. foreign policy, but I think it would have been more interesting if the course had a bit of a different perspective, focusing more on the countries that underwent interventions rather than the intervener.",
    "I think the readings were normally good and a strength, but I really wish Professor Grandin had lectured less and allowed us to talk more. Most classes he would speak for about an hour or an hour and a half of the two hour seminar.",
    "The course was really fascinating, but at times carried out a bit more like a lecture than a seminar, I think future iterations of the course would benefit from more student discussion!",
    "The strengths of the course were primarily Professor Grandin's serious engagement with the material, as well as the complexity of the readings assigned, which allowed for an extremely rewarding class experience. The main weakness of this course was the time constraint, which made it difficult to fully discuss multiple readings\/ideas.",
    "Strengths- we focused on one event per session which allowed for depth. Paper was flexible so we could explore any topic we wanted pertaining to Latin America and the U.S. \r\nweaknesses- some of the sessions werent as structured as others, which made discussion hard sometimes",
    "I would not change this course in any way -- it is already amazing!",
    "I think we could have had more actual discussion and Prof Grandin could have lectured less in class. It is a seminar, after all. This would also incentivize people to do more of the readings."

   "comments": [
    "I learned a ton about Latin America. The workload is pretty manageable (5 reading responses, at least 1 short in-class presentation, 1 final paper). Not really necessary to finish all the readings. Grandin is great to learn from. I would recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in Latin American history. There are not that many courses on this topic at Yale, and Grandin is an absolutely incredible professor.",
    "Perhaps   it was a good introduction to the long history of US Latin America, and I think I understand historical context and particular events much better now. But it was also tough to sit in class for two hours at a time but Professor Grandin kept talking, often only semi relatedly to the topic.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student looking to learn more about the history of U.S.-Latin American relations.",
    "Yes! U.S. foreign policy history in Latin America is an often overlooked topic and its super important to learn about this part of the world because its so close to the US",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student!",
    "Yes I think it is definitely worth taking, especially if you are American and havent studied this stuff before. The syllabus is really thorough. That said, this class definitely has a leftie bent so beware.",
    "I think this class is really interesting and it makes you think of US Latin America relations from perspectives you hadnt thought of before. Highly recommend!"
