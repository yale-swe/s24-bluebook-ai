Don't get me wrong, you definitely learn software on-the-job if you're inclined to digitize your projects, but the purpose of this class is understanding graphic design, not InDesign or Illustrator.",

I think learning fundamentals through abstract exercises (at the beginning) was helpful before transitioning into more long-term projects. Although there was not a lot of support for Adobe Suite and other programs, it was nice to have the option to explore using them.",

                "Though I REALLY appreciated how individualized the feedback was, the subjective nature of critique comments (a constantly-addressed elephant in the room) made it sometimes confusing to pair Henk's suggestions when they stand in opposition to your intent. With that said, I felt like Henk met all students where they were at with graphic design and I greatly appreciated this intention, given I was a newcomer myself.",
                "Weaknesses: If the class has a lot of people, you don't get a lot of feedback because of time but you can always reach out to the professors on your own time. Wish the occasional lectures were more tailored to our course projects sometimes. \r\nStrengths: It's great to see your peers work and learn from them. You get a lot of one-on-one meetings with the professors. Also really enjoyed the guest speakers we got.",
                "Prof van Assen and the TF (Nick) were definitely the highlights of the course. They were engaging and very helpful with feedback, but in and out of class. We spent a lot of time in class critiquing other students work, which was helpful but not as collaborative as it would have been in person. I would suggest reducing the course enrollment number in order to maximize the amount of time we got to listen to Prof van Assen lecture. I also would have liked more art theory and art history.",
                "I really liked the format of the course and the emphasis on actually producing graphic design work. I also thought the focus (especially at the beginning) on hand work was really interesting and instructive.",
                "I think it would be helpful to have more check-ins or something like that. Sometimes I felt like I was producing something in-line with the criteria of the assignment but at critique, I realized I missed the mark. I do not think this would happen so much in an in-person environment, because there would be opportunities to brainstorm with and see other people's works. Otherwise, I think more defined instructions would be helpful. I understand that creativity is key, and being told exactly what to do hinders the artistic process, but the constraints of a pandemic limit the ease of production.",
                "Engaging and hands-on. I'm glad Illustrator and Photoshop were not required to succeed in this class--emphasis is on the basics. Group critiques were very valuable. A weakness is the workload was intense at times and quite intimidating. I also would have liked to see more slide presentations and lectures."

                "Yes! I think that Henk makes his expectations and the course format very clear in the first class, so if what he says sounds appealing to you, go for it! The class is very well structured and surprisingly worked very well in the online format. It was probably one of my favorite at Yale. It's a wonderful course, but it really helps if you're excited by it and see putting in the hours of work as fun. For me, the hours just flew by.",

                "I would! I do think students that are less familiar with Adobe programs will be at a slight disadvantage near the end of the course, but it's totally possible to do all the projects completely by hand. I think that the projects are designed well to challenge you and make you think outside of the box. By the end of the semester, you should have a strong and articulated portfolio. Also, Prof vA and the TF were amazing and so helpful.",
                "Yes - if I thought they were serious enough about it that they would be willing to accept the workload.",
                "If you are looking for a class to learn how to use digital graphic design programs, don't take this class! If you want to learn the elements and themes that you will be implementing through a digital program, or through physical means, take this class! It was a lot of work, but fun and rewarding, and the only way to get better at making art is to make art, which you will do a lot of in this class.",
                "Yes, this course is a great start for someone with any interest in design. Even if you're not an art student, you learn to pay attention to detail and think more critically about design every where. A word of caution: in addition to the course fee, students will need to buy their own supplies (and some may not be fully used by the end of the course)."
