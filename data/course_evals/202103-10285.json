Might be hard given the diversity of projects, but one quickly gets used to the independence and work ethic!"

The 10 hours/week average helps pace your project, but don't treat the course like it's a \"real\" 1-credit, treat it more like two 0.5-credit science labs (plus a couple more hours!). I recommend starting research at least the summer beforehand."
