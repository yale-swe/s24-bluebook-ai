                "Strengthened my Spanish writing skills the most, practiced reading, and occasionally speaking in the in-class discussions. Definitely learned a lot about current events in Spanish-speaking countries and some about legal systems, although that information was all from lectures that were sometimes hard to follow from slides that weren't posted.",
                "Nothing. It was a language credit, but I don't think I really learned much of anything of value.",
                "I improved my Spanish speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills significantly in this class. I also learned about interesting topics relevant to current international legal issues, such as gun rights, violence against women, femicide, climate change, cybersecurity, etc.",
                "Legal Spanish teaches you how to articulate concepts of constitutional, civil, and criminal law as understood in the context of Latin America and Spain. You also keep up to date with law- and politics-related news across the regions, particularly through weekly homeworks requiring analytical and creative responses to podcasts and news articles.",
                "Basic law, synthesis of law topics in different countries",
                "I developed a strong vocabulary for speaking about legal issues and current events in Spanish-speaking countries. This course's emphasis on class participation and discussion helped me gain confidence in my speaking abilities. I also think the final paper acted as a nice capstone for the course because we were able to freely explore legal issues of interest."

            "comments": [
                "Pros: good way to practice writing (you do a lot of it each week) and learn about current events in other countries. The grading is mostly pretty relaxed, which is nice.\r\n\r\nCons: definitely need to be confident in your Spanish going in, much harder than L4 Spanish. SO much weekly written work.",
                "Strengths: NA\r\nWeaknesses: We met twice a week. One was a lecture where it was direct reading off of slides or reading footnotes with different laws in different countries. The other was a \"seminar\" where we read answers to the podcasts we listened to. The homeworks were tedious. Just an absolute pain to sit through.",
                "This course covers a lot of ground and is very interesting. I enjoyed learning and listening to podcasts. The course could be improved by making coursework more manageable  there were weeks when homework was too much  listening and responding to 50ish questions for each of the two podcasts assigned and writing 20+ sentences about 2-3 articles is a very high workload. Often weekly homework assignments required more than 12 hours. However, the class is very interesting, and I learned a lot.",
                "Strengths: The topics of most homework assignments were interesting. A lot of current events are covered in them. Weaknesses: The homework was so tedious, and I didnt feel as though my Spanish was improving by spending hours answering questions about a podcast.",
                "Strengths: Profesora Carreras is very knowledgeable and does an excellent job encouraging class participation. The weekly homework readings and podcasts are genuinely very interesting and insightful. The final presentation and paper are not a big source of stress relative to other courses, and the professor clearly wants the class to be engaging and fun rather than a source of stress. As she says, \"don't panic.\"\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The law-related lectures are only very weakly tied to the homework and even the final presentation. (The final paper is really the only place where you apply the law stuff you learn.) It seems that the course is confused as to whether it is a law class or a political science class. Fortunately, I am interested in both, but don't expect to leave this class being able to pass the bar exam.",
                "- I like the podcasts, but the workload per week was very high (some weeks we had multiple comentarios and the podcasts, and the podcasts can take several hours with so many questions)\r\n- I loved the final essay\r\n- I wish we got to introduce ourselves to our peers at the beginning of the yearI didn't know most peoples' names until the end of the semester\r\n- I would get very nervous in class when Profesora Carreras would get angry at students\r\n- Office hours would be helpful, I wish we had those! I used to go every time in L3 and L4 and it really helped\r\n- Didn't get feedback on assignments, they would just have a grade at the top, grade seemed subjective\r\n- I really liked the topics we covered, like gun control and social media. Very interesting",
                "Strengths: This course has a pretty regular weekly workload and then eases off near the end of the semester to accommodate preparations for the midterm presentation and final essay. The weekly assignments were interesting and provided a good space to practice Spanish writing and argumentation skills. The class environment helped keep the class engaging even at 9 AM.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There were some ambiguities related to grades in that no Canvas grades were accessible or viewable on students' ends, but grades on weekly assignments were helpful as progress markers. While a textbook is required for this course, we were rarely assigned readings and instead read the footnotes as a class activity. I personally enrolled in this course as an elective to learn more about the legal field, but this class seemed to focus more on current events via podcast assignments instead of legal issues."

                "I wouldnt recommend this course. I was drawn to the name of the class and general reputation that it had, but I dont think I learned as much as I would have in another class.",
                "Yes, I recommend SPAN 222 to anyone broadly interested in learning how contemporary law and political science operate in Latin America and Spain. One thing I would keep in mind is that the weekly homeworks can be very intense, as Prof. Carreras sometimes assigns 20, 30, or one week even 72 questions to respond to, plus 1-2 creative responses of roughly two pages each. I recommend forming a group so you can do the questions together.",
