                "I learned about U.S. empire and imperialist endeavors in Latin America and the Caribbean, racial capitalism and banana imperialism, Panama Canal and occupations and military interventions, Latin American cold war and U.S.-backed right wing military coups all over the region, the Cuban Revolution, U.S.-backed dictatorships and massacres. I also learned how to find, read, and analyze primary sources (and secondary sources) effectively.",
                "The course was a thorough survey of U.S.-Latin American relations through the centuries, starting at the turn of the nineteenth century up to the 1990s. Our work with primary sources and databases was really valuable. It gave me resources to refer back to in the future! There wasn't one secondary source reading that didn't contribute to the class conversation in some way. I never once thought, \"Why am I reading this?\"",
                "I learned about the extensive history of United States relations with various Latin American countries.",
                "I learned so much about Latin American and Caribbean countries!",
                "Knowledge of the role of American intervention in Latin America and the Caribbean since the post-colonial period. Developed skills analyzing primary and secondary sources.",
                "Initially, I found this course a bit uncomfortable because of the subject matter and my personal identity. I'm a white guy and I consider myself progressive and in no way sympathetic to U.S. imperialism, but certain themes in the course challenged me. I was slightly uncomfortable with the emphasis on masculinity and whiteness, but after completing the readings and hearing discussion, I felt like my eyes were really opened. I found myself subconsciously defending certain events before I really considered them, but once I truly investigated the facts rationally I felt enlightened. Perhaps the most formative moment in the course was when I read that the Texas Revolution was the most successful filibuster action. For me, this was revolutionary on a personal and intellectual level because one of my ancestors died at the Alamo. That was always a cool fact growing up and I was taught by my very liberal parents that it was a heroic act. Learning more about the general trends of the antebellum era showed me how wrong I was. I fell much more thoughtful about American foreign policy following this course. I don't think I will ever look at things in black and white again and I think thats a big deal.",
                "I learned so much about the history of US-Latin American relations and how much American imperialism has impacted Latin America.",
                "Learned so much about USs in involvement in Latin America, but specially Central America that I would have never even known to look into before. The use of primary sources in class were also really great at developing my ability to work with primary sources and I appreciated the approach!",
                "I learned so much about Latin American history and its connection to the United States. We covered several nations in detail.",
                "Reading primary sources, discussion with people outside my major, presentation skills.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of Latin American countries in relation to their interactions with and interference from the United States. Covering key events in the history of relations between the United States and Central America, South America, and the Caribbean, this course helped me understand to a greater degree the ways in which U.S. government, business, and private interests influenced the development of society, governance, politics, and economics in the region. We read a diverse range of articles, book chapters, and essays from writers in fields covering history, foreign policy, and gender, and often complemented our readings with in-depth coverage of primary sources. As such, this course helped me practice the skill of analyzing primary sources to a greater degree.",
                "I gained skills in historical reading, writing, and thinking and more broadly in general intellectual and academic skills of critical analysis and inquiry by taking this course. In terms of the course material, I gained an enormous insight and context into the history of interaction between the United States and Latin American nations which has provided me with important context for the pressing matters in the world today that stem from this history. Taking this class has certainly changed my worldview and made me more adept at tackling and understanding global situations and historical contexts and events that shape international relations and the experiences of people today."

                "Honestly can't think of weaknesses. Perhaps --we couldn't go more in depth with each week's material, but that was expected for a survey course! Readings were enjoyable, assignments just right, and professor and TA were both amazing! I liked the class structure as well; dividing class time into three components of lecture, discussion, and activity made a 3-hour course seem less scary and more manageable and the short 5-min breaks every hour helped!",
                "The activities we did individually, and in groups, were strong. Lecture provided good event- and date-oriented context to the readings and conversations we were having. The geographical emphasis on Cuba, the Caribbean, and certain Central American states might be seen as too narrow. But personally, I considered it a strength. For one, they are highly emblematic of the geopolitical forces at work in the region; many are directly connected to contemporary events; and they are often under discussed.",
                "I dont think there are any weaknesses. Maybe just that I liked it best when the discussion was split into two Zoom rooms so there were fewer people",
                "Some strengths of this course included the relevancy of the readings, the format of the class, and the excellent discussions that encouraged further learning. The only weakness of this class was how fast the turn around was on assignments\/ discussions posts were, but that was due to the shortened nature of summer session courses.",
                "Strengths included the professor and TF, the selection of readings and lecture material, the balance of lecture\/group discussion\/presentations. No obvious weaknesses from the course.",
                "Being in person would be great, but I understand why it wasnt obviously.",
                "I loved this class, I just wish it were longer so that we couldve gone over more topics.",
                "Prof Snyder is super kind and a great lecturer! It never seemed like I was listening to just a professor but someone who was just talking about something she really loved and it made the class atmosphere great!",
                "Professor Snyder and Jacqueline were the best parts of this amazing course. They were so kind and facilitated great discussion.",
                "Strength is the instructors! They were amazing, and engaging, and helpful.",
                "One strength of this course was the diversity of sources, issue topics, and perspectives we read and discussed. Another was the format of the class itself, being divided between lecture, student presentation, engagement with primary sources (or other collaborative small group activities), and discussion. While I very much appreciated the breadth of this course, sometimes I wish we could have had more time to spend and reflect more deeply on narrower topics. While also beneficial in providing a broad understanding of the history of U.S.-Latin American relations, perhaps one weakness of this course was the attempted scope of what we sought to study.",
                "The strengths of this course were the enthusiasm of the professor, the varied use of teaching styles and in-class activities, and the reading selection. I enjoyed the variety in the coursework but also appreciated the consistency of the structure of each class. Any way in which this course could be improved is simply due to the fact that it was by necessity a virtual class on Zoom. This class, as any other, in my opinion, would of course be much better in person but as it could not be, I would say most areas of improvement for the class fall under the category of limitations of this format."

                "Yes! This material is so important for us all to know about and chances are most of the material covered was never mentioned in your high school history classes! Living in the U.S., it is important for us to engage with its history and role in creating and abetting abuses in Latin America. These histories continue today and have deep ramifications.",
                "Absolutely. One thing that was incredibly insightful in Dr. Snyder's closing remarks on the last day of class was that even though it's called U.S.-Latin American relations, and we often consider it 'Latin American history,' it's U.S. history, too. It is incumbent on every American to acquaint themselves with this history and be engaged with future U.S.-Latin American relations moving forward.",
                "This is a great course if you are interested in learning about Latin American history and its relationship with United States foreign policy.",
                "Yes!",
                "Definitely. I had never taken a class in Latin America, and Im glad I did. The class provided an excellent overview of US intervention in Latin America, much more so than was taught at the high school level. This class was also able to delve into relevant topics of race, sexuality, and gender roles among others that provide a much more in depth understanding of the interactions within the Americas.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The course material is extremely relevant and interesting and was presented in an extremely  organized fashion.",
                "Definitely. There were a lot of students in the class from Latin American countries and hearing how historical events impacted their families lent an extra layer of importance to the course. Moreover, the events of the past week regarding Afghanistan have made me think more and more about the future of American foreign policy going into the \"new cold war.\"",

                "Yes, but Emily is leaving so I'm not sure if this course will even be taught anymore :(",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student, regardless of their major, interested in learning more about the ways in which the United States and Latin American countries interacted with each other and shaped the paths of their respective histories.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any Yale student, whether that student is a history major with a personal or family connection to Latin America or whether that student is simply trying to fulfill a distributional requirement. I recommend the class both for the intrigue and importance of the subject matter but also for the engaging nature of the class."
