            "comments": [
                "The strengths are the content - very interesting. The prerecorded lectures got a little dry and repetitive, especially near the end of the course. The organization of the lectures could have also been improved.",
                "While the professor attempted to control cheating by using a lockdown browser. Nearly every student cheated on each test by using other devices. This resulted in extremely high scores on the tests. This when coupled with the professors bell-curve grading schema meant that those of us who chose to take the tests honestly were at a high risk of failing the class when our raw scores were B-. This led to a lot of stress and frustration with the course.",
                "Strengths- he is very famous in his field and many of the studies we cover in class are ones he has conducted.\r\nWeaknesses- very hard to fail and do terrible in this course. Only three exams, which are very specific and hard, and he grades on a curve that lands around 15% of the students with a D, something I had never experienced in my Yale career.",
                "Strengths: interesting content, low time commitment, fairly easy to do well on exams if you take good notes and study them. Reading his book is a helpful review but not necessary. \r\nWeaknesses: some exam questions (especially the free response) are a bit ambiguous\/informal and difficult to interpret. It can also be difficult to do really well because most people tend to do well on exams and he gives only a certain amount of As.",
                "It got really really repetitive-- basically since the middle of the course all the way until the end, we were learning over and over again about the same studies and experiments.",
                "Extremely interesting course material.",
                "Strengths include amazing course material and the lectures were very interesting. The Professor taught well by giving goof examples and connections to the real world. The professor's and TAs were relatively easy to reach and they were very willing to talk and help as much as they could. The recordings allowed you to easily watch whenever and wherever. Weaknesses? Honestly, it was recorded and this course would be much better live if not in person but obviously that's hard to do at the moment.",
                "Strengths-- very informative and interesting to learn. Weaknesses-- lot of repetition at times, going over same info multiple times in different lectures. Largest weakness-- grading scheme was somewhat ludicrous, as the average was so high.",
                "The strengths of this course are Professor Bargh's expertise in the field. The weaknesses are most definitely the grading scale. Doing average on everything gets you a B and when average is in the high 80s or low 90s, that means the difference between getting and A and B are a few multiple choice questions.",
                "I enjoyed the asynchronous lectures, because it allowed me to follow along with the course according to my schedule, even under the pandemic conditions. Also, tho, it would have been nice to have at least one or two \"face-to-face\" meetings on Zoom, to meet my peers and TAs.",
                "This course was entirely online tests and prerecorded lectures (some were even recorded last March when this course was also taught remotely). I didn't feel very connected to the learning process. The material and the lectures themselves were all about interesting topics and were well researched though.",
                "Strengths: The topic of this class is interesting in and of itself. It assuaged some of the common fears people have with subliminal messages and unconscious behaviors (mostly towards the very end), and it guarantees that you will never be short of studies to cite concerning unconscious tendencies. Since there is no homework, I also appreciated having 3 tests, rather than 2.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class was quite slow-going at times. I appreciate classes that recap previous lectures, so as not to lose students, and to ensure that every lecture is connected to a bigger theme. Sometimes, though, it felt as if every lecture was reiterating the same past few lectures. I'm not advocating for overloading students with extraneous information for midterms\/finals, but by the end of the semester, I was left wondering how much more could have been covered if recaps didn't occur as often as they did.",
                "This class was very easy, to the point that there was talk of a negative curve. In a time of national and global crisis, this was borderline cruel.",
                "Overall, the course provided a very minimal workload, with the only assignments consisting of three midterm exams. That said, the light workload was, in many cases, kind of a weakness. I had very few opportunities to actively engage with the course material besides note-taking during lectures.",
                "The major strength of the course is that the subject material is genuinely interesting. The lectures were all pre-recorded, which is great for doing them on your own schedule, but it definitely made me feel very detached from the class as a whole. Because I was not engaged, I ended up falling very behind on lectures and didn't feel like I got much out of it.",
                "Better and more coherent slides",
                "I wish the lecture slides were more organized-- like grouping concepts together more clearly.",
                "A big weakness of this class is the fact that your grade is solely based off of 3 exams.",
                "Strength - the professor was clearly very knowledgeable and organized himself but his lectures were hard to follow \/ not wellorganized.",
                "While the topics and information were super interesting to learn, the lectures were not very engaging.",
                "Strengths are that its very straightforward with very few curveball questions on exams. Weaknesses are that the curve is super steep so you have to get extremely high 90s to actually get an A.",
                "Lectures not organized",
                "Wouldve loved to have assignments in conjunction with lectures and exams.",
                "Very straightforward presentation and exams closely tied to the material presented in lecture.",
                "The recorded videos were great - to the point and even entertaining",
                "These lectures were all recycled from the spring of last year - no new information",
                "The course content is extremely interesting and offers rich historical perspective on humanity's evolving relationship with the human unconscious. It also offers real-world insight on how our day-to-day life is influenced in many ways by our unconscious. A weakness of the course is the repetitiveness of some of the later lectures, which borrow on many of the same themes and research covered earlier in the course.",
                "Weakness: It is hard to understand what is wanted for the short answer sections of the exams and this can be really damaging to your exam grade (which is the only thing you are graded on for this class).",
                "The fact that you only had to watch two recordings each week for the two classes that would have taken place is nice because it is more flexible and you can watch them whenever you feel like it, but it is also dangerous because it makes it easy to fall behind in class, especially considering that the only assessments are 3 tests throughout the semester.",
                "This course was enitrely virtual which was challenging. It would have been nice if Professor Bargh hosted some live things in the cclass time besides office hours. Additionally, the lectures themselves were not great, as they were very disjointed in terms of having non-cohesive slides and being very repetitive.",
                "This course offers a good overview of the field, and many interesting studies are covered and related to broader concepts\/ideas\/trends in psychology. The course did start to feel a little repetitive towards the end, and several studies were repeated in the last few lectures of the course.",
                "Very interesting material that relates to everyday life. The tests accurately represent what was covered in class and the readings. Could be improved with more student involvement.",
                "Low workload and very interesting",
                "The prerecorded lecture gave clear insights required for the course",
                "Lecture slides are difficult to learn from. If you can muster the energy to attend the very dry live lectures then you should be fine.",
                "It was really interesting material. The big weakness is that the professor wasn't very responsive when many students were trying to contact him regarding his strange grading structure. This caused for people who had 93 averages to get a B+ and people tracking towards Bs to have to drop the class.",
                "I really liked that the professor went through the needed material in a comprehensive way. There wasn't much hiding when it came to exam day.\r\n\r\nI wish there was a section of some kind just to have a synchronous component to the course that is not just office hours.",
                "I wish I took this class when it was in person",
                "id say the a weakness is that exams didn't really test you so much on your conceptual learning but rather route memorization but if you're looking for an easier class then this could also be a strength.",
                "I liked that all the lectures were pre-recorded so I could watch them at my own pace. The lectures were also super interesting and I was always entertained to watch. It was a very low-commitment class (which I loved and needed) but I was also super interested in the material the whole time so it was a great combo.",
                "Great content",
                "I thought the information was fascinating. The lecture had a lot of studies, which were great but it got hard to pay attention towards the end of each lecture. I really appreciated Professor Bargh's anecdotes as they helped me to remember information and stay engaged.",
                "Most of the information needed is in the lectures, and it was good that I could watch them on my own time.",
                "Extremely interesting and easy to understand.",
                "Valuable information but too much on each set of notes. It should meet 3x a week",
                "The strength of this course is the actual material. On a simple level it is very interesting but because I am not a psychology major the course could get tricky. The weaknesses of this course was how the class was set up. The class had three exams that made up the entire grade. Each exam was weighted on how many classes were taught in that certain amount of time. The problem I had was that by the last exam we had 1 hour and 15 minutes and were expected to do 48 multiple choice questions and 3 extended response questions and once you answered a multiple choice question you were not allowed to go back and change it or even look at it.

                "The recorded lectures were helpful. I enjoyed watching them when I had the time.",
                "All lectures were asynchronous and simply uploaded in the media library. Aside from office hours, there was zero engagement.",
                "Well the professor obviously just reused the recorded lectures from his class in the Spring, so that was a little frustrating, but whatever.",
                "hard to keep up with course given virtual nature",
                "Recordings do allow you to watch wherever and whenever but having live would allow students to easily ask questions as the lecture goes on. Obviously, ideally this would be a much better course in person but COVID doesn't allow this. Additionally, I think it would have been much easier to have a discussion tab or maybe piazza thing for this class to ask easy and quick questions throughout the course that do not need a whole email situation. Also, it allows for more...anonymity? I know I am more likely to use a discussion forum like the discussion on Canvas or piazza than I am to email (unless its more complicated or personal).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I do not agree with the use of the lockdown browser. It seems like an okay idea to stop cheating however, it disadvantages anyone a second device. Anyone with a second computer, a tablet, iPad, etc would be able to kind of circumvent lockdown browser anyways. Additionally, during the tests you weren't allowed to go back to questions you had already answered. I think this is ridiculous because it stresses me out much more than it needs to. I do best on tests when I look through and try to do every question then go back to the ones I do not know. It actually makes me waste more time than I have because I want to make sure I am getting every question correct which reduces my time for later questions. Also, I know this was supposed to decrease the chance of calling friends and essentially doing it with each other but how does that change anything? Friends could call and just ask what they think of a question or for help on one even if the questions are scrambled for people.\r\n\r\nI would say either please try to find a better way that doesn't disadvantage anyone or allow it to be open note. Maybe make it so that you have to send in the notes you will use and then you can access only the test and those notes on lockdown browser or something....even then people can still use other devices though.\r\n\r\nAlso, I personally did not know anyone in the class until the very last week because everything was recorded so I think recorded lectures already decreases chances of \"calling friends for help\".",
                "More engagement with the material in between exams.",
                "This course was entirely prerecorded so it felt very distant. It's worth it to wait until it's in person so you can actually see someone teach it.",
                "Classes were asynchronous, so timezones were no problem. Tests occurred during the designated class time, so you wouldn't be able to take a class at the same time.\r\nThe test format was new to me, but it worked well for this type of class. We used lockdown browser, and once a question was answered, you could not go back to check it again.\r\nNo other online learning tools were implemented.",
                "The lectures were easily adapted for the pandemic, since they were simply uploaded as recordings and could be viewed asynchronously. That said, engagement in this class was incredibly low for me. My only actual engagement with the course material, outside of lectures and the occasional office hours, was exams. Some reading responses or discussion sections would have very much been appreciated so that I might be able to think through the material more effectively and actively.",
                "There was truly no practice that allowed for engagement with the class. The pre-recorded lectures definitely allowed people on different time zones to have more flexible access to the class, but because there was no opportunity for in-person communication (other than office hours), it didn't have the feel of a real course at Yale.",
                "I liked that the lectures were recorded",
                "One thing that I believe could be improved was the structure of the online exams. In the exams once you answered a question you were not able to go back and look at it or change your answer which I believed was unfair because in a normal year during an in person exam you would have the option to do this.",
                "It was a good online course.",
                "Shorter lectures would be better, even if that means they become a bit more frequent throughout the week.",

                "I enjoyed the class being asynchronous, it was very manageable during remote learning.",
                "It was nice that I could do the class entirely on my own time, but it could have had at least a couple live sessions with Professor Bargh teaching. He also literally just used the same recorded lectures as last semester, which I guess makes sense but still made the course feel less engaging. I also think the grading was unfair and so many of the multiple choice questions were worded illogically. Plus, a course like this is unfair because I think everyone cheats on the exams when they are not supposed to be open note. I think that is really unfair for those that did not. They could have proctored the exams on zoom like my other courses did.",
                "I liked the pre-recorded lectures because it was easy to follow the course at my own pace. However, I did find myself falling behind in the lectures because there were only 3 exams throughout the entire semester, so having more graded work to submit might have helped me stay on track throughout the course and avoid falling behind.",

                "Yes! The content is really interesting. It is low-time commitment. Only three exams so not much work (but could be high stress for each exam). Readings aren't necessary at all to do well on the exams. Overall, the material is intriguing and has changed how I think about the unconscious and its impact on my everyday life.",
                "Yes, relatively easy class. Just a fair warning, it gets really repetitive. Would recommend as a 5th class",
                "It's a perfect 5th credit or Credit\/D\/Fail.",

                "Yes, fascinating topic that felt relevant to my real life.",
                "It's a nice 5th credit. Low workload, interesting material. If that's something you're looking for, do it!",
                "If you're looking for a chill class, take it. But at the same time, make sure you have some stake in learning about the 'unconscious mind.' Though the class isn't too demanding, asynchronous lectures and lesson redundancies might spell disasters for people who aren't super interested in the topic. It's easy to slack off and find yourself overwhelmed before exams.",
                "As someone who had already finished the neuro major, this was a good class to CrD during the end of the world. The reading was not necessary to do well but exam questions were not always clear.",
                "I wouldn't really recommend this course. The content is occasionally interesting but grows somewhat repetitive as the course progresses. Furthermore, the online format for the course overall proves to be not especially engaging. It's very difficult to grow intellectually as a student throughout the course, as feedback is pretty minimal and one isn't given the opportunity to consider where they went wrong in previous assignments. Overall, it's a pretty limited course, at least in the online format.",
                "If you have taken other psych classes, a lot of the material is repetitive. However, the new concepts are actually really interesting. Take it if you need a gut because there is virtually no work",

                "Yes definitely take especially for an extra low workload class.",
                "No - thought the professor was very hard to speak with especially regarding grades as the class was heavily curved down and with a 83 average of the  3 exams I was in potential danger of getting a D in the class allegedly.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they want an approachable introduction to the unconscious mind and have an interest in reading about the foundational research relating to the study of the unconscious. As someone who is not in CGSC, I found the course content to be interesting, and I also noted that it changed the way I think about some of my own behaviors.",
                "Yes, only if you are ok with being just graded on tests, this is a great course with very interesting course material!",
                "If you find the topic somewhat interesting, then yes I would recommend it. If the description sounds dull to you, I would not take it because it is a lot of this material to take in and understand.",
                "Maybe, but iwould warn it is a low-energy course and repetitive if you have taken many other psych courses. Also, everyone cheats on the exams (which are the only grading component) so be prepared for that frustration.",
                "Its an interesting class but be warned that grading is a bit harder than for most psych classes as he tries to stick to the 25% A guidline",
                "Don't expect an easy grade, but the material is very interesting. I took this class as a Cr\/D\/F to learn something different and outside of my major, and that's what I got.",
                "I would highly recommend this course because the material is very interesting and it does not have a very heavy workload.",
                "yes it was good",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. This semester the average was incredibly high and to earn a good letter grade you had to score exceptionally on every test. I would think that most students take this course as 5th class and it was not worth the stress of dealing with a poor letter grade. Although the material was interesting, the class was not engaging at all.",
                "Yes.",
                "It's a very easy class if you go to lecture. However, because so many people did well, it was difficult to get an A.",

                "Yes it's a fantastic way to dive deep into unconscious processes that are prevalent in almost every region of psychology\/cognitive science research. Even for non-majors, this class is very accessible and a solid class to take for intellectual curiosity without fear.",
                "yes! I found it very interesting!",
                "i definitely think its a great class to take especially in senior year if you've already finished your distributional requirements and are looking for something interesting and fun to learn that's also not too hard. it seems much more interesting than intro psych but probably just as accessible to people who have never studied psychology before.",
                "Yes, this is a great gut. However I did have friends that needed to credit\/d it since the expected A range is only 25-35% as we later learned, despite everyone doing well on tests. But overall, there's zero commitment throughout the week with lectures having already been recorded, and it's just the 3 exams. Extremely easy workload, I binged the lectures the two days before the exams and it works out. Plus it's super interesting content.",
                "For sure",
                "This course has really interesting material. It is a pretty standard lecture and can get dry at times simply because of the fomrat.",
                "Yes. Its very interesting and the coursework is manageable.",
                "Yes. Especially if youre interested in the brain. And human behavior.",
                "Yes if you have the drive to teach yourself the material. No otherwise.",
                "I would not recommend this class to anyone that isn't a psychology major because at the end of the day the material was interesting but I did not find it relatively easy to understand. The class curve was ridiculous because it made my grade worse overall. I had a raw score of a 71.62% and I originally was going to credit D\/F the course. Out of a courtesy I emailed Professor Bargh, and he informed me that a 71.62% was not going to be a C- or higher but that I was in danger of failing the course. I truly don't understand how a 71% could get anyone an F. So on the last day that I was able to withdraw I had to set up a meeting with my Dean and figure out a plan. I honestly was lucky that I figured all of this out in time because if I did not, I would've ended up getting an F in a course that I had a C- in. I don't see how that is fair at all and quite frankly does not represent what Yale is about. I felt as if this professor did not care at all that he would've given out an underserving F.",
