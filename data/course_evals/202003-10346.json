I learned how to think about the global ramifications of these ideas and also connect them back to modern news. I thought about very different ideas and connections than I have before and it really enriched my understanding of medicine and conceptions of life.",

I was also able to work on understanding the history that we studied in the context of itself rather than the context of the present. It was also the first time that I was able to really learn about abortion and its history throughout the world.",

I felt that this course was very insightful and opened my mind to new ways of thinking about modern day topics such as abortion, gender, and science and society themselves.",

However, I thought that sometimes the seminar bordered on a lecture and many of the topics returned to religion in a way I wasn't expecting. I think if we had talked more about how historical perspectives link have modern implications that would have helped! Also, perhaps if students were assigned to lead discussions on certain weeks that might help it be more student led.",

At times I would have preferred to have more of a free-flowing discussion rather than one that was guided and directed. I would have also enjoyed more mixed-media material to  be included throughout the course!",
                "strengths: Prof. Dal Prete is a very caring, kind, and dedicated professor. Even in the virtual format he did a great job leading discussions and getting us to think in new ways. All the readings that are assigned have a purpose and I never felt like I was just doing busy work. Even though this class was at 1:30pm on a Friday, I always looked forward to it. \r\nweaknesses: sometimes the lectures felt a little long. But they were always very insightful and I never felt like my time was being wasted."

They were used one or two times and it was great to talk on an even smaller group level. Additionally, the visuals that were presented were great to get a better idea of what we were talking about.",

The videos seemed interesting though and if they were viewed on a projector\/screen in an in person setting it would have definitely worked, it's just one of those things that doesn't really adapt to a virtual setting"

It is more focused on ancient techniques.",

He also cares about his students' growth and is willing to provide the support you might need to succeed-- that includes discussing topics, reviewing your reading responses before you turn them in, etc. I think he is an example of a professor that will really go the extra mile to help his students get the most out of the course."
