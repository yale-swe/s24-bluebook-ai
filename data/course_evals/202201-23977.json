                "This section struggled to be engaging at 9:00. It was clear that the time harmed discussion and attendance. This course would benefit from a later time and also avoiding discussions getting bogged down with one specific point of the readings. There simply is not enough time to lose when we need to cover so much material.",
                "The books were great and I learned a lot. I think the seminar format could be improved, though. And I wish that there was more \"historical,\" as I found myself lacking context for the \"political.\"",
                "The professor was always incredibly nice and helpful, but his class had many flaws. Despite this class being fundamentally a discussion based seminar, the professor would lecture/soapbox for nearly half of every meeting. It rarely seemed like there was any true opportunity for students to engage intellectually with one another as the professor would always swoop in with his own word. Further, his feedback/grading on essays was comical, nearly every student (not limited to this semester) agreed that the professors grades seemed arbitrary.",
                "I thought the H+P syllabus was the best and most cohesive in DS. Adored this course, I guess I just wish more people had spoken during seminars and that it had been a place where everyone felt as comfortable as I did because I LOVE diving into the texts with lots of people.",
                "I would have liked there to be more class discussionI thought there there were a lot of classes where it was mostly lecture with us asking questions, and I would have loved to hear more of the insights of my peers.",
                "H&P felt like the best organized curriculum of DS spring semester, and the books we read seemed to be well-chosen. Still, like all DS classes, I think it would benefit from cutting down the reading."

                "DS H&P struggles as a class due to the combined nature of political theory with history. The class simply is not about history, instead focusing mostly on political thought and questions of such. The course also fails to capture the essence of many of the readers discussed, instead giving a cursory glance or judgement based on single passages or chapters.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any history/humanities student, or even anyone with a vague interest in western society. You won't find a better foundation elsewhere. Your reading and writing skills will improve drastically through the robust weekly reading assignments and frequent essays. I feel like I learned more in this one year than in 4 years of high school.",
                "I would! I think that the course material is very interesting, although I would reference what I said above about class discussions.",
                "This is DS and thus if you're reading this course recommendation you aren't choosing the course but rather the prof. So here are my thoughts:\r\nlets start with the good bits: Dr. Kreiner is a super understanding and accommodating instructor (see his piece in the YDN on coronavirus and students to get a sense) who also gives excellent feedback on essays. \r\neverything else:\r\n-you will never get your essays back on time, if at all. (Dr. K allows for revisions before the end of the year - but what is the use when the essay you want to revise is still being graded?)\r\n-you will not get timely responses to emails, if at all.\r\nthis is small potatoes about organizational habits that you'll find across the board. It's not worth it - I think - to drop a professor because of these, especially if they are available during office hours / are an excellent prof otherwise. More to the point:\r\n-this is the most important point, by my lights: this class is intended to be a DS discussion section/seminar. It approaches a pale reflection of said description on a good day, of which there are very few. On the average day, Dr. Kreiner lectures for so much of the class time that even when he solicits student participation, it basically serves the pretty perfunctory purpose of having students respond to his prompts without fostering debate/discussion amongst the students themselves (although some days, when Prof. Kreiner doesn't have as much to say, the discussion between students did indeed happen...in any case there was the inescapable feeling that this wasn't intended to be the point of the class.) At the very least the lectures are clear...otherwise the class would be doubly unbearable. \r\n-I think that a few of these things are connected. Prof. Kreiner assumes that the first-year students are just soooo inept and all-over-the-place that 1) he's so incredibly gracious and bends over backwards to accommodate exigencies (this is good!) but 2) assumes that we need to spend 55 minutes each meeting giving us a framework in which to think about the ideas - the historical background etc. - stuff that is usually helpful but certainly shouldn't take up most of class/is the entire point of the weekly lecture system!!\r\n-especially for DS, which is sooo readings-focused, Dr. Kreiner's summary and long lecture - for myself and, I can attest, for most others in the class - disincentivized completing (or getting through a significant amount of) the readings - we weren't going to be able to discuss anyhow, and would get a summary through the lecture component itself",
                "I found the readings to be more relevant and easier to understand than the first semester of H&P, but they were also longer."
