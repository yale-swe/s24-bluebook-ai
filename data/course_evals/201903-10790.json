    "Although Japanese is my heritage language I had never taken the language in a structured, university level class. This class allowed me to pick up more kanji, use formal language, and acquire reading skills in time efficient manner.",
    "How to evaluate Japanese short stories TV shows",
    "New kanji and grammar structures",
    "I improved my ability reading and listening abilities through the course's literature and media assignments. On a deeper level, I was better able to grasp the cultural context giving rise to the material covered.",
    "My Japanese comprehension skills really improved.",
    "I gained the ability to better organise my thoughts in Japanese around structured arguments, expression of impressions and feeling, and clear summaries. Both my speaking and writing abilities improved and my listening skills in participating in class discussions and instructions.",
    "More focus on developing reading and speaking skills that learning new grammar concepts. It is very good, but I'd appreciate more review of L3-L4 grammar every now and then"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths were that the class size was small so it helped students feel less intimidated to share their thoughts with the rest of the class, which facilitated discussion. That being said, sometimes I felt as though the way the course material was being taught didn't allow me to fully absorb the material and apply those acquired skills to successive situations requiring those skills. Also, I did tend to find a lot of inconsistencies and typos in the the textbooks that were provided as course material. I also kind of hoped that we would be able to talk more about global\/social issues and practice more of our writing skills.",
    "Lots of homework. Expect 2-3 hours of homework a class. Could be improved by having more practice for grammar patterns.",
    "Strengths: Good level of difficulty for class to be taught in all-Japanese. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Esoteric vocabulary, fewer chances to speak in class (not necessarily a weakness; substantial self-study is required to internalize new grammar), meets only twice a week.",
    "I think that feedback could be given in a more timely manner so that we could better understand our strengths and weaknesses. It was difficult to try to improve and focus on specific areas without knowing where we were struggling. I think that the discussion based style of the course was engaging and I enjoyed the main texts that we studied.",
    "There's no actual textbook (it's a course packet put together by staff) so there's less structure to the class. If you're used to learning grammar point by grammar point this might be a difficult class."

   "comments": [
    "I think if the student has a deep interest for Japan and its culture, I think this class does a good job of teaching practical skills but also different aspects of Japanese culture.",
    "Yes! Great course if you want to continue learning Japanese and transition into more professional-like speaking\/writing",
    "Professors are very helpful and truly want to help you improve your Japanese.",
    "This is a natural next-step after following the L1-L4 sequence. If you spend a summer abroad in Japan, however, JAPN 156 may provide more of a learning opportunity.",
    "Yes, Japanese is a difficult but rewarding language to learn.",
    "Yes, if you are looking to continue Japanese after L4, this is a good course to continue building your skills.",
    "If you're interested in becoming more fluent in Japanese, yes. Maybe don't just do it for a language credit.",
    "Yes"
