                "I read incredible writings, I had challenging discussions, and I learned how to articulate and defend my opinions. There are few classes at Yale that facilitate such a challenging and yet fun classroom environment.",
                "This class is nominally about the New York Intellectuals, whose world I learned a lot about, but it's also about the defining questions and debates over art, criticism, American politics, and little magazines.

                "Mordechai's expert ability to foster spirited but civil discourse distinguishes his seminars from those of all other professors. To experience the joy of arguing furiously with your peers while also being able to shake hands at the end of the day is one of the great experiences of college.",
                "I loved everything about the course. At times, the article reviews were a bit of a pain, but they did successful encourage actually doing the readings so perhaps a necessary evil.",
                "I enjoyed a lot about this class: first and foremost, the students and the class environment was absolutely delightful, as were the collection of readings that Mordechai provided for us. I think my main issue was with the structure of the course. I would have appreciated:\r\nA syllabus with all the readings on it at the beginning of the course (additional readings could totally have been sent as the class went on, but I would have liked to have at least most of the readings more than a few days ahead of time)\r\nClearer due dates and explanations about assignments (I would have liked to know when reviews, drafts, and final assignments were due, ahead of time, perhaps on the syllabus; I would have also liked written explanations about what the assignments were composed of to check back on) \r\nFinally: at the end of the semester we had nearly a month without a single class, and then we had three classes in the same week (two during reading period). Perhaps some of it was unavoidable, but I would have enjoyed the consistency of having class every week, especially during the end of the year. \r\nNone of this took away from how enjoyable it was to take part in the class. I learned a ton from my fellow students, Mordechai, and the readings. But more consistency may have been useful for my brain, and these are my suggestions on how to increase that clarity / consistency without losing the wonderful heart of the class.",
                "Strengths: the most lively class discussion/debate I've experienced at Yale, great readings, weekly magazine reviews were a great alternative to discussion posts, Mordechai\r\nWeaknesses: steps for getting published were not always the most clear, wish it was spread out over the course of the entire semester more"

Their writing is all amazing, so the readings are super fun. Workload is not bad. I think this course is a really unique exploration of intellectual cultural history that I haven't found elsewhere at Yale. Would recommend.",
                "I would, but only if you are a naturally argumentative or debate-inclined person. If participating in class does not come naturally, this class will be a challenge -- though a rewarding one!",
                "See above! The class mostly requires two things. The first is that you keep an open mind and engage heartily with the readings, debates, and your fellow students. He calls on people in class and doesn't wait for volunteers. You really have to do the reading. This is great-- intellectually challenging and incredibly useful.  The second part, though, depends on whether you can thrive in an environment without clear deadlines or clarity / feedback about assignments. I found this more difficult.",
                "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It's not definitely not for everyone, especially those who take classes primarily to get a grade at the end of the semester, and you have to be prepared to step outside your comfort zone. It's, in my opinion, completely worth it. You won't read or discuss the texts anywhere else at Yale, and you'll be better for having done so."
