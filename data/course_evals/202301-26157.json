The material was thoughtfully curated to provide the student with different points of view from which to form their own opinions on the subject. I learned to think more critically about knowledge creation and the covert effects of colonialism and the patriarchy on the epistemology of things.",

                "There's nothing to improve. This class was outstanding in every way. The course materials were exciting, critical, and engaging. The conversations in class were also deeply engaging and Dr. Chaparro Martinez was approachable and thoughtful in her responses. She did not impose her position on the class and instead gave us a buffet of information from which to make our own conclusions. She welcomed discussion and she was flexible in meeting the class' concerns or topics. She BUILT beyond the readings and offered a space to challenge what we were learning. A class I will certainly always remember.",
                "Amneris is definitely a strength of this course! She is a fantastic teacher who is always open to receiving student feedback and she truly cares about what she teaches and putting it into practice. I also appreciated how there weren't too many readings each week and how reasonable it was to get work done. For the final writing assignment, she also gave us some advice on how to approach the prompts and better make our argument. It was clear that the people that took this class really loved it and we all liked spending time as a class. One way this course could be improved is by allowing us to track our grades more throughout the semester. However, I truly loved this class."

                "This class will change your view of knowledge production and feminism as we've learned from U.S. school systems. Unfortunately, although the materials we read and discussed were excellent, Dr. Chaparro Martinez's experience and insight made the difference to this being an outstanding course, and she was a visiting professor. I'm not sure this course would be the same without her instruction.",
                "Definitely!! This is an amazing class to take if you want to learn more about feminist movements and knowledge creation in Latin America. This course is important for anyone to take with an open mind."
