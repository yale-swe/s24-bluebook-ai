   "comments": [
    "I learned about the connection between ecology and our daily food choices. The class expanded my understanding of some basic ecological and biological concepts and applied them to food.",
    "I learned a lot about modern agriculture and the current issues it faces, as well as ecology concepts and how they directly affect us and our food. I got good practice reading scientific papers and writing a research paper.",
    "I learned a bit about plant ecology on the field trips, but overall the course was not very intellectually stimulating, especially because the professor couldnt answer most questions...",
    "I further delved into the intricacies of ecology and learned a lot more than my basic AP Biology class taught me in high school.",
    "Thinking about the environment more\r\nThinking of the effect of human actions on the environment \r\nConnecting food and agriculture with the environment",
    "I developed skills on how to generate insightful questions about the topics we discussed, and how to organize a research paper.",
    "I have a much richer understanding of ecology and sustainability.",
    "I learned a lot about agriculture and the ecological principles underlying crop and livestock farming.",
    "I learned tons about ecology and food, a relationship I previously knew little about. The balance of information and field trips was amazing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are definitely in the field trips and guest lecturers. They were an engaging way to interact with the concepts we learned in class and see them come to life. Professor Puth and Allison were another strength. They are flexible, kind, and provide thorough feedback on assignments. One weakness of the course would be the readings. Some were dense scientific papers that we didn't discuss enough to help us understand them so it felt like they didn't contribute to our discussions as much as they could have.",
    "I think the field trips were definitely a highlight of this course - I especially liked the ones to the Yale farm, the dairy farm, the oyster farm, and the new science building. I also thought that the agricultural papers we read were interesting and that it was good practice reading scientific publications. I think there could be a stronger connection between the ecology concepts we learned in class and the agriculture\/food issues we learned about. It would also be valuable to have a more diverse set of field trip hosts\/lectures, in both employment\/involvement in ecology and good as well as in gender and ethnicity. I wish we could have learned more about food waste or new food technologies like lab-grown meat.",
    "The strengths were the places we saw on field trips, but the lectures were not interesting to me and I found it frustrating that the social issues within food systems were hardly discussed, even when it was clear that nearly all of our speakers were from one demographic (namely, white men). This could have at least been acknowledged by discussing racism in the food system.",
    "This course is extremely engaging and took experiential learning to the next level. In the future, I could see this course delving even deeper into scientific concepts.",
    "Strengths: interesting field trips, interesting discussion topics\r\nWeaknesses: little diversity in the speakers we met, there seemed to be little connection between the lectures and the field trips, overall the class seemed a bit put together last-minute. I also didnt really like the papers we had to read.",
    "A strength of this course were the interesting field trips, and a weakness was that sometimes we never discussed the homework readings in class.",
    "I loved this course, and I do not have any critism.",
    "strengths: through food journals and writing I learned to apply knowledge from the class\r\nweaknesses: we never discussed the readings in detail, course often felt rushed",
    "Loved the incorporation of guest speakers that pertained to the topics we discussed."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone looking for a basic science course as it does not require any advanced science background. The professor, workload, and field trips are great and it is a good way to get a science credit in your first year.",
    "Yes, I liked learning about the origins of the food we eat and think it something that everyone should know more about.",
    "If you are completely new to ecology and want to go on fun field trips, yes, but if you have any prior knowledge of food systems or ecology, or care at all about the intersections of social issues with ecological\/food-related topics, I would look to more advanced or focused classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to others because of its applicable and relevant content and the field trips were informative and fun.",
    "If interested in ecology, this course may not go deep enough. It is an intro-level course. I still found it fun and interesting, so yes.",
    "Yes, it was an interesting way to learn about the ecological concepts especially with the field trips.",
    "I highly recommended this course to almost everyone I know.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in agriculture rather than ecology as the course really put an emphasis on farming rather than ecology in a scientific sense.",
    "YES! Great content, always more to learn and think about."
