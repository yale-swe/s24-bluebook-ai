   "comments": [
    "I learned how to look primary sources to gather information about historic societies and evaluate the stratification and different opportunities for people from different aspects of society. We also integrated European history with colonial Latin America history to better understand developments in the Americas.",
    "I learned how to build historical arguments.",
    "A great knowledge and understanding of the complex history of Latin America, with separate focuses on the development of Portuguese Brazil and the Spanish Caribbean, Mesoamerica, and South America.",
    "I learned to look at all perspectives of Latin American history (European, Indigenous, African, etc.) when analyzing the events that happened in colonial times. I definitely learned to read faster and more critically to be prepared in section. My Spanish skills improved as well, as I am a non-native Spanish speaker and was in the Spanish-speaking discussion section",
    "This class was a good comprehensive study of Latin America during the colonial era, and helped ground a lot of my other classes on more specialized regions\/ time periods.",
    "This class taught me how to read and comprehend writings on Latin American history. As my first history class at Yale, it also taught me how to structure historical arguments to write papers.",
    "This class taught me that the analysis of history has so many factors and aspects to it that it's difficult to form our own opinion without trying to consider all aspects of it. This class also helped me grow as a writer and analyzer of texts, which will be incredibly helpful as an academic."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course readings provide interesting evidence for the lectures. It was also organized so that historical, political, and social developments over a three hundred year span were all addressed in a single semester.",
    "Professor Schwartz was an amazing lecturer and he always ensured that his students understood his lectures. The chosen course readings were also really interesting. I didn't find any weaknesses.",
    "This does not pertain much pertaining to the actual course. However, I believe offering a second semester course on Latin American history from the colonial era to the present would be worthwhile. There is an Introduction to Latin America course in the Spring, but I am hesitant to take it because there will likely be much overlap with this course.",
    "Strengths: interesting lectures, AMAZING professor and TF, discussion section conducted IN SPANISH!!\r\nWeaknesses: the readings were CRAZY long (like a book a week), you're required to buy like 8 books from the bookstore, and the professor went over in his lecture a little bit and sometimes made me late to my next one lol",
    "The TF's are incredible, and the privilege to hear Professor Schwartz speak is something ever student should take, regardless of major",
    "I liked the way this course was broken up temporally (conquest era, colonial era, independence era), and I liked most of the readings, especially Quito, 1599. I think the course could have spent more time on Portuguese America, and could even have touched on the Philippines. Lastly, I wish the course had spent more time discussing race in a more nuanced fashion (for instance, I wish the class had not used the term \"Indian\" in lectures).",
    "Since this history class covers a large period of time, I was doubtful that it wouldn't be a survey class of historical events; however, I was wrong. The class was well organized to introduce us to general history of the region while also demonstrating themes that occurred throughout the centuries.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- lectures were to the point and always flowed really well \r\n- the section was thought-provoking and challenging \r\n- the texts we read provided many perspectives \r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- some texts were difficult to understand"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course. I knew very little about Latin American history going into this course, and I learned a lot over the semester. Typically, I prefer learning about politics and war in history classes, but I found it very interesting to learn about the different levels of colonial Latin American society, which played a huge role in its history. This course made me interested in aspects of history that I previously had very little interest, and lectures felt more like interesting storytelling than dry slide reading.",
    "I would recommend simply because of the professor--his lectures were always really interesting and well-organized.",
    "Yes. This was easily the best History lecture I have taken at Yale. Professor Schwartz is an incredibly engaging lecturer, making the story of Colonial Latin America interesting and exciting. The class was very well organized and the readings were almost always great. Whether a History major or not, take this class!",
    "Yes. It is particularly fascinating for Spanish speakers because they offer a Spanish speaking section.",
    "I would say yes!! It's really interesting and the TFs are REALLY cool!! I would recommend searching hard for the readings online or from Amazon because they are very expensive at the bookstore and the professor requires around 8 books. Also the readings are dense and long so learn to skim and try to add something in section!",
    "Very much so, however it is an aggressive amount of work with two papers, midterm, and a final.",
    "For some of the reasons mentioned above, I think I might recommend this course only if a student were looking for a broad lecture on Latin America. I wish the discussions of race had a bit more sensitivity.",
    "Yes, this class is a great lecture because it is relatively small in size and Professor Schwartz is a great history lecturer.",
    "Yes! The lectures for this class are amazing and provide such in-depth coverage of a lot of history. The midterm and finals were also pretty fine with the help of the TA's review session and with the use of lecture notes and slides. There are never any surprises!"
