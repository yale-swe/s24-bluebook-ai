                "As expected, we read Emerson, Dickinson, and Melville. The three authors are more interconnected than they might seem. At least for me, I learned how to read and think about texts at a far deeper level.",
                "The chance to read some great literature with a class of incredible people.",
                "I learned so much about American literature and thought, and of course, the three writers of the course.",
                "Insight into the writing and thinking of emerson, dickinson & melville",
                "I learned how to close-read better and how to consider the text itself from a broader perspective. For example, we learned about how Emerson emphasizes that man is inherently good; Dickinson dwells on the externalization of the self; and Melville asserts the realism of his fictional characters.",
                "This class allowed me to dive into the work of three incredible American authors. I grew as a writer, and gained confidence in evaluating arguments. The class discussions were very insightful and it was a pleasure to learn from such a soulful and intelligent group of my peers.",
                "I learned a lot about three important figures in the American literary canon and got a great overview of the breadth of their works. I also explored how they can be in conversation with each other.",
                "This course improved my analytical skills on a specific and broad scale. It helped me to read sources in conversation with each other, without exclusively looking at one particular tradition. Specifically, this class improved my asking of questions: I learned how to interrogate small sections of a text and frame them in various different lights.  It also helped me develop as a participant in a seminar, as the conversations were engaging and highly collaborative.",
                "This course will teach you how to think about texts ranging in theme but unified in stakes and history of influence. You will practice not just noticing and articulating patterns but determining their grander significance. Professor Deming is a big fan of the question, \"So what?\" This philosophy guides class discussions. This helped the entire class feel greater than an intellectual exercise. The texts and conversations matter. \r\nAs a student, you will write two papers (a midterm and a final) as well as a discussion paper and a set of discussion questions (used throughout the semester). None of these assignments have specific prompts, so you will also learn to craft arguments around your interest. This was a huge skill I took away from the class. Since these works are so famous, it can be hard to find new/personal readings. However, by teaching the class in SUCH an open/individual way, students had to find their own path into the text."

            "comments": [
                "The seminar discussions were great. No one was afraid to speak, and it was basically like having a large conversation. The reading and writing is very manageable, though you may want to start reading Moby-Dick over break. Most importantly the reading is interesting. I never really felt that it was a chore.",
                "I loved the back and forth discussion between my classmates and me, though I wish there was a bit more moderation in the conversation every now and then. Without anyone to reign in the class conversation (Professor Deming tended to listen), we'd go to some pretty far-off places and wander out of the classroom like sailors without a compass.",
                "This was an amazing course: Deming cultivates a really warm and exciting seminar environment, and the material and discussion are always top-notch.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that might deter some students is that the reading required varies greatly throughout the semester: the Dickinson is a handful of short poems a week, and then you get to Melville and read Moby-Dick in less than two weeks.",
                "strengths: very interesting writers and subject material; good setup of class discussion with respondent and correspondent; engaging and interesting professor; workload isn't so high that it distracts from actually thinking about what we're reading. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: not many... maybe this is par for the course in english seminars, but it felt like sometimes we got off track and kept talking about something really marginal/ potentially nonsensical, but people didn't know how to stop. Maybe prof. deming can step in then? But I wouldn't want him to be too heavy handed so I understand. I think the course only felt a bit of a drag when we the students didn't put in the right effort.",
                "Strengths: Professor Deming is fantastic at facilitating conversation. My classmates were very engaged and interesting to talk to both during and after class. The content itself is also super interesting -- I left each class feeling like I've learned something new. The workload is very manageable. The class discussions prepared me very well to write the essays. Weaknesses: None!",
                "strength: good trajectory through the authors, comprehensive selection of readings \r\nweakness: I would have liked to read more of Emerson's fictional works and poetry rather than only his essays",
                "This class facilitated engaging and active discussions between students, but I think that towards the beginning of the course it could be beneficial for a slightly more explicit explanation of the Emerson texts. Personally, I found those to be the most difficult to grasp and having a clearer understanding to jump off of could have made the material easier to access. A strength of this course was the inclusion of respondents and correspondents. Having 4-5 different points of entry to any given reading led to an increased depth of analysis and guided conversation in a productive way.",
                "Strengths: the readings (Emerson is a true inspiration; Dickinson is an absolute genius; Melville is perhaps the GOAT), the professor (Deming is smart, deeply engaged, caring--a wonderful teacher), and the collegial class atmosphere (which Deming, largely, creates).",
                "Strengths: \r\nThe class is well organized, and every student has the chance to participate heavily in each class. However, Professor Deming does not let the students have complete control. He guides the discussion and encourages students to argue with each other. In my opinion, seminars should have professor input. They have their degrees, we don't. Deming strikes a nice balance. \r\nProfessor Deming is clearly very experienced. He knows the texts inside and out, and he can quote specific passages without looking at the page. He offers robust feedback (at least 2 typed pages / paper you write)."

I personally had not taken that many English courses before and it was a great way for me to learn how to better appreciate literature, and how it relates to living one's life. At least for me, it's made me truly think about what I want to do with my time.",
                "Yes! It's exactly what the syllabus advertisesa course that gives to you as much as you give to it. So give, read, engage, and it will all be well worth it!",
                "Yes! If you are interested in a varied yet involved English seminar, this is the one. You cover a lot of ground but also go deep into each writer.",
                "Absolutely yes. I enjoyed the course a lot. Super interesting works to read and think about, some of which really resonated with me personally/emotionally. Worth trying to get in even if you don't have an English background (I hadn't taken any english courses before this)-- just register at the earliest possible second.",
                "Yes absolutely! This is my favorite English class that I've taken so far. I left each class with a new takeaway or lesson. I love the class culture (everyone is friendly, engaged, and supportive), and the focus on three authors is the perfect breadth for the semester!",
                "Yes. I got a really good sense of the three authors the course is focused on, which is what I wanted",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they particularly enjoyed the philosophical component of literature. The reading load was manageable, if heavy at times, and the conversations were interesting. The class was often rather theoretical and abstract, and I would warn away someone looking for a straightforward writing credit. That being said, it is a great option if the student is interested in the topics covered.",
                "Absolutely--there are few combinations so potent as Emerson, Dickinson, Melville, and Deming.",
                "yes! \r\nFirst of all, the readings are just great. But Deming brings a very specific and humorous energy to the class that is unlike any teacher I've had at Yale. He clearly loves his job, and he isn't afraid to push people in the moment in class. \r\nMake sure to do the reading. He cold calls :) \r\nIf you put the work into the class, you will walk away with far more insight into reading great texts and expressing arguments about them."
