            "comments": [
                "Strengths: I loved how the essays we were assigned for each class period clearly had a unifying theme and a lesson embedded in them, whether on structure or on content. In addition, Professor RKN fostered a warm and inviting class environment that made it feel really easy to contribute to class discussions and in workshops. I also really liked how classes integrated discussions of the readings with reflective writing activities and prompts that helped us either brainstorm or edit our essays. The most helpful aspect of the entire course was definitely the feedback that we received, though. Professor RKN provides really in-depth, kind, yet constructive feedback that was instrumental to helping me develop a keener sense of how I approach and structure my writingand this sort of critical self-reflection and analysis applies to all forms of writing. Weaknesses: not really any major ones! The weekly reading responses for every piece we read were sometimes a lot though, especially when we had five readings for a class and work for other courses was piling up.",
                "Strengths: RKN is a *fantastic* professor + gives extremely detailed + helpful feedback, essays are open-ended and let you explore your interests, in-class writing exercises are usually very fun, class community is supportive, lots of helpful author visits, generally interesting readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: really not many? Sometimes class conversation felt a little repetitive, I guess",
                "Strengths: very well taught. The weekly readings were very relevant and helped give a framework of how to write our own essays. I also loved that we would submit a first draft, get comments and then get to submit a final draft for a grade. This is a great system to teach you how to edit your own writing and polish as you go.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: you basically have an essay due every week which is quite time consuming, but it is definitely doable.",
                "Strengths: Everything! I wouldn't change a thing",
                "This course gives you a lot of freedom when it comes to writing styles and topics",
                "English 120 is only full of strengths. The organization of this course, from the in-class workshops to the alternating weekly writing/editing schedules, is phenomenal. The essay topics require insight and thought, and I found myself really taking time to consider and reflect upon my experiences during the writing process.",
                "I wish we edited more of our peers work. I am glad the course eventually changed to the structure of free writing in class and I hope this continues in future classes. Pacing was a bit rushed. We finished our essays faster than many other English 120 classes. I learned that the only way to get that coveted \"A\" grade is to write what the professor is looking for, and that lies in structure. I discovered that more risky ideas and structures would not get the grade they deserved sometimes if it wasn't executed correctly. I think this discouraged some of my peers from taking more risks. Risks should be more praised in a more creative writing class such as this one. I think we all eventually found the professor's flow. This class was challenging and what you put in you got out. Effort was rewarded. I think execution was highly valued in the course, something that wasn't necessarily taught and which I relied on my own knowledge to achieve. I think more student essays should be read in the course, praising what they did well and bad in. Reading NYT articles and book snippets don't reflect the word and time constraints of our class sometimes. This class overall did help with growing as a writer but I wish it was more collaborative with my peers and honestly that we wrote more in class, where my best ideas grew near the end of the semester as we had more time in class to explore. Workshops felt rushed and it was hard to get everyone to participate and voices were not dispersed equally. Our class though was very enthusiastic and engaged which helped. Professor had best interests at heart I think."

                "Yes! Especially if you can take it with RKN. ENGL 120 is a great chance to practice non-academic writing and explore your interests and identities, whether you're an experienced writer or a total beginner. Such a supportive teacher + class.",

                "Yes!!! This was such a fun class and even though the workload was a little bit more than other courses it was necessary for this class. I never felt that I was doing busy work, everything that we did in this class felt like it was necessary to help me learn.",

                "Yes",
                "Absolutely. Writing, especially in essay format, is an essential life skill. Often times academic writing can scare students from writing but this class carefully teaches you without too much time pressure. All the readings assigned especially with Prof RKN align with the essay prompts and only adds to the class.",
                "Yes! ENGL 120 is a phenomenal course, and Professor RKN is incredible! She gives thorough feedback on every draft and genuinely cares about her students. I improved as a writer and a person in this course, and it was also enjoyable work.",
                "Yes, 100%. I entered English 120 completely unsure of my writing ability and very anxious about participating in class. I emerged as a confident writer, thanks to the affirming words and encouragement of Professor RKN. The class environment was warm, welcoming, and intimate: my worries about participation ceased, and I found myself speaking up and sharing my perspective quite often.",
