                "Learned about different techniques within human bio, their applications and how they can apply to ethics around biological research.",
                "In this course, I learned about how human subjects research is conducted and evaluated. We learned a bit about the historical context as well as really focused on the social implications of human research. Some of the insights that I took away from taking this course were how to problematize research that is aimed at having \"human benefit\" but asking questions of who is benefits, why is the research being conducted, and who's voice is being left out of the conversation. We also learned about identity and stereotypes formation beign historically roots in \"science research\"",
                "Study of the ethical and social impact that biological research has on society",
                "This class challenged students to take a critical look at human biology research methods. We took a close look at the ways that human biology has hurt various communities and were able to learn what appropriate measures should be taken when involving humans in studies.",
                "I learned to connect science to societal issues.",
                "I learned about the different considerations that are typically made when designing an experiment with human subjects, like power, informed consent, and ethics. We also discussed what research has been done regarding the human condition (skin, gender, response to opiates, intelligence) as well as how science has been used to justify\/understand our ideas of race and gender.",
                "I felt that our class was able to create really insightful conversations around the failings and shortcomings of medicine throughout history to support all members of society. As so many of us are going into the medical field it felt like we were engaging with difficult topics that are of the utmost importance to all of us.",
                "I learned so much. This was the best class Ive ever taken. Learning about the social aspects of biology was great and something I havent really gotten in other classes Ive taken.",
                "I learned about the complex connection between science and society.",
                "I have never before taken a course that mentions all of the less-talked-about topics of medicin such as race and gender biases that we all know exists but fail to recognize at times. So, in the beginning it was a bit challenging for me to form my own ideas and opinions on some topics but I believe I have now found that ability thanks to this class.",
                "I developed a deeper understanding of the complicated and structural issues around biology and human research in a historical context. This course made me a more empathetic and well rounded scientist."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the professors were always engaged and wanted us to have important discussions on sensitive topics. They were also always available for 1-1 conversations and feedback discussion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not a real weakness, but since I this is the first time the course is being taught I believe next time it will be more streamlined in terms of assignments, organization, etc.",
                "This was the first time this course has been offered, and I think it came together quite well. The material was fascinating and managed to cover a range of subjects. The workload was very manageable, and the two writing assignments allowed a good amount of self-direction. The assessments we were given didn't actually relate to the class readings\/lecture content, which may have made participation and discussion less lively, so my only suggestion is that perhaps there would be a way to better align those. In general, though, this was a terrific class, and I'm sure the next version with Profs Horsley and Roberts will be even better!",
                "Strength: Professor Horsley and Professor Keshishian are absoulte gems and truly care about students learning the materials, the topics are so important and the teaching staff did a great job of cultivating class reading and talking points forr discussion each week, Professor Horsley was willing to give up class time from lecture to let student dicscussion and participation flow naturally throughout the course.\r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes the reading load felt a bit unbalanced throughout the semester (some Wednesday classes would have a ton of reading that I couldn't get through)",
                "This class was full of lively discussion and was a great balance between biological study and its impact on humanity.",
                "Loved the in-class discussions! You have many opportunities to participate without any pressure to always have the right answers. The classroom environment was definitely a huge PLUS! The atmosphere was so open and comforting that everyone always felt validated and included. There were many resources provided to students to further investigate topics we discussed in class.",
                "I think the course was very well organized!",
                "My favorite part of the class was in working on the grant proposals. I got a lot of feedback from my peers, and it was cool to tie in the ideas we learned earlier (ethics especially) to a topic that I felt really passionate about. I also really liked the discussions I had with my peers, especially when we talked about topics I did not know as much about. One of the biggest weakness of this course was that it often felt like it was all over the place. There was a point in the class where we just alternated between talking about race and talking about gender, with very little movement in terms of new understandings about these topics. I also felt like I was introduced to certain people in the teaching staff only for them to have very little relevance to the way that the class was actually orchestrated.",
                "I really feel that this course is filling a gap in the MCDB curriculum. There is no ethics course and given that so many of us are pursuing medicine, there really should be a course like this. \r\n\r\nI do feel, however, that we needed to bring in more speakers or guest lecturers to provide personal insight into many of the topics that were presented. By including POC lecturers, trans lecturers, queer lecturers, etc. we can add a dimension of personality and true impact. I feel especially that given the wealth of professorship available at Yale this would have elevated the course further without having to look to far outside .",
                "I think this is a very interesting basis for a class and important for biology majors to take and understand. However, I do think that it could be restructured somewhat. First, I think having the very delineated weeks tends to disregard intersectionality. Second, I think some of the conversations and comments could come off as culturally insensitive at some points. I think a really good way to address this would be to have a humanities professor co-teach this course to bring in another perspective, some more humanities-based readings to balance the scientific papers, and to help facilitate discussion.",
                "Strengths: the material and caring esa of the Professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: nothing",
                "I think that introducing frequent guest speakers\/ professionals in the fields of humanities for each unit would take this class to the next level.",
                "This course is exactly what we need more of, especially for biology majors who are likely to go on and practice medicine later in life."

I'm so happy that I decided to take this class as my senior elective because of her vitamin opportunity to learn more about important topics that touch on science research that I've never been really disgusting other classes in MCDB. I vitiated the amount of time effort and dedication the professor Horsley and professor Keshishian committed to the class. You got a chance to take the class I absolutely say take it literally would rearrange my schedule and then I could retake this class! Degree I think that there should be more social aspect of biology research required for the MCDB your degree similarly to MB&B",

                "I would recommend this class to MCDB students who are looking for a somewhat easier 300-level class to take for their major. Other than that, I felt this class could have been taught a lot better.",
                "I feel that with some adjustments to the syllabus and speakers\/lecturers invited to talk this could be an amazing course that really elevates the MCDB department. With that, I would recommend the course given that I really valued the discussion with some of my peers I have known for years and our ability to critically discuss hard topics that have the potential to impact how we approach and practice medicine in the future.",

                "Yes, great instructors that made learning a fun and interactive experience.",
                "Yes! I would recommend this course 100%. Working with professor Horsley was a breath of fresh air. She cared a lot about us as students and people and facilitated interesting and productive conversations."
