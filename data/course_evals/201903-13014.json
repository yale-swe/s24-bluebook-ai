   "comments": [
    "I learned about the intersection of ecocriticism and critical race theory. I learned how to conduct literary analysis while referencing the wider range of criticism. The course covered a novel each week coming from Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean.",
    "This course really taught me about the concept of slow violence and also about the subjectivity of the term \"wilderness\" and the idea of multiplicity in postcoloniality and in history.",
    "An understanding of what constitutes a postcolonial ecologies and the ways in which these works advocate for environmental justice",
    "I loved the syllabus for this class, both the novels and the secondary sources. It is somewhat similar to World English Literatures, but the ecological aspect adds a really rich dimension, and the novels are from a later date.",
    "I learned about the intersection of postcolonialism and ecocriticism in literature and developed new ways of thinking about what is natural in an environment and who gets to decide."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of this course comes from its synthesis of nature writing with the perspective of people of color. Many Yale courses will focus on one of these topics but not the other, so this course had something quite unique to offer. I also appreciated Professor Iheka. He is kind, knowledgable, and gracious in the classroom.",
    "The syllabus contained many good and thought-provoking books, which was great.  The pace of the course, however, was sometimes too quick to really go in-depth into some of the novels.  Discussions also could perhaps be improved with more structure.",
    "I think this course did well in covering a number of topics and areas, and the assignments were well structured and helpful in leading to the final paper. However, I felt that the discussion in class did not prepare me well for constructing my own argument, as the discussion rarely built on itself. Overall, I liked the books on the syllabus, and while the class included many more books written by women than a typical Yale English seminar, I did find that the books written by women were generally of a better quality and the books written by men were simplistic in their depictions of women. Sometimes the workload was hard to balance, especially with secondary readings, which was a shame because the class could definitely be improved by more engagement with the secondary material.",
    "The syllabus was the definite strength of the course. It was really well put together, and Prof. Iheka knew so much about each book. He was also very thoughtful about content warnings and how we should approach difficult subjects.\r\nI think the discussion could have been stronger. Though that might have been because of the size\/makeup of our class, I think there was not enough room for student participation.",
    "The set of novels assigned for this seminar were perfectly suited to the central themes of the course, and the classroom discussion itself was well guided by Professor Iheka's questions about the readings. The secondary readings were very useful background information but I think the course could be improved by dedicating time during class to more fully delve into some of their key concepts as well. I also think trigger warnings for some of the themes of trauma before each week's reading (when applicable) would be useful."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in the intersection that the course poses. I would also recommend it to those interested in world literature.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course.  Overall, the readings were really good.",
    "Yes! Every work we read and class discussion opened my eyes to look at the environment, other humans, and the greater world in new ways. My beliefs and assumptions were questioned, and I truly felt changed by the course material. After having finished the semester, I could not wait to recommend to my friends and peers some of the works we had read.",
    "Yes, if you are looking to read contemporary world literature and learn about postcolonial ecocriticism. While it is difficult to develop one's own critique from this class, it certainly provides you with a variety of ideas and viewpoints from which to build. The assignments are very broad, which made it difficult to narrow one's focus until the very end of the class, but they provide opportunities to explore a topic in great depth.",
    "Yes. Prof Iheka is new, and so I think this class will only get better, and the syllabus was already good. If you want to read postcolonial literature, or literature through an ecological lens, I definitely recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this seminar! There aren't many classes like this that are currently being taught at Yale. I really appreciated being able to think about the environment from a non-Western, postcolonial perspective. You should know that a good amount of the material deals with themes of ecological violence and trauma, but the professor handles discussions of them responsibly."
