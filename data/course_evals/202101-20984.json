                "The content itself is so interesting and relevant, the main weakness is the lack of clarity and expectations in assignments (of which there are only project milestones towards the final project). The course is cross listed so nearly everyone at Yale can take it, which is great, but it feels more geared toward grad students and is pretty ambiguous to an undergrad",
                "Topics were rather large and abstract and, although there was potential, did not relate back to current events/moments. It was good for getting a general idea of space in an urban context as well as how certain themes and ideas are a global occurence.",
                "The course is really interesting, but sometimes I felt that it was trying to cover TOO much in one semester. Perhaps it could be streamlined a bit.",
                "Lectures were super interesting, and we covered a wide array of topics which was absolutely great. Of course, the virtual component made discussion section difficult, but overall the course was really good. Potentially would have been nice to have *more assignments, to increase course engagement and incentivize understanding of materials.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Understanding teaching team\r\n- Variety of topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Basically zero feedback on student work prior to final project submission\r\n- Poor selection of weekly readings\r\n- ???? don't know what I learned besides a few niche facts here and there",

                "Enjoyed the pecha kucha! But I wish the class had more structure in terms of content",
                "More interaction with the class. I know it was difficult being online, but even in section our TA was not very engaging at all and made it very boring.",
                "No weaknesses! The lectures were well organized, the TFs were extremely helpful, and the variety of topics discussed made the class even more interesting",
                "weaknesses: the zoom format was a little less engaging than in person but that cant be helped! Very greatful for all the effort Prof Easterling put into creating immersive, multimedia slides and lectures though!!!",
                "Lectures had no relevance, content was not graded at all",
                "I think the strength of the course is the lecture style. A lot of people complain about dry lectures that you can read off the lecture notes but this is probably the first lecture class I've taken where traditional lecture notes would really not do you much good. It's all about the approaches you take to a particular issue, and the interesting ideas and claims that Prof. Easterling makes along the way that you want to pay attention to. The one improvement I would make is that Prof. Easterling has slides with numbers on them to mark \"interplays\" and it would be nice to have an updated powerpoint with each one to better track the themes throughout the course.",
                "The lectures were phenomenal and the readings were incredibly interesting. For some reason, however, engagement of others in discussion section and lecture was incredibly weak. Maybe there need to be stronger incentives to get people to read and participate? Also, we never get a single grade in this course until the very end -- that accords well with the culture and fit but makes it very unpredictable and feel less like an academic class which demands academic engagement.",
                "I loved the TedTalk-esque format, and found the lectures really engaging and interesting. The only negative was that some of the readings were quite dry and difficult to process--some more modern selections/news articles would've been more appealing. I also would've enjoyed hearing more about Keller's own work.",

Most of the course is a super light workload with a few readings a week to prepare for section (sometimes kind of long) and then most of the work concentrated on a final project. The TAs are pretty cool and focused on facilitating genuine discussion during sections, which was definitely appreciated.",
                "Unless you are in architecture major or in urbanism major do not take this class. It was very specific to those majors and even as someone who is in urban studies major I found it quite boring.",

Its not very hard but you learn so much about the world and the strange networks of power, technology, economy, and culture that drive it.",
