This course is the perfect crash-course in computational linguistics, provided you already know how to code. I also gained some foundational knowledge in other adjacent fields: probability theory and set theory, in particular. And I learned what on earth a \"neural network\" is! I think this class is among the highest in terms of \"net amount of things you will learn\" if you haven't done any work in compling before.",

                "The psets were more helpful than lecture attendance in my opinion in terms of understanding the material. Professor Frank is an enthusiastic lecturer but often I felt under equipped to follow lectures without substantial help from youtube videos and textbook readings.",
                "Strengths: cool material especially how NLP meshes with linguistics chances to actually apply all the stuff we are learning in assignments\r\nWeaknesses: long assignments, difficult with not an extensive CS background, material is often not very engaging, not a lot of feedback on assignments, office hours were tough to make",
                "Professor Frank is a terrific instructor and engaging lecturer. My only real issues with the course are that I'm not the biggest fan of group projects, and that the first (and last) time I went to office hours for help with a problem set, the ULA was unable to help me and seemed unfamiliar with the material.",
                "Strengths: professor and course material, homework assignments were very interesting and fair\r\nWeaknesses: lecture slides were not very helpful to review if you forgot a part of the class or were confused. They are heavily dependent on live input from the professor during lecture.",
                "The course covers a lot of topics with the expectation that you already have a strong background in linguistics and computer science. I would recommend taking courses in both of those areas before taking this course. Not necessarily a strength or weakness, but it will help you get more out of it.",
                "Strength: very interesting course material and structure.\r\nWeakness: hard to keep up without a background in statistics",
                "Strengths: the material is fascinating, the grading is very lenient, and the P-sets are quite fun! And Prof Frank is always very helpful at office hours.\r\nWeaknesses: you have to REALLY know how to code, and you have to be quiet good at thinking mathematically. Many reviews of the course say it is better for CS students who are interested in linguistics than for linguists who are interested in CS...I don't think this is true, BUT the caveat is that you have to be a linguist who is mathematically-minded. I also wish lecture slides were uploaded to canvas BEFORE, not AFTER, classes, so that we could follow along with the slides in class on our own computers in case we ever miss some information. Of course, Prof Frank is always willing to go back to a previous slide if anyone asks.",
                "This was an excellent course, the teacher is very enthusiastic and engaging, and there was a very reasonable courseload that helped to cement the concepts we learned in class. Having the final early to make room for the final project was very helpful.",
                "Lectures were very engaging. Professor Frank is a wonderful lecturer and did a great job explaining many of the technical concepts. I would have enjoyed a bit more exploration and explanation of the purely linguistic ideas behind a lot of what we learned.",
                "Professor Frank is fantastic and I found the course perfect in terms of knowledge/level and difficulty of homework/selection and depth of topics. Enjoyed the opportunity to conduct a final project as well."

                "It was a fine survey of applied stats from a linguistic perspective. If that's what you're looking for, then yes.",
                "Yes, but only if you have a coding background and are interested in linguistics. As someone with more of a linguistic background (and having taken CS50 w/ minimal other coding experience), the coding required in assignments was sometimes quite tough, although not impossible. If you have other background knowledge in NLP, that would be a great asset -- some groups had very complicated final projects that I could not have implemented with my limited background.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in the intersection of linguistics and programming, this is a great survey of ways to apply the latter to the former.",
                "Yes, if taught by Prof. Frank. It is a great introduction or even second course in NLP techniques.",
                "Yes, if you're very interested in NLP and computational linguistics. Class is a lot of work but p-sets are graded fairly and as long as you do the work you'll be ok. Don't take this course if you're really only interested in transformer-based architecture or neural networks, as it only touches on those the last couple classes.",
                "Yes, if you have strong background with Python and machine learning. It's very heavy on the computational side and I had a lot of catching up to do throughout the course.",
                "Professor Frank is incredibly passionate and engaging. I learned a ton about many computational models used for linguistics and the problem sets were enjoyable and not too difficult or time-consuming. The only assessment was an in-class quiz that had people stressing and it seems like we all overprepared (which was, perhaps, the point).",
                "Yes, its well taught and very interesting.\r\nUnderstand basic stats before you do.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but not to a linguist who is just looking for a QR credit, as you need to be quite mathematically minded (and good at Python!) to keep up in this class. But the material you will learn is fascinating and, like all linguistics classes, will seriously change the way you view language.",
                "I'd recommend this course for anyone with a computational background and some level of interest in applying it to natural language processing. That said, this is definitely not the course that will teach you to reproduce ChatGPT, so one should know that going in-- it's less about deep learning and more about the probabilistic methods that came before. It's a good course overall though, and there's a significant amount of freedom in the final project which enables a more thorough investigation/application of deep learning techniques for those who are interested.",
                "YES! This was the most useful and exciting couse I have taken. Prof. Frank is awesome.",
                "I would. It is a great introduction to computing and probabilistic modelling for those curious about how language modelling works (eg from GPT).",
                "Yes. This is a wonderful introduction to linguistics for anyone with a techincal background. You will find it relatively easy and be able to enjoy the topics a ton.",
                "Absolutely! Perfect for those in computer science who want to learn NLP, for those statistics students who want to learn an application of statistics, and for linguistics students who want to learn the computational side.",
                "Yes, I would recommend. I did computational linguistics research before taking the class, and this class often made me think \"I wish I had known about this.\" However, if you have a math or programming background, the pace of the lectures is somewhat slow."
