                "This course is very good at getting students engaged in the topic and learning about Korean culture and history. However, the class was not super engaging.",
                "Strengths of this course is that it covers a lot of interesting content on Korea so there is something for everyone, including literature, history, current affairs, and more. Class this semester was apparently slightly larger than a normal class, it was great to discuss with others.\r\nCourse could be improved by perhaps slightly more speaking engagements but I think it was more difficult because of the online format.",
                "Choi SSN did a great job of selecting interesting articles that challenged us by expanding our vocabulary use and knowledge of formal writing structures. Each week was dedicated to a different topic, so we learned a wide breadth of new terminologies that allow us to engage in deeper conversations about politics, history, culture, etc.",
                "Strengths: The variety of material and content we covered and I definitely had a lot of practice strengthening my writing skills and enhancing my vocabulary. \r\nWeaknesses: The structure of the course was sometimes a bit more fluid and uncertain at times but that also was because the class had to cater to a variety of skill levels and interests.",
                "This course provided a strong structure for practicing writing skills and learning new vocabulary and grammar, as well as learning about important topics in Korean current events and history. I wish the workload had been more evenly spread - there were intense reading and writing assignments at the beginning of the semester, but they tapered off towards the end of the semester, and I think I would have remembered more vocabulary with more consistent practice.",
                "Strengths: High engagement, lots of interactions between students, clear feed back \r\nWeakness: Lack of concrete structure",
                "The difficultly with higher level language classes is that the students' language abilities differ more than in introductory classes. This course could be improved by not tailoring to any one end of the range (often, I felt that the course material was fit for the students who were already fluent at Korean). The material was dense and often more academic than realistic, as in the wording of readings were not common to what is truly used in society. Strengths is that the Professor goes through, line by line, the dense class material and is willing to repeat explanations. And there is also a TA session to ask specific questions about that week's readings."

Discussions in the breakout rooms were helpful, and I especially liked larger group discussions rather than pair discussions. We had some trouble trying to watch a movie together over Zoom.",
                "Answering reading questions through randomized break-out rooms helped to get to know my other classmates as well as encourage discussion. What could be improved is Professors directing questions at specific students rather than the broadly to the entire class, since often through Zoom there is an awkward barrier to unmute oneself and answer the question out loud. I think using the Zoom survey function or encouraging answering through the chat box is helpful for more shy students to participate in class."
