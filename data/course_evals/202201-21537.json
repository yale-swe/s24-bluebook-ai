Zhou Laoshi is a very kind instructor, the classroom setting was productive but not stressful, the vocabulary and content we learned was relevant, the assignments and grading was very fair. If I had to identify a place for improvement, it might be to cut down on the number of articles assigned each class day to read in advance, so students can focus on a few and discuss those in-depth during class. I also loved it when we watched the Chinese film Wedding Banquet in class and discussed it, and wished we could have done similar activities with movie watching and discussion in Chinese."
