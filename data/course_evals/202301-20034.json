                "Strengths: the material we covered felt very relevant and the problem sets\/labs were interesting. The final project was a fun experience, although because it was so open-ended it was hard to know what the expectations were. I thought the guest lectures were helpful for hearing from graduate students about their experiences coding and doing research, but were not necessarily helpful in learning to code.",
                "This course is very well designed for student learning. Feedback from Professor Geha and the TF Will Cerny was invaluable and I feel that the course is excellently designed.",
                "Strengths: all of them! I learned so much in this class; the material is extremely relevant to careers in astronomy research, anything dealing with big data, and plenty of programming-heavy industry jobs; the course is challenging, but doable, and there's a lot of help available both through the instructors and through your classmates; the classroom environment is super fun and everyone is so collaborative. The class is really focused on learning rather than testing, which makes it a really valuable and enjoyable experience. The final project is a bit hefty but still very doable and really pushes you to come up with a super cool idea and execute it to its fullest. Weaknesses: none!",
                "Super good class, is very hard but good",
                "The biggest strengths of the course are Marla and Will. The setup of the class is also a huge strength, as having a dedicated class time to work together definitely helps get through the tougher psets. It didn't feel like the class had busy work, so it felt like we were doing everything for a reason. I can't really think of any weaknesses!"

                "I would recommend to astronomy majors. It's important to learn how to handle data in research, and the coding skills you learn in this class are invaluable for that.",
                "Yes, I would strongly recommend this course to another student interested in learning more about scientific computing in astrophysics.",
                "Absolutely!!! If you're an astro major (or physics major with any interest in astro), PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take this class. It's one of my favorite classes I've taken here so far, and definitely the most useful thus far for my major and career. Classtime is structured super well to facilitate learning first in the form of a lecture, and then in the form of labs and hands-on demos where you get to practice the coding skills taught in lecture, and one class each week is devoted to working on the homeworks with help from the TA and instructor which makes the class feel really collaborative and enjoyable even when the content is hard. Every single astro major should take this class!!!!",
                "Yes its awesome and prof Geha is the best",
                "Yes! Even if you already are very good at coding, this will improve your research life.",
                "Definitely take this, it's one of the best classes I've taken here. She started the class by saying she wanted it to be challenging but not stressful, and that's exactly what it is. It's the surprisingly rare class that actually teaches you the tools to do research. It's definitely a good amount of work, but it all feels worth it. I would highly recommend!!",
                "It was a very enjoyable and lowkey course that still did a great job of teaching me some very important techniques\/methods in modern day astrophysics."
