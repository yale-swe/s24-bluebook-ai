    "The course is designed to learn language through readings and discussions in class. It is very efficient and helps students understand the culture behind some of the words.",
    "The course is very well taught and the content is both engaging and exciting. I especially enjoyed the project we were able to complete and the weekly oral conversations. The class is already great, but if there was one thing to add it would be more conversational in class activities."

    "Yes because it is a necessary course to take to gain a deeper understanding of a culture you would otherwise not be exposed to.",
    "Yes, this course is a great opportunity to keep learning Indonesian and gain more insight into the culture. Bu Dinny is an amazing professor and is so supportive. During L4, you get the chance to have engaging classes like a cooking class. You also have the opportunity to pursue your own interests and complete projects on topics of your choice. The class involves a lot of conversation with your peers which makes it engaging and fun. Definitely take this class!"
