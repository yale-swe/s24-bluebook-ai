    "Really interesting questions, and I have some good background now and frameworks within which to think about big religious questions.",
    "I learned a lot about religion, and the frameworks and different processes of grief in our culture.",
    "Really fun class, easy work load, and learned quite a bit",
    "I learned more about religion in this course than I ever expected, and especially so about religions outside of the traditionally \"western.\" Although a vast majority of the course (especially the literature section) focuses on Christianity and Judaism, I found the sections of Buddhism, Islam, and South Asian religions to be the most interesting, especially since to me they were completely new to learn about. This course sparked my interest in religious studies that I now hope to pursue as a major.",
    "Honestly, the most valuable part of the course was the syllabus  it was just a pleasure to read all those great texts (both the ancient ones and the modern ones), and I wouldn't have been able to convince myself to sit down and do it had I not taken this course.",
    "I learned to critically evaluate texts in religious traditions while being mindful. I also learned how to ask important questions about human agency, tradition, teachings, and much more for religious and literary texts.",
    "Comparative literature and reading",
    "The class was really well organized and I developed a lot of great reading skills. The course was intellectually challenging and the subject was really interesting, I would definitely recommend the class.",
    "This class was a good introduction to how religious traditions from around the world view death and loss. It was interesting to tackle issues like suffering and agency in the context of death and ritual."

   "comments": [
    "Interesting lectures, could be improved by the professor cutting off students going on tangents.",
    "A little bit juvenille",
    "This course does have a heavy focus on Christianity, especially in the second half of the course when students are reading literature about grief, rather than religious works about grief. This was especially evident because the professor chose several works that were not extremely religious because they were written by Yale professors, when personally it would have made more sense to explore more well-known literature in other faiths. However, the first half of the course was an endlessly engaging couple of weeks where students of all faiths were trying to pick apart what were the bare bones of that faith: explaining (or not explaining) suffering. Just for the first half, this class is worth taking.",
    "The syllabus was clearly the strongest part of the course. I think discussion ended up shifting towards grief over faith, which was interesting but a not quite as intellectually engaging, so a stronger focus on the religious aspects of the texts  and the questions they provoke  would have been valuable. Also, I think the leap from ancient texts to modern novels and memoirs was a little bit abrupt, and I felt that we missed any discussion of the modern practice of faith. For instance, I think Wiesel and other Jewish authors are much more influenced by the Jewish religious and intellectual traditions that sprung out of Job and Lamentations than they were by the books themselves.",
    "The strengths were definitely the content and the way Prof. Carlson presented the material and facilitated discussions.",
    "More feedback would help the students improve\r\nThe reading was engaging and interesting\r\nThe class was divided in two parts which made a lot of sense",
    "I liked that the course was broken up into two sections. The first half in which we examined world cultures and traditions through their primary texts was helpful in providing a framework to think about death. The second half was a bit more difficult, since some of the readings were not as accessible."

    "A great fifth class. Not a lot of work, but a lot of great conversation. Really relaxed, and Laura's very down to earth. It's a great break from classes with big shot professors who have forgotten how to get really into texts with their students. Laura's just in it to explore some big questions and great books with the class, which creates a great vibe. No ego, very supportive, fun class. Would recommend.",
    "Yes, this course was incredibly interesting and insightful!",
    "Yes, very important complement to traditional liberal arts classes. Well taught and engaging.",
    "great 5th class",
    "Absolutely. I think every student should take a course comparing various religions since they are the bedrock of how many societies form and exist. What better way to do that than to study their response to something every human deals with: grief.",
    "I would! It's not going to change your completely, but Professor Carlson is lovely, and everything on the syllabus is well worth reading.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to everyone who wants more exposure to religious texts and critically examining literature. Prof. Carlson is not only brilliant, but also extremely helpful and kind.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, the professor is great, the discussions are interesting and the workload is manageable.",
    "While this class is not an overview of world religions, you will still learn a lot about various traditions and faiths. It can be difficult to engage fully with some of the readings, but our weekly discussions were very collaborative and people were able to admit when they found something difficult and ask for clarification.",
    "This course is for students seeking a new way to engage with religion, literature, and reflection on the human experience."
