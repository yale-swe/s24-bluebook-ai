                "This course was absolutely incredible; I learned how to write completely all over again. I was taught how to view the writing process where I learned to write first for myself and then for a reader, the incredible importance of parsing through every sentence to make each one as strong as possible, along with the need to have a public point - answering why a reader should be invested.",
                "I became a much more confident writer from this course! My reading\/analysis skills didn't improve, but the focus of the course is writing.",
                "I learned how to write, and enjoy writing, creative non-fiction  which I hated before this class. The class structure taught me how to revise my work, which I am so grateful for. I learned a lot about conviction, posterity, and my own comfort with writing. None of this makes any sense  but trust. I write differently, loved the class, and will write far more from now on.",
                "I become vastly better at writing consciously with awareness of the purpose and structure of a text. In English 120 we read very engaging essays that touched upon a wide array of social issues - texts that augmented my thinking and beliefs.",
                "Through this class I learned so much about how to be critical as a reader. Coming in to the class, I liked every piece we read and was surprised when I came to class and my classmates had critiques. Throughout the course, I learned what I like in writing, who I like and have learned to develop my own personal style of how I write and what I like to read.",
                "I became aware of the elements of writing that I most appreciate in a good essay. I developed confidence to express myself in creative non-fiction, and I refined my voice as a writer.",
                "I have learned how to analyze and appreciate the essay form of writing. I have learned how to apply techniques and stylistic features of esteemed essay writers to my own writing. I have improved my revision process and how to give constructive criticism to others writings.",
                "I really was able to understand all the elements of creating a powerful essay while not loosing my personal voice. The different assignments had just the right amount of guidance and I thought the essays we read for homework were very insightful into what our essays needed to look like.",
                "This was my favorite class OF ALL TIME!! I literally cannot emphasize how much I learned in this class and how much I loved loved loved it. My writing bloomed in a way I never thought possible. Within weeks I think my writing has grown more than ever in my lifetime. Professor Riley gave wonderful specific feedback, and through the readings we read, my classmates work, and other guidance I felt like I had wonderful examples to influence and model my work. In Professor Riley's class every word had to count, I learned to write in a way that was beautiful and meaningful. And, I fell in love with so many new authors, and fell in love with language and words in such a new and special ways.",

I am extremely proud of every piece I wrote in this class and the progression of my writing ability from one unit to the next. There is a lot of freedom in this class which at times is challenging but is also very exciting."

                "The strength of this course is the incredible material we read, the intimacy of the seminar setting where the class can become a family, and the stages of the writing process where a draft is first submitted to receive feedback before the final. One way the course could be improved would be to have more writing activities during class to play with the different writer's techniques instead of solely discussing the essays the entire time.",
                "Strengths: Professor Riley is so kind, and she gives great writing feedback! The essay topics are really broad, so you can write about practically anything. \r\nWeaknesses: Our class discussions were a bit surface-level at times. There wasn't a lot of back-and-forth dialogue in class, but rather individual students voicing their opinions\/thoughts on the essays we read.",
                "Strengths: Professor Riley, structure of the course (draft, workshopping, revision, process letters), the syllabus and Norton Reader, class conversation, community, writing exercises in class\r\n\r\nTHERE WERE NO WEAKNESSES. I loved it.",
                "The reading list for this course is a huge strength. Such an amazing collection of works from a variety of different backgrounds, covering so many different topics. I loved that the class was very straightforward in that homework was to read and in class we discussed. This made class very exciting each week because we were talking so passionately about what we were reading. One weakness with the course is the time in between when drafts are returned and revised versions are due. I don't feel like 4 days is enough time to really sit with the critiques and implement them into my piece to improve it as best as I can.",
                "Strengths: wonderful readings and discussions, free-writing exercises, the revision process is essential, workshopping is fun and rewarding, the professor and residential college tutor\r\nWeakness: sometimes students speak without responding to others",
                "I understand discussing the essays among the students in class is the main purpose of the course but I wish the professor was a bigger part of the discussion.",
                "This course was spectacular and there is very little to improve on.",
                "I wish I had not taken this course at 9am because I think that affected my participation levels.",
                "I can think of no weaknesses! This class was engaging, stimulating, vibrant, and just so special. We became such a community, and it was clear Professor Riley cared for each one of us.",
                "Strength is the range of essays we read and the professor",
                "This course will make you a better writer and expose you to great writing. I only wish that I could take it again!"

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another study. It changed both my relationship to myself through exploring five pivotal topics (place, self, opinion, writing, and profile) and also to writing. It enabled me to become selective about what is meaningful enough in my life to take the time to explore in the form of an essay where I and hopefully a reader can leave the experience feeling rewarded.",
                "Absolutely. This was my favorite course this year.",
                "Absolutely! Phenomenal pick for a writing credit, particularly with Professor Riley. She truly cares about her students! And the essay topics are so broad that you will have a lot of fun writing.",
                "This class was magical  absolutely take it, and particularly with Barbara Riley. Like actually. Our readings and discussions became a canon that we referenced like a semester-long set of inside jokes, and our class became nearly a family. We practiced writing in class and workshopped our essays, so power was distributed among all students and I felt completely comfortable sharing my work and reading others' pieces. The readings were brilliant, and I loved spending my days reading from the Norton Reader. The schedule of drafts, revisions, workshopping, and process letters was manageable and made me excited to write.",
                "Absolutely. This was by far my favorite course of the semester. I loved the essays we read. The group of students in my class was phenomenal and made for such engaging discussions. Professor Riley was fantastic as an instructor. I loved that the course focused on creative non-fiction. This class knocked it out of the park and I'm sad for anyone who doesn't take this course.",
                "Yes! This class was enjoyable and rewarding. I improved my writing, read beautiful essays, and had the chance to work with a wonderful professor, classmates and writing tutor.",
                "I highly recommend this course. It provides students with right tools improve their writing abilities for future writing courses and beyond.",
                "Yes. This course was filled with fascinating readings and the students in my class were excellent writers who brought so much value to discussions. Reading their essays inspired me.",
                "I would recommend this course because I think it is a quintessential Yale class that will help any major.",
                "Yes, though beware, it is a lot of writing. \r\n\r\nAlso, please, please take ENGL 120 with Barbara Riley if you can. She is incredible and facilitates a beautifully open, organic and engaging seminar. One of Yales best.",
                "I would ONE HUNDRED PERCENT recommend this course to another student. In fact, I already recommended it to my other friends. Not only that, I have begged all of my besties to take it. This is the best class you will ever take I have told them all. Literally whenever classes come up I cannot stop talking about my English 120 with Professor Riley. I am in love with this class.",
                "Yes! Favorite class Ive taken so far and great for all kinds of people",
                "Yes, you would not only meet lots of amazing authors through their writing, but also explore a side of yourself that you did not know before through this course",
                "Absolutely. This course will set you up for successful nonfiction writing in the future and help push you to find new ways to approach writing."
