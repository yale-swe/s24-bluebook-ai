I often skipped readings when I could not find them, even after flipping through the entire 400 page packet. While this was frustrating, the lecture usually summarized the important readings enough so even if I could not find them I understood the purpose. Overall I really enjoyed the lectures. I think the topics we learned about were really interesting and the professor was engaging.",

That said, Prof Marcus is pretty striaghtforward with the two exams and the paper so there are no tricks.",
