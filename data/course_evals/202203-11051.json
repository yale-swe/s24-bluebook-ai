I learned a lot about proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids, including their structure, function, synthesis, metabolism, and regulation. This course also focused on enzyme kinetics and the integration of different pathways that together support life.",

I gained critical thinking skills when it came to applying concepts learned in lecture on problem sets and during exams, which had questions that were both memorization-based and application-based. I developed insights into how biomolecules function and how to interpret experimental data collected about these biomolecules.",

I experienced 3 different lecturing styles (as this course has 3 professors), and it was interesting to adjust to the different manners of presenting information and to see how each professor approached their respective third of the course content. I appreciated that the professors would provide study guides with the most important information from each lecture to guide our studying.",
                "I think that this course gave me a really solid understanding of biochemical principles in protein function\/property, structural biology, and also some metabolism as well.

I practiced memorization and recall a lot in this class, and this class was also what made me decide to completely drop the MBB major.",

While the focus in this class was largely on macromolecular structures, I also gained an understanding of the small molecule chemistry that occurs in living organisms (i.e., metabolic processes). An insight that I gained personally is that the field of biochemistry is still very biologically-oriented, and most topics are approached from the biological point of view rather than a chemical point of view."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Fairly well taught. Workload not too intense. Supplements are great. Optional section\r\nWeaknesses: Exams are graded super finicky. You will lose some points for things that you shouldn't on basically all of the,.",
                "It's good for mcat prep honestly, and covers a lot of content in a short time. The course could be more transparent about their expectations from the start. They emphasized at the start they didn't want us to memorize information but understand general principles of biochemistry, yet almost a third of each midterms was small facts and details you would only be able to answer by memorizing it. For the most part, explanations of the material were clear. Though the last third of the class and some of the beginning could have helped with improving not the biochem content, but rather their wording of sentences on slides. Oftentimes small phrases were misleading or unclear and it took longer to just understand what was meant grammatically than it took to grasp the concept it linked to itself.",
                "The class policy is HORRIBLE. The professors dont take deans excuses and will not allow you to make up an exam unless you miss two exams and have a deans excuse. Very unfair for student with medical needs. I also feel like processes were explained through. It was just surface level and then you were expected to know the processing in depth.",
                "Strengths: being able to drop a midterm really is great; cumulative final is tough but the course really starts to come together in the final weeks.",
                "This course was heavily memorization-based up until the last lecture. I understand that this is the nature of biology courses, but I was also a bit disappointed that our exams and final were based on memorization than actual application\/integration\/understanding of why things in our body even happen.",
                "STRENGTHS: I learned a lot about biochemistry by taking this course, and I am sure it has prepared me well for research in the life sciences, the MCAT, and for medical school. The course was organized well, as the lectures flowed from one to the next very well. The PSETs provided very good practice and highlighted important takeaways from the class. The study guides posted for each lecture helped me focus on the main concepts. There were many opportunities to get help for the course, including office hours with the professors, office hours with the peer tutors, discussion sections, etc. WEAKNESSES: This course is time consuming due to the memorization required in learning nomenclature, structures, pathways, etc. The exams really tested our ability to apply concepts learned in class to new problems, which was sometimes quite difficult. Lectures move very fast and lots of material is covered.",
                "Some of the strengths of the course was that students were able to rely on lecture handouts and attending lecture to learn the necessary concepts, as opposed to relying on a textbook. The problem sets were created and discussion sections were facilitated with the students' learning in mind. A weakness of the course is the memorization-heavy nature of the course.",
                "The problem sets and exams were fair and a good assessment of what we were supposed to know. For me, the quality of the lectures slides and study guides decreased as the semester progressed, but this may be a matter of personal preference.",
                "Strengths: professors. Professor Simon was a great introduction to the course, and his office hours were far and away the most useful of the three professors. Professor Paulsen was also amazing. I felt that her lectures were packed with a little too much content, however, and it was unclear how much we were required to memorize regarding the examples she provided. This made the second part of the course a memorization-heavy portion, and I questioned the benefits of memorizing random facts about GPI-anchored proteins, for example, even though they are very cool! Professor Koelle's section of the course was also great. He cares a lot about making sure students understand the material (I asked many trivial questions during office hours, but he still treated me with dignity and patience, which I greatly appreciated). He also checked Ed consistently, which made it a great resource during the last third of the course and the final. \r\nWeaknesses: Class organization. I really did not enjoy that the course was taught by three different professors, even though they were all great. The class felt like three modules rather than a complete course, but this is more of a personal preference. The answers to some of the problem sets were also not available before the exam, making it difficult to study at times. The support system of professors and TAs were great, but the course overall felt disorganized.",
                "Strengths: well structured & well organized; helpful discussion sections\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: certain test\/pset questions designed & worded poorly--can be interpreted many ways, but only one is given credit; lectures are incredibly dense and hard to retain",
                "Strengths include the clear explanations of concepts by each professor, problem sets (sort of) reflective of exams, the study guides (sort of) and the peer tutors were an excellent resource. Improvements could be in the last unit's study guides, which seemed to gloss over many of the details that we actually had to know from lecture. In addition, I appreciated the more conceptual\/application written questions in the 2nd exam versus Yes\/No style questions or questions that pinpoint one detail from one lecture, especially because the big picture concepts and integration of lectures was emphasized. I feel that the lecture recordings could be improved because oftentimes the slides didn't record properly, making it difficult to revise and\/or go back to review concepts I had missed while in lecture.",
                "Strengths: lectures were good, feedback was reasonably prompt, workload was very reasonable. Weaknesses: the course could be more organized. The midterm date was wrong on the initial syllabus, which caused much confusion.",
                "I think one of the strengths of this course, where that the professors are very accessible, and there were a lot of resources in which to reference when studying for exams. I found all of the professors to be very helpful and understanding in helping students learn. however, with the TAs, there was a very apparent difference in skill and experience of teaching, so often times I felt, as if some students who have different TAs had more of an advantage on exams, while others did not. I think if there were more coordination amongst the TAs on what curriculum should be taught in section and what shouldnt be that would be very helpful in equalizing the field.",
                "Very good structure and course organization. Amazing and engaging professors.",
                "Strengths: This course is extremely well taught. The lecture material, while dense, is extremely clear. I left lectures with a solid groundwork understanding of the concepts, and I didn't need to spend much time to teach myself all off the course material outside of lecture. The professors were excellent, and the supporting TF staff was also great. Professors were active on Ed to answer questions. PSETs were engaging but manageable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "strengths: instructors are (on average) good and willing to help out, TA's are also good\r\nweaknesses: sometimes there is just so much content and it was a lot memorizing everything because sometimes there didn't seem to be a pattern. Certain exam questions were also a bit annoying.",
                "A strength is that it was very well organized- the order of the lectures made logical sense, all the relevant textbook readings were provided, and the Ed discussion page was usually helpful. Everything was always clearly communicated to us.",
                "I think that the lectures varied in level of engagement depending on the topic and who was lecturing. Unfortunately, they were not all uniformly as captivating, and it would lead to a lot of redigesting of information after the fact \/ outside of class. I appreciated the supplements at the end of most of the lectures, but sometimes the content would be lost on me as it was at the end of every lecture. However, I appreciated the helpfulness of the teaching staff, and their (typically) swift responses to student questions. \r\n\r\nI think that the course could be greatly improved by making the exams longer (as in, out of more points). Missing more than 4 points would have a significant impact on ones score, and I felt as though partial credit was sparse in most cases (resulting in larger losses of points). I could never rationalize why the number of points per exam was always such a strange number, and I felt that the number of questions would prevent me from demonstrating my actual knowledge of the course content.",
                "Strengths: I think a major strength of this course is that each portion of the lectures are focused into a specific faculty member that has high expertise in that area, so that they are more apt to teach on the subject. Michael Koelle definitely stood out as the strongest, kindest, and most engaging lecturer of the three. I think another strength of the course is that the faculty does truly care about student success, and that they do provide a lot of opportunities to do well. \r\nWeaknesses: I do think that a major downside of this course is that a large portion of the grade is focused onto three hours of exam time. It's extremely punitive, and if you end up doing poorly on more than one of them, there is not much opportunity to improve your grade drastically. I also think that the PSETS were really helpful in understanding topics, but with the amount of time spent working on them, they should be worth more of our grades. Also, the first two professors were not really present on ED discussions, whereas Koelle was, which led to him being confused as to why students weren't using it before (it's because there was a lack of engagement with the other two segments). The exams were also really specific topic-wise, and it was often not really what I found to be the biggest takeaway from lectures, and focused a lot on some random names\/enzymes at times, though serious studying could help with that issue. I also think section should be mandatory and count towards your grade to encourage engagement! Otherwise, I think this course was alright.",
                "Strengths: Practice exams, lectures were great!\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that Professor Paulsen's lecturers could be improved by slowing down a little bit and cutting down the information on the slides. It was sometimes overwhelming to see an enormous amount of information on the slides and not be able to follow everything while Professor Paulsen was speaking.",
                "I think this class is taught well for what it is. I do wish there was more emphasis on learning how to think like a biochemist, instead of just learning a bunch of content. As a very basic example, more about how biochemists arrived at the alpha-helix structure and metrics, rather than asking us to memorize the numbers 5.4 angstroms per turn or whatever. Also, I think this class caters too much to premeds - at times, I felt like the class was less a class for those interested in biochemistry and more so a class preparing premeds to become doctors.",
                "Strength: Interesting course content. Allowed to drop one midterm grade. \r\nWeakness: Would've preferred just having 1 lecturer. (I did like all 3 lecturer though)",
                "Strengths - good TAs \r\nWeakness - a lot of material, overwhelming and made studying very hard",
                "Biggest strengths were Michael, Matt, the TAs, and the fact that lectures were recorded. The TAs I had were incredibly helpful and approachable. Lectures from Matt and Michael were very clear and cohesive so it made it easier make connections between each of their lectures (though they go really fast, so that's why recording the lectures was really helpful). Practice exams, although really helpful for understanding format, felt a little easier than the actual exams; though they usually asked one question on the exam that was straight from the practice exam. I didn't get to go to the professor office hours as much as I could for peer tutor office hours and TA sections, but my friends who went to office hours with Michael thought that he was incredibly clear (even helped clarify concepts from the lectures that he didn't teach) and approachable. Peer tutors were helpful for weekly PSETs and individual questions that I had about the material, but when it came to reviewing for exams, their review sessions didn't really help at all, as it was mostly just them regurgitating the slides. Exams were for the most part pretty fair and I could finish with a decent amount of time to check over answers, though sometimes there were questions that were pretty ambiguous, and unless you did a ton of studying and understand the material like the back of your hand, it was very difficult to answer in the manner they were looking for. The amino acid and glycolysis quizzes were a strength and a weakness (strength because they're basically free points and a weakness because memorizing the structure of each amino acid and each step in glycolysis steps felt pretty meaningless). Probably the biggest weakness was that as the course goes on, the need to memorize everything from the slides becomes very apparent, for the midterms seemed to test us more on very minute details. Candie's lectures, while also pretty clear, were very information-dense, and it was difficult to discern what was necessary to know and what was just details; I found myself needing to memorize the most from her slides more than being able to connect concepts between lectures. Also, please never have a midterm the week we come back from break ever again; it was very unfair that a lot of us had to study over break for that exam (and that reflected in the fact that it was our lowest midterm average). Overall one of the most organized courses I've taken at Yale, and not much that I would change about the course other than the stuff I mentioned.",
                "Its really well organized and have good assistance programs",
                "The approach that the professors and teaching team had towards this course was excellent. In comparison to many of the other stem lectures that I have taken in the past, the professors of this course were much more encouraging and genuinely want the students to do well. The whole structure of the class was very nice because your grade would never depend on just one exam or one homework assignment, and the TFs were all very encouraging. One weakness would be that there weren't a lot of office hours available to students. There were only two office hours each week and they were often at times that didn't work with my schedule.",
                "The strengths are the instructors' expertise in the topics and level of detail in the slides. However, there is a LOT of memorization in this course and I wish that the tests would be more conceptual-based rather than testing this or that questions, which makes it feel like hard work didn't amount to much if you hadn't reviewed one particular topic and chose incorrectly.",
                "Strength is in the professors. They are all very strong and care about the students' learning. It's tough material, but it's presented in a very manageable and interesting way.",
                "Making it less of an info dump, especially with the second part of the course.",
                "It was very helpful that we got study guides, but these became more sparse throughout the semester, so it wasn't always clear what we would be tested on.",
                "Good professors and teaching team. Study guides\r\nLots of work needed to do well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The grade breakdown is weighted very heavily towards exams (though less heavily than the other MCDB option for Biochemistry). Midterms are only out of 67 points so a few points of deduction makes a big difference in your grade.",
                "Strengths: lectures were clear and concise, and included all the necessary information to succeed on exams. The three Professor system makes for engaging and enthusiastic lecturing with different styles of material presentation. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: significant variability in materials between TFs  some gave out practice exams \/ questions while others just reviewed the pset due the week before",
                "I think lecture slides were pretty organized and it was very helpful to have online versions available before class and the study guides. The lectures sometimes felt too fast-paced, but recordings were very useful for that to be able to re-watch. Exams sometimes asked questions that were memorization-based but didn't seem like important things to have memorized (volume of a HeLa cell, number of substrate cycles in a pathway, etc.), although I think most of the material that needed to be memorized like amino acid structure and many other things did make sense and was asked in questions that asked you to show deeper understanding of memorized material. The atmosphere of the class among students didn't feel great, perhaps because there was a lot of stress about exams and grades. There's not officially a curve, but after every exam there was a new post about what grade cutoffs were projected to be based on class performance, so it still felt like you constantly needed to do better than others to get a decent grade (and as of now when my final grades is posted, I still don't know what the cutoffs were or have my final exam grade released). I would also find it helpful if problems set grades and keys could be released as we complete them, because they were not released for a long time, which made it hard to gauge how I was doing with the material.",
                "Strength:\r\n- a lot of material to review to practice \r\nWeakness:\r\n- course moved very fast while being unclear in some topics",
                "Strength - very collaborative \r\nWeakness - different instructors so it's hard to adjust. First 2 midterms are very memorization heavy while last one and final are very applicable based, made it hard to adjust",
                "The content is incredibly interesting and engaging. The professors give the students a lot of opportunities to practice and ask questions.\r\n\r\nHowever, the sheer quantity of material that needs to be memorized for each exam feels nearly impossible in the context of a typical course load. To me, this was particularly true of the second and third exam. The first exam felt more manageable, and I think that was in part because the study guides for each lecture did a really good job of diluting the most important information from the lectures, whereas in the subsequent two thirds of the class it felt more like the study guides were basically just telling us to memorize everything from the lectures.",
                "Super interesting material, explained generally well and applicable to life as a human. Profs make effort to tie everything into the bigger story, which is very helpful, but there is also a lot to memorize: all the amino acid structures plus a bunch of pathways, which is all important and useful but memorizing it all will take time and effort.",
                "The lectures are engaging and the psets are manageable. I found that the exams were unnecessarily tricky and tested on route memorization rather than broad knowledge of the course.",
                "Three different lecturers with different teaching styles. Organized very well - the study guides were especially helpful in managing the large amount of content involved.",
                "Despite emphasizing that this course focuses on overarching principles rather than rote memorization, the instructors have designed exam questions that test for obscure knowledge, not conceptual understanding. On all exams, the first page of questions was composed of exclusively fill-in-the-blanks asking about factoids mentioned in perhaps one slide out of the hundreds covered on that exam. Many other longer exam questions also effectively boiled down to knowing one specific detail, with the explanations barely being considered in the grading. The questions even inform you of this, as they all restrict answers to a certain length limit (for example, two sentences or less). As much as this restriction is for convenient grading, it is also stifling for demonstrating actual knowledge of the material. I believe the course would be significantly improved if the exams were modified to involve more questions about experimental design and application of ideas. As the instructors themselves frequently mention during the course, biochemistry is a complex discipline with countless details and models, which cannot be fully understood by memorizing merely one biological system in its entirety. Exams in the format of trivia night feat. metabolic pathways do not capture these principles of biochemistry and reflect poorly on the course's title and goals.",
                "I think this class was organized in a standard STEM fashion with lectures, psets, midterms, etc...",
                "From my point of view, there were not many strengths to this course. Most lectures, especially in the first two-thirds of the class, felt like raw information dumps. I felt like many concepts were not properly fleshed through due to the raw amount of information taught in the course and the relative lack of total lecture time through which each concept could be covered. Due to the structure of the class, it felt like each lecture covered a laundry list of topics to know, rather than building concepts from the ground-up using any sort of first principles. Even with decent note-taking practices, it was very difficult for me to retain anything from lecture. The problem sets were quite short, and as such, did not provide for a comprehensive engagement of the course material. Many of the examples that were provided throughout the course to illustrate biochemical principles actually made the subject material more complicated, as each biological example provided had its own set of complexities that were in themselves difficult to understand. As a result of all of this, it was difficult to discern what was actually important from lecture versus what was supposed to be extraneous information (but this was adequately addressed using the study guides released by the instructors, which is something I would consider one of the few strengths of the course). Additionally, it was difficult to build an intuition of much of the material since it felt like the emphasis in this class was on rote memorization of largely disjointed material. Of the three parts of the class, Prof. Koelle's was the easiest to build an intuition for, and that is because he provided a framework at the beginning of the metabolism unit through which an intuition for the material could actually be built. \r\n\r\nMy suggestions:\r\nThe sheer amount of lecture material becomes even more apparent when compared with the amount of material taught in MB&B 275. Perhaps this is a radical suggestion, but I would think about shifting much of the enzyme kinetics over to MB&B 275 to equilibrate the content load between all three of the core classes. I don't think MB&B 275 would lose much this way, since enzyme kinetics is already covered in the course in arguably a more chemical manner, but I think MB&B 300 would have a lot to gain, since it would allow for more time to comprehensively cover a smaller amount of material. Also, I would recommend using less examples and instead describing biochemical concepts in very generic terms without the complexities inherent to biological systems. I would also recommend making the problem sets longer and more varied. This would increase the workload of the class, but it will be easier to engage the course material this way. Additionally, many of the supplements were actually not very useful or pertinent to the course (and 5-10 minutes is not enough time to go through complex scientific experiments and conclusions), and I would perhaps forgo those to make more time in class for better pacing of the material."

            "comments": [
                "Yes. Fairly low workload\/stress and definitely essential if you want to understand any biology",
                "If youre taking it its probably because you have to or you heard its good mcat prep, but dont see why you should outside that tbh",
                "Absolutely not. Worst class Ive taken at yale.",
                "If you have to take it, I recommend it. I think that the content was taught relatively well and I appreciated the focus on tying everything together at the end. I think that if you are interested in the actual science and reasoning, then I would choose MB&B over MCDB 300.",
                "Yes. Considering that biochemistry is not an easy subject, MB&B300 was taught quite well and was very conducive to learning. The professors are great and very accessible. There are also many opportunities to get help in the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The course is well-designed in the way that the necessary information is disseminated during lecture, as attending lecture and having the lecture handouts helped students have all of the necessary information for problem sets and exams, without having to rely on a textbook. The discussions helped solidify concepts presented during lecture, and the problem sets, instead of taking a long time, helped students practice the exam-style questions, which were often challenging, but helped students apply concepts learned in lecture. The course has a challenging workload and is memorization-heavy, so students intending to take this class should be prepared for these challenges.",
                "Yes, I found the material very interesting and the assessments were fair. In addition, the supplements were very interesting.",
                "I don't know much about the equivalent MCDB course, but this course was a good introduction to biochemistry. I questioned the level of detail we were required to have at times, but the professors are a great resource and make most of the lectures fairly engaging. It also overlaps significantly with content from BENG 350 (Physiological Systems), and it was very rewarding to draw upon content from both courses to enhance understanding of lectures.",
                "Yes, great overview of the main concepts of biochemistry, without too much rote memorization",
                "If youre interested in\/have to take biochemistry, choose MB&B!",
                "I heard that this course was better paced than its MCDB counterpart. For the most part, I would agree. I also think that there was a deeper conceptual understanding that was demanded of students rather than just memorizing facts. So overall, I would recommend this course to another student.",
                "Yes! One of the best science classes Ive taken so far",
                "Yes. I imagine most people interested in this course are either pre-med or MB&B\/MCDB majors. This course, while tough, left me with a rigorous background understanding of biochemistry. The course requires a lot of memorization. The first half of the course is mostly memorization. We go over the basics, and that requires memorizing names and structures more than an intuition for biochem. The second half of the course is a lot more conceptual, and we study metabolic pathways and how they interact with each other. After taking this class, I have a better appreciation of the body as a holistic, integrated system. As a pre-med who works in clinical settings, I began seeing how my MB&B 300 knowledge was helping me better understand certain patient conditions. I thought that the course was taught extremely well. The TF team was great. The lectures were dense, but I never felt overwhelmed because of how well the lecture slides were written. Overall, highly recommend to interested pre-med\/biology students.",
                "Overall this is not a bad biochemistry course. If you are interested in a deep dive down the core principles of biochem I recommend this course. However, it is very intense and you do need to know a lot and memorize a lot so if that's not for you probably don't take it.",
                "Yes, it was a very interesting class to take and it is well taught.",
                "I dont know if I would recommend this course to another student, simply because it largely serves as a prerequisite for some majors. I think that the content learned is important and interesting, and the case studies are very informative by helping exemplify certain pathways and enzymatic functions. However, I think that I would have preferred a more seminar-style class to learn this information (it just is generally taught as a lecture, so it couldnt be helped).",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, though if you're taking it, you probably have to. I think my recommendation comes with a warning that it will not be the best, most fascinating course that you will take at Yale. I think that there are a lot of weaknesses associated with this course, that honestly led to me having some difficulty with it as a whole, but if you are interested in the subject, you will be just fine. You will need to study a LOT and memorize a bunch of fine-detail aspects of lecture slides that were hardly-discussed in class. I think it's also essential to form a study group to actually talk out some of the concepts and receive clarification on topics that you are unsure about. Definitely a must-take course for MB&B\/CHEM majors, but be prepared to struggle a little.",
                "I'd recommend this course to another student! Although the course was fairly difficult for me, it would have been a lot worse if not for the ULAs, TAs, and the professors.",
                "Perhaps. For MB&B students there is no choice, but MCDB and E&EB and other pre-med students might consider this class for a more rigorous approach to biochemistry that would prepare them well for the MCAT. I am unsure what MCDB 300 is like.",
                "Would only recommend if you are super passionate about biochemistry and are sure you are, or if you have to. If you were interested in \"exploring\" biochemistry like me, it's a very painful class to persist through if you find out you don't like the subject. Also, I would recommend taking this course as early as possible - ideally as a sophomore. I know many sophomores who took this class and decided to switch their major from MBB to Chemistry, and many juniors who took this class that lamented that it was too late to switch out of MBB. Take this class early to know what you're getting yourself into.",
                "Would recommend for any students who liked organic chemistry. Also brings a nice follow-up to concepts introduced in BIOL 101\/102, as well as second-semester general chemistry. You have to put in the work to memorize content for the midterms, but from week to week the p-sets are short so it balances out.",
                "Only if you are a biology major or really interested in pathways and connecting the different aspects of science",
                "If you want to learn biochemistry, yes! I can confidently say that I'm walking out of this class with a thorough understanding of almost everything I learned, and it's because of how organized this course is and how much the professors and TAs cared about what I was learning. Though this class was sometimes very stressful because of the amount of time that I had to spend studying the information. It sometimes felt like a part-time job that ended up taking priority over all of my other classes.",
                "Yes, I mean it is required for Mbb majors. The class is well organized and professors are wonderful. Be aware that the class is easy at first but gets much more difficult in the second half.",
                "Yes, it was definitely an interesting class if you like biology - just be prepared to review and study a lot before each midterm and the final. The level of engagement with TFs is pretty low because sections are optional, but Ed Discussion helped to facilitate questions.",
                "Yes- most take because it's a requirement but it's very well taught! Profs get you to enjoy biochemistry. The course requires a lot of work and the amount of material can feel overwhelming at times, but you come out of it thinking like a biochemist and there are lots of opportunities to get help.",
                "Yes, it's an interesting subject!",
                "If you have to take Biochem, then yes",
                "Yes  this course is fantastic. Lectures are clear and engaging, the material is incredibly interesting, and I highly enjoyed learning it. This course is not easy but its very fair  the material you need to know is on the slides.",
                "Most people take this course as a major requirement. I would not suggest it as an elective, as it's pretty rigorous and goes into more detail than you need for casual interest, but if you're an MCDB major choosing between MCDB300 and MBB300 (which I was), I would suggest it. I can't speak on how MCDB300 was, but the MCDB course is only a semester whereas this one is an entire year, and I don't think you could fit in a satisfying level of detail within only one semester, so I'm happy I chose this course (and if you do take MBB300 and hate it, you aren't required to take the second semester for the MCDB major). It does sometimes feel like you're learning more detail than you need or like exams will ask very specific questions, but overall, the details are used to illustrate broader concepts. While there is undeniably a small amount of rote memorization for exams, the vast majority of the questions use what you know or have memorized to answer questions that do test understanding and not just memorization.",
                "Yes, the course changed my perspective on biology and how humans operate.",
                "Ehh - not the worst class, you definitely do have to put in the necessary hours to make sure you understand the material",
                "I would, but not in a semester with a significant course load.",
                "Yes, super interesting.",
                "yes! great course to take for learning about biochem",
                "Yes, but be forewarned that the final third of the material (the metabolism section) is WAY harder than the first two! Dont make the same mistake I did, which was to alot the same amount of time studying for the metabolism section as I did for the first two. If you avoid that, youll be fine :)",
                "Yes, it is an interesting class.",
                "As much as I disliked how this course was organized, it is unfortunately a major requirement, and the content you learn is necessary to proceed in higher studies of biochemistry. If you plan on taking this course, prepare for a large time sink to memorize every detail on the lecture slides to succeed in the class. I would also recommend taking this course as soon as possible, as many people I know (including myself) have changed or are considering changing their majors after taking this course.",
                "I took this class because it's required for premed and the MB&B major. If you need it, then I recommend taking it. This course is (supposedly) better than the other biochemistry course and you engage with more material at a deeper level. But if you don't need to take a biochemistry course, then take a more interesting class at Yale that you'll enjoy.",
                "In its current state, I would not recommend this course to any student unless they are extremely interested in getting a comprehensive survey of the field of biochemistry. But as it is, the course is not very organized academically\/thematically and is not well-suited for a non-biochemistry major to get anything out of, in terms of principles that inform day-to-day life."
