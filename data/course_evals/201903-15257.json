    "By taking this course, I gained skills toward approaching the subject of television and culture. I gained deeper insights into the views of those around surrounding television ranging across time. I gained a new and valuable perspective on race and television, including its portrayal through the medium and how this is received by viewers, including those in my class. I also gained a greater understanding of the intersection between politics, culture, race, and television and how these influence each other, rely on each other, and work together. I feel that this is important to understand and think about due to the extremely central role television plays in society today, so I was very happy to be able to have the opportunity to engage with it in this seminar in ways I otherwise may never have. Now my thinking surrounding television has changed and I approach my viewing with more thought, curiosity, and intent.",
    "analytical frames for television, broad history of golden ages",
    "Overview of the historical period of televisions--and of the ways in which people talk about those periods. Also reviewed contemporary issues in television including streaming and online television.",
    "I gained a critical appreciation of the structure of television scheduling and broadcasting. In addition, I developed an understanding of the legitimization of the television medium that has occurred during the self-proclaimed \"Golden Ages\" of the medium and the necessity of \"otherized\" shows to maintain the distinction of these venerated works.",
    "I learned about television trends during the first and second \"Golden Ages\" of television in the U.S."

   "comments": [
    "One of the great strengths of this course was the selection of viewing, which I found extremely engaging and interesting and watching the required viewing was always a time of the week I looked forward to. Receiving feedback on blog posts was also extremely useful and motivational. The level of discussion was stimulating and this was likely due to the professor's high level of engagement and genuine in-the-moment presence during seminar, and passion for the subjects at hand. \r\n\r\nOne thing I wish I would have seen is feedback on our presentations. I would have liked to have received feedback after the fact, or at least been ale to engage in a discussion with the professor and\/or classmates regarding my performance and work on the presentation, as a lot of hard work and thought went into preparing for and completing that part of the course, and if there had been a chance to gain feedback I would have greatly appreciated and learned from that opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by simply limiting the readings slightly, as it was difficult at times to get through them all and engage with each fully. If the readings were slimmed down slightly, students would be able to complete each one with complete attention and focus and bring more to class discussion than is possible when trying to survey many readings or only fully completing a few of those assigned in a given week. The second half of the semester the readings were a bit lighter and this helped, but potentially pairing down in the first half could greatly improve the chance for student's to engage fully with all course material and thus participate more fully during seminar.",
    "strengths: 2nd half of the course's screenings, pared down syllabus was really strong, a lot of really incredible readings\r\nweakness: never talked about race properly in an afam course; never got feedback on writing?",
    "I thought that the comparison of the two eras was insightful in thinking of our preconceived notions of was television is and has been. I didn't always understand why we were doing certain readings and sometimes a large amount of material meant that we didn't get through everything.",
    "Great weekly viewings, interesting discussion, student-led conversation. Only improvement might be that the workload was a bit heavy some weeks.",
    "The course benefits from the juxtaposition of the \"First Golden Age of Television\" with the current \"Golden Age of Streaming\" to reveal the white-washing and distinctions that must be created in order to elevate certain output of a medium from the rest. It might further benefit from a more seamless transition between the two time periods or establishing this juxtaposition earlier in the course.",
    "The discussions were always engaging, but sometimes we didn't have time to cover all the assigned viewings and readings in class."

    "There is no doubt that I would recommend this course to another Yale student. Not only was Professor Forster uniquely engaged and passionate about the subject, but he also took care to assign meaningful work and to really challenge students to think more deeply about their statements and participation during seminar while also maintaining a supportive and comfortable speaking and discussion atmosphere. The viewing was particularly engaging and interesting and I always looked forward to completing it. The readings, while at time very dense, were rewarding if you were able to get through them fully and truly think about them. I found that the time I spent completing the readings, chosen with care by the professor, truly added to the seminar experience and connected to the discussion in a way stronger and more effectively than that in most of my other courses. This course applies a medium very central to our society today (television) to issues also very pressing in our everyday and modern lives (e.g. race, class, culture, etc.). If you take this course, I guarantee you will leave with a broader understanding of these topics and a great skillset that you can will be able to apply in your everyday life and in the future on a daily basis.",
    "yes, especially because the film dept here sorely lacks attention to nonwhite artists in the americas and internationally & it was a great way to examine these works",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone that has an intellectual interest in television or television history.",
    "Absolutely. Very interesting topic taught in a constructive way.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who interested in the social impact and critical reception of television from its inception to the present, particularly if they are interested in the depiction and inclusion of Black writers, actors, and stories in American television."
