                "I developed a solid base on how to write 4 kinds of papers: a close reading, a comparison of two authors, a research paper, and a personal essay.",
                "I learned how to read and analyze essays as well as better formulate theses for my own papers. I became more comfortable challenging my own ideas and others' ideas, and addressing multiple perspectives in my writing.",
                "How to write papers of various types; how to analyse emotions and use them to perform social commentary.",
                "The best thing I learned in this course was specificity--being precise and deliberate in my writing. I was taught to consider what my readers were reading, which seems pretty simple, but it's an eye-opening thing. Professor Perkins did an amazing job with feedback and engagement, and it felt like I improved with each new essay that I wrote. The Booth et al. readings helped so much to understand the underlying strategies of literature, and although they were sometimes pretty dense, they were interesting and definitely helpful. I also learned a lot about emotions as the course title describes. Critical emotion theory is something I had never investigated, and course material was consistently engaging. Some readings were easier to understand than others, some I agreed with more than others, some were more enjoyable than others, but they were all always thought provoking.",
                "We read both works that had interesting and inspiring creative content and excerpts that were targeted at certain writing skills, so there was a lot of opportunity to apply some lessons and ideas from the class materials and the essay structures really allowed for that kind of practice. Class discussions were great for engaging with and learning from other perspectives towards and ideas within readings. Writing conferences allowed for both the development of a close relationship with the instructor and an amazing opportunity to talk about your writing process, goals, thoughts, and concerns. I felt like I came out of this class more well-read, more comfortable with producing quality work in a timely manner, and more familiar or introspective towards my own position and process as a writer.",
                "I significantly developed my ability to write thoughtfully, purposefully, and in greater depth. I am much more capable of analyzing and imaging my space in an academic work. My professor taught me to enter the conversation of the difficult academic literature we were grappling with and analyze it in new ways.",
                "I learned how to close-read essays and analyze their meaning.",
                "I learned how to better organize essays and stick with one thesis during this class, something I was not good at in August."

                "Great class to teach the \"academic essay\"",
                "The strengths of this course are the helpful feedback on papers and the interesting readings. The weakness is the amount of discussion, especially considering the Zoom format.",
                "I really enjoyed the seminar style of the course and the instructor posed really insightful discussion questions that were both challenging yet had so many perspectives to tackle. One improvement that could be made is if the texts selected for reading had greater variety; we read many texts addressing the role of emotion in the context of social issues but I would also like to see a more creative side of how emotion is applied in our lives.",
                "Strengths: Lizzie; Weaknesses: none",
                "I think revising the syllabus and removing some of the more dense theory could help improve the class. Although it was interesting, it was pretty difficult to grasp, and I don't think our discussions of it were as productive as our other discussions. Other than that, I loved everything about this course. It was definitely the course I learned the most from this semester, and Lizzie is such an amazing professor. She is super engaging and knowledgeable and caring about her students. The class was a great environment, and I loved getting to know all of my classmates. The break out rooms where we discussed how our essays were coming along, worked on formulating warrants and other essay strategies, and got to hear about each other's research were such an amazing aspect of the class, and I feel like everyone improved from them.",
                "Strengths: The size and meeting times of the class allowed for really interesting discussions and reflections about the readings because all of the students are able to become familiar with each other and have time to absorb the content and ideas between classes. On a similar note, the class only met twice a week, so there was a lot of time for catching up, preparing, or doing essay work without it feeling relentless. Lizzie was a wonderful discussion leader, caring and flexible instructor, and rigorous mentor. The readings she chose were great, and I really loved how she curated the class's topic.\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, there isn't much to say here. I felt like this class was both challenging and manageable. In the Zoom format, maybe class discussions were a bit heavy on a few voices and maybe there wasn't a whole lot of interacting between students, but that's temporary and didn't impact my overall positive experience in the class.",
                "I cannot imagine a way this course could be improved. Lizzie was AMAZING and provided wonderful feedback.",
                "Strengths is that the essays chosen to be read were very interesting, the teacher was very engaging during conversations and discussions, and the topic of the class was engaging.",

                "The classes were virtual seminar style. We had many discussions. We also did breakout rooms in order to peer edit each others' essays. However, I think we could have done more breakout roomsspecifically for discussions about the texts. Sometimes, it is interesting to start discussions about texts in a smaller group and then bring all the ideas together with the entire class.",
                "Everything worked.",
                "Zoom discussions actually went better than I expected - there wasn't a whole lot of interrupting or difficulty engaging with each other, they didn't feel choppy, and people were pretty engaged. The camera situation was a bit iffy, as in around a quarter of the class sometimes had their cameras off, but that seemed to be a struggle in most classes and didn't really interfere with the proceedings of the class. Unfortunately, we couldn't\/didn't really get a chance to meet or have a whole lot of outside discussion, but that's just a COVID problem I suppose.",
                "The Zoom method for class and writing conferences as well as using breakout room for peer editing was extremely helpful!",
                "This class was really engaging when we were asked personal questions as students, and the only reason some readings were less engaging was because of either their content or the fact that we were not learning in an actual classroom."

Despite not being the biggest fan of writing coming into college, I learned so many new writing skills and got so much more intellectual and thinking freedom in this course that it made me grow fond of writing. The prompts were broad enough that I could apply my own personal voice to the specific topics we were studying.",
                "Absolutely, and especially to international freshmen who may not have been taught how to write papers in their home country (like me). This course will bring you up to speed!",
                "Yes, I would 100% recommend this class to other students no matter the major. Lizzie does an amazing job helping to improve your writing in a gradual and understandable way. She is extremely clear with feedback. The material of the course is great. The essays are wonderful chances to not only investigate emotions and critical theory, but also to display aspects of your own personality. There is a wonderful blend of freedom and guidance. If you are looking for an English 114 class to take, this is the one.",
                "Yes, definitely! I was really missing relatively casual but meaningful English discussions from high school, and this class totally filled that desire. The readings were great, the class environment was great, Lizzie was fantastic - I just wish that we could have had the chance to meet more informally before, after, or outside of class. I felt like I improved, became more comfortable with, and\/or have inspiration for expanding my writing capabilities. It was also just a lot of fun - I looked forward to going to class. Definitely consider!!",
                "I would recommend this class to another student. ENG 114, on a broad scale, will transform your writing and cause you to think more critically. But this class specifically, with Lizzie's help, will change the way you think about critical literature and will help you in any way you express concern with regarding your writing.",
                "Yes I would. I was able to improve my writing and way of close-reading while learning about how to write my emotions more clearly and in relation to politics or personal problems. I learned about the different types of emotions that are expressed in writing.",
                "Yes I would. This class improved my writing dramatically, as I was forced to practice it in different ways and multiple essays throughout the semester."
