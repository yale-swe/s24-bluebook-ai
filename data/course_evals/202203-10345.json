Definitely not too much in the course about espionage per se  really didnt learn anything about spies.

                "I loved this class!!! NO WEAKNESSES. Definitely my favorite class at Yale so far. The lectures are incredibly engaging, Ted is amazing, and the guest lecturers are qualified and interesting. The class makeup allows for many different perspectives, and there is a lot of student input in both lectures and discussion sections. I learned so much from this class, and truly feel like it was such an interesting look into the intelligence community and our political system. Homework readings were a bit long, but totally worth the read. I cannot recommend this class enough!",
                "Truly uninspiring",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Primary source material composed the majority of the reading\r\n- Students were given the opportunity to answer questions during dynamic lectures\r\n- The quantity of well-informed, prestigious speakers was appreciated\r\n- The option to write a paper for the final\r\n- Policy memo for section was a valuable experience putting students in the \"hot seat\"\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Some contemporary material felt a bit distant from intelligence collection",
                "This course has great discussion sections and great lectures. One thing that could be improved would be having more structure -- like knowing why we were moving from one unit to the next because the intelligence events were not chronologically ordered. Perhaps one could name the different units.",
                "Assignments were very manageable. Section was actually discussion based and very interesting.",
                "The sections could be refined a little bit. I think the TFs were some of the most intresting TFs I've seen at Yale, but given their backgrounds, they are not super familiar with how to run a large section smoothly. This is not to say I disliked section, but I think it would feel more similar to a government briefing if the sections were smaller and TFs were given a little more direction on how to direct section at the start of the semester.",
                "The course was well organized and taught, with the additional readings all interesting and informative. I think the course would be best as a seminar, where more in depth discussions of the readings could take place, but I also understand that literal hundreds of students are interested in the course and this is the only way to keep it accessible.",
                "Overall, the course is fantastic. Very interesting and engaging professor and material. It's well-organized for learning and the lectures are well-executed. My only recommendation for improvement is making the slides a bit more clear - without the context of the lecture, they could be hard to understand.",
                "Strengths: Learn directly from a former Intelligence (CIA) and Foreign Policy (State) practitioner, Career Advice night with some of the grad students and TAs in the class (learn from current intel, law enforcement, and foreign policy practitioners), Heard from speakers ranging from the COO of the CIA to the former president of Estonia to a seasoned think tank expert on China - plenty of opportunities to learn more about their respective industries and network! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Assigned readings can stretch to 200-250 pgs at times; however, don't let this scare you as most people only do parts of the readings, if at all, and you don't really need to do them before class (although I am sure you would have a much deeper understanding of what is covered in class if you do)",
                "Section meetings were very helpful, as they allowed us to contribute our thoughts on the moral and ethical questions that were at hand.",
                "Strengths: Prof Wittenstein is excellent. Hes an ex-intelligence agent and his enthusiasm for the material is palpable. Interesting subject matter too, but definitely not for everyone.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we looked more at the role of spies throughout history. Despite the name of the class, we actually barely talked about spies and espionage.",
                "The strength is the knowledge and experience that the professor has.",
                "Lectures were always fascinating as were discussion sections. I always looked forward to Prof. Wittenstein's class and would always rave about it to my friends and family afterwards. The course is well structured and not overly complex.",
                "Strengths: Great Professor, interesting readings, awesome guest lectures (probably the highlight of the course), interesting opportunities offered by Professor Wittenstein to attend lectures at Horchow Hall.\r\nWeaknesses: I really liked the course, but the amount of reading was a bit too much for the course. While it is true that you can learn a lot from the course even without reading those (Professor Wittenstein does a great job summarizing those), I still felt somewhat guilty that I could not finish the lengthy 200-page readings every week.",
                "Excellent course. Interesting readings assigned for each class. Lectures give a great overview of material. Exams let people write about whatever material they are most interested in.",
                "The case studies in this course were fantastic and the guest lectures were incredibly interesting.",
                "Great lecturer and great TAs.",
                "The readings were sometimes were long, to the point that it seemed impossible to complete them before class.",
                "The course makes great use of high-profile guest lecturers and compresses massively complex information into easy-to-follow formats. Discussion section felt meaningful and like you actually built upon and processed the raw material presented in class.",
                "Strengths are that Professor Wittenstein is an excellent lecturer who clearly and concisely covers many different aspects of the intelligence community, without shying away from many of the horrors the CIA has perpetuated in the past (though the class stays almost entirely post-Church Commission, so no discussion of coups in Latin America). We learn what intelligence is, how it can be used for good or bad, and how it might be used going into the future. The readings are structured so that if you're interested in a topic, there are hundreds of pages available for you to read, but you can also read a short executive summary or one of the assigned New York Times articles and know everything you need to know for class. Professor Wittenstein has worked in the intelligence community for years before coming to Yale and really knows what he's talking about. There aren't that many weaknesses, but I would say that the midterm and final prompts weren't great, and that they both (especially the final) were more work than I was expecting. They say that the midterm and final were adapted from in-class exams, but they take much, much longer than an in-class exam would.",
                "The coursework is generally not stressful, and the discussion sections complement the lectures really well. There is a lot to be learned and the essay-based exams make sure to delve deep into the material without making it a rote learning process. Learnt a lot from this class.",
                "Incredibly interesting and informative. The greatest teaching staff Ive had and hugely interesting guest lectures. I cannot fault this class.",
                "Engaging lectures and absolutely incredible guest lecturers who are leaders in the field. Great teaching staff. Not too much work and the readings are manageable and exciting. Wish it counted for a distributional.",
                "great course! professor wittenstein, the TAs, and the guest speakers are the highlights!",
                "Very interesting, Ted is a great professor",
                "Wittenstein's slides are concise and easy to understand.  The guest speakers were all wonderful choices and a good change of pace in class. Wittenstein focused on good events in American and international history as examples. I think there should be more assignments, so as to not put as much weight on the midterm and finals and engage us more on a class to class basis. The readings were rather long to be reading between a Tuesday and Thursday class, because you wouldn't want to read ahead because the information needed to be fresh.",
                "This course was amazing. No recommendations!",
                "Strengths: Great use of multimedia in class and section; interesting and highly knowledgeable professor who is genuinely invested in the students; interesting and relevant subject matter and assignments\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like a lot of people were checked out in lecture and section; material can sometimes feel nebulous and like we are expected to know more than we do",
                "Well-organized and detailed lectures; guest lecturers and assignments were designed to help students critically think and engage with the material.",
                "strengths: very engaging, interesting lectures, relevant information. Weakness: readings were really long and unrealistic to do in a timely manner, but you could just skim them and get most of the information you need from the lecture. Also, discussion sections could be structured a little better. Overall, good opportunities for writing memos and thinking critically about current events.",
                "Strengths - engaging lectures, approachable professor, manageable workload, flexible assignments, thoughtful teaching fellows, interesting guest lecturers\r\nWeaknesses - dense readings at times",
                "Strengths:\r\n- extensive and informative\r\n- well-organised and exciting \r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- weekly readings were quite long relative to other subjects \r\n- sometimes sections felt disconnected from class material",
                "Strengths: interesting lectures, organized slide decks, discussion in section furthered what we talked about in class so we had relevant discussions",
                "Ted is an excellent lecturer but sometimes the content moves slowly",
                "The course was very well taught and was well connected to real-world events",
                "Strengths: great prof and TAs, interesting content\r\nWeaknesses: not much direction at all on the memo assignment. The moment you receive feedback on your memo is the first time that you understand exactly what is expected on the assignment, and by then its too late, given that you only write one memo all semester",
                "Strengths\r\nGreat analysis of historical events like the Cuban Missile Crisis and the GWOT\r\nInteresting introduction to the thought process in the Intelligence Community\r\nReally great at touching lots of the different issues in intelligence today (relations w\/great powers, anti-terrorism, domestic intelligence, etc)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\nMaybe a bit more attention to Intl. Relations theory? Just to help a bit more with analysis for those of us not familiar with it\r\nNot that it would be relevant to modern intelligence (though maybe more relevant than one might think), but a bit more attention paid to the Cold War?",
                "Interesting info and prof witterstein is amazing! Sometimes too much reading but you dont need to read to do well.",
                "Strength: Ted is pretty engaging, topics and guest speakers are good too\r\nWeakness: Sometimes because it was a lecture it was hard to engage everyone"

                "Yes, if you are interested in intelligence and foreign policy, this course is extremely interesting. One of my favorites I've taken at Yale. It's not necessarily easy - the intellectual challenge is high - but it's engaging and Professor Wittenstein is a wonderful professor.",
                "Highly recommend this course! You will get an insider look into the intelligence community and get plenty of helpful career tips along the way. If you're at all interested in poli sci, global affairs, ep&e, or are just really interested in spies, this is THE class for you!",
                "Indeed! It was a fascinating course, and I learned a lot about how the government functions.",
                "Wittenstein rocks! Learned a lot. And Landon was the best TA Ive had at Yale.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in the subject matter then this is such a fun class to take. If you dont already find this stuff interesting, youll probably be very bored.",
                "Yes. It is a great gut course if you're interested in national security and espionage, intelligence.",
                "Absolutely. Regardless of your major this is an extremely fascinating subject taught by the best in the field. The content is applicable to any field as Prof. Wittenstein draws in aspects of history, policy, technology, and science into the course. Class debate was always highly engaging. One of the best classes offered at Yale.",
                "Absolutely. Lectures were consistently engaging and Professor Wittenstein brought in some incredible guest speakers. If you have any interest in the subject matter, you will enjoy the course.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in a career in government or the Intelligence Community, you should definitely take this class. Professor Wittenstein and the TA team are great resources. If you are looking for something different to shake up your schedule, or a manageable Global elective, this is also a good option for you.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Gives a very broad but in-depth examination of foreign policy, espionage, and cyber warfare. Important for all people going forward while tied to a historical background.",
                "Yes, it is an interesting and not a hard course that you can take at Jackson.",
                "Yes.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the intelligence community, or anyone wanting to take an interesting course. I found the lecture material very engaging and the readings were always cool as well.",
                "Yes! Definitely take it. The workload is low but you get good foundational knowledge about the intelligence community. It also spurs discussions in section that help address some of our country's flaws.",
                "Yes, very interesting content and we were given assignments that challenged our critical thinking skills.",
                "Yes, I would! It was very interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who has a little extra room in their workload.",
                "At the beginning of the semester, I would have wholeheartedly recommended this to anybody interested in learning about how our government functions. Over the semester, I got less enthusiastic about the class but nothing about the class really changed, so it might be me. Professor Wittenstein is a great lecturer who knows what he's talking about and delivers the information well, with a sense of humor. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the guests we get are excellent. Even section was set up to function relatively well, which some lectures I've been in completely disregard. Maybe it's just that 26 lectures is a lot of lectures, so make sure you've read over the syllabus and make sure you want to hear lectures on all of the nuts and bolts of intelligence before you take the class, because the novelty factor of learning about the CIA wears off quickly.",
                "For sure, specially if you haven't taken a global studies course before and want to get a taste of it. A very relevant topic even for CS students when it comes to the international cyberspace.",
                "Absolutely. I think every student at Yale should take this class. It is hugely interesting, extremely well taught and the guest lectures are incredible.",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yep, definitely. If you are interested in learning about how the CIA works and responds to threats in reality (unlike most spy movies) this class is a great one. Enjoyed the class as a CS major.",
                "yes for sure!!",
                "Yes!! Unbiased history of US intelligence",
                "Yes, I think the topics covered were fascinating and wonderfully taught by someone who is a lead in the field.",
                "Yes! Super fascinating material delivered very accessibly, regardless of your prior familiarity with events like Pearl Harbor, the Iraq WMD debacle, etc.",
                "Yes! It is not too difficult, but I felt like I learned a lot and developed both writing and speaking skills (especially when it comes to discussing policy issues). I've never been in a large lecture where I felt the professor was as invested in our learning as in this one. Definitely recommend for anyone with an interest in these topics.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students looking to challenge their current views on domestic and foreign policies! Intelligence provides a very specific and unique lens through which to think about complex global issues and interests.",
                "Yes I would, the material is engaging and the people facilitated strong discussions.",
                "Yes absolutely, even for STEM Majors. very important to understand how the government works and what decisions they are making.",
                "I would most definitely recommend this course. The content and the teaching combined to make it one of the best courses I've taken at Yale",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.  The class itself is not that difficult, and the professor and TFs were all super interesting people to hear from.  Even if you are not a GLBL major, consider taking this class!",
                "Yes, very exciting and engaging course material. Exciting lectures, good professor and manageable course work. Sometimes readings were quite long, so would only recommend to students prepared to take on slightly higher reading load.",
                "Highly recommend even if youre not in the major. It was a good overview of the past several decades of Intelligence Community history. It helped me better understand US relations and the challenges the Intelligence Community faces today.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this class! Well organized and a great introduction and analysis of many topics of intelligence.",
                "Yes it is really interesting especially if you're not majoring in global or polisci",
                "Yes, it is really interesting and insightful",
                "I would. It was quite interesting and the professor was fantastic",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about intelligence collection and analysis.  If they want to learn why intelligence is seen as useful and continues to be a constant tool utilized by states, it is a great intro to the theory behind intelligence. Its also helpful for people who want to learn the role of intelligence in recent world events, especially the GWOT. Political science majors wont be put off by too much unfamiliar Intl. Relations theory either, its great really for any major thats at least a bit familiar with global politics.",
                "Yes if you want a relatively easy and interesting course. Bc workload is low or can be hard to stay engaged and I think grading depends heavily on your TF.",
                "Yes, gut + interesting topic = take this class",
                "100% fav class I have taken at Yale. Ted is incredible"
