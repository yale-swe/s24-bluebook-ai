Except from the theoretical knowledge, the logic of economic data analysis insight is also deeply imbedded in the course.\r\nThe second half the course is about how to replicate the professor's paper. Very challenging, yet also very achieving as well.",

The first half of the course is a crash course in regressions in stata and in the second half we apply them to real world issues like collusion. I knew nothing about regressions before taking this class and learnt A LOT",

                "One strength was definitely the methodology of the first half of the semester, which encompassed a great econometrics review and programming basics.",
                "Strengths: The course outline was very clear from the start and was well-structured for student learning. The material felt much more \"hands-on\" than other economics and statistics courses. The professor was knowledgable and affable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Grading policy was pretty unclear - all assignments other than the midterm were graded on an ambiguous \"Good/OK\" system.",
                "A very practical course, I got to have a lot of hands-on experience. The professor is also very supportive throughout the course.\r\nMaybe more training on the personal term project in the end would be great.",
                "Strengths: the course structure allows you to solidify your econometric knowledge before applying it. Michi is fair, helpful and understanding. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the workload in the second half of the course is disproportionately higher. the course could really use a TA or some kind of support that isnt the professor. When wed get stuck on theoretical or stata questions there wasnt much support, wed have to have done the homework early enough to ask Michi for support in the friday class even though the homework was due on wednesday which just didnt work out most of the time. i ended up using the econ department stata tutor and the marx library econometrics tutors as a substitute",
                "great all around",
                "Weaknesses: lack of set schedule for office hours, considering this class is technically a lecture. The one time he offered office hours before thanksgiving break was very helpful.\r\nStrengths: the second half of the course actually takes a more applied focus and we got to replicate Prof. Igami's results using what we have learned in the first half"

                "Even if you have only one semester of econometrics (or less) under your belt, I'd recommend it. I took both ECON 117 and ECON 123 before taking this course and still found that I learned new things. The second half of the course is similar to a grad-level Industrial Organization course (what the prof told us in the beginning of the semester) and was actually really cool to put to work what I had learned in my previous metrics courses in a more applied manner. Really cool to see exactly how supply and demand curves can be retrieved from data (it's a bit more complicated than I initially thought!!) to give us insights/conclusions we are first introduced to in ECON 115."
