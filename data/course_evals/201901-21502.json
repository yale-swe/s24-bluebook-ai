    "So much! My speaking skills improved enormously (my biggest challenge), and I learned tons of new vocab. The study of tenses and grammatical structure really ramps up in 120, so I feel like my language skills are significantly more complex than they were last semester. We also covered cool topics like feminism, racism, the environment, and social issues in Brazil.",
    "I learned so much about the Portuguese language, Portuguese grammar, the culture of Brazil, and gained a tremendous level of fluency in spoken Portuguese. This was an AMAZING class thanks to Lizandra.",
    "I can speak Portuguese comfortably. I can have more than a basic conversation and understand almost anything. Also I learned a lot about Brazilian culture.",
    "Taking Portuguese was one of the best decisions I've made at Yale. The entire department is vibrant, enthusiastic, and intelligent! I learned so much from just a couple semesters. I now consider myself a fluent speaker!",
    "I was able to better refine all aspects of my Portuguese skills (reading, writing, speaking and listening). I also got a more substantial look into Brazilian culture, and participated in interactive activities to better understand various Brazilian traditions and activities."

   "comments": [
    "Maybe one fewer major assignment in the second half of the semester -- in the last week, we had three big assignments (oral presentation, test, and a video) which was a lot. Or maybe put the oral presentation earlier in the semester.",
    "Literally no weaknesses. The strength was Lizandra's creativity, her engagement with students, her hard work and positive attitude every day, and the wonderful community I found in the Portuguese department.",
    "The strength: Lizandra Correia\r\nThe weakness: losing Lizandra Correia",
    "Amazing class!",
    "This course was amazing largely because of my professor, Lizandra Correia. Lizandra made each and every class dynamic and fun, and created a close-knit community within the class and, with the help of other Portuguese professors, the department as a whole. Each week had new and interesting activities to help us maximize our learning and enjoy class periods, and all assessments were well-explained and reasonable as well. The only weakness was probably the spacing of work, as some weeks could get a bit crazy with several large assignments in addition to daily homework as well. Having more of a tradeoff between these different types of work would help make some of the most busy weeks in the class more manageable."

    "Yes, amazing course. It's a shame Lizandra is leaving because she's one of the best, most dedicated, and most passionate teachers at Yale.",
    "10000000% TAKE THIS CLASS. Lizandra was hands down the most amazing professor, teacher, and friend, and I literally learned so much Portuguese in this class. I gained an insane level of speaking ability and legitimately enjoyed the class so so much.",
    "YES, Portuguese is such a fun language and Brazilian culture is so rich. Truly a great way to get away from more traditional classes and also have some fun!",
    "Yes! Portuguese is the best language to take if you're interested in the language or culture, or just need to get the language requirement out of the way. Especially if you already know some Spanish or Italian, this language is easy to pick up. The workload is low and very easy to manage. It is tough getting up early every day but that's the case with every language.",
    "100%. This course, in combination with PORT 110, is an amazing way to fulfill a language requirement or just an amazing class to take for academic enrichment. I have become semi-fluent in Portuguese in only one year, and had an amazing experience learning with my fellow classmates in a relaxed and informal setting.",
