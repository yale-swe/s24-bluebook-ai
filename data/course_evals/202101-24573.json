                "I love that there are weekly Psets to keep me on track with the material. The Psets also directly test for understanding, and I believe are just right in difficulty to make sure we grasp the basics firmly instead of flailing around in confusion. Prof Girvin is also such a wonderful teacher. His love for the subject is truly infectious. I took this class just to fulfill distributional requirements, but Prof Girvin's course (all of it) actually makes me seriously consider taking the field into consideration in my future prospects! The TAs are also the most patient and kindest life savers in the class. No weaknesses!",
                "Excellent professor! Excellent TAs and wonderful peer tutors! The content is also great! The one thing I would change is that the problem sets were sometimes much harder/ complicated, so I would appreciate if more of that material was covered on the lectures.",
                "Strengths: Good lectures and notes\r\nWeaknesses: Teaching staff provided less assistance than expected.",
                "Overall, the course was really well taught. As with every class this year, it would have benefited from being in person, where it is easier to discuss and ask questions. The course notes were excellent, and there were prewritten ones posted with the live notes so that students could prepare before lecture, and then review the same material after lecture. The lectures were very interesting, and didn't move too fast or slow.",
                "I thought it was a very good, and especially for its first year being taught it was very well done.",
                "Strengths: Grading distribution (25% for each component) is pretty balanced.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. Prof. Girvin would either sprint through his already written notes, so we didn't have time to copy them, or he would write them (and talk) slowly. I watched lectures at 1.5x or 1.75x.\r\n2. By the end of the course, I don't know precisely what quantum computing is. The first half of the course barely touched on it, and I wish I had waited for the CS department to offer this course.\r\n3. Midterm had 4 short questions. One silly mistake and you're sitting at a B.",
                "Strengths - Prof Girvin explains the concepts very well, clear notes, makes you excited about quantum physics\r\nWeakness - The psets are a bit uneven in difficulty",
                "The course was interesting, but was definitely geared toward CS majors over Physics majors. The first half of the course was entirely Quantum mechanics that would have been covered in any other Quantum class.",
                "Strengths: Enjoyed the professor's lectures, he was very knowledgable and entertaining.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because it was designed for a wide array of students, the pace moved really slow for those of us already familiar with the course material. It would be nice if there was a more fast paced version of the course.",
                "Strength: Girvin is an absolute beast who is an actual pioneer in the field; fast grading and solid psets overall\r\nWeakness: weekly psets became somewhat annoying (especially the ibm simulations)",
                "The material in this course is interesting, and Professor Girvin taught it well. His course notes (which are essentially a short textbook!) are very, very well done. It would have also been nice to see some more of the hardware side. Despite being extensive, the support structure for this course (TAs, peer tutors) were lacking; I gave up going to their sessions as they were never helpful.\r\n\r\nProfessor Givin taught this course technically very well. I also took PHYS 260/261 with him, and that was an absolute joy. This course was okay. His energy and enthusiasm do not carry quite as well on Zoom, but that is not his fault as Zoom is a dumpster fire that deserves do be thrown into a woodchipper covered in fire ants.",
                "Strengths: Interesting lectures, constructing quantum circuits was fun (like puzzles)\r\nWeaknesses: Often difficult psets, a final paper in a physics class along with a final",
                "Prof. Girvin knows his stuff, and for that reason the class was a joy to take. \r\n\r\nI wish we had had more opportunities to work with the IBM Quantum Composer on our problem sets. \r\n\r\nA version of this class with Physics 439/440/441 as a prerequisite would be amazing for students who already have a background in Quantum Mechanics/the vector space formalism, because a lot of the first half of the class was devoted to review of those concepts. But I also understand the value of having a class accessible to Computer Science majors or Physics majors who haven't taken QM yet. That said, from my conversations with fellow students it seems like the survey of QM was too fast for students outside the Physics major to really get it, but slow enough that students with QM experience didn't really feel challenged.",
                "I think the course was very well structured at a high level, starting with basic information theory, and moving on to the basics of quantum information. Lectures followed the course notes mostly, and were easy to follow. Professor Girvin was clear in his explanations of many quantum concepts, and I though the pace of course was just slow enough to properly gain some intuition for a lot of the concepts, like entanglement and phase kickback. The course was a bit weaker near the end, when we were exploring different quantum algorithms. Organization was bit more lacking, although understandably so, and lectures covered high-level concepts rather than details.",
                "This class gives you a solid understanding of quantum computing and inspires you to be the one to press our progress forward. The content is presented at a good pace and curiosity is encouraged. PSETs get to the essentials and provide good practice; the tests are also very fair. This was easily one of my favorite classes! Professor Girvin is absolutely amazing! He is incredibly passionate, helpful, and cares about the learning of his students. It serves as an amazing introduction to the subject. The course notes and copious provided resources were exceedingly useful. It is a wonderful class and there are not any weaknesses.",
                "Homework assignments and the final project were clear, but it was sometimes difficult to follow with the textbook, which I found more useful than the lectures.",
                "The strength of this course was the instructor's breadth of experience in the field and the fascinating material. This course was very multidisciplinary and encompassed a broad range of subjects, and the course benefited greatly from this diversity. I think the course could be improved by focyusing more on using quantum simulators and quantum API's, as these are the format in which quantum computation is nowadays more readily applicable.",
                "Strength: nice professor, Weakness: Hard psets that didn't align with lectures",
                "Fantastic course, super interesting. A bit disorganized but that can be explained by this being the first year it was taught. I'm certain it will only improve over time.",
                "Strengths: this course covers a basic introduction to quantum computing without requiring any prerequisite knowledge in physics (just some linear algebra), making this course super accessible to students from a wide variety of backgrounds. Furthermore, the course was also rather low workload, with short but informative psets, allowing you to spend some time synthesizing the weirdness of quantum computing instead. Weaknesses: Prof Girvin lectures pretty slowly, so his lectures can get dull at points (especially if you don't have a 2x button to speed him up).",
                "Really solid! As someone who took 261, the course def started slow for me, but I really enjoyed building upon my previous knowledge. I also loved the course notes!!!",
                "Strengths: covers a wide variety of topics at a depth that is accessible to students from a range of majors. Weakness: I felt like the first half of the course was a bit slow. Either speeding up the first half or going more in-depth into the mathematical theory could improve the first half.",
                "Professor Girvin is obviously a world-class expert in the field, and also a really nice/helpful person. However, the course was a bit disorganized, which made it harder than it should have been",
                "The grading and feedback could be improved. It felt very harsh at times with little to no indication as to why",
                "Professor Girvin's notes are a huge strength. They are very thorough and explain the material well. I think one weakness that just came from this being the first time was that the course moved a bit slow in the beginning, which led to us not getting to all the planned material.",
                "The course gives a good overview of central concepts in quantum information and touches on some of the more advanced topics in the later part of the course. The course notes are comprehensive and very helpful.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting course content, fair and manageable workload, Prof. Girvin is the master of his field, TAs/staff are very good with office hours and give great feedback on all assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Expectations for the project were extremely unclear. I definitely could've done better with more guidance in that regard.",
                "This course explains clearly and in detail all concepts required to understand state-of-the-art quantum computing research, in an order that clearly builds upon previous topics. It also lays a good foundation for the linear algebra and probability knowledge required to analyze quantum systems. The algorithms discussed in class give a good idea of where the quantum advantage lies. The independent project was a great opportunity for students to pursue their own interests in this broad and exciting field. However, it would have been helpful to know the grading criteria and expectations for the project more clearly in advance. It would have also been very interesting to hear more about real quantum algorithms instead of only proof-of-concept ones, as well as about quantum hardware.",
                "The material of the course was very interesting and engaging, and Professor Girvin does a great time teaching the material. My only critique is sometimes the psets felt like busy work that was largely unrelated to the content from lectures.",
                "more example problems would have been much more helpful",
                "Prof. Girvin's creation of a curriculum accessible to students with little background in the area, including his textbook-like course notes, was this course's major strength. His detailed answers to questions both in lectures and in office hours were also very helpful. I would have like to have learned more about the physical implementation of quantum devices, though I understand that this might not have been possible with the course's limited prerequisites."

                "YES! Take any class with Prof Girvin. You will learn so much.",
                "Yes! Excellent course, especially if Professor Girvin is teaching it!",
                "This is such a cool topic and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with an interest in quantum computing, I met great people and learned so many cool things through this class",
                "Take it only if you have taken quantum physics.",
                "If you have an interest in quantum computing, definitely. However, the concepts were not as straightforward as it sounded, and a lot of math background is needed that stated in order to get a full grasp of the material.",
                "I definitely would - it's pretty accessible for a beginner and very interesting!",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in quantum computing. There was an excellent mix of physicists, engineers, mathematicians, and non STEM people taking the course, and the course material spanned all of those areas. The material is not easy, but you come away from the class feeling like you've learned a lot about a topic that is cutting edge in the world of physics.",
                "Definitely, it gives you a lot of insight to a fascinating and new field!",
                "Absolutely!!",
                "Yes if you are interested in physics and computer/information science and their overlap",
                "I'd probably recommend them to wait for the CS department to offer a quantum computation class.",
                "Yes, great introduction to quantum computers and what they can do, lets you better appreciate the \"hype\" from a Physics/CS/EE perspective.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in exploring the idea.",
                "Yes, especially to CS or math majors who havent taken a physics class. Its super interesting material that you wont learn in other departments and Girvin makes it really accessible to people who know basic math (i.e linear algebra). Not an insane amount of work and not super hard material, but also not easy material and it takes a while to grasp how quantum bits actually work.",
                "This is an interesting and unique course on quantum computing that is taught very well. I would definitely recommend taking this course if one has not taken PHYS 261 with Girvin. If one has, then I might steer clear as this course is probably about 75% overlap, even though professor Girvin will assure you that you will learn new material.",
                "This class is great as long as you manage your expectations correctly. A lot of CS students took it thinking it wouldn't be super difficult, especially as there are no prerequisites. However, you should be very comfortable with lots of linear algebra, and some background in quantum mechanics would have been helpful. This definitely isn't a science gut, but it is very interesting. Prof Girvin is amazing, and lectures were always well taught. Just be prepared to struggle with the psets for a while each week.",
                "Definitely. This class taught me so much about the up and coming field of quantum information, and made it clear why a second quantum revolution is currently underway. It gave context to an exciting time, and set us up with the mathematical basics behind the quantum processes. It was also detailed enough for students to gain intuition about some difficult quantum concepts, and learn how to apply it independently in our final project. I learned a lot in the course, thanks to the great organization, well-framed problem sets, and clear feedback.",
                "Definitely, you must take this!! Professor Girvin is exceptional, and although very humble, is an expert on the subject. You truly learn so much in this class and the content is super interesting. The intuitive explanations of qubits and laying down of the fundamental rules we have to work with make the subject approachable from all backgrounds (the appendices in the course notes can catch you up on any math you might not have seen). The class then becomes incredibly illuminating and inspiring; there is a sense that you are incredibly lucky to be there. I have had a blast. Please take this class!",
                "Yes, if they are interested in learning about quantum computing and quantum mechanics through the lens of quantum information.",
                "I would defentily recommend this course! Professor Michel Devoret gave a talk in which he said that the study of quantum information is not simply quantum computing, but and investigation of one of the fundamental behaviors of the universe. I felt that this class did justice to the amazing phenomenon of quantum mechanics and investigated one of its most surprising applications.",
                "No",
                "Certainly, as long as they were vaguely interested in quantum computing.",
                "If you're interested in learning more about one of the biggest buzzwords in science right now, take it. It's super accessible to anyone into STEM, and only assumes a basic knowledge of linear algebra (that is itself reviewed in the first few classes). It's a low work, high reward course and is super easy to get an A in - there's literally nothing to hesitate about.",
                "Yes! A fun course and pretty gentle I troduction to quantum information. Useful for different majors and compatible with different backgrounds.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in quantum computation. Quantum computation is one of the hottest (and personally, one of the most interesting) topics right now, and it is definitely helpful to have some background so that you can follow along with some of the progress that is being made.",
                "Probably",
                "Yes, if it becomes a bit more structured.",
                "If you took Phys 261 with Girvin, a lot of this will seem like review. However the second half of the class once we got to algorithms was really interesting. I think in the future that will be more of the class, so yeah I'd recommend this course. Also, Girvin is great and extremely knowledgeable about this stuff.",
                "Yes if you are interested in quantum information! This course does not require prior knowledge in quantum mechanics and is accessible to students with some linear algebra background.",
                "Yes, I would. This course has the potential to be one of the legendary classes Yale is known for - a once niche subject now exploding in relevance taught by the GOAT in his field (Girvin) - but I'd say at the moment the course is good and not quite great. There are definitely still a few kinks to work out, which is totally understandable since this is the first time 345 has been offered (for example, Prof. Girvin revised his course notes, sometimes even retroactively, as the class went on), but quantum computing is such a cool subject that the class was still extremely worth taking. Since it's an intro class with very few prerequisites, people came into the semester with vastly different backgrounds and got vastly different stuff out of it because of that. For example, I took this class after taking all the probability, CS, and linear algebra that 345 assumed but not any of the quantum mechanics (though I did have classical mechanics from 260). The quantum stuff we covered all flew entirely over my head so it really felt like a randomized algorithms class. But it was possible to do all the work without conceptually grasping all the physics, so I still did well despite feeling kinda lost in the lectures. I imagine the flip side is true as well: you can do well in the course with lots of quantum background and learning the more mathy stuff on the fly. But it does mean that people are confused about very different things in office hours so I sometimes started freaking out when someone asked a question seemingly unrelated to anything I had been thinking about. The actual work you have to do is heavily computational and there isn't much of it, so it really made a perfect science credit for me, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone else taking math/stats/CS looking for a relevant and relatively chill Sc class. (If his plans haven't changed, Prof. Girvin will be on leave next spring but plans to offer 345 again in the 2022-23 school year.)",
                "I would recommend this course as a great introduction to an exciting and rapidly developing field for any students interested in physics or computer science.",
                "Absolutely! Great science credit for math/econ/cs majors that is interesting and engaging, while being neither too easy nor too hard.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in the applications of quantum mechanics then definitely take this course",
                "Yes, this class was a good introduction to quantum information. I'm a CS major and the class was pretty accessible since there's no physics involved. But at the same time you have to take some of the concepts for granted since we don't go into the physics of things. The first half of the class was mainly linear algebra/Dirac notation, but towards the end we learned some interesting algorithms.",
                "Yes, especially to a mathematically-inclined computer science student who is interested in learning about quantum computing at an idealized theoretical level. The course material was carefully prepared to be understandable to students with little background in the area, and built from the very basics up to practical quantum algorithms, though this meant that the physical realities of implementation were heavily de-emphasized. Some experience with algebraic problem-solving, such as an introductory physics course, is very helpful as preparation."
