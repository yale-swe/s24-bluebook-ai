We learned about the key, foundational texts in ethnic studies as well as praxis, poetry, prose, etc. I also developed my ability to discuss these texts in conversation with each other and comparatively. Furthermore, I developed my ability to write candidly about these readings and ethnic studies as a whole. Lastly, we learned a lot about ethnic studies methodologies.",

                "This course is exactly what is needed at the mid-way point of ones education in ethnic studies and related areas. The class is a small seminar environment in which we can share and discuss each others writings, build community, and deepen our understanding of key concepts like the oppositional strain, coloniality and anticolonialism in language, encoding/decoding, carcerality and abolition, kinship and rupture, Saidiya Hartmans work of critical fabulation, gender liberation vs. ungendering, and colonial anthropology and contending with/rearranging the archive."

                "This course was absolutely incredible. Everything about this course with Professor Omar is a strength! She crafted an exceptional syllabus and I couldnt have imagined a better ER&M 300 experience.",
                "The strengths is that Professor Omar allowed students different ways to show their learningmemos, performances, final reflections. We were treated like more than studentshuman beings who are vulnerable, who make mistakes, who like to talk about heavy topics that affect all our lives. The community that I found in ER&M 300 was so accepting and kind. \r\n\r\nThe one weakness is that discussion could be more guided or structured. It might be helpful to have students post discussion questions before class to ensure that everyone did the readings, read the memos, and have questions or comments to say before coming to class. Then, Professor Omar or a designated student leader could guide the discussion making it clear what theme we are discussing and keep track of the time.",
                "The class focuses deeply on readings and topics which made it so nice to really delve into readings and analysis of them, I learned so much, it was organized wonderfully",
                "Strengths: having conversations with everyone in the class\r\nWeaknesses: I would have preferred to not share my work with all classmates and instead only with the professor",
                "Prof. Omar is amazing and has introduced a helpful new course structure in which, every week, a few students write exploratory memos on the readings, and we then use these memos as a starting point for group discussions. This allows us to receive feedback and find connections between each others writings over time, so that each memo does not feel like a one-off assignment but something that we are continually learning from. At the end of the course, we all participated in a group performance at the Palestine Museum in Woodbridge and had the chance to hear directly from Faisal Saleh, who founded and runs the museum. This was a beautiful experience and I hope that future classes get to see the Palestine Museum too. And we all cannot say enough about Prof. Omar; she has so much knowledge to share, and also created an environment that encouraged us to participate in collective knowledge-sharing. Prof. Omar is an alum of June Jordans Poetry for the People program, and it is so exciting to feel some of these practices being passed along to us."

                "Yes! Very good course even if you are not an ER&M major",

The course is required for ER&M majors but not a chore by any means  some of the most important texts you may ever read will be in this class, and it is a great chance to deepen connections with the people in and around your year in the major. Between everybody in the class, there will be a richness of experiences with different courses, theories, and forms of community work."
