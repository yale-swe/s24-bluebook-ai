I built a foundational understanding of the development and implementation of algorithms in the world in domains ranging from politics, society, and the workplace. I also built skills in thinking about philosophical and moral topics from an outside-of-the-box perspective.",

While I was superficially aware that algorithms can be biased, this course taught me to critically evaluate the impact of technology to a degree I had not previously considered. Professor Hu also highly emphases developing the skill of identifying why something is morally wrong, building an argument from first principles as opposed to relying on gut feelings."

                "Strengths: The readings and discussions touch on a wide variety of interesting subtopics in regard to the ethics behind algorithmic decision-making. Very manageable workload of weekly readings + responses and 3 writing assignments. Professor Lily does a great job encouraging us to think outside of the box and push our critical analytic skills. Weaknesses: A bit of a double-edged sword, but Prof Lily pushes us to develop nuanced understandings of the text so much that it can be intimidating to speak up in the seminar.",
                "The strengths were the varied assortment of readings and the weaknesses would be unclear grading requirements (an overview of what papers required at the beginning of the course would've been helpful and a rubric that our papers would be graded against)",
                "Strengths: Professor Hu was amazing! I thought the readings and discussions were extremely interesting. The class felt well-paced.",
                "Very engaging material. Change structure of grading.",
                "The strength of the class was definitely the discussions themselves -- I always found them super interesting. A weakness is that we had to do more writing than I expected.",
                "The content of the course is very interesting, and the discussions around it were enjoyable. The 3 essays build up on each other well, with the feedback from each helping the improve the next. My only critique is that I don't think the final should be worth 40% of the grade, as I don't think so much of the grade should depend on a single assignment."

                "If they want a great review on the current issues in ethics involving tech, this is a great course that I would recommend. However, this class deserves its fair bit of attention and is definitely not a gut course for STEM\/CS kids",
                "It's definitely on the guttier side, but not a gut. I would 100% recommend this class, especially if you want to major in CS\/CS related because it helps to look at coding and algorithms from an ethical perspective, which is important in the real world.",
                "Yes! It is such an interesting topic. Algorithmic technologies are becoming increasingly prevalent in our world and it is crucial to understand both the benefits and ethical harms that it has on society, especially in reinforcing long-standing systemic injustices.",
                "Yes! This has been my favorite class so far! I would totally recommend it if you have any interest in data\/AI or philosophy or even if you don't. I didn't really have any interest in philosophy before taking this class but it has totally expanded my horizons.",
                "Yes--Very interesting and good teacher.",
                "Yes! It is genuinely pretty interesting. Just make sure to not procrastinate on the essays.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course, and I think all computer science students, or students looking to get into tech, should take it if possible. As algorithms become ever more influential in our daily lives it is becoming critical to understand their impact on our society, and tech workers should be thinking critically about the impact of their contributions, though I believe non-CS students would benefit from delving into these questions as well. This course does an excellent job of facilitating really interesting discussions on a broad range of topics."
