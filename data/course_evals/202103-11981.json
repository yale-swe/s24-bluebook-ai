                "Very well organized and all the material both fits together and is broken into manageable pieces. I even wished there'd been a little more weekly vocab.",
                "This course was fabulous and truly a lot of fun if you are willing to put in the time and effort.",
                "No weaknesses. Loved it. Super fun.",
                "I loved Padlet.  Everything was very organized and it was easy to see what we had to do for the entire week.",
                "This course is an excellent foundation for anybody looking to get started with Hebrew. Its main flaw is that many of the students already have a background in the language. True newcomers can feel lost and sometimes left behind in class material due to their peers demonstrating a much more solid grasp of the language.",
                "Padlet was a great tool, that was definitely a strength, although I think too many assignments/texts were assigned daily sometimes and it became overwhelming. Weekly vocab lists were a great tool and helped organize learning for each week and what we were being held responsible for. Material built on itself well. The course did ramp up quite a bit at the end with a new binyan every week, and I think the \"et\" accusative should be taught a bit earlier in the semester; it's not super hard to understand and I think we could have benefited from being able to solidify it more into our knowledge and speaking by learning it maybe before the roots/binyanim. I also liked doing some assignments as a class so that we can hear real time corrections, but doing them again at home if they were homework should be optional. I do wish this course touched on past tense since that's the one thing missing that really makes you conversational, just in case you want to get that full foundation from only L1 and not L2 (where it's taught).",
                "Strengths: Very very organized professor, coupled with the excellent Padlet interface! Predictable course-load, weekly assignment, and class material. It's a 1.5 credit so there's certainly work to keep you occupied, but very adaptable to your semester if you easily set aside time to work on the daily/weekly assignments (Vocab memorization, Google Doc assignments, etc.).\r\n\r\nWeakness: Could be a lil' too draining at some point in the semester to go to class EVERY 10:30AM morning of your week. Honestly, it may be possible to make one of the days asynchronous/just on Zoom. Maybe."

                "Yes. It's not something that you can slack on for any length of time during the semester except perhaps the weekends, but the materials are well-organized, the teaching is clear and class is fun.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in learning the language then yes. I think Hebrew is probably pretty tough for a lot of people coming in with zero background, but definitely manageable if you are willing to put in the time and effort. If you are looking for an easy language to fulfill the distribution, go take Indonesian or something else. This class is great for those interested in learning Hebrew and some Israeli culture.",
                "Yes, if you have any interest in learning Hebrew, take this class. The structure of the course is well planned out and you learn Hebrew quickly. Even if you haven't thought about Hebrew before, it's a beautiful language. I highly recommend.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other people. Its so cool to be able to speak another language. The amount I learned in this class is incredible. It was however a lot of work, but it was worth it in my opinion.",
                "Anybody interested in the Hebrew language should take this course. I would only recommend taking it if you are prepared to have a lot of homework every day. I would not recommend taking this course alongside other demanding courses such as DS or CS50.",
                "YES! This was the best language course I've taken at Yale (having been through many of the departments) as far as structure and ability to teach you the language. Dina's pedagogy is amazing and I wouldn't miss an opportunity to take L1 with her. Also going to class was honestly a fun and positive experience every day, while in other departments usually at least a couple days a week feel like a drag just because it's a daily class. The class has great community and I think Jewish or non-Jewish alike, students bonded with their classmates and really engaged with the material. I also am realizing by engaging in Hebrew language media outside of the class that she really taught us everything you need to have a solid foundation in conversational Hebrew, including cultural aspects and highly common expressions like \"baruch haShem\" and \"ma pitom\". We didn't even learn the colors in L1, which is kind of strange, but it's clear in retrospect that the vocab and verbs we learned were exactly what was logical and necessary.",
                "100%. Remotely interested in learning the Hebrew language. Jump right in   (\"my friend\")! Your friend over here had zero experience with Hebrew before this class, but can now think in Hebrew not just talk. With not much bloodsweat."
