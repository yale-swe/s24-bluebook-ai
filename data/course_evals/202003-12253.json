This is a really unique class in the ChemE curriculum, and gives an interesting perspective on understanding the dynamics of processes, and then designing control processes to manage these dynamics. Learned lots about LaPlace Transforms, modelling dynamic systems, various types of controllers, and different methods of control. We also utilized SimuLink in Matlab to analyze some of the systems, which was a nice, more practical, addition to the class.",

                "One strength of the course is the teaching format. The Canvas page was very organized with all of the necessary resources available to learn the material, including instructional videos, notes, problem sets, and solutions. Additionally, the in-person class was very helpful because it was always tailored to what us students needed help with. The textbook for the class was also pretty well-written, and was helpful in understanding the material. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of the class was the pacing. We moved through material very quickly, and it was clear that students got somewhat dragged along at certain points along the way. That being said, everyone got a chance to catch up at the end, just in time for the final!",
                "This course was a great look into the Chemical Engineering processes that we learn about in other classes as Chemical Engineers. I think it had a good balance of pen + paper math to Matlab, but it kinda felt like two separate classes in that respect too. The entirety of the beginning of the course was pen + paper, and then it suddenly transitions into a Matlab class.",
                "I think it is a strength of this course that most of the material is all new to us. And Professor Loewenberg adapted the course when possible so that we learned the material the best we could.",
                "Professor Loewenberg and Rodrigo are the highlights of the course. It is pretty dry, and gets challenging very quickly, but the teaching staff made it work.",
                "This class was taught in a reverse classroom structure, which was helpful, but I feel that a stronger emphasis on problem solving during class time would be beneficial."

                "The recorded instructional videos were awesome! Super helpful and a great way to take advantage of the Canvas media library. It was also awesome to have all of the classes recorded and uploaded to Canvas. This made it really easy to review materials and go through explanations again in case you missed them during class.",
                "The recordings were great! Being able to go back to review (or watch for the first time if Zoom fatigue kicked in and I missed class) was amazing. At times, I felt as though some recordings came out semi-sporadically, which made it sometimes difficult to stay super engaged, but in the end it was fine. I liked the idea of videos on = I can be called on and videos off = please don't call on me. Part of me also doesn't like this because maybe not everyone can always put their video on if they want to interact with the class, but at the same time our class was small enough and everyone had at one point had their videos on at some point so it worked for our class.",
                "I enjoyed the in class collaborative problem solving activities in the breakout rooms as they helped me engage with the material and learn it better.",
                "The class felt the same online and in-person, perhaps with the flipped classroom structure added.",
                "This class was taught in a reverse classroom structure, which I feel was productive given the material and the online nature.  There were technical challenges throughout the semester, but I don't hold these against anyone since we were all rushed into the new virtual system.  While I hope that by the time the Fall 2021 semester rolls around, this course is not virtual, I believe that this layout performed quite well."
