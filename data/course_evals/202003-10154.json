                "Strengths: you learn an enormous amount of information in a short amount of time. Doing so is very rewarding. The teaching is amazing and there's tons of resources that students can use for help. \r\nWeaknesses: the workload is intense and you almost always have something to do for the class (watch lecture, take quiz, lab, or PSET).",
                "SO MUCH WORK. \r\nDavid was incredible! Many resources for help. I really appreciate all the effort that went into making this course enjoyable, engaging and interesting. But, it still was the most time-consuming class I took this semster.",
                "Too much for a beginner I believe. Hard to stay caught up some weeks without falling behind in other classes.",
                "Strengths: this class teaches A LOT. There are weekly psets and quizzes that do a pretty good job of ensuring that you're staying on top of things. That being said, if you fall behind, it becomes hard to catch up. The lectures are engaging (albeit long). Section also offers a valuable opportunity to ask clarifying questions\r\n\r\nWeakness: Labs are pointless because everyone just copy and pastes the answer anyways. I wish toward the middle of the term, TAs would have quick 10 minute meetings with people to check-in because the difficulty of the course significantly ramps up around then.",
                "I thought that the course was taught very fast it was tough at times to follow. For students new to CS, it could be a very daunting course. \r\n\r\nThere was clearly a lot of time and effort put into the course.",
                "Strengths: learn useful skills such as logical thinking and problem solving; teaches patience, overall a very rewarding class when you finish\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were like 3 hours long, hard to get through them sometimes; section leaders are just students who took the class in the past, which in my opinion, doesn't qualify them to help us solve all the issues we run into along the way; problem sets take such a long time",
                "Strengths: amazing lecturer, great structure and support (especially the TAs during office hours), really productive assignments \r\nWeaknesses: so much material and very time consuming, also office hours were only offered at quite specific times",
                "The course is very rigorous, content heavy, and fast-paced. This is a beautiful thing for computer science because it's almost like a bootcamp in the sense that you acquire so many skills and languages in such a short time. In the midst of a pandemic with a shortened semester and everything being totally virtual though, it was super difficult to manage and keep up with. 3 hour lectures may not be as bad on a normal year. But when all of your classes, activities, jobs, etc are online, it may not have been the best idea. In addition, the heavy workload was difficult to keep up with because of screen\/Zoom fatigue and the difficulty to learn during a 3 hour lecture. It made it feel as though I was self teaching on a week-to-week basis and having to spend numerous hours on labs and problem sets that I could've started earlier in the week had it been released and if the lecture was shorter.",
                "The entire structure is well considered and the assignments were fun to solve. Maybe the content itself was too hard for first learners.",
                "Great problems. I genuinely enjoyed doing my homework. All tasks had some real world application. This is definitely the course I learned the most information from. I can't think of any negative feedback.",
                "This is an incredibly challenging course and takes SOOOO much time. The problem sets could be shorter.",
                "A big strength of the course is the professor, David Malan. He is phenomenal at what he does, and he is one of the primary reasons why CS50 is so highly lauded across the world. Another strength is the course's structure. Week in and week out, I really felt like I was learning a lot, and the TAs were super helpful during section and in office hours to answer any questions that I may have had about the material. The labs generally had clear applications to the problem set, which were super helpful. The problem sets are super fun as well--we implemented a spell checker, solved a mystery using databases, and even created our own stock trading website. There were so many obvious real-world applications in the problem sets, which made them more fun to accomplish.\r\nThere aren't too many weaknesses with the course, but the lectures are really long (if you attend them live). They usually run for right under 3 hours, which is a really long time to focus on computer science. Though, if this is also the case for you, I would recommend watching the lectures when they are released on YouTube at 1.5x speed (or even 2x speed, if you're up to it). Also, sometimes the office hours queue would be overloaded with students trying to complete the problem set the day before it was due. I would recommend going to office hours earlier in the week if you can!",
                "Strengths: fun, engaging, challenging problem sets that are extremely rewarding to finish, quality of the lectures was superb\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: seemingly needless\/very tedious quizzes and \"labs\"",
                "Great course! I think they're nailing it already.",
                "The live lectures were very engaging and taught me a lot. I think the only improvement is to continue to make labs 1 point or even optional, so that they don't add more stress on top of already long psets.",
                "I think that the course did a good job at teaching a large range of topics in a short duration of time. I think that sometimes it felt very rushed and I wasn't fully understanding the information presented.",
                "Strengths: the lectures were phenomenal and engaging despite being delivered virtually from Harvard each week; the sections were helpful follow-ups\r\nWeaknesses: For me, as a graduate student, the course was very time-consuming and labor-intensive (glad I did it, but if I knew how long I'd spend on it going in, may not have stuck it out honestly)",
                "Overall I spent more than the average time on the course and felt burned out. The course is unforgiving for those without a coding background. I wish the course homeworks demanded less as I wasn't able to finish all of them or even understand all of them before moving on, even with 15 hours or more of work with the course every week. \r\n\r\nThe course gives too much information too quickly. I feel like I have a surface level understanding of a brand array of topics instead of a firm grasp on a few topics. This has led me to now want to pursue computer science down the road.",
                "I think the level of detail that was explored in this course was perfect for an intro-level course. However, I sincerely wish some of the examples (particularly related to the more complicated topics such as linked lists and memory allocation) were covered in greater detail. Perhaps this interpretation is entirely personal, but I feel like some explanations were glossed over and I understood the topic conceptually but putting it in practice and actually coding was much more difficult.",
                "I loved how much i learned for this course. But I felt very stressed since I had to learn a lot on my own.",
                "strengths: very engaging and interesting course\r\nweaknesses: too much homework",
                "Strengths: Learn a lot about CS and programming,\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was not very accommodating during the pandemic.  There was no leeway on assignments unless you had a Dean's excuse and so many different assignments (quiz, lab, AND 1-2 psets) being due each week was overwhelming.  It felt like you couldn't get a break and caused so many students distress. I know a lot of people who after this class will not engage with CS again because of the stress and that really makes me sad because CS is a really cool field.",
                "I think a major weakness of this course was that there was so many assignments! It was so difficult to keep up with them. Additionally, we had to complete a quiz by Tuesday morning, which meant we had to watch the 3 hour asynchronous lecture in a 20 hour window. There was not enough flexibility.",
                "The course is taught very well and in-depth, but I don't like how we only spend a week or so on each topic.",
                "Malan is an excellent instructor who uses clear and comprehensible examples to better teach concepts. My only complaint is that the final exam is weighted very heavily. One poor performance on the test (which is common, the average was around a 75) can completely turn your otherwise good grade around in this class. Office hours also felt inaccessible at times.",
                "Strengths: availability of help resources, sections for more and less comfortable students, structure",
                "it's a LOT of work, but some of it is really fun!",
                "There are a lot of assignments that I felt were over what was reasonable. I thought this course had many strengths and actually helped you learn CS. However, the biggest weakness for me was the lack of understanding for students with a no late policy on psets, especially during COVID.",
                "This course is extremely organized. The lectures are clearly planned very well in advance, and it really benefits from years of trial and error. There are also so many resources for students to succeed. I can't really think of any way to improve the class, but it would be cool if there was some ungraded activities students could do just to try their hand at more advanced topics.",
                "big support system; too much information per lecture very difficult to absorb all the information",
                "It is an incredibly well structured class that takes into account all types of learning programming. Professor Malan is an amazing lecturer and always kept students very engaged. However, there are a few issues that arrised during the term. The lecture was given live on Monday during the time of many other Yale classes and because the schedule was not announced until 2 days before the class started, there was no way of adjusting my schedule to it. There was a quiz that was due Tuesday morning (which basically means due Monday night) and because of it students have to watch all 3 hours of lecture in one sitting. The material was very dense and it was very hard to focus throughout the whole lecture. I understand that having quizes due right after the lecture meant to encourage students to watch lecture earlier in the week, but I think it would be better if the quiz was due the next day after lecture. Sections were somewhat useful, but very time consuming with no real benefit from it. During the time allocated for completing labs most of the students ended up doing nothing, because noone was able to focus on the task. I did not find labs particularly useful for the completion of the psets, rather than more time-consuming. Problem Sets were definitely challenging and took a lot of time, but they are also the most important part of the class. OH were quite often understaffed, especially during the weekends with hard problem sets when everyone needed help. Test was unreasonably hard and quite a few question were weirdly formulated and when I asked for help from the heads, they refused to provide clarification. Project was definitely a highlight of the course and even though it took me 40+ hours to complete it, it was a very fun time.",
                "Sometimes, the lectures can be a bit unclear and the labs and PSETs feel overwhelming. I wasn't sure how to approach learning syntax vs learning the language at first.",
                "The weakness of this course was its sections as they weren't very helpful. The strength was the professor, David Malan is a very engaging lecturer.",
                "I liked the problem sets because they were practical and the problems were interesting, which made them fun to do. I also liked how the final was open for a week, but not that it was before Thanksgiving. Sections were great, because we got to do some groupwork.",
                "The classes (and sections) are wayyyy too long. The lecture was consistently over three hours long in one sitting, and the sections are 1.5-2 hours. This along with 20 hours of homework a week warrants two credits! And personally I hated how all of the homework was autograded. The whole class felt extremely cold and removed and we had almost zero contact with actual faculty. The undergrad TAs were flakey, not always knowledgeable of what we were learning, and unreliable.",
                "Weaknesses: There is a lot of content covered in very short stretches of time, making it difficult to fully grasp or understand why you are making the programming choices you are. The workload can also be extremely variable in that certain psets require much more time and support than others, making it difficult to gauge how much time you need to be putting into the course. Strengths: You gain exposure to a lot of different languages and functionalities.",
                "This course is amazing! The workload is definitely high, but the course is equally rewarding in the amount of knowledge you gain in a relatively short time. The lectures are engaging, David Malan is a very inspiring professor, there is a remarkable CS50 community for support and help, and the final project is a lot of fun!\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures are very long and I wish they were broken up into segments",
                "This course helps people get a basic understanding of the programming world and helps them to get creative through the final project. The only weakness of this course was its 3-hour lectures every Monday. Honestly, watching previous years' lectures gave the same amount of knowledge in only 2 hours. I wish they understood that just because the course format is fully virtual does not mean that they can take another hour than compared to last years.",
                "Strengths: the lectures were as engaging as possible for a course so packed with new information. The TAs were incredibly helpful -- the sections provided a good review of key concepts, helpful group work, and challenging exercises to help prepare for psets. The workload is high but not as bad as I expected: completing the labs and psets almost always felt rewarding and fun (even though the debugging process itself can be stressful and frustrating).\r\nWeaknesses: it's hard to stay focused throughout a 3-hour lecture. The final exam was a bit too lengthy, and it was hard to see what some of the questions were looking for.",
                "Strength: ORGANIZATION. This is the only reason any student is willing to put up with this much work. It is the most well-organized class, probably in existence. Extremely refreshing.\r\n\r\nHowever, the workload is pretty absurd. If they keep the workload the same, I think they can spend a little more time reminding students that it is a survey course, and not to feel discouraged if they move on from topics with a limited understanding of some aspects.",
                "Fun, but a lot of work",
                "I enjoy the lecture and how to think of questions and solutions logically rather than purely technical",
                "Strengths: the course is so well-structured and you really learn A LOT; Prof. Malan's lectures are very interesting and the CS50 team is beyond amazing; the psets are some of the most well-designed and fun psets I've done\r\nWeaknesses: lectures are once a week which means a lot of is covered in one sitting; weekly quizzes, labs, and especially psets combined do take up quite some time; depending on your section TAs, the sections might not be as helpful as you'd hope",
                "The lectures were fabulous and the PSets were rewarding and made you feel like the skills you learn really are practical. The difficulty spike at the end might make this class disheartening for non-STEM majors.",
                "This course is extremely thoroughly but at times extremely difficult. Anyone can take it but be prepared for it to be the class you spend the most time and effort with. You will learn a lot and be challenged a lot. You will have resources available for help at all times but you will also have to do a lot of work on your own to come to a solution. It is difficult but rewarding.",
                "Strengths: fun psets, office hours\r\nWeaknesses: sections were sometimes not helpful at all in further understanding of labs\/psets",
                "The course does a really good job teaching C and Python, but the parts of the course dealing with html and, most of all, JavaScript, are really bare-bones. Despite making it through those weeks with good grades, I still have no idea how to do anything with JavaScript, even the things I learned for the problem set.",
                "The scheduling of the course was weak because even though the lecture was recorded you had to watch it Monday because section was Tuesday and the quiz. Strong point was the instruction, great teacher and professor.",
                "Strengths: unbelievable how much you learn, for people who have no experience in computer science whatsoever, will feel confident in programming after this course\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of work",
                "Strengths: The course has AMAZING professors and TAs. There are endless opportunities to get help, and while you're expected to be able to do things on your own, they don't hesitate to work with you and really help guide you to finding the answer\/information you need. The labs were nice to have a bit of practice before diving into the pset for the week, and I was happy once they made them more of a Pass\/Fail so that I could use that as a learning\/understanding opportunity and then see where I made mistakes and apply that to the psets.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was a LOT of information to learn over the course of the semester. I don't think this can necessarily be remedied, but it was really overwhelming and hard to keep up with everything - 3+ hour lectures, 1-2 hour sections, labs, psets, quizzes, etc. I think they all were helpful in bettering my understanding, but it was really easy to fall behind; not in the sense of procrastination or lack of effort, but just that there was so much to learn and remember and new concepts introduced each week that if you had difficulty understanding the information from the previous week, it was difficult to relearn that and catch back up.",
                "I think the  workload was too much.",
                "Strengths - TONS of support from TAs, sets you up well to continue CS at Yale\r\nWeaknesses - goes really fast and can be overwhelming with the amount of work\/committment",
                "My sleep schedule would've been better if the labs were either due later in the day or at midnight the night before.",
                "Strengths: \r\nTAs are great and very helpful \r\nDavid is a great lecturer \r\nHW was, for the most part, pretty fun\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nLectures were always a pain to get through (3 hours recorded Monday which you had to watch on Monday) \r\nSometimes lab\/hw instructions weren't very clear \/ could give better hints.",
                "Its the best, most well-organized course Ive taken! But its extremely difficult and time consuming",
                "Strengths: material was clearly very well-thought out, and the mix of low-level programming in C and higher level, more user-friendly languages is the perfect blend for a first course in CS\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Its very thorough, you learn a lot, but it moves extremely fast and is very hard for someone with no computer science experience.",

                "strengths: problem sets were all unique and applicable to real-life scenarios; sections and office hours were extremely helpful; labs were great and helpful in doing problem sets; final project was fun and challenged you to learn something new on your own and creating anything\r\n\r\nweaknesses: lectures were way too long and it was difficult to retain any information from lectures",
                "God the quizzes and labs were annoying.",
                "The lectures were amazing.  The discussion sections were a little dry and very repetitive of the lecture.  I wish the discussion section was more about working on code and asking for help when needed.",

                "this course was very well taught! I loved Professor Malan's lectures even if they got long at times, and though the work is time consuming, many of the psets are interesting enough to be enjoyable",
                "I dont think there were any weaknesses. I loved the class",
                "Weaknesses included some of the unstructured problem sets.",
                "This course was great as an online course. The professor's lectures were fun and engaging and very easy to understand despite being very dense in matter. The sessions and the office hours were extremely helpful with the psets. I loved the support that the TAs provided.",
                "One strength of this course were the ample opportunities to reach out for help when we were stuck on problems. There were several office hours almost every day in addition to the weekly discussion section, and we could also ask answers on ED (an online discussion forum). I was especially impressed by the fast response times to ED questions. On one occasion I posted a question well past midnight, and a member of staff responded within 10 minutes. I also enjoyed the lectures, which combined engaging and useful visuals with plentiful examples of code. One thing I would improve would be to better balance the workload throughout the week. Mondays and weekends were very workload-heavy, while the remainder of the week I didn't have much CS work to do.",
                "The lectures were engaging and the examples used in the lectures were also really fun. The labs and problem sets were also all fun to do. Sometimes the weekly cs sections were not the most helpful but the office hours were great!",
                "A great introduction to programming. Lectures were excellent, though a little too long. Examples provided in lectures and in sections were easy to understand and relevant. The psets were great exercises to learn and grow--challenging but rewarding finish. I appreciated the option to sign up for a section that is \"more comfy\" with coding or \"less comfy\" with coding.",
                "Strengths: the staff was very willing to help, office hours were well-organized online through the queue and Zoom, my TAs were always one email away, the class was very informative\r\nWeakness: the lectures on Mondays were extremely long (~3+ hours) and I would become overwhelmed by the end mentally, there were also too many assignments during the week that distracted from the problem sets\r\nImprove: have the labs be limited only to section and have the section leaders walk through the solution, have the Monday lectures be more concise in length and time or have the quizzes due later than Tuesday morning (which would help those who have multiple classes at Yale on Mondays)",
                "This course is unique in that it has been offered as a remote (on-line) course for almost a decade at Harvard. Because of this, it has an incredible production value which is unique in the age of Covid-19 university classes. Honestly, not sure how much more this could be improved while the course is strictly on-line.",
                "Strengths: The instructor is great! The office hours were also great along with the TA's. Every person met through CS50 wants to genuinely help you. \r\nWeaknesses: It could get time consuming at times. The lectures would go on for 3 hours sometimes.",
                "The strengths of this course was the access to help, in section and in office ours. The weaknesses  stem from the time commitment. Often the wait for office hours in the virtual environment could be an hour long. In addition, assignments like the Labs each week begin to feel a bit like busy work.",
                "Strengths: The lectures are very well organized and the delivery of information is very well thought out. The lectures are engaging with various demos and visualizations in class facilitating learning (it has always been an online course so the quality of the lectures are very high). The information is presented in a digestable fashion, and I think this class is an excellent introduction to computer science. Also there is a lot of support throughout the course, though I've never had to use any of them\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Toward the end of the semester, they want to focus more on \"learning it yourself\", which I think is just an excuse for bad teaching and laziness. In particular, the lectures before the last two psets were helpful but did not supply the relevant information to actually implement the code, so office hours would definitely help (I still don't know how to implement a feature because I never asked).",
                "It is really just more work than it needs to be. The time commitment expected, especially for graduate students is too large. I think it's a wonderful course that is extremely well organized and covers great topics but it simply needs to have 20% shaved off. Otherwise, great teaching, engaging setup and valuable PSETS.",
                "This is one of the best courses that I have ever taken. David is an amazing instructor.",
                "Strength: The labs (which I understand were only a thing this year) were super helpful when it came to approaching the psets.\r\nWeakness: The lecture pace is pretty variable; some simple concepts were given twice as much time as much more difficult ones.",
                "Strengths include the explanations in section and the recorded lecture. Weaknesses are the time demand and sudden increase in difficulty in problem sets. Lack of in-person office hours made the course much more difficult, which was a result of the virtual format.",
                "Great lectures, hard psets",
                "The strengths are access to quick health in office hours, several coding manuals, and the CS50 website.",
                "Strengths:\r\nIf you really have to take an intro CS course, this is probably a good course to take--at least, it's better than CS112, the other intro course offered at Yale, from what I've heard. This course has really great lectures and an engaging professor + Brian is freakin phenomenal.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nBe prepared for the really high workload. Not sure why discussion sections are 2 hours long and that lectures are 3 hours long and PSETs often take 10 hours a week for me on top of working on labs which sometimes took me 2 hours per week in the beginning of the semester, when we didn't finish them in class. Plus, there's a weekly quiz that often took an hour because I got counted down if I didn't write down verbatim what the professor said--so I had to rewind the video multiple times.\r\n\r\nFor weekly section:\r\nI don't think anyone learned anything in section, because we'd all come to the lab and not have any clue how to proceed, waiting for answers from the TA. Some people straight up left during section, sometimes for periods of 30 minutes and only came back in the last 15 minutes when the answers were being done by the TAs. The TAs often went over material we didn't cover in lecture and that we didn't need to know. \r\n\r\nFor weekly labs:\r\nLabs didn't really teach me anything new and rather just provided code that I could look at for the PSET (but I heard in previous years, we worked on the PSET in lab, so that would make a lot more sense). \r\n\r\nFor weekly quizzes:\r\nI didn't feel like quizzes reinforced or taught anything. There were a few times where I got marked down on quizzes, and I'd message my TA only for my TA to respond \"Oh, that's weird that I marked you down for that. You're fine. But I can't change the grades. You're doing okay in the class though so don't worry about it.\" Quizzes also took about an hour or so since the times when I didn't write down verbatim what the professor said in class, I'd get marked down, so I often had to rewatch lectures for the exact wording. Sometimes, I'd still get marked down.\r\n\r\nOverall workload:\r\nNot sure why discussion sections are 2 hours long and that lectures are 3 hours long and PSETs often take 10 hours a week for me on top of working on labs which sometimes took me 2 hours per week in the beginning of the semester, when we didn't finish them in class. \r\n\r\nFor the test:\r\nThe test doesn't make sense to me either. \r\nTests are supposed to test how well you learned the material. Their goal, by having a test that covers material we didn't cover in class, is to \"test how well you learned how to teach yourself\" but they never taught you how to teach yourself--they just made PSETs really difficult so you either had to rely on your smart friends, go to office hours and pray your TA helps, or slog through hours of websites that don't really make sense because the only advice you get during lecture is \"just google things and find the answer\" as the only method of teaching yourself.\r\n\r\nAlso, on both the quizzes and tests, the questions always say \"use three sentences\" but whenever I use three sentences I get a 0 because I didn't cover the 5 things they wanted me to cover, and then I see other people writing 3 page essays and getting full credit because they regurgitated everything in the course. Not sure what the staff is going for with \"only use three sentences\"--are they trying to penalize people who follow directions?\r\n\r\nFor the project:\r\nThis was what I expected for the most part I guess, but our TA kept saying \"you should do more\" when, like. Buddy. It's finals period. There's a pandemic. I have better things to be worrying about than trying to add yet another feature to something like letting someone download an image. Being forced to make a video about our project and write peer feedback for every project we saw during discussion section was truly rubbing salt on the wound for an already high-workload course.",
                "The weakness of the course was that it was online. Online learning is difficult for me, because there is not much room to be able to interact with the professor of course material during the live 400 person lecture. It's strengths were that it had sections with smaller groups that reviewed the material that was learned within the lecture.",
                "The lectures were incredibly well done and engaging. Homeworks were also fun and engaging. Sometimes the grading for this class felt very specific and it wasnt explained that some directions should be followed very carefully and others are as important to follow exactly.",
                "Strengths - very strong lectures and supportive TAs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - course load and level of difficulty does not match with pace. Too fast paced.",
                "David is a fantastic lecturer, and the course really encourages students to be excited about computer science and about learning. The course teaches a lot of practical skills that can eventually be used in a lot of other areas as well. The course could be slightly more forgiving on deadlines or missed problem sets, even once perhaps.",
                "I think the strengths were the lectures as they were very well explained and informative. The problem sets were also challenging but do able and the walkthroughs helped enough without giving away the answers. I thought the weakness was the discussion section and I felt that sometimes they did not use time effectively.",
                "Strengths:\r\nVery high production value of lectures. \r\nGood system of online interaction (office hours, question board, etc.)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe constant reminders about the honor code discouraged me from searching for information and resources online. I know that programming is all about finding existing code and adapting in many cases, but I was not able to develop that key skill because I was terrified of an honor code violation. I struggled through a lot of the problem sets on my own and used office hours extensively, but feel that I really missed out on a valuable opportunity to learn how to teach myself online due to the honor code.",
                "Strengths: learning a new way to approach issues and solve problems\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: workload could be very strenuous at times\r\n\r\nImprovements: giving solutions to labs before problem set is due to let us see what we did wrong (this was implemented half way through the semester)",
                "Lectures way too long",
                "A weakness would be that the course is too large to accommodate participation from everyone.",
                "The strengths were in the interactive learning displayed by the professor. Weaknesses included many TAs that seemed disinterested in seeing through student success. I would often go to office hours with many questions, and leave more confused. Office hours were also rushed; I wish there had been someone to sit with me and help me work through my confusion, even if just by leading questions. Another weakness is in the class length in general - I found it really difficult to sit through the 3+ hour class and stay focused the whole time."

                "I think this course was taught as well as it could be given the circumstances. Virtual office hours seemed just as helpful as they would have been in person. Lectures have always been online so there weren't any major changes in that regard.",
                "This course has been taught virtually in other years too, so it was suited well for online learning.",
                "I thought the sections were done well because it was a place to ask questions and share ideas.",
                "Office hours were super helpful when I could get in, but sometimes I would be waiting in the queue for a while, and I would have appreciated more time slots, especially over Fridays\/the weekend (since this is right before the PSETs were due)",
                "Sections were a great aspect of the virtual setting. I also liked the routine of quiz, then lab, then problem set. However, I feel that all three should have been released at the beginning of the week because a crucial element of the virtual setting is working at your own pace since there was a lot of flexibility yet a lot more time was designated to addition virtual hours that were added to our schedules this year. Also the use of Ed was beneficial, and Office Hours were good but the days and times for office hours seemed to be helpful to some extent. It was kind of frustrating when office hours were not available for flexible hours. Then if you were able to make it, you would have to wait in line for sometimes an hour or longer which could leave you in a bad situation depending on the other hours of your schedule.",
                "I think the staff did more than enough. Live virtual lectures, youtube videos of instruction, and interaction with Ed\/email were all helpful.",
                "N\/A",
                "The live Zoom lectures were incredibly well-produced. They provided ample opportunity for in-class engagement from not just Harvard students (as was in years past I believe) but also from Yale students. I felt that there weren't many changes to the course structure to accommodate for the COVID-19 pandemic, which was okay because CS50 tends to be mainly online anyway. It was really sad to see some of the in-person components (namely the CS50 fair where everyone gets shirts and shows off their final projects) not implemented at all, though.",
                "The format of the course at large was largely online, even during non-covid times, which allowed for a pleasant experience.",
                "Virtual office hours were very well thought-through with the Zoom queue.",
                "This class is usually remote anyway, so I don't think there were many specific practices, but I thought virtual office hours were well organized.",
                "I think that the course was very engaging even during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
                "This course is called CS50 at Harvard and its methods are very public and well-known. It translated very nicely to virtual learning because of the nature of the class and the professionalism and tech-savviness of its course heads\/staff.",
                "I enjoyed the variation in the lectures with props and more. This course is typically taught in a similar fashion even in a normal year and so I don't find there to be much to change.",
                "I liked the recorded lectures since I couldn't attend the live lecutres. Zoom was a big help!",
                "the professor and staff have done a great job transiting to a 100% virtual teaching",
                "Having recorded lectures and live section was helpful. \r\n\r\nA lot of assignments and many that were redundant and an extra stressor.  Not really flexible with deadlines. Get rid of the labs and gives us three free lates or excused missed assignments for each assignment type.",
                "Again, I would have appreciated greater flexibility in this course to account for the fact that not everyone can watch an asynchronous lecture in the span of 20 hours, especially when said lecture is 3 hours long.",
                "Having quizzes due the morning after the lectures were posted was quite stressful.",
                "Virtual sections worked better in this course than others because coding doesn't require too much discussion. From a social standpoint, they were not ideal (but this is inevitable).",

                "We had labs in the beginning of the semester (new this semester), which they later took out of the grading scheme. I think it would have been helpful to keep them in because they were very helpful in understanding the content for the week, and by doing them we should have been awarded credit for them.",
                "I appreciated having the lectures recorded, but having the quiz on the lectures due the next morning at 9 am sometimes made it difficult to comprehend the material fully. The discussion section via Zoom also tended to not be that engaging, we would go through examples and have time to work individually on lab at the end, but more direct examples would be helpful.",
                "This course did not change very much because it was always offered online for Yale students. The sections worked well via Zoom and the additional option of having a live Zoom lecture seemed to work for some people. I found the recording to still be the better option.",
                "The online format of the office hours worked out well -- it was clear how long we had to wait to receive help.",

I think the course ran pretty smoothly, I just felt like the pandemic prevented me from connecting more with other students so at times I didn't feel the cult-like atmosphere CS50 supposedly creates on campus.",
                "I think the virtual engagement was good. One minor gripe is that I thought the section time zones were pretty limiting.  I was on the west coast taking 4 other courses, so a lot of the section times were either too early (before 7AM) or interfered with other courses.",
                "There was way too many components, quizzes\/parts\/lectures\/sections\/labs.",

                "I think that the recorded lecture format worked great, as I could revisit the lecture several times if I did not initially understand something, or if I wanted to refresh my memory before completing an assignment. I think that the online discussion forum was also very helpful, since it allowed me to ask questions outside of the regular office hours times. One thing that I would add to the course would be more opportunities to interact with fellow students. Besides seeing students in the discussion section, I met very few other people taking CS100 this term; a virtual learning environment was not as conducive to social interactions as an in-person lecture would otherwise be.",

                "Everything was successful through Zoom. I recommend that section leaders for the less comfortable spend less time going through the slides and more time helping students understand the lab (I would always go to office hours outside of section for help on them). \r\nImproved: Offer fewer assignments -- I understand this is a computer course, but the amount of time spent staring into the screen during an already remote year is too much on the eyes, sometimes less is more",

                "The TA sessions are pretty weak and they take a lot of time. There's just not enough coding practice. We should be practice code (simple code) like crazy to build up our skills during those labs. As it stands, it's a mediocre regurgitation of concepts from the lecture and then a superficial and frankly, unhelpful, overview of the lab which already skips several levels. Let us PRACTICE if you're gonna make us hang out for two additional hours on zoom.",
                "Course contents are very well taught. Live lectures have allowed interaction between students and instructors which is great.",

                "Section and recorded lectures worked well. Office hours could be improved. Providing more opportunities for collaboration with other students would also help.",
                "They added labs to the course, which honestly I feel like was the last thing needed during a pandemic",
                "The live lectures succeeded as coding is a very visual concept to grasp, so visualizing solely the code on a screen is also very efficient for learning.",
                "A well-designed web that made it easy to access a lot of material about the course.",
                "It seemed like this class had already been practicing for covid years ago. Everything worked great for the online environment.",
                "This course's format did not actually change much from how it is usually (lectures are always online), so the staff and professors were already quite used to the digital format; I think everyone did a good job of adapting, and help was readily available for students in several different forms, such as Ed, office hours, etc. Not much needs improvement.",
                "I think that they did a good job of learning virtually as the lectures were very effective even over zoom.",
                "Discussion sections were not very useful. TAs were not very organized or receptive to questions. \r\n\r\nOnline question board and virtual office hours were excellent.",
                "This class was probably the most streamlined of my courses during the pandemic since it has been delivered in this format for years now. CS50\/CPSC100 is the gold standard for how a large lecture can be taught virtually.",
                "I think that the idea for virtual office hours was good, the execution ended up in a way that sometimes I was waiting for 40 minutes in a queue even when there were more TA's than students in queue.",
                "The recorded lectures worked out really well because I could pause if I was confused and refer back to the lectures when completing the PSETs. However, there were many technological issues that took away from valuable class time."

                "I would most definitely recommend this course to others because I learned so much. I also think on a normal year (assuming we're out of this pandemic by next fall, which seems to be the case), the course will be very different.",

I originally decided to take it because we were going to be online anyway, so I didn't feel like I would be missing out on other opportunities as much by taking CS50 this semester. But, even if that's not the case in the future, absolutely take this course. It teaches you really valuable concepts in computer science, skills in which are becoming more valuable by the day, and plus you get to complete a final project at the end that you own and will be really proud of. After taking CS50, I'm now going to be taking more computer science courses in the future. There's few courses at Yale that you will gain more from than CS50!",

                "If you've done any programming before, it's not that bad. 2hr+ lecture , quiz, section, lab, and pset are more than any other class, but not insane.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this class to any student. It's extremely informative, the psets are so interesting it takes away from the work, and overall the class is just fun to be in.",
                "Yes, it is a great course for learning the fundamentals of coding. You won't become an expert in any given language, but you'll have the framework to expand upon later.",
                "Yes! I went from knowing nothing to creating my own website with a partner for the course's final rpoject!",
                "If you want to dig into computer science and you've never done so before, this is a great course! Clear your calendar for Sundays to work on the problem sets, though!",
                "I can't recommend this course to another student because of the work demanded. It is too much work to do along with other courses for those that have never taken a computer science course or are familiar with computer coding. Maybe the summer course would be better when there are not distractions with other coursework. I took this course very seriously but ultimately felt like the attention given to the course wasn't worth the result regarding what I learned or was able to understand at the end of it all.",
                "Yes, particularly for those looking for a simple introduction to CS and unsure about potential interest. This course helps you learn how to think all the while giving you an introduction to several important programming languages.",
                "Yes, this teaches a very relevant topic.",
                "yes, very fun course with great knowledge",
                "If you want to develop the fundamental skills for programming and get an understanding of multiple coding languages i recommend this course.",
                "I would not recommend this class during the current COVID-19 pandemic.  It is too much work and stress during this already stressful time.  I would recommend this during the pandemic only if you're taking 3\/3.5 credits total.  I would recommend this course to people who plan on being CS majors but who had no formal CS class before. It can prepare you well for internships.",
                "I would highly recommend this class to any student interested in CS. It was a very enjoyable intro course, but required a lot of time.",
                "Yes, if they're interested in learning about various different languages.",
                "I would recommend this course: it is a solid and comprehensive overview of computer science, and the fundamentals can easily be applied toward any more coding projects of the user's choice.",
                "Yes. Amazing class.",
                "absolutely! just know what you're getting into",
                "Yes. Although I complained a lot, I truly learned the most from this class.",
                "Absolutely! Don't be scared by the course's reputation for being overwhelming. I was pleasantly surprised by how manageable it was. Seriously, just do PSETs ahead of time, and CS50 is a really chill, low stress class.",
                "i would if they have very little else going on in their schedule",
                "Everyone should take this class!! It is an amazing intro to programming and if you are not a CS major or even a STEM-fan - still take it. They teach the most popular languages and teach you how to learn new languages by yourself. CS50 is a very heavy workload class, so adjust your schedule accordingly.",
                "If you are interested in CS, definitely take this course, but make sure you have time in your schedule for all the problem sets.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in learning computer science!",
                "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course to another student. The workload isn't as daunting as it might seem. Even if it's a lot of work, usually it's super fun of a problem to solve, and I never had a dull moment. Just start the problem sets early in the week and you should be good. The fact that the course is done in conjunction with Harvard, with such a large total student population, means that it is very structured and streamlined.",
                "No. It was poorly taught and the TAs were very unresponsive. Much of the learning was self taught and the recorded lectured did not help with the application at all",
                "I would recommend another introductory course to programming. Unless you have some familiarity with coding already, I would recommend looking at the other course offerings. I struggled to understand why I was programming in a certain way or choosing to make certain decisions, which only compounded my confusion over the course of the class.",
                "Yes! Absolutely! You do need to have time dedicated to working on the PSETS every week but it is not as much of a time suck as people say it is.",
                "Yes! Anyone who is curious about computer science should really really take this course, no matter your quantitative background. There are office hours held almost every day and they help so much with problem sets and other assignments.",
                "Yes! The course helped me overcome my fear of computer science that stemmed from bad experience with CS classes in middle school. I genuinely found the psets enjoyable and looked forward to solving them. I now feel more confident to continue coding in the future, even though I'm sure I'll never be a CS major. This course has a considerable workload, but CS is just so important in today's world and an intro CS course can't get more fun than this.",
                "Yes, any student, especially if you had no understanding of technology like me. It is an important introduction. But it is a lot of work.",
                "Yes, engaging way to learn about cs and see if the major is right for you",
                "yes",
                "Yes, because it changed my attitude and confidence toward coding",
                "Absolutely yes!! I've heard great things about this course before taking it, yet it still exceeded my expectations. If you're interested in CS, this course has all you could ask for in an intro CS course. You can really learn so much from it (and with lots of support and fun) if you're willing to put in the work.",
                "Yes. This is an absolute must-take if you would like to know more about how to make programs work for you but have little experience.",
                "Depending on their interest and work ethic",
                "Yes! This course really changed my perspectives on programming and computer science as a discipline. Would absolutely recommend that you enroll in this course (perhaps Credit\/D\/Fail) to really be introduced to CS and different languages.",
                "Yes, especially if you have no CS experience but are interested in coding or the major.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes because you learn a lot of good computer science knowledge and languages.",
                "Yes, most definitely!! I think this course teaches valuable skills on how to facilitate learning independently, especially during something like the COVID19 pandemic. i would give the caveat, though, that if you aren't super good at STEM, don't put so much pressure\/emphasis on grades. I did that, and it ruined my enjoyment and excitement for what I was learning and turned the class into something I didn't love by the end of the semester. Just focus on learning something new, take pride in being bad at things, and credit\/d\/fail the class if you still find yourself super stressed!",
                "Yes, if you want a good introduction to computer science.",
                "Yes! The course is wonderfully clear and engaging.",
                "Yes!! It can take you from zero knowledge in CS to creating your own project. It feels like a boot camp most of the time, but it really does teach you a huge amount of content in a single semester.",
                "Yes. Excellent coding class to start from nothing. You get what you put in; if you manage the class well, it is an excellent opportunity to learn and become comfortable with coding.",
                "Yes. Just be mindful of how much work it takes. Would be better to take on a 4 credit semester than a >5 credit semester. Overall though, you come away with knowledge about how computing problems are solved.",
                "If you have the time, take it!",
                "Yes, for any major. But make sure to consider other classes carefully, as you have to spend a lot of time.",
                "Only if you are prepared to dedicate a great amount of time, focus, and effort to it, or if you have some computer science experience already.",
                "Yes! Although the workload was quite heavy, I learned so much from this course and really enjoyed it.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants a strong foundation in basic programming. It teaches you an introduction to a lot of languages.",
                "yes! such a rewarding course even though it's challenging. you learn so many different coding languages and solve fun problem sets that are applicable to real-life problems. influenced me to pursue CS.",
                "Absolutely! Incredible introduction to computer science!",
                "Good way to find out whether you are interested in CS or not.",
                "Yes, this is a great way to get introduced into the world of CS.",
                "Yes! Amazing introduction to computer science.",
                "yes!! it gives you a broad overview of CS and is very valuable in understanding basic computational concepts",
                "Yes definitely. If you are interested in cs, take this class.",
                "Yes, good foundations.",
                "Yes! This is a great introduction into the world of programming!",
                "Yes. The broad scope of the material covered in class is a perfect introduction to further computer science study. The PSETS and final project allow to use your newfound CS skills to solve relevant, real-world problems. Although hard, these assignments are incredibly fulfilling once you complete them.",
                "This course is a very good overview of comp sci principles and applications.",
                "Would highly recommend this course because this course helps you get started with many programming languages and has fun problem sets to complete in the process. While psets may take some time, they help students progress with their knowledge and open the door to many new things that the student can create on their own.",
                "Great course to get exposure to a lot of concepts in CS! It's fast-paced and might feel rather shallow at times, but it's worth it and you get a lot out of it by the end.",
                "Yes, this is an excellent introduction to coding\/programming. The psets and examples were drawn upon familiar events and concepts. Prof. Malan at Harvard is a fantastic lecturer, and the Yale TFs were very enthusiastic and dedicated. The workload may be overwhelming at times, but very rewarding once finished. It is best to start assignments early.",
                "I would recommend the course to another student. Even though I had no previous programming experience, I still found the class really fun. You learn many useful languages and there is ample help if you need it along the way.",
                "Yes, for anyone interested in computer science. It is a great introductory course and the problem sets are fun, but challenging. The work load is pretty high, though, so keep that in mind.",
                "I would recommend this course to every student. It offers an opportunity to learn about coding and computers, which are two influential forces in today's technology-driven society. It is a challenge, and will take up most of your time, but with hard work students can push through.",
                "Yes, I would. I think that a basic understanding of computer programming will be required in the future in order to stay competitive in the marketplace. I believe that this course should be a requirement for all undergraduate students.",
                "YES! It is a lot of work though, but you will learn a lot.",
                "Yes, it was amazing class in which students learn a massive amount about the subject.",
                "Yes! I definitely recommend this over the other introduction to computer science classes offered at Yale. CPSC 112 is notoriously badly taught (trust me I took the course before taking this course... I learned a lot more in 3 weeks of CS50 than a whole semester of 112) and CPSC 201 (which you should only take if you're going for the major. You don't particularly learn anything special in the class). \r\n\r\nThis class has a \"lot\" of work, but honestly, it really depends on the person. If you have some CS background, the psets shouldn't be too bad. If you're going in green, then it will take some time to develop some intuition on how to code, best coding practicing, and debugging techniques, but just push through! You'll definitely learn a lot. Also, how people do in the class really depends on how much CS exposure you get while taking the class, so definitely take some time to think about ways to optimize your code.",
                "Definitely. I think they just need to be warned about the workload.",
                "Yes, highly recommended!",
                "Yes, it's not as hard as a lot of first-years make it out to be (I took this as a junior) and you genuinely do learn a ton; I just think it's a lot harder than the average first-year course but maybe more on par with the average upperclassmen course.  Regardless though, it definitely isn't a gut.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. The course provides a strong foundation in programming for future classes and endeavors. It also serves as a great way of learning Python and C for application in fields outside of computer science.",
                "I recommend it credit\/d\/fail",
                "Certainly. You learn valuable knowledge of what coding and computers are very quickly, alongside other skills which are acquired through the hard work and persistence required to succeed in the course.",
                "If you really have to take an intro CS course, this is probably a good course to take--at least, it's better than CS112, the other intro course offered at Yale, from what I've heard. This course has really great lectures and an engaging professor + Brian is freakin phenomenal. Be prepared for the really high workload. Not sure why discussion sections are 2 hours long and that lectures are 3 hours long and PSETs often take 10 hours a week for me on top of working on labs which sometimes took me 2 hours per week in the beginning of the semester, when we didn't finish them in class. Plus, there's a weekly quiz that often took an hour because I got counted down if I didn't write down verbatim what the professor said--so I had to rewind the video multiple times. Best of luck to whomever is reading this review.\r\n\r\nFor weekly section:\r\nI don't think anyone learned anything in section, because we'd all come to the lab and not have any clue how to proceed, waiting for answers from the TA. Some people straight up left during section, sometimes for periods of 30 minutes and only came back in the last 15 minutes when the answers were being done by the TAs. The TAs often went over material we didn't cover in lecture and that we didn't need to know. \r\n\r\nFor weekly labs:\r\nLabs didn't really teach me anything new and rather just provided code that I could look at for the PSET (but I heard in previous years, we worked on the PSET in lab, so that would make a lot more sense). \r\n\r\nFor weekly quizzes:\r\nI didn't feel like quizzes reinforced or taught anything. There were a few times where I got marked down on quizzes, and I'd message my TA only for my TA to respond \"Oh, that's weird that I marked you down for that. You're fine. But I can't change the grades. You're doing okay in the class though so don't worry about it.\" Quizzes also took about an hour or so since the times when I didn't write down verbatim what the professor said in class, I'd get marked down, so I often had to rewatch lectures for the exact wording. Sometimes, I'd still get marked down.\r\n\r\nOverall workload:\r\nNot sure why discussion sections are 2 hours long and that lectures are 3 hours long and PSETs often take 10 hours a week for me on top of working on labs which sometimes took me 2 hours per week in the beginning of the semester, when we didn't finish them in class. \r\n\r\nFor the test:\r\nThe test doesn't make sense to me either. \r\nTests are supposed to test how well you learned the material. Their goal, by having a test that covers material we didn't cover in class, is to \"test how well you learned how to teach yourself\" but they never taught you how to teach yourself--they just made PSETs really difficult so you either had to rely on your smart friends, go to office hours and pray your TA helps, or slog through hours of websites that don't really make sense because the only advice you get during lecture is \"just google things and find the answer\" as the only method of teaching yourself.\r\n\r\nAlso, on both the quizzes and tests, the questions always say \"use three sentences\" but whenever I use three sentences I get a 0 because I didn't cover the 5 things they wanted me to cover, and then I see other people writing 3 page essays and getting full credit because they regurgitated everything in the course. Not sure what the staff is going for with \"only use three sentences\"--are they trying to penalize people who follow directions?\r\n\r\nFor the project:\r\nThis was what I expected for the most part I guess, but our TA kept saying \"you should do more\" when, like. Buddy. It's finals period. There's a pandemic. I have better things to be worrying about than trying to add yet another feature to something like letting someone download an image. Being forced to make a video about our project and write peer feedback for every project we saw during discussion section was truly rubbing salt on the wound for an already high-workload course. \r\n\r\nI wish I were exaggerating on the workload.... th",
