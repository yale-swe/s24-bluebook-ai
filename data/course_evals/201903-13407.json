   "comments": [
    "I learned the formula for writing research papers. I learned how to use the resources of the library and of the Stacks. I learned more about the philosophical debate of authenticity.",
    "This course provided an interesting new take on the concept of Authenticity, specifically as we deconstructed and recontextualized the term. Although the papers were sometimes difficult, my writing skills improved greatly and I can now say that I'm much more confident to take challenging writing credits in the future.",
    "I am a better writer, and I grasp the concept of authenticity on a deeper level. I feel like a gained a different perspective to look at art specifically that I really am grateful for.",
    "I learned how to efficiently write a college-style essay, how to utilize Yale's research database, and identify and formulate problems and answers to these problems.",
    "Improved my writing skills and they say I say writing style",
    "I learned how to better organize my writing so that I had both a strong and well-supported claim.",
    "How to write academic English essay"

   "question_id": "YC403-YCWR",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: usually interesting topics, passionate teacher, teacher was always willing to meet\r\nWeaknesses: readings were often very long and boring, the class activities could have been varied more, paper assignments were often unclear and ambiguous",
    "This course will force you to re-evaluate how you construct arguments when writing papers, which was definitely helpful in terms of improving my writing. We also read a number of very interesting texts, which I often turned to for support in making a claim about the nature of authenticity. This course is very discussion heavy, and sometimes our class discussions felt rather forced, so this is a potential area for improvement.",
    "Strengths: high engagement and good flow between the texts we have have read. Specifically, reading Berger's Ways of Knowing at the beginning provides a very robust foundation for the course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: possibly workload. But I also do acknowledge that without writing as much as we did I might no have improved as much as I did.",
    "Strengths: diverse and interesting set of readings, interesting topic, well-structured to smoothly transition student into college-style writing through progressively more complex essay assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: unit structure could have been improved by reserving it: instead of focusing on a specific type of authenticity and then later on expanding it to a wide range of how the authenticity conversation manifests itself, the course could be started out with that same range to give students an idea of the scope and give it more personal meaning.",
    "Analyzing texts were a weakness",
    "The readings are extremely interesting and well-selected--so much so that I didn't miss a single reading. I found the class topic, the myth of authenticity, super relevant and it even influenced the way I saw my other classes. The class discussions are also very productive because Max is very good at leading the conversation so we didn't continue circling the same idea.",
    "It was very engaging and Max was very supportive and helpful. He gave me a lot of constructive advice and suggestions."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "No I would not. Unless they are very passionate about the topic, I would tell them to take another English 114 because they will have a better learning experience. I felt that the professor's expectations of us students were often ridiculous and I would meet with him about my paper and he would tell me to include a certain thing in my paper. When I would get my comments back on my paper, he would take off points for the part that he told me to add. Also, he is way more passionate about the topic than his students are, and so he expects everyone to be on the same level as him when thinking about this topic. He doesn't realize that we have never studied this topic before and aren't as quick to understanding analysis as he is.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course if you are looking to take a writing seminar and bring your writing to a college level. Although the papers can be quite a bit of work, at the end of the day I took a lot away from our discussions about the nature of authenticity. I will probably never be able to use the word 'authenticity' without thinking about it ever again.",
    "Yes. This is a very interesting course. While I am not particularly interested in the arts, the course's focus on the concept of authenticity, a term so widely used and misunderstood, really made it interesting for everyone.",
    "I would, as the topic itself is fascinating, but I would caution that sometimes the teaching style would complicate and confuse rather than simplify and that made the course more frustrating than it had to be.",
    "Yes because it improved my writing ability",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend taking this course! Max has high expectations--which can be a little stressful--but it's super worth it in the end because your writing will improve so much. I am sure that everything I've learned in this class will help me in all my future classes.",
    "I would recommend this course for the interesting reading selection and discussions. However, the lack of clear articulation by Max on what he wanted from our writing made the challenges of the course less productive than debilitating. (Reference question 13 for more elaboration)",
    "Yes! Other than the writing skills that every other ENGL114 class would cover, this class covers a lot of critical thinking about authenticity in every aspect of life."
