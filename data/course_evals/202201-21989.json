                "Wow. I learned LIFE skills. This is single-handedly the most transformative class I have taken. Ever. Being one of the few first-years amidst mostly upperclassmen, I was not only able to learn about different beliefs informed from different personal experience,  but I was also able to gain life advice on selecting courses, what 'really matters,' and why (and how to) be authentic. This course was such a grounding experience, where I felt free to exist in the way I've always wanted and engage with the texts and other students in a manner that is both critical and approving (but always respectful). Everything about this class felt safe, like a warm hug when you need it the most. Seeing other students with such reverence for the texts, ideas, or even your own contributions fills one's heart. Many texts difficult to interpret and cultures unfamiliar to us, it felt like we were all on a journey together toward enlightened understanding.",
                "Got a really good intro to different philosophies and religions and their respective ideas of what make a \"life worth living\"",
                "I learned a lot about myself and my goals in life, which should be important to any college student.",
                "Amazing learning the different view points from different religions and different speakers",
                "I learned about different religious and philosophical explanations of life and happiness, and how to think about my own happiness.",
                "A general overview of many traditions and their perspectives of a life worth living. But also a new way of thinking about how to approach life and the choices you make to live your version of a life worth living."

                "The primary strength of this course is the diversity of students it attracts; students of all ages, majors, backgrounds, religions, and beliefs. This makes for vibrant classroom discussion, and I don't think a single day passed where our own beliefs weren't challenged in a way we were incredibly grateful for. I appreciated how the plenary lectures were recorded so we could watch at our leisure. I wish more first-years knew about this class and felt empowered to take it; it has wonderful thematic elements that seem to cater toward those at either the beginning or the end of their Yale journey. An improvement could be encouraging students to actually do the readings, watch the lectures, and think about the course questions beyond the classroom setting. Most students do take it seriously, but some students attended sporadically, which sometimes felt a bit disrespectful to the traditions we were studying. Another improvement is posting additional readings related to each unit so for those units that particularly appeal to us, we know where to look for more!",
                "Strengths: reasonable workload, excellent discussions, engaging paper topics \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "This class was really wonderful. It was well organized, very engaging, the discussions and readings and papers were interesting, and it was a really good discussion environment.",
                "I thought this course had a great layout and I loved the seminar setup so we could have discussions about complicated questions."

                "I would recommend this course to EVERYONE. The course questions, about how, why, and for whom we should live a good life, what a good life looks like, and what the role of suffering is in a good life are questions I believe people too often skip over in favor of external validation from productive/capitalistic sources. What is the source of life within? What is the wealth of knowledge in the world? These must be realized, which can only come through authentic self-reflection and intellectual exploration, and this course provides you the framework and time necessary.",
                "Absolutely this might be the best class I have taken at Yale",
                "It is such an interesting class and the stuff you discuss is relevant to anyone. I learned so much about myself and my goals.",
                "YES especially as a senior",
                "Yes definitely. I took this my senior year, which was the perfect time to take it and reflect on my experience at Yale and my plans for after Yale. It's a really wonderful engaging class that makes you think about what truly makes you happy.",
                "Yes, but mostly because it is nice meeting new people and hearing about their ideas of a life worth living. In terms of the readings we did, I feel neutral. As someone who is not religious, it can be difficult to read very religious texts, for example about Christianity, and then discuss it when it is not something I believe in."
