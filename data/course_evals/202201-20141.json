                "I got more experience in literature and film analysis.",
                "I had been searching for a course that justly reconciled the challenges of studying literature through history and history through literature. This course was an exemplary introduction to this challenge, and I feel so much more confident as a student of literature because of Prof. Jarvis' insistence that literature is at the heart of revolution and Algeria's anti-colonial legacy. This course definitely helped me learn how to formulate argumentswhether in our smaller weekly response papers or in our midterm\/final. And fittingly, Prof. Jarvis let us formulate an argument for our final project not necessarily limited to traditional academic prose--but rather through epistolaries, illustration, art, etc., following a similar model as the brilliant Algerian writers we read embraced."

                "The class was great in facilitating learning about this history that is not usually covered in regular classes. I think that all of the supplementary materials were relevant to the content in the course.",
                "STRENGTHS: such a passionate syllabus of novels, tracts, articles, speeches, and movies! and a passionate professor who brings us into the genesis and after-lives of these books and their historical context! Prof. Jarvis is an expert on all of these texts, adept at enhancing their instructive capacity with historical maps, complementary texts, and photography. Discussions were always fascinating, a helpful balance of closed reading and collaborative commentary. No weaknesses, just be prepared to do lots of reading! In this vein, sometimes I felt that, since the class meets only once a week, the weekly reading load was a bit too much. However, I believe making this course twice-per-week would helpfully lighten and scatter the load."

                "Yes, this course is great way to exercise your written and oral French skills while learning about groups that are historically neglected in French academia.",
                "I strongly recommend this course as it is one of the most unique yale course I have taken. I got to learn about the Algerian war, colonialism, and the aftereffects of war. The readings and movies we watched were all excellent and interesting. TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU CAN YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course because it's a low stakes class that encourages participation and casual French speaking without reprimand. Professor Jarvis is extremely kind and encouraging and clearly passionate about the content and her work. The workload is extremely high because of the reading level but you don't need to remember every detail, only points of interest and general themes. I wish I could have received more constructive feedback, although the positive feedback is encouraging. More structure in the content, clear timelines, would be helpful throughout the course.",
                "Absolutely. Such a foundational experience for any student of anti-colonial and\/or Francophone literature. Professor Jarvis treats this texts with justice and elegance--and they are so important to any understanding of Algerian history and French empire. (A revealing fact that some of Prof. Jarvis' assigned, ground-swelling books are no longer in print due to suppression.)"
