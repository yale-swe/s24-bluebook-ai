                "Strengths: Weekly subjects and their corresponding readings were so, so good. Class discussion was really insightful, and having both Rabbi Jason and Professor Shore to give their insights was so incredibly useful. Papers were super enjoyable and difficult, with really good feedback. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The readings were really hard sometimes, and this class was easily the most cerebral class I've ever taken at Yale, which was a terrific thing, it was just so much brainpower trying to conceptualize some of these things.",
                "Strengths: excellent reading materials, accomodating atmosphere for discussions, and insightful comments from the instructor.\r\nThis seminar has been phenomenal even though it is open for the first time, so there are no significant weaknesses I can tell really.",
                "I think the strength of the course was in its experimental and conversational nature -- it felt new, exciting, and interesting, like Prof. Shore and Rabbi Jason were figuring it out with us. I think formal pre-reqs would have been good (or some more background about some of the readings, which were pretty difficult).",
                "I really liked the joint teaching style of this class- Professor Shore and Rabbi Jason balance each other well and facilitate really great conversations. I also liked the readings and overarching themes we discussed week-to-week. I think in terms of improvement, maybe condensing the readings a bit would be good. All the readings are really interesting but also dense, so sometimes it was hard to feel like I had a handle on what was being said in all of them."

                "Yes! This was the first time they taught it and I can imagine it will be better moving forward if they decide to teach it again, with smoothing out the edges and all.",
                "Yes, especially to those who wish to learn more about the philosophical schools outside the mainstream analytical tradition.",
                "Yes -- but mainly if that student were interested in philosophy.",
                "I would recommend this course-it is really interesting and unique, and the co-teaching element was really special. However, at times a lot of the content was not given enough background to be fully understood by a lot of the class.",
                "Yes for sure - it's a low-pressure environment to explore some really interesting philosophical ideas, and both professors are great. They also take time to give very clear feedback about your writing, which is honestly so helpful."
