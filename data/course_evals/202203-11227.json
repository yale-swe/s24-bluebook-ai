The first half or so could be covered faster so more time could be spent on the topics we covered in the second half, which seemed harder to understand and more complicated to work with.",

                "Strengths: Yihong, especially for a lecturer in a STEM-based topic, is a more engaging lecturer than previous ones I've had. Also, ULA and TF support in this class is great.\r\nWeaknesses: Feels like there is an emphasis on learning to self-apply class-learned subjects in problem sets; couldn't imagine doing it not in office hours. Wondering if there could be, in addition to current examples in lecture, more examples worked out on the blackboard. The ones that were walked out by Yihong line-by-line I understood.",
                "The last four weeks of this class flew over my head and I was very dissatisfied with how the exam seemed to exclusively focus on this section of the course. Very frustrating",
                "Great lecture slides and very fair homework that furthered class lectures",
                "It felt like last 5-6 lectures contained content that needed much more time to be discussed. The final also felt like a significant step up from the midterm/psets. Personally, I did not find the lectures to be very helpful.",
                "Great amount of work and practice.",
                "very thorough",
                "I feel like I really struggled in this course and I am writing this worried that I am not going to pass because the final was terrible. I felt like every exam I went in thinking it would be okay and the real exam was 10x harder than the practice exams. I just felt like I could study for this final for 2 weeks 8 hours per day and still not feel prepared. I have other responsibilities and 4 other finals I needed to study for, maybe some people could afford to study that much but I could not. I went to office hours every week for this course and I still struggled. I attended every single lecture. I just feel like maybe I needed more examples and better examples for the final part of the course.",
                "I loved this course! Prof. Wu is a great professor, and he has a very clear and effective teaching style. Each lecture was filled with relevant and carefully chosen content, and the psets greatly helped me with better understanding the concepts learned in class.",
                "Weaknesses:\r\n- organization of the course... the office hours are hard to find. \r\n- the professor. yale needs to change him and bring alecturer instead.",
                "I think the course is excellent. You learn a great deal throughout the course, and Dr. Wu gives outstanding lectures and notes. The problem sets do not take up too much time at all and are very helpful to prepare for the tests. The exams can be a little tough because some questions require a lot of thought, but practice, specifically for the final, makes them significantly easier.",
                "the exams did not reflect average difficulty of homework",
                "The slides are really thorough and lectures are recorded, which makes learning very accessible. The exams, however, are worth a lot and high-stress, because there's not a lot of questions, so if you didn't figure out one part, it's a lot of points.",
                "Strengths: Slides are well-made and easy to review, Yihong is very knowledgeable and doesn't even really need his notes to teach\r\nWeaknesses: None that I can think of",
                "The lectures are awful and unengaging. The professor is monotone and goes over exactly what's on the slides without adding anything of use. The professor spends too much time on proofs or overly complicated examples instead of anything helpful on the problem sets or the exams.",
                "Strengths: consistent assignments and great peer tutors\r\nWeaknesses: professor yihong wu",
                "good enough but too hard to learn",
                "The main issue I had was understanding how to approach problems. It was difficult to get explanations (from the professor and from the TAs) for why we count certain probabilities in one way and not another, for example. I think having access to answers for textbook problems would have helped me understand the patterns for approaching problems. However, rather than memorizing patterns/ways to approach problems, I think there needs to be more assistance in understanding problem-solving techniques.",
                "The course and the lecture notes were quite comprehensive, which helped a lot during self-studying. I felt like taking two exams worth 70% of my grade was a lot of stress.",

                "Very interesting course, loved it.",
                "questions are hard",
                "Strength: The way that Professor Wu explains a terminology is easy to understand, and the examples are all helpful.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The final exam is too hard comparing with homeworks and practice finals, I think it would be better if the homework can become more harder so that we can get used to the difficulty.",
                "The examples given by the professors, for example the motel one and the election one, are very interesting and I like them so much. I think the professor really provide quality content that is thoughtfully prepared. I like this course.",
                "It is a very well-designed course",
                "The course is great in theory: a student learns all the initial tools they need to equip themselves with to undertake an S&DS major or certificate. Such a foundation is the most robust way to get started in the major. The overall strengths are:\r\n1. The PSETs: the PSETs strike a balance between challenging and manageable and are good fun to tackle\r\n2. The lecture powerpoint docs: Professor Wu's lecture powerpoints are incredibly clear and logical and are always, well connected to previous lectures, and provide incredibly helpful examples on a regular basis.\r\n2. The TFs: shoutout to Ashley Oaks! Office Hours were a lifesaver and were very well organised.\r\n3. Professor Wu: Professor Wu explains probability in an easy to grasp way, that is, if you can see or hear what he's doing which takes me to the crux of my frustration with the course:\r\n\r\nProf. Wu stated that the course is designed to be asynchrous, but in reality, good luck learning anything if you are not in person. That is because the recording set up Prof Wu uses is completely untenable. \r\n\r\nPlease, please, please use a clip on microphone so that when you move between the lectern and the blackboard, the microphone audio does not cut out. Secondly, please consider switching to a digital form of writing like an iPad in lecture or find a better way to fix the recording camera on the blackboard as currently, it's impossible to see Prof Wu's writing on the blackboard without it swinging back and forth due to it's automatic motion tracking setting. Even for people in lecture, the microphone and blackboard are pretty frustrating as it's really difficult to hear Prof. Wu if you are more than three rows back and impossible to see the blackboard from more than six rows back.\r\n\r\nSo here are the weaknesses:\r\n1. As stated, the lecture format: please use a clip on microphone and consider using an iPad for writing instead of the blackboard.\r\n2. The time of lecture: for such a theoretical course, a 9am time is brutal. Please consider delaying the class to 10:30.\r\n3. The ULAs: I had a pretty dissatisfactory experience with the ULAs who were hesitant to give out help and acted in a very cagey manner for fear of being punished for HELPING us which is their JOB. One even got upset with me for taking a photo of workings that we had written out together during an office hours meeting.\r\n4. The pace of the course: this is a minor gripe as I do believe that the course does an admirable job of fitting such a large body of material into one semester, but I felt a few topics were brushed over too quickly: (a) Convolution: it would have been helpful to spend more time on the topic of bounds; (b) Hypergeometric series: it was mentioned in passing but a shame that it wasn't given more attention; (c) Non-linear quantile transformation, especially of two random variables -- I was particularly frustrated by this as we covered the linear algebra behind two-to-two transformations (X,Y) to (U,V) but practiced zero examples either in lecture or in any PSET.\r\n\r\nOverall, the course was great and I really enjoyed the material when I felt that I wasn't drowning in it.",
                "Strengths: Clear lecture slides free of typos, reasonable and consistent psets, fair exams, great professor\r\nWeaknesses: none in particular",
                "Material was interesting and there was a lot of material available to facilitate learning and lay out the content! The lectures were pretty unengaging, though, and it was hard to tell which content was relevant. The professor did seem pretty unreachable, and there was no flexibility on deadlines, which sucked.",
                "Strength: lectures, course materials, and problem sets were clear\r\nWeaknesses: some concepts felt a little too niche and were only talked about in lecture, but not enough problem solving",
                "One weakness was the monotone nature of the class. Most of the lectures felt repetitive and ultimately pretty dry.",
                "NA",
                "Lectures felt unnecessary given the level of detail of the slides. The content was solid but could be taught slower (especially after the midterm) to ensure students are following.",
                "The problems were fun and useful, and there was a lot of TA office hours to offer help with problem sets or other questions. The lecture slides were clear and the lectures were recorded, which made reviewing the material very helpful. The textbook was also a great resource. Grading proportions were clear, but the grading algorithm/scale could have been explained.",
                "The professor was excellent and did a good job at keeping the class engaged. The midterm was very difficult for the content in the class",
                "Weaknesses: PLEASE TEACH THE MATERIAL. PLEASE. \r\nStrengths: youtube.com (Statistics 110 lectures from Harvard are an absolute godsend).",
                "na",
                "strength: broad topics covered. The hw and exam questions are not plugging in numbers with formula; rather, you need to think deep about the questions. \r\n\r\nweakness: the hw questions seem to be less relevant to lecture than exam questions. I think practicing more questions that are similar to midterm and final would improve our understanding of probability better.",
                "I feel like the first half was very manageable, but the last few weeks of lectures could've been slightly slower paced, as we covered a pretty large amount of material/formulas each day. It was still doable though and I think I did pretty well, but if it was a bit slower and covered a bit less at the end I feel like I would have gotten an even firmer grasp on the material in the second half of the course. Also, some of my favorite parts of lectures were the real world examples, like gambling and the hotel problem (which allowed us to experience the material in an interesting new way), so keep doing those!",
                "Strengths - PSETs can be easily completed by going to office hours and writing down what the peer tutors say. I got 100s on all the PSETs doing this, but didn't understand a single thing taught in this course.\r\nWeaknesses- Everything else. This course is too hard, PSETs are impossible to complete on your own, teaching is terrible, exams are too hard. Two thumbs down.",
                "I love this course",
                "Everything is defined very clearly in lectures and the problem sets are difficult but engaging. The tests can be difficult.",
                "Lectures are early, and often hard to follow there is a lot of material to cover, and I didnt realize how mathematically founded and proof based the course would be",
                "The lecture slides were helpful, and the content was organized in a way that makes sense. I would prefer more problems on the p-sets, or perhaps more smaller problems plus some bigger problems. Sometimes, I felt that I did not get enough practice with the concepts just through the lectures and p-sets.",
                "Strengths: a rigorous introduction to probability where Professor Wu gives the proof and motivation for every new concept and equation. The class is very well structured: lectures are engaging, lecture slides and the textbook are highly usable, and the weekly psets are fair and reasonable. Weaknesses: students with less experience in probability and less intuition ability have a slight disadvantage at the start and for the midterm. However, once we start learning about continuous variables, most people were now on the same page.",
                "Strengths: the TFs and ULAs, posting the slides, recordings, posting past exams and their answer key\r\nWeaknesses: The combination of the lectures being quite boring and them being at 9am had me sleeping almost every lecture I went to in person. Sometimes felt like there was a big jump between an example in class that the professor went over and what we had for homework. Also, coming in with no stats background was a little bit rough because I feel like there wasn't that much intuition for what we were doing in class."

                "I would recommend this course to any student who have the prerequisites. Probability Theory is an important part of Statistics and is applicable in many different situations and industries.",
                "If you need it for your major, don't dread it.  It's a solid course that will teach you a lot.  It's challenging, but it's not too difficult to handle.  If you are seeking the certificate, I don't think this is a bad choice to satisfy the requirement it falls under.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in going into a quantitative field, but don't need this for your major, I would still take it.  It's good preparation for hedge fund or quant interviews.  You need a solid understanding of probability and statistics, and this course will give you the foundations and then some.\r\n\r\nIf you are not applying for hedge funds or quant firms and are not seeking the major or certificate, I don't really see the point in taking the class.  It's boring and kinda hard.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, if you're interested in probability. It is very different from the lower numbered statistics courses, though, and is taught much more like a math class.",
                "I would recommend this course to those who already have a strong background in probability or competition math.",
                "Yes, I'd take it. Well-taught math/stats class, feels really gratifying to have learned and applied the material. Hard to study for exams, I felt, but the problem sets made me feel capable of modeling and solving some really interesting problems in terms of random variables.",
                "Only if it is required for your major. I would be hard pressed to recommend this course to my friends who might be looking for a comprehensive introductory course in statistics.",
                "Absolutely, great course especially to build a foundation for quant and understanding foundational statistics",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if they are required to take it or have a strong interest in the topic.",
                "Yes, great introduction into quite theoretical probability.",
                "If you need to take it, you need to take it, but it wont really help with anything else - I learned less in this class than pretty much any other relative to the amount of effort.",
                "It's a fine class",
                "No, content wise I thought it was interesting but it is so challenging it isn't worth it. I hope to god I passed",
                "Yes, I'd highly recommend this course to other students. Prof. Wu is a great professor, and he has a very clear and effective teaching style. Each lecture was filled with relevant and carefully chosen content, and the psets greatly helped me with better understanding the concepts learned in class.",
                "I would if it is required for his major.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I think it may be useful to have some background in probability prior to entering the course because it starts out a little fast. I think the computations were very satisfying, and I learned a lot throughout the semester. The lecture notes are outstanding, and the problem sets were informative and enjoyable. The midterm had a fairly difficult question, but I think the overall nature of the course is fair.",
                "would not recommend",
                "It touches on really interesting topics that I have not thought much about before. Definitely challenging though, so not unless you really want to learn it or if you are really good at math already.",
                "Yes. Teaches you how to think. Yihong makes it hard but its worth it",
                "No, please take 238",
                "Yes, this is a well-organized course and a solid introduction to probability theory. If you already have some background in probability theory, you would probably still benefit from this course.",
                "For S&DS majors, I highly recommend you take this class, credit/d/fail it, and then take S&DS238 for the major requirement. You need this class for other classes in the major, but honestly, you will probably not do well in this class. Yihong does not explain concepts well at all and seems like he does not want to be teaching the class at all. The exams are EXTREMELY difficult (especially the final). Also, the course director will not share anything about the grading curve so you basically have no idea what your grade is the entire semester.",
                "Yes I would recommend it",
                "For S&DS majors, this is an important class. You can swap it with 238, but this class is more math-focused, giving you an exposure to proof-based logic and combinatorics; if you feel like you need more practice with math logic, then take this class. It might help to have taken discrete beforehand.",
                "I would, as it is integral for taking some more advanced courses, and some of the topics covered are quite interesting.",
                "Yes. The course is fundamental for statistical learning.",
                "Definitely, from the perspective of a math major this was a relatively easy course that taught lots of interesting probability concepts that I hadn't formally studied before. Absolutely recommend.",
                "No. too hard",
                "Yes, it has all the basic knowledges regarding statistics.",
                "I would definitely recommend it. For a student who does not major in mathematics or If he or she hasnt taken probability in undergrad, this course provide a very comprehensive and clear introduction to basic probability theory. The content is insightful and makes you want to learn more but is not too challenging. I think its definitely very helpful.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to another student only on the condition that Professor Wu changes his recording format, because as a 9am class, it's inevitable you will miss a couple of lectures in person over the semester, and even if you don't you'll still need to revisit the recordings to cement your understanding.\r\nSo, on the condition that Prof Wu (a) uses a clip on microphone, and (b) fixes a camera onto the blackboard so that it is not always swinging around or more preferably, switch to the use of an iPad for mid-lecture annotations, I would definitely recommend the class.\r\nA few things to be wary of:\r\n1. You will definitely need to invest a few hours a week in addition to PSETs going over lecture recordings and/or attending office hours. \r\n2. You should be incredibly prepared for exams, and make sure to do as many practice questions from the textbooks.\r\n3. Get to know Professor Wu, he's even better up close than in lecture!\r\n4. USE THE TFs. They will save your life and turn probability theory from something terrifying and overwhelming into something elegant and beautiful.",
                "For a rigorous background in probability",
                "Definitely- the material is extremely useful and quite interesting.",
                "If you have to take it for the major, then take it, accept that it won't be amazing, and try to enjoy the material for the material! If you can take another class, like 240, do so.",
                "I would recommend if they are interested in probability theory",
                "If you like pure math and are interested in probability, sure. It will end up being a lot of computation, calculus, and complicated formulas. Only the first couple weeks of the class do you learn how to reason about probability (independence, inclusion-exclusion, etc.), and afterwards, it becomes just an exercise of applying various formulas to various distributions.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, if it is required for their major or they would like a theoretical treatment of statistics and probability.",
                "Yes, if you want to give a little extra time to become really comfortable with probability! The concepts are challenging to grasp at first, but after a while they will become very intuitive; the class provides a lot of useful resources.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in probability theory.",
                "Yes, solid class and learn a lot.",
                "Yea! It's a great course to further learning on stas and coding",
                "I actually find probability really interesting. That being said, Yihong clearly doesn't, so proceed with caution.",
                "yes. \r\nThe lecture, though the content was hard, was clear and examples were easy to understand",
                "yes. It is an important course to get a foundation of probability theory. Even though some topics can be hard, all of them are helpful.",
                "Yes, the course was well organized.",
                "It wasn't the most fun class I've taken (not to say it was boring), but I definitely learned the material thoroughly at a high level, so I'd recommend it.",
                "No, not even to my own worst enemy. I wish I didn't take this class. Like that one scene in Interstellar (spoiler), I wish I could go back in time at myself signing up for this class and yell, \"No! No! No!\" Yihong's lectures are also like watching paint dry, although that may be an insult to the intricacies of drying paint.",
                "Yes",
                "Highly recommend, you learn a lot about probability (of course) but also about problem solving",
                "This can be a difficult course but will develop a fundamental understanding of probability. The material is presented clearly.",
                "Im not sure. I would make sure they know there is a lot of theory and that it combines math concepts from multiple difficult areas",
                "I think I would. I think this is an interesting introduction to probability and statistics. I just wish we had more practice with the content.",
                "yes",
                "If you have to take it, it was hard to learn from lecture, but it's one class and there isn't really an equivalent.",
                "Absolutely! Every concept is introduced with proof and motivation, and you don't just apply concepts without understanding where they came from or why it works. Professor Wu has made a very well-structured course. He is always attentive to questions during lectures, and at the beginning of classes, he often goes to the blackboard to review some important ideas from the previous lecture. I will make this course a basis for comparison with any other stats course I take in the future.",
                "I took quite a heavy course load this semester so this class was a bit rough for me. I think if you are a math person and have a not-so-bad course load then you should be fine. The lectures are pretty boring, but they are all recorded and the professor posts the slides which was a big plus to the class.",
                "yes\r\nthe concepts are fundamental for understanding of higher level materials"
