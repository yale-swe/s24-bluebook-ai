Analyzed time travel from multiple points of view, especially a historical one as well as the typical sci-fi tropes. Many discussions on the loose definition of time travel. Also improved my researching ability and finding sources.",
                "Time travel is more than science fiction. It is a concept that draws from authenticity, whiteness, fiction, euro centricity, drama, race, etc. Truly a fascinating course that proved to me that a topic could be much more than what we initially think it means.",
                "Through our discussion of time travel, I learned a lot about how the past, present, and future are framed in the media and academic works. This course conducts a thorough study of concepts relating to historiography before looking at different historical fiction and science fiction works. This organization prepares you to critically examine different stories, movies, and TV shows. My writing improved throughout the course as I was able to practice writing different styles of academic papers.",
                "I became a better writer and am more able to recognize faults in my writing. I learned that time travel is more complex than I thought it was such as the different biases within time travel media not only towards race but modernity as well.",

                "Being an ENGL 114 seminar, this course allowed me to develop and grow my writing. From close reading to a research paper, I was able to see my writing improve through multiple drafts, feedback from fellow peers and the instructor, and incredible techniques taught in class.",
                "The course is interesting and the readings are pretty engaging. You receive a lot of help when drafting the papers which aids you in getting a good grade.",
                "A strength is that it taught me more analyzing time travel media for bias. It could be improved by having a stronger connection to time travel in the beginning of the course."

                "Yes. It is a good course to improve your writing at the start of college. You practice writing many different types of papers, are aided in the process, and get clear feedback. The workload is not very high compared to other classes and the topics covered are pretty interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in bias and how it can show up within different genres. Also a someone who wants to broaden the scope of what they think time travel is.",
