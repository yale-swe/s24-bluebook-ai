                "Professor Lenski was definitely a strength of the class. His lectures are informational and engaging, and he was very approachable.",
                "The course's readings were interesting for the most part, but some were difficult to approach. The lectures were very informative and served to piece together and simplify the overarching themes of the week's readings. Discussion section was exceptionally helpful in understanding the readings and diving into them on a deeper level.",
                "Many strengths, the only weakness is that the weekly section readings were far too long and unrealistic",
                "I thought the course was great because of the flexibility, lecture length, and the helpfulness of TFs. Not having to attend live lecture was something that I could always fall back on if Im super busy for a week. \r\n\r\nNoel is an amazing professor, super helpful, understanding, engaging, and informative. \r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the course and cant think of anything more that would improve it.",
                "The lectures were incredibly informative",
                "This course has a very strong breadth of material due to the lengthy time period covered. One thing I think could be improved is the way the disjoint between the chronological lectures and topical lectures are covered. Many of the topical lectures feel somewhat removed from the shifting narrative of Roman history, and I think doing more to note temporal changes in individual topic lectures (urban/rural divide, gender, cults) would make them feel more embedded in the overall narrative, albeit still out of order to some extent, of course. One other thing: I wish there was a bit more feedback given.",
                "Prof. Lenski has great expertise in Roman history and he's skilled at breaking down complex concepts. Lectures were entertaining and informative. Readings were also interesting, though we didn't always have the clearest evaluative framework for discussing the academic articles we read. Weekly FRQs reinforced the material at regular intervals and made studying for the midterm and final pretty easy.",
                "Strengths: dynamic lecturer, recorded lectures during pandemic made it possible for me take this class, good section leader. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: If possible, would have preferred the section size to have been lower.",
                "The biggest strength is the clarity of the class's syllabus and presentation. Prof. Lenski really knows his stuff  if you take this class and keep up, you will know a lot about the Roman Empire by the end. \r\n\r\nI also really liked Prof. Lenski's decision to uncouple the readings for sections (mainly primary sources) from the secondary sources and chronological material from the lectures. It allowed us to cover more ground, and to interact with the subject on multiple levels at once.\r\n\r\nI do question the pedagogical choice to have closed-book midterm and final exams for a remote lectureit felt like an unnecessary choice that disadvantaged students for maintaining academic integrity  though I can't deny that studying forced me to internalize a lot of the narrative history."

Overall it was a very interesting class, although some topics may have been less interesting than others. With only one paper over the course of the semester, and non-extensive readings, I'd recommend this as a humanities gut or as a general interest class.",
