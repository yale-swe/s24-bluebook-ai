                "I learned so much. i am so happy i took this course. i remember walking into the course and being unsure about like dancing with other people? contact improvisation? what even is that? But now, I don't want to stop dancing. I want to roll across the floor with batidos. I want to be a banana. I want to give people massages that activate their centers. This might sound crazy, but it's just a very freeing thing to have a space where you feel comfortable to dance, to learn through dance with others, to press the idiot button and let go but also to learn these various physical movements and skills and awarenesses. Although I think I didn't engage in the readings as much as I would have liked to, from the ones that I did, I did learn and see interesting notions of dance and democracy although I think the link between them sometimes felt elusively abstract or metaphorical rather than something we acted out actively in the course.",
                "I learned about the wonders of contact improvisation. The course definitely fulfilled the \"dance\" part that I was looking forward to. There were a lot of interesting workshops and movement experiments that I gained a lot from. However, I failed to gain any meaningful insight from the \"democracy\" portion of the course. Ninety percent of the time, the in-class discussions were meaningless. Ninety-five percent of the time, we did not devote a single minute to the week's readings.",
                "Thinking more deeply about myself and my life in community",
                "Most of all, in this course I learned how to be a practitioner of creating change. While many Yale courses provide multitudes of opportunities to learn about concepts such as democracy or liberation through text, they rarely provide the opportunity to put these principles into practice. In Dance and Democracy, students were provided the rare opportunity to explore intellectual concepts through various mediums, such as dance and activism.",
                "I developed knowledge about liberation movements, activism and communal healing techniques, and Contact improvisation.",
                "I learned a lot about how to participate in contact improvisation. I had no prior experience in this dance style but this class started off from the very basics to pretty advanced and intermediate dance moves throughout the semester.",
                "I learned about the history, practice, and creation of contact improvisation and related movement forms.   I also learned deeper histories of liberation movements, especially in South Africa and the US, as well as an array of contemporary thoughts on democratic formation, freedom, community, and change-making.  This course developed invaluable skills in communication forms I hadn't previously worked on, especially in movement/body dialogue and reflective writing.",
                "Through this course, I learned some basic principles of dancing contact improvisation (including an introduction to working with momentum, gravity, and groundedness. I gained knowledge about foundational performances of Contact Improvisation, skills in analysis of dance performance, and insights about how to develop improvisatory research. I also developed both concrete knowledge about as well as the skills to critically analyze connections between dance and social movement.s"

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Eryn's energy is delightful. She hopes to enact Freirien learning (breaking down student teacher boundary) and I think in many ways, she does. She dances with us and infuses the class with energy and provoking activities. She tries to be very aware of our own needs, pushes us to take care of ourselves, take breaks when we need it. The dancing is also just so fun. Like in what class do i get to just roll over the floor and my classmates. Make moving, active art and then engage with readings on democracy and try piecing them together while drawing on paper in conversation with my classmates. every week i had something new that I was excited about that I wanted to share, and the physical movement of the class made me feel energized and expansive. I loved everyone in the class and although we didn't become besties I think that the environment was in general really amazing and supportive and everyone was just so cool.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Grades. I think that grades definitely got students stressed and I think the timing of assignments was confusing. I think there was ambiguity on how long you should work on assignments, when you should work on assignments, and what we hoped to get out of them. I think that students' preocupation with grades coupled sometimes with unclear directions or just the general open-ended nature of the course made the environment strained. I think that in general, ironically, students who cared more about their grades struggled more because they weren't acting out of true curiosity or care. Eryn doesn't care if your sentences in your reflection are perfect, but she does want to push you and question you in ways that I think Yale teachers don't normally. She wants you to think and care and actively take control of your learning, enact in Freirien learning. I think that's difficult tho because true freirien learning requires a lot of energy and independence and agency that most yale students don't have the time/energy/desire to enact. it's great in theory but in practice when there's this external notion of a grade, it's hard for students to fully engage in that. I think in general tho, the class was still realyl amazing and all students brought unique perspectives, care, and passion to the table in ways that never failed to amaze or inspire me.",
                "Only the \"movement\" part of the course was worthwhile. Contact improvisation is an interesting \"sports-art\" and I am glad to have gained exposure to it. However, anything else that did not have to do with movement was absolutely worthless. The weekly readings, while overwhelmingly abundant, contributed very little to the design of the course. The only thing more pointless than the weekly readings were the in-class \"discussions.\" Their ridiculousness is hard to describe, but I will try. Our discussions mostly involved us sitting on the floor, doodling on a large piece of paper, and having a meaningless conversation. There are never any guiding questions or bigger goals we are supposed to build towards. We just sit there, chat, while trying to ignore our aching back pains from sitting on the floor. \r\n\r\nHow can the course be improved? Just rid of the useless \"discussion\" portion of the class. Make it a two-hour, movement-only course. Assign only CI-related readings. All of my qualms with the course can be solved if the instructor stops trying to make the course more than it is by tacking on \"democracy\" as if she feels the need to justify the course's existence.",
                "It could tie more strongly readings with movement exercises",
                "The highlight of this course would be how focused it is on individual growth and development. Eryn is a very supportive instructor and pushes every student to be the best they can be. The course content can be molded to the interests of every student, which also makes the topic and class discussions very engaging.",
                "This course always felt like there wasnt enough time to do everything in the agenda. It seemed like 3 hours for a course would be a lot, but they went by so quickly. So a strength is how engaging and interesting the course material and exercises were. But a weakness is the time, if anything the course should be extended another hour per meeting!",
                "This course offers students a rare opportunity to engage our entire bodies (including our hearts) in intellectual and social-justice oriented engagement with deeply important issues. I really cherished the chance to move and dance each week, and to consider the role of movement in social transformation. This course draws on a wonderfully broad range of readings/sources, and is both interdisciplinary and transnational."

                "depends on the student. Don't take the course if you want an easy grade because that's not going to happen. don't take the course if you're not willing to healthily push past your comfort zones, to dance and try and learn and engage with others. but if you want to, DO IT! I really hope that Eryn teaches more classes at Yale because her energy is genuinely transformational and such a breath of fresh air compared to a lot of Yale classes. I think one thing tho is that maybe students coming into the class should be more honest about their learning objectives to themselves. like what do you actually want to do? are your dreams big enough? are you actually going to want to work towards that? the dancing is so fun and refreshing and so many times in the class, I felt like a kid again, connected to my body and self in a way I can't often tap into. it was also wonderful dancing with others. awkward at moments but the awkwardness passes and you learn to really listen to their body to create with them and it's really amazing and fun and powerful.",
                "You should ONLY take this class if you're ok with taking an \"experimental\" class. I previously thought I knew what that meant. After taking this class, I realize I do not. An \"experimental\" class apparently means that it's a half-thought-out, uncoordinated, and unproductive class that the instructor has unlimited excuses for because it's \"experimental.\" It's frustrating because the class has so much potential if its scope can be limited to just \"movement.\" Instead, it tries too hard to teach meaningful lessons on \"democracy\" that the instructor is underqualified to lead. The democracy-related readings are pointless and the discussions are unintellectual. As fun as the \"movement\" half of the course is, it is not worth the hassle of the other pointless burdens of the course.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the grading for the class is beyond sensical. Unless you're a student that enjoys having \"Why?\" lightly scribbled on your essays in pencil, you'll agree with me. Whatever feedback you receive is pretty inapplicable to your future works. The best decision I made was Credit/D/Fail-ing this class. Getting an A on any assignment is pretty impossible and any questions about your grade are answered with, \"This class is meant to be a dialogue, not transactional.\" If that statement frustrates you as much as it frustrates me, this class is not for you.",
                "1000% \r\nthis class will teach you about yourself, your friends, and society in a completely new way. This class will help you become a more grounded person. This class will teach about trust and support. This class will challenge you, pushing you to stretch your brain in new ways.  This class will engage your bodyboth in dance and in a practical manifestation of readings and coursework. This class is an opportunity to engage in social justice and art. This class is truly one of the most special and groundbreaking I have taken in my 4 years at Yale.",
                "Yes, very interesting and conducive to growth",
                "Yes. The course in its content and in the class dynamic, pushes you in the ways you think about democracy, activism, and liberation. It was a breath of fresh air to be creative in approaching the pressing political and social issues of today, and being able to connect them directly with movement.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot for class discussions and exercises and the thoughtfully curated readings. I appreciated that we got an opportunity to apply our learnings every class and take them to another level in projects. I absolutely loved the community I found in this class. It was stimulating, supportive, and conducive to healing. Even if the student is not interested in dance, democracy, or activism, I would still suggest they take this class because it is very easy to intertwine their diverse interests to the class's material. I liked that this class went beyond theory and allowed for action and implementation.",
                "yes it is not a class it is a blessing",
                "You must definitely take this course if youre trying to step out of your comfort zone! This class revolutionized the way I think about the world, my communities, and my relationship with myself. Dance studies as a framework was taught so well in this course as an introduction but also provides a deep dive into these studies.",
                "Yes!!! I hope that the professor, Eryn, is able to teach this course or something similar again, as it is both a unique opportunity for this type of blended movement-lab course, and because I think there are so many students whose interests align with the material and could stand to learn so much from a syllabus like this.  I also learned a lot from the incredible group of peers who were taking it, because I think it's a class format that really fosters community and meaningful creative &  intellectual contribution.  Other classes wish they could create what this one did.",
