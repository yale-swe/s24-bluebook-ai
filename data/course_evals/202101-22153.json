The freedom to work on what you are passionate about and in whatever style feels best is a real privilege. While some of the screenings are helpful, others did not feel very relevant to any of our projects and were a big-time commitment. However, the screenings directed towards our own projects and the screenings of other students' work were invaluable.",
