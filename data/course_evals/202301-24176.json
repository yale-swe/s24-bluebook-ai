                "I took the class for the boundary work and history of deconstruction elements that we started with. That was so exciting and promising! But when we started focusing so much on demonology and things like that, I got a little less interested since it's not really what I'm focusing on. Perhaps the syllabus changed at some point? Or I didn't look closely enough! \r\nOne of the strengths and weaknesses of the course was also its broad scope. When it came time to write the final paper, I didn't really know what to focus on! But it was also really cool to think everything was possible. We never really defined enchantment, either-- but maybe that's completely fine and even an interesting point that the course made. More than any other course though, we came to almost no conclusions! Whether that's good or bad I'm not sure!",
                "I had trouble following some of the discussions, in part because everybody was coming from a different field\/area\/time period. I think it would have helped if everybody could give more context and background information on the things they're saying.",
                "I really loved the majority of this courseI just wish we had it more often because it was so interesting! I also would hav loved to look at a few more primary sources!",
                "Professor Zadeh is an excellent facilitator of discussion and great professor to work with. The materials are well selected, and even the readings for the course that initially struck me as not directly related to my research interests ended being very fruitful for framing my thinking later on in the course. I think perhaps adding some of the readings that came at the very end of the course more in the middle of the semester would be beneficial; I would have liked to engaged with some of the materials on disenchantment, for example, more heavily than I was able to given the time in the semester when we got to them.",
                "Sometimes the readings were so vast and broadranging with such intense detail that it was overwhelming to keep track of it all, but the Professor had made it clear that we could discuss them at a high level which was helpful."
