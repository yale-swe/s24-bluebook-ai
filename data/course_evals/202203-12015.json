Linguameetings were helpful and increased my confidence in my speaking skills. \r\nWeaknesses: Lots of work, grading can be a little harsh, exams usually had too much on them for the allotted time. I felt as if I learned a lot this semester but I'm not sure that my grade really reflects that (personally think language credits shouldn't be about letter grades). Moves relatively quickly.",

                "This course was pretty fast-paced (faster than L1 if you took that during another semester) and the exams tested a lot of material at once that made studying for them or doing well on them slightly harder than L1. The course uses Linguameetings which was very helpful in forcing people to speak Spanish."
