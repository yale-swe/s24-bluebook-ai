                "We were taught about Chekov's ball, stick, veil approach which I had never used before. It was a fascinating way to get into a character physically. Of course we also had fantastic individual instruction on our songs in each unit.",
                "This class really helped me grow as a performer! Our exercises helped me present myself more confidently, and I had the opportunity to explore a lot of repertoire outside of my comfort zone. I feel that I've learned how to more compellingly tell a story, inhabit a character, and intuitively connect with musical motifs.",

                "Strengths: very small class size, lots of interaction. Everyone had equal time to work through their pieces and receive feedback. We were able to go really in-depth into our pieces and explore our characters from a variety of angles. It was great being able to witness other students' work; the class had a lot of great variety in vocal styles and repertoire choices.",
                "I really enjoyed the time we spent workshopping songs and doing acting exercises, though I think it might have helped me feel like I had a more organized takeaway from this course if we had talked a bit more about actual technique and then gotten the chance to try to apply it in our workshopped performances, rather than largely starting from scratch with each new song."

                "Definitely! Regardless of what your own performance experience is, this class will help you grow and you'll have a very rewarding semester. The environment is both very encouraging and structured to push everyone beyond their pre-conceived notions of what their limits are. Beyond the performances themselves, the papers we had after each unit provided a new intellectual lens with which to view the music.",
                "I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's interested in improving their ability to perform a songyou get lots of practical experience and tools, as well as insight into the industry from Professor Oliveras."
