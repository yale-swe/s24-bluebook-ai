                "This course taught me how to digest academic articles and synthesize information more adeptly.",
                "I learned significantly more about AIDS, both scientifically, through our examinations of the virus's structure and manifestations in the body; and historically, as we explored the past and present impacts of the virus around the world.",
                "I learned a lot in this course about understanding the HIV/AIDS epidemic holistically and with empathy.",
                "I learned about the history of HIV and the science behind producing HIV drugs. It was extremely insightful as I learned about how the public health system was drastically altered as a result of HIV activists gathering together to protest against the stigma set upon them by major government officials and how HIV is treated by other countries. We reviewed HIV activism and public health through time from the first recorded case to current times, and the class offered a lot of new perspectives with numerous guest speakers. The course focuses more on public health than necessarily on science, but we do read many science papers from journals and learn about basic virology.",
                "I learned the present impact of the HIV pandemic and the causes of said pandemic. I also learned important skills in scientific research such as how to read a research paper effectively.",
                "I learned about HIV around the world.",
                "The course taught me how to effectively read and glean information from scientific articles and think critically about the science and politics of disease.",
                "Great knowledge on the history of HIV/AIDS. The class was less focused on science and more focused on politics, but still lots of info and resources on the science."

                "The course provided a lot of opportunities for collaboration and class discussion. \r\nIt might be helpful to have one early section devoted to learning how to read a scientific paper and find academic sources using Yales Library system.",
                "This course was very community-oriented and focused on a breadth of issues related to HIV/AIDS, which I thought was excellent.",
                "Strength: the guest speakers and the professor himself, who allowed us to freely discuss the papers at hand and did a great job guiding us through the history of HIV with his news reporting experience\r\nWeakness: none",
                "I loved the multiple guests that were brought in that were in close contact with the HIV pandemic over its lifespan. I also enjoyed the discussions in each class which allowed me to get multiple perspectives and insights from my classmates. I would have loved to have more group assignments in the class.",
                "I loved this class!",
                "Strength is that Prof Bazell is so caring, understanding, and passionate about the work. We also meet unbelievable figures from HIV history. You will struggle to find a better expert on the science and politics of HIV as Prof was on the frontlines as a journalist throughout the epidemic. Weakness is that assignments can seem too open ended and hard to ensure that youre doing what Prof has in mind.",
                "Sometimes class got very redundant and it felt like new information was only learned from the readings.",
                "Guest speakers were incredible and a major strength. Classes without guests were mostly student-led discussions which were productive and insightful but occasionally felt limiting as some major topics were never brought up in class."

                "Yes, it's worth it for the Professor Bazell experience! You'll get to engage with incredible guests who are famous for their work with AIDS and will gain a really solid overview of the impacts of AIDS. I will say that if you come into this course knowing a lot about the AIDS epidemic, you won't learn a ton of new content. With that said, I recommend this course wholeheartedly, especially for humanities-oriented first-years looking to satisfy a science requirement.",

                "I definitely would to anyone remotely interested in public health and LGBT activism. I thoroughly enjoyed this course without doubt and loved every aspect of it. The guest speakers are phenomenal, and it really brings to light all the holes in the healthcare system that must be mended.",
                "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student. As a STEM student, this class taught me so much knowledge about HIV and science in general, from virology to academic skills. However, this class is great for anyone interested in social science or politics becuase the HIV pandemic had causes from both sides. The guest speakers that were introduced were also incredible and the interactions with them were very enlightening.",
                "yes I enjoyed the class very much and learned a lot/",
                "Yes. Great course with highly interesting content and format! Students become super close to one another and to Prof. Bazell.",
                "If you are interested in HIV, especially the politics of public health, I would definitely recommend.",
                "Yes, if they have an interest in HIV/AIDS and will do well in a reading/discussion-heavy science class. The class felt more humanities-oriented but this is flexible as the focus of discussions is based on the interests of the students taking it."
