We thought creatively about intricate problems using advanced calculus to solve. We also learned about modern advances in the field of water quality and filtration, especially as it relates to Professor Elimelech's fascinating research.",

                "Strengths: Prof. Elimelech is an awesome professor! He presented the material at a good pace and had really neatly written out notes. It was always easy to follow the flow of the material. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the homework assignments were confusing and didn't connect well with what we had learned in class.",
                "The professor was clear in his lectures, and always reviewed material from the previous class, which was very helpful. The pace of the lectures was good and I was able to follow along. The homework problems were challenging but interesting. I do wish that there were more review problems in preparation for the exams.",
                "This was a great class and Meny is a wonderful professor! The only way that the course could be improved would be by being in person, but obviously, that was not a possibility this semester.",
                "This is a very rigorous and fun course. It taught us how to break down environmental problems with a rigorous approach, stating our assumptions, coordinate systems, and governing equations to solve. The class is very organized and thorough, and could perhaps use some more breakout rooms to try to solve some of the problems in class on our own.",
                "The strengths of the course were in the homework and the instruction. Meny did an excellent job teaching and the homework led to an increased understanding of the topics. The aspect that could have been improved is a more clear distinction between the types of diffusion to help students identify the system correctly."
