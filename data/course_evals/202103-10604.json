                "I learned about new composition softwares, how to write for every instrument, music theory, modern composers, and notation etiquette. Overall, I learned a lot about composition in a short amount of time.",
                "Composing a cohesive larger work and preserving motivic unity throughout, modes\/non-diatonic scales, different instruments",
                "We worked on music composition, specifically use of pandiatonicism and pitched percussion instruments. I developed my skills in Sibelius and Logic Pro, as well as knowledge of many different orchestral instruments.",
                "I learned a lot about music theory, and classical music composition.",
                "in class you'll learn about the \"ingredients\" (like scales, ranges for instruments, playing techniques) of composition and final products. in the lessons, is where you'll really learn about the process w\/ the school of music graduate students.",
                "Before taking this class, I had a lot of experience with topics in composition including chromatic harmony, motivic development, musical structures, etc. However, this class did challenge me and make me learn things I wouldn't have otherwise:\r\n1) Expanding my harmonic palette through pandiatonicism \r\n2) Expanding my rhythmic vocabulary through an emphasis on mixed meter through the course\r\n3) Careful formatting - as a composer, I've always been focused on solely the compositional process, and I never paid attention to the formatting and legibility of my scores. However, this class did force me to work on those skills, and they are tools I will need to use extensively in the future."

                "Strengths: Individual projects.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Limitations on individual projects. Requirements often felt like a hassle and a hamper on creativity.",
                "Strengths include the very warm and helpful faculty and students, the integration with the grad program during the guest lectures, the access to New Music New Haven performances, and the opportunity to devote the semester to an open-ended composition project with helpful tech resources, lessons, and incremental deadlines. The one way I think the course could be improved would be to provide a bit more of a nudge earlier on in the semester to meet our classmates and colleagues -- maybe by moving the visual media group project to earlier in the semester or offering an event with all the students.",
                "I thought the course was extremely well designed because there was a good balance of theoretical lectures and actual composing. We also got to meet a lot of really cool modern composers, which was incredibly inspiring. The only thing I would consider a weakness is that the lecturing can sometimes feel long since the class is almost 2 hours long, but we only met once per week and these lectures were only towards the beginning of the semester.",
                "Strengths: the semester-long assignment is super open-ended and you can basically compose whatever you want, as long as you fulfill the requirements (which are not super hard to fulfill)! Also, working on the visual media project (scoring a short film) in a group is super fun + educational, as you can learn from your group members. The lessons with grad students are also incredibly helpful.",
                "Strengths: Detailed work on compositions, lessons on expanding compositional palettes are very useful for growth. The TAs are wonderful for helping with all sorts of things.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Much of the course consists of general listening to the music of other composers, which is not a weakness in itself but felt excessively dominant as a focus of sessions (maybe 75% of total class time?). I didn't feel that I was able to learn too much from these sessions.",
                "The course structure, with a long term project and several parallel smaller assignments, makes it both valuable and rewarding, as a student ends up being able to work on what they want to while still applying what they learn in class in smaller pieces. The guest lectures were also a great resource.\r\n\r\nThe assignment of course TFs who do private lessons could better be tailored to the interests and workflow of the student. The lecture slides were only posted as Apple Keynote slides which made them difficult to review after the lecture.",
                "Many strengths and a good support system.",
                "the one on one instruction is the most helpful part of class. i find that the requirements for composition projects can sometimes be a hindrance rather than an aid to developing your composition skills. the teaching style is not very engaging (reading from slides).\r\n\r\nthe joint seminars with school of music were great.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Dr. Alexander - she's really nice!\r\n- The TF's - they're great!\r\n- The weekly seminar itself, as well as the presentations of guest composers\r\n- The very fact that this seminar incentivizes you to compose!\r\n- The rules you have to follow in your composition assignments (it forces you to be more creative than before!)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The weekly seminar itself doesn't meet very often; guest composers will often come and present instead, and we won't meet just as a class for weeks\r\n- The at-times confusing assignment requirements and occasional difficulty of the grading\r\n- Lastly, the group project. Every year composers get a group project where they score 2-3 minutes of film, and our year was no exception. If you're not tech-savvy like me or don't know what logic, dorico, or a DAW file are, you're in for a rough time. There's so much technical stuff, and you might have to find a way to collaborate with group members who use different softwares... which isn't easy. Also, I've found that composers have very specific ideas about what music should sound like and it's sometimes hard for them to work together. Despite all of these challenges, I think ours turned out okay, but it was very stressful and time consuming."

                "If you want to make some original music, by all means take it!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in composition or wants to apply their previously gained knowledge of music theory. You have complete freedom over whether you want to create something classical\/traditional styled or something more modern\/electronic. Essentially, any type of musician would benefit from this course.",
                "Yes!! If you're trying to improve your composition, this course is great. However, I would caution that it is classical composition, so make sure you have enough theory before you take the class (or else it just might be a little harder to follow along).",
                "Great course for any aspiring composer to take!",
                "Yes, if the student was interested in pursuing  composition seriously this is a great course.",
                "Yes, if you want to learn these skills.",
                "yes, if you want to learn about composition. don't expect much from the class lectures, but the composition lessons and YSM joint seminars are amazing.",
                "Fortunately, how much experience with composition you have is not an important factor. My understanding is that Dr. A. grades you against yourself. In other words, if she knows of previous compositions you wrote, she'll grade based on improvement and progress rather than creating a curve against others in your class.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'd still recommend this course either for individuals who are more advanced or are very passionate about music. Even for more experienced individuals, there is an extremely stressful learning curve in the first six weeks to understand what the course is asking for in various assignments (if you've composed a lot, prepare to abandon major and minor keys and make the jump to pandiatonicism; all of my classmates and I had a lot of difficulty with this!).\r\n\r\nBut for enthusiastic composers, yes, I learned a lot and I would recommend this course. It's definitely not for every composer, but I think many will get a lot out of this class!"
