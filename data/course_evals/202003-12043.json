                "Strengths: I think class was very straightforward and structured\r\nweakness: we didn't have much writing practice before the final essay and Mondays could have had more discussion instead of just going over answers",
                "The strengths of the course are that we learn a lot of new and useful vocabulary and we use this vocabulary every week when we have to read the news and new articles. By the end of the course, I was able to read the news and understand most of it without having to constantly check a dictionary. The course could be improved in a few ways. I would have liked it if the class discussions were more interactive. Instead of talking about the answers to the questions that we did at home during breakout rooms, it would have been helpful to be assigned a question that we did not prepare in advance so we could practice thinking and speaking on the spot in Arabic. Rather than practicing presentations (which is also helpful, but I think it would be better if done every other week), I think it would be better to have more class discussion. I also think it would be useful to have more vocabulary quizzes in class or more writing assignments. Finally, I think this course could be improved by having more feedback on my assignments. Instead of just a grade, I would have liked explanations of what grammar and pronunciation mistakes I make so that I can improve this in the future. I think that it would have been helpful if we reviewed a grammar concept that maybe a lot of students are struggling with.",
                "The materials and texts we engaged with were interesting. However, the structure wasn't set up in the best way to facilitate engagement. Instead of answering vocabulary questions after reading a passage, I think everyone would have benefited more and engaged more if we had a discussion to analyze and understand the text better. Additionally, the presentations we gave every Wednesday weren't very helpful, since people tended to zone out in other people's presentations.",
                "The discussions were very helpful, however, it was hard to improve because I did not receive feedback quickly.",
                "During the course I submitted about 30 oral assignments. I haven't received any feedback on any of them (bsdies a numerical grade, that does not have any meaning in a langauge course). Therefore, I haven't had any chance to improve my reading, writing or speaking during the entire term."

Flipgrid is very interactive and fun, but I think that there should be more synchronous discussions. Kahoot was also a nice resource to practice the new vocabulary, but I think that there should be more quizzes to reinforce the vocabulary.",
