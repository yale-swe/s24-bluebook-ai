   "comments": [
    "I learned how to plan and structure my writing. Also to have confidence when writing!",
    "I developed my ability to make a more coherent thesis and ways to talk more specifically about one topic.",
    "I learned a lot of the technical skills for writing, especially improving on transitions, structure, and clarity. With writing, practice is the most important thing, and this course forces you to do very focused practice in multiple different writing mediums.",
    "My writing skills were significantly improved! Jae did an amazing job of telling me what I was doing well and what I wasn't, then giving me the tools to further improve each paper.",
    "I developed the skills to form, defend, and interpret an argument derived from outside sources. The structure of the writing in the class was different than I had done before, but it was similar enough to warrant some confidence. Principally, I learned to ask for help in the future of writing and in my education in general.",
    "I learned how to positively accept criticism, how to actively address a problem, and improved upon my grammar and writing skills as a whole.",
    "This course is a great intro class to college writing. I learned to make original claims and use evidence to support them. After the course, I became familiar with using the MLA format and citing sources. Reading materials were challenging but going through them made me prepared for Yale's par.",
    "-This course served as an introductory class to academic writing. We learned to emphasize the idea of entering a conversation. Using They Say\/I Say we learned to identify where we as contributors fit in a developing conversation regarding a topic. The book and workshops in class allowed us to practice these skills of identifying our own position in a topic and then evaluating its legitimacy based on evidence. We also developed the skills to find different sources and determine their legitimacy. One of the great insights that I got from this course was the importance of the so what? part of a paper."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: a lot of explanation was given on how to do certain things or ways to improve which was good. Weaknesses: more writing activities would have been helpful.",
    "Strengths: Opportunities to practice in different forms of writing, small teacher to student ratio \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Classes themselves can sometimes be a bit dry, multiple drafts not encouraged",
    "The strengths of this course are that it facilitates discussion, helps with logistics of writing, and creates a welcoming atmosphere to Yale. The weaknesses of this course are that it is difficult to understand some texts, the nuances of the writing style are at times unnecessary, and the standards were too high at the beginning.",
    "Some of the subject matter and texts that were assigned were very difficult, especially as first-years, to write about.",
    "One strength is that the course is well planned to teach students various writing skills and tasks. One weakness is that the first few prompts were very complex and not straight forward. It was really difficult to come up with things to write about.",
    "A weakness of such a course is that it depends partly on reading example scholarly writings as a means of learning. However, most academic writing is very specific and likely very complex already which makes reading it very difficult. Many articles build on past evidence or past articles on similar topics by citing them, they often do this by briefly referencing and then explaining the significance of these contributions . Although the explanation provided is sufficient for any scholar within the field to understand the article, it is insufficient for comprehension to anyone out of the scholarly community which is the case for students. This means that when we as students read an example scholarly article with the intention of learning from the way they build their argument we do so without really understanding the meaning of their argument. We may know the purpose of their argument but not understand the true weight of it because the context is ambiguous due to our lack of knowledge as new readers to the academic conversation. As a result, when we read articles we spend too much time trying to understand what the author is trying to say rather than analyzing how theyre saying it. Although it is possible to overcome this by doing extensive research as a new reader it is very discouraging and gets in the way of getting to the point of reading these example articles. The only reason I bring all this up is because as a student its nice to be explicitly aware of what a class expects. An assignment to just read or analyze the way they build their argument is something much more difficult than is initially made clear. This isnt necessarily a negative thing but certainly is very discouraging unless acknowledged."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, loved the teacher, topic, and class\/",
    "Yes I would because I did have a lot of fun in it and my writing improved. I also learned how some of the ways I learned to write were wrong.",
    "Yes, for the ordinary student this course provides a lot of valuable exposure and practice to writing.",
    "Yes, but only if you are taking it with intentions of improving your writing skills. If you are not keen on improving your writing, then it will be a long, miserable semester for you.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course to another student. There are better courses to facilitate writing skills specific to your area of study. Furthermore, though this is a general course for academic writing, the form taught is not necessarily the manner to write in every academic field (e.g. research papers). The ideas are more nuances of what you already know more than new ideas on how to approach writing. Giving something a name doesn't change what it is, but the student may be led to believe that he\/she knows less than he\/she actually does.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who wishes to develop their essay writing skills and learn how to further analyze text.",
    "Yes and no. I really liked the professor and how the course is planned out, but the topic 'Pleasure' was really different from what I expected and going through all the reading material was very difficult and tiresome.",
    "Id recommend this to any other student as its very important to build better writing skills for the rest of college. The type of writing that we learned is applicable to any academic field and is practical for any use. Practicing these general writing skills is essential if the student plans to effectively communicate their work in the future. This course is catered towards first years and is a great seminar-styled class for anyone wanting to fulfill the writing distributional requirement."
