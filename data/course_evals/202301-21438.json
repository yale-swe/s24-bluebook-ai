                "Great class overall",
                "One of the central insights of the course I received is how education systems can play a central role in developing national identity and statehood around the world. Depending on the vision of its leaders, a country may develop a totally different education system than its global counterparts. \r\nEach writing assignment asks us to reflect on our writing process and experience. Uncommon in other classes, reflections provided me with the opportunity to think about the parts I enjoy (and the ones I dont) about writing. I believe this has made me a better writer because I am aware of what areas I need to dedicate more time to while writing.",
                "I learned about how closely tied education is to politics, and the significance of history & language in nation building. I also learned how to read more efficiently and how to take notes on them.",
                "EDST282 is probably one of the coolest courses I have taken during my time at Yale! In it, we moved beyond the American education system, drawing interesting differences and connections between various systems across the world. It was fascinating to read about competing motivations for education, the impacts of colonization on educational pedagogies, indigenous education, the intersection of philanthropy and education, and so much more. Class discussions were extremely valuable as they invited people from so many different backgrounds to share their unique educational experiences and insights, which opened my eyes to various and nuanced perspectives about language instruction, education, and social mobility, etc.",
                "Through this course, I gained insights about the varying purposes and uses of education in nation-states across the world. I also gained insights about how non-state actors, such as local communities and parents, determine the purposes of education and confer value on particular languages, modes of study and learning, achievement, etc..",
                "A survey on international education from a variety of perspectives.",
                "I learned a lot about the basic education systems of many different countries as well as about what the foundations of education systems are, how the goals of education differ and are viewed, the considerations that go into setting up an education system, and just how to think about the many facets of education globally.",
                "Reading and writing skills. The class has a heavy reading workload so make sure to complete the readings and write the discussion post throughout the week, not on the day before class. It also gave me confidence to speak out and discuss my ideas and thoughts as a big part of the class was discussion-based, allowing us to improve our public speaking skills.",
                "Objectives of national education systems, the uses of language and history (among other subjects) to build nations, different types of education (progressive, classical, traditional).",
                "This class has furthered my understanding of education as a vehicle for politics and how nation building is closely linked to the form and content of education.",
                "Gained insight on ho the basic principles and purposes behind education play out differently based on the who/where/why contexts. The balance between varying motives for education is difficult  to achieve, but it has been interesting to think about communities and individuals as agents in education."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: class environment and discussions, assignment scaffolding and support, good readings. Weaknesses: large-ish seminar meant we often got lost in tangents in discussions and there was not always enough time for everyone to speak.",
                "Strengths: small reading groups, 2h block broken up and well-organized, assignments give opportunity for creativity and ingenuity, opportunities to collaborate with peers (both presentations and essays), manageable workload allowed me to enjoy the readings I was consuming, flexibility with deadlines, large portion of course being ungraded, diversity of student experiences \r\nWeaknesses: lot of agreement, little debate, incentive to do readings falls over course of semester, need more check-ins for essays",
                "Great class overall and I wish there could have been more coverage of religion, but overall great class",
                "As with any other Yale course, it is always difficult to fit all the possible content into a semester, and every weeks theme could be a course on its own. I think the course has the right balance between breadth and depth. Each major assignment is designed to make you think more deeply about the course materials, but they also allow you to explore a related topic of your interest. \r\nAdditionally, the course incorporates learning opportunities beyond lectures. During the semester, we had the chance to chat with a former student who is working in the education field in Rwanda, and we also met and talked with Italian high school students about their educational experiences. These types of experiences enrich the course because we get to see how what we are reading and discussing in class plays out in real life. Even more, because the students in the class come \r\nOne suggestion for the course is to ensure enough time for large group share-outs toward the end of each class. Sometimes it felt that we were running out of time, and many items of discussion were left unsaid. However, this was remedied toward the second half of the semester, so the real suggestion would be to continue implementing this solution.",
                "I think a strength of this course is the reading groups  I enjoyed being able to talk in a small setting, since Im not very good at talking in front of more people; I found it easier to bounce off ideas with a fewer number of people. Reading groups was also a good way to become more integrated into the class. Also, students also had agency in shaping the vibes of this class, for a lack of a better word; and since everyone is so kind and intellectual and curious, it made the class pretty fun. I think a feedback of this class I can think of is giving context or some kind of thematic framework for the readings before we actually read them. There is a broader topic that we cover each week, but we go over context after we read the readings, and I think it would be more helpful to have the context beforehand so we know what were going to be reading about more specifically. Or maybe even a few guiding questions that we can think about while we read. Lots of the readings were long or really in-depth, so I think having something to focus on while reading would have helped.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is the diversity of students this course attracts. As this is a course on comparative international education, the plethora of unique perspectives makes EDST282 a highly engaging class! Moreover, the seminar meeting once a week made this class less stressful (and we were able to talk more during our weekly class!). While this is likely to be true for every seminar at Yale, sometimes I felt like we didnt spend enough time on certain topics. Perhaps distributing an introductory survey to gauge class interests might be helpful in modifying the course structure to zoom in on student interests.",
                "The strengths of the course is that it repudiates Western-centricism and offers a broad survey of education systems in the Global South. Another notable strength of the course of that includes a diverse array of learning medium, including academic scholarship, film, news articles, in-class learning experiences with international students and educators, etc.. I also appreciated the wide latitude that we were given for the final project, as it enabled me to creatively pursue a topic that both interesting and rigorous.",
                "Strengths are a caring instructor an amicable classroom environment. The course can feel as if all of the work is piled onto two assignments (which can be stressful) but beyond that it is very approachable and rewarding.",
                "Great course, I think discussion was very fruitful. The only real weakness was that sometimes discussions felt a little bit too free and unguided and we'd end up taking about students' personal experiences (which while incredibly interesting and important to hear about) which made the bigger picture or tie back to larger concepts a bit hard to track.",
                "Strengths: a lot of discussion time and opportunities to participate, interesting readings, flexible assignments and essays (allowing you to dive into your creative side). \r\nWeaknesses: not a lot of actual class time. Sometimes I wished the class would have longer lectures by the professor so that we could hear more about her ideas and research, rather than just discuss it ourselves with our classmates.",
                "I absolutely loved the student presentation model, which would keep us engaged with the readings. I also appreciated the reading groups, which really helped me get to know my classmates and feel more comfortable in the seminar. In terms of weaknesses, I would have appreciated a little more guidance by Dr. Debs during discussions, because it felt like we kept coming back to the same topic and getting stuck (language for economic growth vs. cultural preservation).",
                "Strength: Prof. Debs, peers, good readings and discussions\r\n\r\nWeakness: 9am, classes/discussion can look very different based on who is presenting",
                "Strengths: Reading group structure (Dr. Debs will give you gift cards to get coffee!), professor, course material and variety, automatic two-day extension on assignments when needed, wellness time in the start of class, weekly treats, student presentations\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have loved more lecturing (ex. Short overviews) from the professor in tandem with student presentations, but that is just my learning style!"

I even recommend the course to students who are intellectually curious and want to learn about a new topic. Even if you have had past experience and knowledge about some education systems in other parts of the world, there is substantial discussion of various countries that you will certainly learn about a new countrys education context.",

And for people who are curious about international education, but also want to do their own research on a topic or country that wasnt covered much in class, we have the opportunity to do that, which I thought was great.",
                "Take EDST282! Whether youre pursuing an education studies certificate (this would seriously be an amazing class to count towards your requirement) or not (in which case, this course would just be a very relaxed writing credit if youre looking for one), I am taking away a lot from this course. If you are interested in or, really, just curious about what education looks like outside of the United States, this class is for you! The writing portion of this course is not stressful at all as Dr. Debs allows you to incorporate your personal interests into your assignments. You also have a lot of freedom with your final project!",

                "Yes definitely ! Good overview of education systems world wide, really good discussions facilitated by Dr. Debs, and important opportunity to learn how to think about the world from a more educational stand point",
                "I would recommend this class to another student as long as theyre aware that this is an EdStudies course. While it is also cross listed as PoliSci, most of the students in the course were EdStudies majors with more experience and knowledge on the topics discussed in class. Nonetheless, I learned extensively about Political Science and surprisingly a lot about the theory and history of education, while I was expecting to focus more on current affairs and present education around the world.",
                "Absolutely. Dr. Debs truly cares about her students and wants to make this course engaging and informative for all. I learned a lot about different modes of education and did a lot of reflection (at Dr. Debs's encouragement) on how my own education has shaped my upbringing.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if they are interested in learning about different models of education/thinking about what an optimal system could look like. Its a class where youll get out what you put into it, so I recommend choosing this course with the intention and time to do all the readings; these can seem daunting at first, but they are incredibly interesting and really broadened my understanding of education. The class discussions are vibrant, and the reading group structure works great for meeting others in the course."
