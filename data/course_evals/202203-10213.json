This class made me think in a new way, studying how tension developed early on rises into conflict, how to structure a scene, how to make a compelling character, and so on. Also the process of writing and writing and getting that work workshopped was really amazing."

One weakness is that class often went overtime, so it might have to have more scheduled class time for future semesters.",
                "I really like the workshopping format, the professor's wisdom, the vibe of the class, and the opportunity and openness to write whatever was most interesting to us! I do wish however that more class time was devoted to the readings (maybe shortening the workshops or even just having one work of each student workshopped?) and more outright conversations on craft points. Some things like the different POVs for example (limited, objective), I didn't really know beforehand and wish were clarified and explained during class time. It felt like I was missing a certain foundation of literary terms and concepts I wished I gained!"
