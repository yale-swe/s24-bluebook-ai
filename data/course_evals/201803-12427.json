   "comments": [
    "Learned a lot of basics for Political Science study. What is a state, wars, legitimacy, regimes, etc...",
    "Some simple ideas on political science, but not much.",
    "Attention to the broader patterns of comparative politics and how similar and disparate structures emerged based on varying histories, geographies, and interactions; ability to contextually engage with international politics",
    "Basic defenitions of nuanced terms in Political Philosophy (Country vs state vs government vs regime etc. )",
    "This course is an introductory course into International Relations. Teaches basic principles of interaction between states by looking into specific cases that have occurred in the world.",
    "the political institutions and histories of other states around the world and what has made them successful or unsuccessful",
    "I learned about the foundations of states and various comparisons of different government and ruling styles.",
    "I learned about the theories of state formation, different state structures, development strategies, sources of state fragility, civil war, and trade policies. This course simultaneously covers a wide range of material about comparative politics but also provides a good deal of depth on each topic. While the course can seem theoretical at times, the theoretical frameworks are complemented well by case studies.",
    "We discussed various aspects of comparative politics, such as electoral systems, stateliness, development, comparative political economy, democratization, ethnicity, and civil war, among other topics. I learned how to read college-level research papers.",
    "I was introduce to many new topics through the course of this class and varying view points on these topics to better understand the realm and development of politics.",
    "I learned how to read and evaluate literature published in the field of political science. I also learned how to write a brief, which was something I'd never done before.",
    "This taught me how to think in a particular way about international politics.",
    "I learned a lot from the main textbook about government structures and electoral structures. Honestly the information we learned would be really boring to anyone but a poli sci Major.",
    "I learned about state development and various properties of states in their development that have resulted in comparative views of governance.",
    "General insight into political science, parameters for comparative politics",
    "Comparative politics",
    "Nothing. This was the worst class at yale.",
    "I learned a great deal about looking at politics through a comparative lens",
    "I learned how to compare political systems, different aspects of voting and politics.",
    "I learned how to see the world comparatively, and learned that political science is not all about memorizing facts.",
    "To be entirely honest, I only chose this specific introductory poli sci class over others because it was at a convenient time. I definitely lucked out though, because I genuinely enjoyed this course and was able to get a lot out of it. Learning about different regime types, electoral systems, tracks of development, the political economy, etc. provided a good base that can be used to take higher level courses in comparative politics. The overarching themes tie in with a lot of other political science courses, and I was able to apply concepts learned in this class to my American Constitutionalism class. It gave me a more comprehensive world view, and disproved a lot of preconceptions I previously held. It focused on the entire world, not just America and Europe. Additionally, the moderate reading load exposed me to many scholarly articles and how data across countries is actually compared.",
    "A great survey\/ introductory class to comparative politics",
    "Analytical approaches to state development, and the multiple dimensions of states",
    "Theory of state building, different ways of electing leaders and maintaining states, strategies for overcoming and moving on from insurgencies. In addition, specific political knowledge on pertinent and interesting nations.",
    "More knowledge of politics within countries",
    "A lot of info about theory regarding state formation\/basic info and conflicts.",
    "I learned to coherently analyse the political system of a country, in relation to its economic and social status.",
    "Knowledge about how other governments work, helpful for understanding current events",
    "The differing political systems across the world and the modern issues effecting the global political climate.",
    "The basics of comparative politics, from how states form to different political institutions to political economy to civil wars."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The professor is not very engaging and the lectures are bland and not very informative.",
    "Teaching style is not clearly and not very organized.",
    "Insightful readings and widely applicable material; excellent introduction to political science and its various approaches to conflict",
    "the course did not incorporate enough of the case book into our lectures.",
    "strengths is the information overlaps with each other a lot so it is easy to link all of the things together \r\nweaknesses is the lectures were a little boring and the slides were hard to follow",
    "This course runs very smoothly, the readings sometimes seemed a little too focused, as they gave very small examples of the larger themes, but it's a solid class.",
    "Strengths: Professor Simon provides great insights into each topic, providing a high degree of nuance for a survey course. Readings are extremely interesting and complement the lectures well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The allocation of time given to certain topics relative to others seems somewhat arbitrary.",
    "The course material was very interesting and relevant, and I like how Prof. Simon brought in both well-known examples and countries that are rarely discussed to enrich lectures and contextualize what we were learning. The exams and paper were manageable. You usually did not have to do the readings because they were only on exams to the extent they were covered in lectures. Section could be dull at times and the most amount of work for class would be spent doing assignments for section. Sometimes Prof. Simon would focus on one lecture slide for half the class and we would thus run out of time to cover the material we were supposed to cover during the lesson.",
    "A strength of this class was the organization of the syllabus and material taught since it had a good flow and made learning the concepts easier to learn. A weakness of the class was the amount of assigned reading because it was impossible to keep up with all of it throughout the entire semester.",
    "Felt a bit like there were four sources of information - the Cases textbook, assigned readings, lecture, and section - and during the course this was confusing. However, I would recommend that students compile everything from each day together and use that to draw a map of the information they need to know. The course was generally well organized chromatically and felt like we methodically covered everything we needed. It was just a lot of information from a lot of different places, and a little heads up about how to integrate each piece into the overall picture of the course might have been nice.",
    "Strengths: My TA\r\nWeakness: Lectures can be a bit dry",
    "I felt like lecture wasnt particularly engaging and I didnt gain much from being there. Most things were covered well in the reading. Section was super helpful though. I also thought the readings were helpful.",
    "Learned a lot about various countries which I feel like will be very beneficial in other Political Classes.",
    "The course fits a lot of material, but in doing so doesn't focus very strongly on any given topic due to just how many topics there are.",
    "Strengths include strong lectures and beneficial sections, no real weaknesses",
    "Great",
    "Professor Simon was a weakness in that he could not communicate anything about this topic.",
    "The course had a lot of readings that didn't seem to relevant to the material or much too difficult for the scope of an introductory class. The exams were straightforward though and the essays fun to write.",
    "I like the lectures and the weekly TF-led discussion sessions are also very informative.",
    "Fantastic course, some improvements to lectures and online notes",
    "The strengths of this course lie in the fact that the syllabus is really comprehensive and deals with a lot of really interesting and pressing issues, which helps make the readings and coursework engaging. I do feel that a lot of the course was lost in the lack of in-class conversation as a result of it being a lecture. I think this class would be an incredible seminar.",
    "Strengths: assignments were clear, lessons were coherent",
    "The lecture was kind of dry and rambling but it would've been really interesting if the class was more focused so there was the opportunity to go deeper into the topics jay seemed tangential.",
    "It's a bit too much memorization. Especially with the exams taking up more weight in the scoring than the papers.\r\n\r\nIt's really wide in terms of coverage of the basics of comparative politics. Very good introduction.",
    "Helpful information, but was an overview, never went into depth",
    "It was hard to follow at times as a underclassmen. There were assumptions of knowledge that made it difficult to keep up",
    "The strength is that this course covers a wide range of topics in comparative politics and gives students a good understanding of what comparative politics is. One main weakness is that, as a result, the course doesn't go in-depth in any unit."

   "comments": [
    "No. Not a good professor, hard and unclear exams and assignments-- no review session for the midterm and asked very obscure questions. Just a big no-no.",
    "Yes as a base course for a student already engaged in political science\/international studies; they would be better able to appreciate the nuances of the complex course readings that I as a less experienced student could not.",
    "Maybe, it is not as thought provoking as other courses, but the material can be a useful base to statr with.",
    "Yeah, good intro poli sci class",
    "No.",
    "yes good foundational course for any other political science course",
    "For sure. It's a good intro class for political science majors but also just an interesting class on the foundations of comparative politics.",
    "Yes, this course provides a great introduction not only to comparative politics but development, political theory and international relations.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course to students who are interested in learning about comparative politics - while a majority of the first half of the course was topics with which I was already familiar, the second half of the course was quite interesting and I learned a lot about topics like democratization and political economy, for instance.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students since it is a brief overview of topics in the field of political science and is beneficial in helping identify what you want to study more in depth. There is also a lot of freedom of choice with what you want to research for papers, which makes it more interesting to learn about.",
    "Yes! Especially as an introduction into the major.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because if you put in the work you can succeed in this course. The material isnt particularly challenging, and its interesting if you like political science.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to any student in part interested in Comparative Politics.",
    "Definitely. Professor Simon gives an excellent sample of political science and what that entails.",
    "Great",
    "Yes. I took this class because, at the end of shopping period, I was left with a gaping hole in my schedule and nothing to fill it with. So, I arbitrarily picked one of the random courses I had shopped and submitted my schedule. Funnily enough, it became my favorite class of the semester.\r\nThe material was very organized and lectures tied directly to the readings (although you don't necessarily have to do the readings, it makes preparing for the midterm and final much easier). On that note, the exams were incredibly simple (honestly, my high school tests were harder) and straightforward. My TA was also fantastic, and made this class infinitely more understandable and enjoyable.",
    "No. Do not take this course. Pofessor Simon could not communicate anything about this topic.",
    "Yes",
    "I definetly would. Great introduction, very clear but also interesting",
    "Yes, if they have a very, very strong interest in comparative politics and are willing to overcome some of the classes deficiencies.",
    "Yes, a great introductory course.",
    "Yes, great foundational knowledge for an intro course",
    "I would recommend this to anyone interested in being a PoliSci major to see if its for them or taking another major and only planning on doing one PoliSci course, based on the number of relevant topics that the coursework hits .",
    "Yes, the course material was clear and easy to follow thanks to the lectures and section meetings. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in foreign politics or various forms of government.",
    "Yes, because it helps you to develop useful introductory knowledge on world politics",
    "Yes, for an intro level course",
    "I very much recommend this class because it covers many topics in comparative politics that are very important to understand how different countries and governments work, and it gives the student a very good understanding of comparative politics."
