                "I learned a lot in this course that I didn't expect to learn before taking it. I learned foundational information about the immune system, how it interacts with different pathogens, how it complicates itself, etc. I also learned the crucial differences between different vector-borne diseases, and by the end I was able to think about how different interventions could help reduce the prevalence or incidence of these infectious diseases. I learned to take data from papers sometimes with a grain of salt, and to consider the different ways it could have been skewed. I have a great breadth of newfound knowledge on a lot of different scientific subjects because of this class.",
                "I learned all about Malaria, Lyme, and Dengue. I learned about the disease, immunology, and treatment. I knew nothing about these diseases previous to this class, and now I know so much. I also developed the skill of applying my factual learning to situational problems through the quizzes and midterm. This was very valuable problem solving skill development."

            "comments": [
                "This class is incredibly effective as a small seminar. Having an expert in the field lead the way in lecture while having many opportunities throughout to stop and ask questions, this class was formative and made learning inevitable being in such a small setting. It was helpful getting great feedback on quizzes and assignments, and clear instructions of how an assignment should be done, something I found very nice. Many of the topics, terms, and things discussed in class were more difficult to understand but Professor Belperron always made things easier to understand and she was able to break things down into digestible terms. This helped a lot, but sometimes I would get lost in assigned readings or research on my own because her clear explanation wasn't present.",
                "I think a large strength was the class size. It was small so it allowed us to ask many questions if they came up. It also was good that it hyper-focused on a few diseases because we could delve deep into them and also compare them.  A weakness of this course was that it didn't always feel like assignments we were completing were for a specific purpose. We had questions to complete every few weeks, but then our questions were never applied to or acknowledged in class to my knowledge."

                "I definitely would recommend this course to another student because this course is a guarantee to foster learning. I think Malaria, Lyme, Dengue, and the other diseases discussed are incredibly interesting and perfect for students who aren't geared towards STEM. Since it is a specific topic it makes learning much more concentrated and will allow students to engage thoroughly with scientific topics while relating it to how it impacts society. This is a great science class to take and it will give you newfound knowledge that makes other science classes more enjoyable.",
                "I think I would because the content was very interesting. I learned so much about vector-borne diseases, and as someone interested in public health, this was very cool to me. I just think it would be important for students to know what they are getting into as this definitely was not an easy science credit. There were many assignments and evaluations. They definitely were helpful and essential to retaining our knowledge, but this class required lots of my time."
