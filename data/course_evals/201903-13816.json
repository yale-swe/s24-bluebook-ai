    "I think this course helped me better understand general chemistry. I am definitely not a chemist but as a student retaking this course, I have a greater understanding of some of the topics.",
    "Learned chemistry!",
    "This course provides a good foundational survey of general chemistry concepts and skills.",
    "Great class. Awesome",
    "I learned about various topics in general chemistry and about about how chemistry affects people's everyday lives.",

   "comments": [
    "I think that the lecture style was good but could have been better simply because I felt as though going through a chapter a week was a bit too much. I think it would have been nice to spend a week and a half on each chapter but I do understand that there is a time constraint. I also think that the Sapling questions could have better reflected the material or problems we saw in class.",
    "Pretty good course. Well structured to facilitate learning.",
    "At the end of the course, we discussed how the concepts we learned relate to  recent and current issues like damage to the ozone layer and how chemistry is helping to fix it.  I thought this was a great way to review concepts and understand how what we had learned could be applied to the real world. The course is well-organized, with a consistent structure and easy-to-follow lectures. While I like the feedback and Learning Curve feature provided by Sapling, I feel like some traditional problem sets might be more useful for learning harder concepts.",
    "Not very many weakness, the class was great and both the TA and professor were very helpful and great at explaining concepts.",
    "The strengths of this course were the discussion sections and lectures. The course could be improved by making it more clear what information is important to learn, because there was so much material that was covered and much of it was not necessary to understand thoroughly.",
    "Strengths - concepts are explained very well in class, slides are very informative and posted online, office hours are very accessible, and we are given plenty of time to complete the homework! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - more practice with examples of homework problems in class",
    "Strengths: Evan, LearningCurve",
    "The strength of this course was the instruction by Professor Cooper, the structure of the course, and the fact that it was a small class size. I liked how the units were structured by chapter and it was very clear which chapters would be covered on the midterms. I actually really liked having three midterms throughout the semester and taking them during class time. It made it very manageable and it was clear what material we were responsible for. The weekly problem sets and learning curve assignments were also fair and helped understanding of the material, but occasionally there would be a few problems that didn't entirely line up with the content we were learning. Section worked well and having low-key quizzes was not too bad. I realize that having such a small class size is not possible for regular sequence chemistry, but I really think having a 15 person class added so much benefit to my learning. I was able to ask questions in class and Professor Cooper was able to ask the class questions about the material during lecture as well. If it is possible to maybe offer two lecture times during the regular sequence, I think students would enjoy the class much more and be more inclined to show up. I know that is supposed to the be the role of section in this type of lecture class, but having a smaller lecture class makes it seem so much more manageable. I had a great time in this class."

   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this class if it is needed as a pre-requisite or if it needed for a major.",
    "Yes, specifically to take the course with Dr. Cooper.",
    "If you are interested in chemistry, take it (off sequence is better). The class is much smaller and you get a better grasp on the material.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who knows they are interested in this subject.",
    "Dr. Cooper is an amazing professor to take Gen Chem with! Hes so helpful, accessible, and kind!",
    "Yes, definitely! It is a great introduction to general chemistry and it is not overly challenging, which is great because you really learn the material instead of struggling to understand concepts.",
    "Yes take chem off sequence!",
    "Yes, if you had to take the intro chemistry course. This class is much smaller and gives more room for student learning.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. Taught by Professor Cooper, the material is very straightforward and there are plenty of resources to help you learn. If you can and it is offered, take this class off sequence. The class I was in was very small and made what could be a bland lecture course interesting and interactive."
