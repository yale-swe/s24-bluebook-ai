                "I came in without having ever taken an education studies course at Yale and this class adeptly introduced all key concepts while simultaneously teaching the design thinking framework. It exposed us to problem framing and the importance of assessing our own approach to ensure we have done it right. One of the things I appreciated most was the emphasis on group work, as it allowed us to see firsthand the immense value of collaboration in education. All in all, I had a fantastic experience in this class and would highly recommend it!",
                "I learned what design thinking is and how it can be applied to education.",
                "I learned how to approach educational design challenges from both an equity lens and an eye for fostering belonging. I learned what design thinking entails and how important it is to everyday life.",
                "A better understanding of the design thinking framework and how it can be used to actually develop a project in education.",
                "Knowledge about educational design, how to design for equity, and practice designing through design project.",

                "I learned what design thinking is and how it can be used to think about our educational system",
                "I learned about the design thinking process in the context of schools, and learned a lot about how to foster healthy classroom environments and relationships",
                "Design Thinking. It is so difficult simple observe without jumping to conclusions. The process of empathizing, prototyping, testing then doing it all over  again is also difficult. This class taught me the skills needed to work towards solutions to modern problems. I learned to think critically about my own education. Especially, how the public K-12 system does not prepare learners to think critically about the world. This class offers students the opportunity to  exercise the reiterative skills of trial and error problem solving with vague guidelines. This is more representative of real-world problem solving. I left knowing that the world does not HAVE to be organized the way it is.",
                "I learned a lot more about the process of design thinking and its applications to education as well as other parts of society (health, business, engineering, etc). We also learned about organizational theory, leadership styles, and the developmental side of primary and secondary education. I gained insights on how to rethink the purpose of schooling (and school reform) with equity in mind.",
                "Familiarity with design thinking process and practical applications; practice tackling a large project in a team",
                "I developed the ability to think outside of my own experiences and personal biases. Using the design thinking framework, I was able to break apart the ways that I make evaluations and inferences about problems\/solutions.",
                "This course introduced me to design thinking and how it can be applied to thinking about education. I think one of the key insights I got out of the course was problem solving effectively - some of the earliest readings we did in the class were about how many reforms have been tried and failed (even ones that are being talked about now), and how we might avoid some of these pitfalls by really honing on defining problems before diving into solving. Design thinking really helped me focus on understanding a problem more fully before acting, which I think was a valuable lesson. It really provides me with a framework with which to approach problem solving in the future in a clear and precise way, which I think is invaluable not only for education but more broadly as well. In addition the professors stressed having equity as a throughline, which I think challenged me to think more broadly about how to incorporate people from diverse backgrounds into different educational designs.",
                "This course is largely focused on redefining your metacognition when approach societal problems. We spent a significant amount of time challenging our traditional approach to problem-solving and forced our brains to embrace empathy and reduce assumptions. Using this metacognitive framework, it allows you to investigate educational design in a more personalized way! In all honesty, it was one of those classes you did not realize you learned a lot in until you look back at the progress!",
                "The course has fundamentally changed the way I think about a lot of things and how I handle situations. Take the course if you can.",
                "I certainly developed a better understanding of design thinking as a result of this class, and felt the practical applications of the concepts helpful in building those skills. I also appreciated the depth and breadth of material on education-specific concepts, such as learning theory and the history of the public education system in the U.S."

                "Extremely innovative course. I learned so much about whats happening in the education space, particularly in America, and was consistently engaged.",
                "Strengths: Definitely one of the most fun, engaging, and supportive seminar environments I have ever seen. The professors are excellent and so caring. Weaknesses: I think the group project could have used a little bit more direction.",
                "This course is designed to foster a vibrant community, and the readings are relevant and engaging. Every class session involved a different, hands-on collaborative task, and I enjoyed going every week. The only slight weakness was not having very clear rubrics on our big assignments.",
                "The class sessions were very engaging and it was good to be able to focus on how the readings were important in practice. The learning throughout the course all connected really well. The design thinking skills learned are very applicable outside of this class.",
                "strengths: weekly memos were really great in improving reflective writing, and group projects and activities allowed everyone to get to know each better and build a community. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: at times the course was a little disorganized (Deadlines, rubrics) but it was also the first time the class ran so I assume it would be better each time onwards! the strengths FAR OUTWEIGH the weaknesses though.",
                "Absolutely wonderful course. The professors were excellent, very little time was spent on lecturing and instead we got to work on design challenges in small groups. I loved the ways that we engaged with the course outside of class, too, in the readings, memos, and final group projects. No weaknesses!",
                "Super engaging. There was a lot of work, but all of it felt worth while and elevated the course.",
                "strengths: super understanding professors, interesting content, class environment was engaging and productive\r\nweaknesses: 7 PM class is just brutal, weekly memos are a lot of work",
                "Strengths: the weekly memos helped my learning a lot; the professors fostered a really positive class environment that felt fun and stress free but also encouraged us to work hard; the content was relevant and really interesting; the in class activities were very engaging and always made the class pass very quickly\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the readings felt sort of like afterthoughts (ex: articles like 20 pedagogical practices you should try, that read sort of like a blog post); the final group project, while fun and helpful for learning in the end, was very stressful partially because there werent many benchmarks we had to hit and it wasn't very structured",
                "STRENGTHS: This class is awesome! You learn a lot in the readings, and it's very different from any other course I have taken at Yale. The small cohort and the teaching team's dedication to community-building and mental health make the class cohort really fun as well. The weekly memos take work, but I feel like I have become a better writer because of them, and they get easier over the course of the semester. The class is a masterclass in showing that learning can be deep and rigorous without being stressful or unkind. WEAKNESSES: No huge ones - I wish that there were more connections to in-class activities and the readings (it would be nice to review the reading material as a cohort; I often found myself wishing I could have a discussion based on the readings, what I wrote in my memo, and what others wrote in their memos).",
                "This class creates space for students to sit with and explore their thoughts. As well as exercise their imagination and true emotions without academic filtering. Although the ambiguity of the entire class allows for a lot of exploration and personalization, the immense freedom can be a little paralyzing. But the professors' design choice of making groups successfully made a balancing environment between imagination and practicality.",
                "Strengths: the class culture, the instructors' caring style of teaching, weekly memos where you get to see your classmates' thinking and respond to them, the semester project you get to design with a group.\r\nWeaknesses: broad prompts for the analytic papers are sometimes too vague, though we understood it was meant to be broad so as to allow for freedom in approaching the prompt",
                "Strengths - Engaging seminars, professors are amazing, genuine community emerges; Weaknesses - This was the first year, so the course was a bit disorganized. I think it will probably improve in future years, though!",
                "The weekly memo is a strength of this course. It primed me for class by doing much of the work of wrestling with course readings beforehand. Additionally, as someone who struggles to speak on the spot, the online peer review helped me to feel more connected to colleagues because I was able to express my thoughts easily on paper and I felt like they really saw my perspective through this. I think one weakness of the course was the end of term project. I appreciate the ways that we were given creative liberty in an attempt to come up with an outside-the-box idea, but I struggled with the lack of structure of the project. Though, it may have been more a personal weakness than pedagogical weakness because I do see how the analytic papers were meant to build up to the final project. Still, I think that not enough time in class was given to meet with team members but I recognize the limitations of a once weekly class meeting. Given all of this, I think the weight of the project (15%) was fairly low and fair relative to the other work throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: the professors are very welcoming and kind, and they made the class experience well designed (in my opinion). - In particular - I thought that class time was never wasted; class was never us sitting around and discussing readings, but us participating in activities and experiences which I thought really enhanced my understanding of design thinking\/the material. With regards to readings - I think this class was one of the few classes where I really wanted to do the readings haha. (We did have to write a 1-page memo each week which was a good motivator... but also a lot of the readings were quite thoughtful, at least in the beginning.) - I think the professors were very deliberate about fostering a class community, and really centered our own experiences and backgrounds in activities, which I thought was good. The length of the class (2 hrs\/Wednesday, once a week) was a bit long, but also I thought it had the benefit that we could really dive deeply into the material for a long period of time each week. Assignments I didn't find too bad, the papers were relatively short when compared to the amount of weekly memo writing we did. I also felt that the feedback was generally helpful; we received peer review from other students and also review from professors, and I think both of these were helpful in bringing up new questions\/ideas. Weaknesses: the timing is a bit unfortunate, I know a couple of my friends were quite tired by 7-9 pm on Wednesdays. I think some of the later readings were a bit weaker than the readings in the start - in the beginning we had more journal articles that dove deeply into research\/theory about organizations; in the end the articles were more webpages\/long guides which I felt were a bit shallow\/hollow in content. I think for me I would've preferred having the same type\/quality of readings as in the first couple of weeks (though some of them were a bit long). I think having rubrics for the papers\/projects more in advance and with more fleshed out expectations could've helped clear up confusion around assignments too.",
                "Strengths: Having professors who are design thinkers means they have put in a lot of thought into every aspect of the course, and it showed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Cannot think of any except for the 7pm timing.",
                "Strengths of the course were the weekly memos, which helped to develop a deeper understanding of the topics of study. Class sessions were engaging and informative, however not much time was devoted to the material, which I would have appreciated."

And not just for Education Studies students; if a student was interested in school reform and creative problem-solving and was looking for a seminar that allows for group learning, and group-designed projects-- this is a great class for them as well. If I could take this class again, I would!",

The lessons you will in design thinking, the framing of problems, and the construction of solutions make this class phenomenal for all areas of interest. Even if you are not solely interested in education innovation, the lessons are applicable and it is nice to be in a classroom that truly feels like everything is intentional. You will walk away stunned at how well run a course at Yale can be when the planning is contextual and intentional!",
                "Yes! I will unironically say that this changed my approach to problem solving, especially within organizations. I think that understanding a problem deeply is a step that I personally didn't think too much about beforehand, but which I now see as quite critical to problem solving - and I think developing this class developed this framework very well. Also it's a fun class! - Take it if you have any interest in education\/educational organizations.",
                "Absolutely! It is not an education studies-specific course. The skills I learned are transferable to my major and other certificate.",
