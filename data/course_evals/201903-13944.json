    "Analytical writing skills, how to discuss interesting\/abstract questions as a group, concepts about nature\/ecology\/ecotourism",
    "I gained a lot of experience in having discussions and grew a lot as a writer.",
    "Through this course I most definitely got better at formulating a claim and strengthening that claim throughout my paper.",
    "SUCH valuable feedback on my analytical and creative writing. I further practiced my skills in close reading as well. I was most impressed by the way Helen talked about and taught analytical writing which I really appreciated. She started off by just assigning us to write a paragraph, that we would then fold into a bigger argument. They way she setup class was so good for workshopping and refining my work",
    "The class honed my writing style and ability to communicate ideas with clarity. I developed a solid knowledge of different bodies of nature writing and come out of the class with a new appreciation for the natural world, \"the essay\", and philosophical thought."

   "comments": [
    "The class was taught very well. The only way it could've been improved for me personally was if we read less Thoreau, but that isn't a legitimate weakness.",
    "I really enjoyed the subject, especially when we had the freedom to choose something that interested us.",
    "Strengths: Helen is very accommodating and I never felt rushed with deadlines. If she felt as though we needed or deserved an extension, she would happily extend the deadline for the entire class. She was also incredibly helpful in giving us feedback for at least one of our drafts during the paper writing process. Furthermore, she spaced out the paper deadlines (ie making multiple drafts due) very well and that definitely helped keep me on track for writing a good essay. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the subject matter got a bit redundant and not as exciting.",
    "SO MANY STRENGTHS! Incredibly thoughtful feedback and 1-on-1 time with Helen was so useful. I loved reading Thoreau, Cronon, Emerson, Oliver, Merton, and many other great writers. The only small small piece of constructive feedback was Bill Bryson's A Walk in the Woods. I didn't find it as philosophical or \"great writing,\" and I prefer reading something like that on my own, over break or something. Instead, I would want an english class to focus on more challenging texts with many interpretations and close readings that I wouldn't be able to full unpack on my own.",
    "Sometimes, I felt that we moved too quickly through bodies of work and that we were not able to spend as much time dissecting them. Even in class I wish we spent more time on certain ideassometimes it felt like we moved on too quickly in the discussion for our thoughts to develop. For example, I wish we could have spent more time understanding the rhetorical tactics that Mary Oliver, Dale and Newman, and even Thoreau employed in their writing, or really drilled into one of the nature author's works for a class or two. With that said, the class successfully gave me a \"flavor\" of a wide range different nature scholars and ideas, which I definitely feel well-versed in. Other than that, there was excellent and thorough feedback on my different essays, which I greatly appreciated and improved my writing. The workshops in class along with our engaged discussions were good for that too.",
    "The largest strength of this course, in my opinion, was that it taught us to write in a variety of styles (basic analytic paper, research paper, personal essay). My class was also very small (only 7 students) which made it into a very comfortable environment where everyone raised their hand. Another strength was that was received a lot of feedback on all of our essays.\r\nThe biggest weakness that I can think of has to do with the English department's grading policy. It definitely felt as though getting an A on an essay was very difficult, and though I do see how this is a good thing in many ways, I think the standards for an A could be lowered slightly (given that an A represents the range from 93-100, I think it's reasonable that an A could be given to a paper that is not deserving of a departmental award)."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. The professor is great, the material is engaging and thought-provoking, and the workload isn't too bad.",
    "Yes, great for beginning writers",
    "Yes, this is a great course if you want to improve your analytical writing skills.",
    "100%. Helen is one of the kindest and most well-prepared teachers I have ever had. She is so affirmative, so smart, and so understanding. The works we read are just amazing, and I love the way Helen always asks us to reflect with mini journal prompts, make word maps, notice patterns etc. to think about the readings in new ways. I felt so supported in this class environment and I looked forward to it every day!",
    "Yes. It's a perfect class because there isn't much work.",
    "This course is unique and important in today's world, where conversations about nature have the ability to influence decisions that impact our entire world. I would recommend Nature and Healing because I learned an incredible amount about how humanity understands our place on the world, and thus, how we have shaped it. The class is great for those looking to explore the humanities and develop their writing skills.",
    "Yes and no. If you're a confident writer, I don't think I would advise taking this class, seeing as there are so many English classes at Yale, and I find it likely that courses that are not 114 or 115 may delve deeper into subjects and be more interesting as a result. However, if you're not confident with your writing, or are on the fence at all, I think English 114 does a good job of introducing you to college-level analytical writing and would thus recommend it."
