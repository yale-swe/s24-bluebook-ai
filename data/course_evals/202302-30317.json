I can sense my muscle for academic reading growing by the day. I'm really pleased about it. \r\nIn terms of concrete knowledge from the course, I'm grateful that I know much more about American Anthropology than three weeks ago. And as someone who didn't grow up physically in the U.S. but has always been virtually living in the English world through the Internet and whatnot, the knowledge from this course is a valuable asset.",
