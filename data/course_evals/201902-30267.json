    "I really like the cycle of practice--critique---painting. I think the pace can be faster.",
    "I love that I could see all my classmates' works. We were a  class of 11 students so it was nice to see others' differences and strength and we were glad to give each other advice.",
    "I felt like the timeline on some of the projects was really too short for me to feel confident in what I was producing, but the feedback during crits was very helpful.",
    "The strengths of the course are that you are able to get individual critiques from the course and that you are able to learn directly from the professor due to small class size. The engagement with other students was also enriching."

    "I would if she\/he had ever wanted to learn painting.",
    "Yes especially for up and coming painters. They will definitely learn a lot from Professor Sophy. She tries to bring out your talent by giving her ideas in a very respectful manner. She treats everyone fairly. If she will offer an advance class I will definitely enroll."
