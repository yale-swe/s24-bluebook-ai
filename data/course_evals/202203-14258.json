                "This course is very discussion based, so it is important that people participate, but otherwise fantastic.",
                "The readings were consistently stimulating and interesting. The syllabus was a nice overview of the intellectual discourse of the sublime over time, and it was a nice balance between breadth and depth. However, we would only discuss a few sentences of each text (if not less) each seminar, which made the actual classes feel useless. I seldom walked away from class thinking that I had gained a better grasp of the texts or that I had learnt anything substantial. A lot of the time we focused on the authors themselves in relation to broad contexts, instead of the actual content of the readings. Moreover, discussions seemed open at first, but always ended up skewing towards what students thought the professor wanted to hear instead of actually being a space for us to raise different perspectives. The discussion environment could also be better because some students would talk a lot and others not at all.",
                "I think that some of the discussions were hard to follow due to my lack of knowledge in religion. The readings that arent super intertwined with religion were interesting though.",
                "Strengths: lots of discussions, passionate and nice professor\r\nWeaknesses: difficult to pay attention sometimes, essay prompts could be a bit vague",
                "The professor is really passionate and knowledgeable about what he does. The class is very discussion based and he gives everyone an opportunity to speak. The class really changed my perception of a lot of fundamental ideas of what it means to be human, divine, transcend boundaries, and more.",
                "I thought that this course could more efficiently use class time. Usually class was spent simply reading over the assigned readings for the week without much involved discussion. Many students were able to get by without doing any work for the class.",
                "Strengths: discussion section allows for a better understanding of text\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: texts can be incredibly difficult to read, not much help deciphering text"

I think the class expanded my views of a lot of things in life, so I would recommend this course if you have the chance to take it. Professor Soles helps you a lot with learning how to write college essays as well.",

                "I would not recommend this course unless the student was very interested in the material at hand. A course on the sublime that failed to establish a working definition was not very effective. Many times it felt that none of the students were engaged."
