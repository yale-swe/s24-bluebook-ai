Much of the content involves current events, and Professor Landemore seems to change the content depending on what has recently happened in the world of deliberative democracy.",
                "The course was crucial in rethinking how the state power could be distributed in a democracy. When one mentions democracy, there is a natural tendency to think about a party-based system, wherein the legislature is formed using electoral battles. This course provided deep philosophical and historical material in favor of thinking otherwise, to imagine a system wherein every citizen has an equal chance to be a lawmaker irrespective of their muscle or money power.",
                "Writing, reading, political knowledge",
                "Its hard to answer this question because I feel like I learned a lot in this class. Professor Landemore is clearly passionate about this topic and wants students to engage with the material. Lectures were more like seminars and we were encouraged to ask questions and debate with out the pressure of a seminar. Because is was so passionate and a GREAT lecturer learning was really facilitated. However, the assignments were not reflective."

Therefore, we get to see and analyze how the theory we discuss in class plays out on the ground. \r\n2. The courses emerge from a general disenchantment among the people with the current system. Therefore, it was amazing to see how everyone brought in their input, which enriched the class discussion. \r\n3. Professor Landemore's experiences in the French Citizens' Assemblies. \r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n1. I'd love to read more material, preferably local texts, analysing the impacts that citizen assemblies have made.",
                "Loved it / great teacher",
                "Professor Landemore is passionate about this topic and really did her best to facilitate learning by making herself approachable and very kind. The assignments were structured in a way that really made students critically think about the topics. however (and I truly mean this) the grading was extremely harsh for no reason and did not take into account effort or critical thinking. Feedback was scarce and harsh by a TA instead of the Professor. Do not take this course unless you want to throw off your GPA and spend and make a herculean effort (coming from a polisci major that has taken many classes in the major)."

Although this class is a philosophy exercise, it has real implications in giving you the critical thinking skills and context to reimagine democracy for the better. I entered this class as a person disillusioned with the current state of politics in the U.S. and learned a lot of valuable insight that has informed my future academic path.",

                "Yes definitely",
                "No. For the majority of the semester I really really enjoyed taking this class. I thought Professor Landemore lectures were amazing and super engaging. She is one of the rare professors that really cares about teaching and exposing students to cool concepts. However, the grading was ridiculously harsh and critical (and was done by a TA). It is truly a shame because I feel like I learned a lot and Landemore was a GREAT professor. That being said its not worth tanking your GPA and not even get good feedback. Perhaps if it was not graded by a TA my recommendation would be different."
