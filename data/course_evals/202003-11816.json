For example, I had practically no experience with close-reading before this class. In high school, too, we were often expected to write based off much more specific prompts, discussing the text in a much broader way. I believe that, after having taken this class, I have a better grasp on what literary analysis means at the college level, and I am more equipped to reach the depth that we are expected to achieve. I also feel as though I have a better grasp on the relationship between authors; although I'd heard of many of these writers and their texts before, I was not aware of how closely they were related to one another.",

                "Strengths:  co-teaching (with two amazing professors), fascinating lectures, Professor Hodgkin beginning each class with a response text, writing support, a few chances for slightly more creative assignments and essays \r\nWeaknesses: uneven time spent on texts (it was sad that we only had a day on Sappho, but a month on Homer), a lot of the curriculum feels similar (mostly epic poetry by ancient Western men) and should be updated",
                "Strengths: the readings were engaging and fun \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class discussions did not feel so productive and did not always help me understand the work better or feel so necessary",
                "I thought we did just the right amount of reading in DS - 10 books is a hefty amount but wasn't overwhelming. When studying for the final I really enjoyed seeing all the themes of the semester tie together, and I think the syllabus for Literature stood on its own much more so than H&P or Philosophy.",
                "To be frank, I can't think of many weaknesses. I thought this was a wonderful course, and I enjoyed it greatly. No text that we read felt out-of-place.",
                "Strengths: This course was really intensive and took a really broad view of understanding the canon.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Short, superficial covering of all the texts. Sometimes, entire sections that we spent 2-4 hours reading just never came up to talk about.",
                "One strength was that I was always motivated to complete the entire course reading. In other DS classes I would skip different readings, but I ended up reading everything in here because I enjoyed it all. One weakness is that I received no feedback after September which I felt hindered my growth as a student."

Our class discussions flowed very well and I appreciated the interactive use of screen sharing to annotate and make timelines, etc.",
                "I think that, in general, DS did a very good job adapting to online learning. I remember thinking that the lecture on the New Testament by Professor Nasrallah had a particularly good and helpful format -- I believe she had a transcript, perhaps, of her lecture running alongside the video? It would be great if there were more lectures like that in the future.",
                "The course was run fine online, and pretty similarly to most courses. There were opportunities for online office hours regularly and an attempt to maintain normal classroom procedure. There was a creation of a 'buddy' system to have a partner to work with outside class, but there was no follow through system."

                "Yes!  I love literature, but I was a little hesitant about ancient literature.  I ended up loving the content of the course as well as the professors.  The books we read in Literature were my favorite out of all the DS classes.",

                "This course is very interesting, and certainly covers a lot of interesting content. I highly recommend further exposure to the canon, not for any grand life-changing reason beyond the fact that its very interesting, and I think Yale students should populate their time with interesting courses. Similarly, as opposed to reading the works on your own, the dialogue and further information given my professors allows for an enhancement to the text.\r\n\r\nThe in-class discussion was very deep and made me think in a way that was structurally much more different and much more deep than any high school literary course. That said, the course, at least as delivered to me, wasn't very good at providing me with feedback or really structuring it in a way that allowed me to grow as a student. I think feedback is important for any progress or growth, and I think the lack of it really constricted my ability to grow and become a successful literary analyzer."
