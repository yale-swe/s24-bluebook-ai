                "Overall, the class was pretty well adapted to Zoom.  It would have been nice to get to see some of these bones in person (even if through some kind of outside scheduled office hours) but especially for a virtual class, I was surprised at how well I feel I know human osteological anatomy coming away from the class.",
                "The lectures were pretty boring and I wish we got the bone set to take home. It was really hard to visualize things online.",
                "The major strength is how straightforward it is. Professor Sargis makes it clear what bones and muscles you need from the get go, so you never have to worry about missing anything important. The weakness this semester was the lack of an in person lab due to COVID.",
                "It was pretty tough to teach in a virtual setting",
                "Lectures are organized very clearly, expectations are very straightforward, wouldn't regret taking it",
                "Recorded review sessions would have been helpful, with specific tips on how to remember challenging bones.",
                "Great professor and TAs! They were all really supportive with helping students succeed. Great course in which students needed no prior experience or knowledge to learn and do well. The course was not very engaging, but I would owe this to the fact that it was completely virtual, which meant that students could not physically go into the classroom to directly interact with the bones. It was not very interesting to learn about bones through pictures and PDF slides, but I think the professor did as best a job as possible given the circumstances. and provided a lot of online learning resources.",
                "This course is organized wonderfully for student learning. Even though the reading have all of the information, Professor Sargis does a great job lecturing and driving home the most important points and preparing us for exams.",
                "Strengths: I think Prof. Sargis did a great job adapting this course to the virtual format. Something that this course is excellent at is laying out, very explicitly and unambiguously, what is going to be tested and what is not (most notably through the study guide). This helped streamline my studying, and helped me understand what was important in the material. The lab session before the quizzes were very helpful. \r\nWeaknesses: We learned a lot of bony features but I think I would like to learn a bit more about why those features were chosen. Sometimes it made sense (e.g. connection point of important soft tissue) but other times, it seems some features were highlighted in lecture but not in the study guide and I didn't know why (like the nutrient foramen).",
                "the amount of information you need to learn for quizzes is not overwhelming but you still leave the course having gained a lot of knowledge and cool facts. however, it's easy to disengage from the course as we aren't tested on most of the biology that prof. Sargis lectures on."

                "I felt like the class was really not suited to virtual learning at all. It is extremely difficult to get a real sense of what all of the bones look like from a screen. Our professor would ask us about features on the bones that are virtually impossible to see or identify in a 2D image, but that's what we had to do. The grading and workload was very fair though, so I can't complain at all on that front.",
                "I sometimes wished the lectures were recorded to allow more flexibility with reviewing the material, but I appreciate that all lectures slides and study guides were uploaded to Canvas. The virtual lecture was not very engaging, but I think this was due to the Zoom format not being very interactive.",
                "The curriculum was modified to fit virtual learning, so we didn't have to know every feature or side some bones that were not pictured well enough. The online 3D models were very helpful and quite realistic. Professor Sargis offered a lot of alternate sites that would help us see the features we needed to identify.",
                "Prof. Sargis did an excellent job adjusting the course for the virtual situation. I appreciated that he also made sure to clarify when there was a particular feature that would be tested in person but not virtually. It was not easy transitioning a course like this into a virtual format--since so much of the learning is not just visual but tactile--but I think it was done quite well for this course! \r\nJust a small note, I'm wondering how much it costs to purchase a set of bones. It would be nice to be able to see and feel them up close but maybe that is unrealistic for the virtual format. \r\nAlso, I'm not sure why the lectures for this course weren't recorded.",

                "If you want a gut, yes. It would probably be way more interesting in person. I wish we could've gone in person and handled the bones but obviously COVID ruined everything. Oh well.",
                "Yes, great extra class to add to your schedule. Pretty interesting topic and no prior knowledge or experience is needed to learn and do well. Low workload and not challenging. You have to put in the time to study for the quizzes which can be tedious, but reviewing the material a couple days before the quiz is really all you need to do well in this class. Not an engaging lecture course with the virtual format, but hopefully it will be more engaging and interactive when the class is moved back to in-person.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course as an interesting and engaging science credit. I think just knowing anatomy is important and, at the very least, fun. Professor Sargis is a great and engaging lecturer. This course is pretty heavy on memorization and heavier on work approaching quizzes, but the labs prepare you well for the exams and the professor and TFs walk you through the labs as well. The textbook is helpful and so are the class slides. I found it pretty simple to find what I needed to keep up with the class and do well on assessments.",
                "I would recommend this course for students. It was pretty easy and investing. If you study before the tests for a few days you will get an A, which is a nice reassurance in the mix of your other classes. I also think I came away with fun facts about bones that I can tell friends.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. The expectations for the quizzes are extremely clear, so that you know exactly what you need to study and what you don't. Same is true for the course, Prof. Sargis makes it very clear what you need to do at the start to do well.\r\n90-95% of the work in this course is memorization. The cutoffs for getting an A in this course are not very strict. This course, I assume, is also a great primer for osteology\/physiology courses in med school, if you are interested in that.",
                "yes, it's a very relaxed course (only 4 quizzes that you can probably study for starting a few days in advance) but you can still learn a lot!"
