It emphasizes creativity and storytelling in a fun and engaging way, and I learned to really let my own interests and passions lead me in surprising directions on whichever project we were doing in a given week, and as a STEM major it gave me a rare chance to tap into a more creative side that will help me elsewhere throughout my time here and beyond.",

                "I was able to just be creative and learned to trust my intuition. I got better at group projects.",
                "This class teaches you to let go of the perfectionism that nearly every Yale student clings to.",
                "I learned some fundamental lessons in art and creativity. I honed my skills in story-telling and media usage.",
                "Working on this course taught me a lot about creativity and what about how and when to use that creativity. It really forced me to sit down and have to work on something, have to move forward. Being on certain deadlines meant that I am I had to think very quickly about different projects and I also had to think very quickly about what I wanted people to seeing what the end result would be. I love the space and I loved having access to so many different things at once and I think it allowed me to have a much better understanding about how I wanted to work as an artist, and how I want to be as an artist what my process I wanted to have.",
                "I learned a great deal about the visual world and how to handle various mediums of artistic expression.",
                "I put to use my inner child's creativity that has been locked away and almost forgotten about these past years of high school leading up to college. Using ordinary objects, often trash, to create stories of fictional worlds and out-of-this-world (literally!) projects."

I think the biggest weakness without there is no real canvas and there is no way of knowing like when anything was or exactly like what the instructor wanted from us from different project with what that was supposed to look like. I know this mightve also been his first year working on this course understand that we like a lack of examples but at the same time it was really sometimes going in blind when it came to different projects and stuff.",

                "If you want a course where you learn by making kites, flags, puppet shows, fashion runways, Rube Goldberg machines, and more, then this is the course for you. Most projects are designed to be concentrated within the class time, which allows you to really let your creativity shine without being hindered by other obligations. As a first-year student still learning the ropes and what this school had to offer, it showed me that there's much more than simply your normal, academic-heavy courses. This is a truly unique course that I doubt you'll find anywhere else at Yale, and I highly encourage anyone to try it.",
                "ABSOLUTELY. If this class is ever offered again, take it take it take it. It tremendously improved my time at Yale. The sheer absurdity of it combined with the freedom to make and morph and alter is something that was incredibly valuable to me.",

                "I would recommend this course. However, I would say that the course description set expectations that were different from how the class actually was. The course description implied a more philosophical or scientific learning to creativity with application after, rather than just application. I would need to make that clear before I recommend the course.",
                "Yes, definitely.",
                "I would not only recommend you take this course, but implore you to take it. Its a great reprieve from the academic rigor of college where you can explore untapped parts of yourself in the process of creating things that only ever seemed to exist in your dreams.",
                "Yes. I felt like a kid allowed to play around and explore again. There was no wrong way to do things."
