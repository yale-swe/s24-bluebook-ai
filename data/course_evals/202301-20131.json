                "I think the course had a good selection of literature spanning centuries-old literature to works by current authors, which provided a framework for us to discuss different eras of French literary history (and history in general) as we read. The inclusion of oral presentations by students on topics of our choice was a nice way to allow us to explore an area of literature/history we were particularly interested in. One change I think might help students get more out of readings would be lecturing about the history of the author/the time period of the readings during the class before we discuss the reading rather than on the day that the reading has been assigned for, because then we would be able to read already knowing the historical context or having some information about the author and their writing that helps us understand what we read more fully and be better-prepared for robust discussions."

Some of the readings are time-consuming (at least if you are not completely fluent), but I found that even reading the material that was more difficult to understand was a good way to expand my vocabulary even though it did make some of the readings take a long time."
