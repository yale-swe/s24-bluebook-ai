                "Learned about the theoretical frameworks of race (e.g. critical race theory, analyzing the ways in which race is formed/impacts society), place (how are material places imbued with meaning and how they impact how people in these places behave), and memory (how events/values/etc. are passed from generation to generation and how they translate into present action), and the ways in which each of these frameworks impacts schooling, particularly in several different educational geographies. The essays helped us engage with these frameworks particularly to geographies relevant to ourselves."

                "Strengths- Errol is a fantastic professor and human being! He is empathetic and warm and made me look forward to coming to class each week. The policies and grading were beyond fair- it showed that he was most invested in our learning, which I deeply appreciated.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Just one minor thing- I wish the work of my classmates would have been more visible/we had been more collaborative. However, I do also think my class was a little shy at first.",
                "Strengths: the topic matter + theoretical frameworks are quite interesting, and I found it useful to apply them to my own schooling; in particular the essays I wrote for this class all felt really meaningful, and I got a lot out of them by analyzing schooling through the lenses provided. Errol is a very engaging teacher and very knowledgeable on the subject he teaches. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think that we could've engaged with more whole-class discussions, which tended to be a bit rare. Personally for me, I don't engage with lengthy readings/books that well, so I found the readings/books a bit hard to get through; on the other hand, there was a week when we were doing a case study on Chicago and we did multiple more 'hands-on' \"readings,\" if that makes sense, which I think would have grounded me more had they been more common throughout the course. Overall I think this course could be stellar if we drew more from the direct sources and had more specific passages of readings to draw from; though I got a lot out of the class and thoroughly enjoyed it as is."
