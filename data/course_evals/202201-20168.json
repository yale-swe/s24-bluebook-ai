                "The seminar style could be diversified a little more to include small group discussions or working with pairs mixed into working as a whole class so that everyone is able to participate more throughout class time.",
                "Not enough opportunities for class discussion and participation it was more so in the form of a lecture",
                "Strengths: Prof. Garfinkel is an engaging speaker, and the topics of discussion are interesting. I really appreciated the flexible way that graded assignments were structures and the freedom we had to choose our topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The biggest weakness I found was the amount of reading, and the fact that it often deviated from the syllabus with an email sent beforehand. This was confusing and resulted in me not doing the readings sometimes. Especially because case citation can be confusing, changing the readings all the time made it hard to find what to read.",
                "I really liked our textbooks and Professor Garfinkel is amazing and so patient!! He made the class really interesting and I loved learning.",
                "While Professor Garfinkel is very knowledgeable, he would sometimes forget to provide more room for discussion during class. He would give very good (but extensive) overviews of the readings and cases, but sometimes it would just go on for too long.",
                "The source material for this class was really interesting, and Prof. Garfinkel was great. One way I think this course could be improved is by making the class sessions a little more immersive (group or presentations by the week) so as to engage with the reading more critically.",
                "Strengths: I really enjoyed writing the papers, and all of the cases we we read were fascinating.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish Judge Garfinkel would open up the floor to more student discussions. At times, even though it was a 13-ish-person class, I felt like it was a lecture."

                "Absolutely.",
                "I would definitely recommend the course to edu. studies students or those with an interest in law. If that isn't your niche though, this isn't the class for you because you won't stay engaged.",
                "Yes! A great introduction for those interested in ed law/policy",
                "Yes!! EDST people should definitely take this!! And any one else interested in law or education related issues that are applicable to everyone.",
                "Yes! Especially if you are thinking about going to law school and want some exposure to reading from a casebook and learning how to analyze cases. Prof. Garfinkel really enjoys going over made-up problems that the textbook provides, and that really gives you a chance to test how well you understand a case and how you are able to manipulate it to make your point. Prof. Garfinkel is incredibly understanding of the busy nature of students, so is happy to go easy on you in class if you haven't had the chance to complete the readings for the week. I would say though to get the most out of the class, do the readings! I always felt really excited and eager to participate when I had done the readings, and always sat in class wishing I had done the readings when I hadn't.",
                "Yes! This course is awesome. I think the more time you can devote to this course the more you get out of it. While class periods could sometimes be dry, I really enjoyed writing the papers for this class and found the experience of critically engaging with the content to be really enriching.",
                "Yes, I think so. Judge Garfinkel is such a knowledgeable mentor, and the cases are interesting. Just know that you might not be involved in class discussions as much as you want to be."
