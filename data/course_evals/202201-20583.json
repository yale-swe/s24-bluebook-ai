                "The class discussions are dynamic, and its nice that students take turns guiding them in their own style. I think talking about the final paper earlier in the semester and in more detail would be helpful, and more feedback on the reaction papers would help students know whether theyre on the right track or not.",
                "Repetitive course structure which can get boring. The information was interesting but class could be slow. Also had no idea what my grade was until it came back at the end of the semester",

                "The materials are interesting, and professor Ferguson is great. The conversations was disorganized sometimes, and it's all at the whims of the discussion leaders."
