                "The breadth of material used was definitely a strength of this course. Being able to animate with references to history was a really interesting opportunity. The guest artists had really insightful commentary on how to create art.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness is that many of the things introduced in class would be much better in person, as the Edison museum. I think working with digital animation at some point would remedy this",
                "The course was very broad and approached animation in a number of different ways. The projects were all varied and challenging. However, this course suffered a little from being virtual since it's a studio art course",
                "The strengths were that we were pushed to learn a lot of different ways to create moving images by hand. We were given constraints on assignments that pushed me creatively and led me to make art that I would not have made on my own. The weaknesses were that class time could've been used more for making the art and less for guest lectures and discussions."
