                "Gained a great overview of civil-military relations theory and application in a variety of settings.",
                "Knowledge in civil military relations",
                "I learned how to closely read theoretical texts related to civil-military relations, including the seminal works of Finer and Huntington, and how to apply their findings to modern-day conflicts. I gained a greater insight into how governmental structures and policies can be used to legitimize a regime, and we explored the questions of 'why do the people with guns listen to the people who don't?' or 'why does the military follow civilian orders?'. I really liked the set up of the class, as it really helped me develop essay-writing skills.",
                "Honestly not much, some basics of Civ-Mil and a few anecdotes, but this class was pretty jumbled and lackluster. We hadn't had a normal class since mid March so I can't really remember the stuff we talked about other than coups and the broad Civ-Mil concepts Objective and Subjective control.",
                "I am from a military family and Professor Lotito's knowledge, plus the readings he chose to assign allowed me to view military relations from a variety of perspectives and explore topics in a way I had not before.",
                "Learned about the civil-military relations subfield of political science, including why coups happen, coup-proofing measures, and democratization."

            "comments": [
                "Great professor, reading list, and classroom discussion. Assignments were well thought out and provided clear guidance on expectations.",
                "The strengths were the course content, and the layout of the course as it really developed your writing skills. It was pretty writing intensive, due to the weekly responses, and the literature review, research design, and final paper, but this is actually really useful for juniors who will be writing their thesis in their senior year. The weakness of the course was beyond Lotito's control - he had to go on paternity leave and was subsequently quite hard to contact for help and feedback regarding the final essay, but again this wasn't really his fault",
                "Main improvements would be to decrease the weekly reading and response workload as well as increase feedback and speed it up by many weeks. If you're going for learning, we shouldn't have crammed double weeks at the beginning and then not had class for the last month. Also the final \"presentations\" were kind of a waste because half the class hadn't started because we hadn't gotten feedback yet and the others didn't want to give a talk that was ungraded.",
                "The course was a bit disappointing this year due to external circumstances  engagement was very low at the end of the course and the class met too many times in the beginning, the pacing was not great because there was a huge gap between the high workload before spring break and our big end of the semester paper. The course has a lot of potential to be good because the material was interesting and the structure of the seminar was very conducive to learning, the execution this semester in particular was just not the best",
                "Professor Lotito put forth very engaging and thought-provoking questions in class discussions and it was an excellent experience to hear so many points of view.\r\nThis course had no weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Allows students to practice writing a full-length political science research paper from topic proposal to final paper. The Professor is nice, and the weekly reading responses (though they take a while to complete) are not so bad. || Weaknesses: While sometimes the topics were interesting, other times class discussions about such complex issues felt a little too shallow."

                "Absolutely. If you are interested in civil-military relations, this course is a must take. Professor Lotito is also great, and makes the seminar lively and intellectual.",
                "In a typical year yes, there were just a lot of events and circumstances out of our professors control that severely impacted my feelings toward the course, as I felt like he almost ditched us toward the end.",
                "Yes I would recommend this to someone who is looking to further their writing skills, especially if they are global or polisci majors. It is really interesting to consider the role of the military and civilian authorities but there were a lot of prospective future military personnel that took the class, which biased some of our discussions somewhat.",
                "Maybe In another year this class would be good, but this semester with Prof. Lotito having a kid the class kind of went to hell by the end. It also has a lot of readings that are dense and often technical. We didn't have any class after Spring break which was nice, but you'd wait for months to get feedback and it was often super brief or non-existent. I'd avoid this class and if you're interested in the subject read one of the books like \"The soldier and the changing state.\"",
                "I would probably recommend this course in another semester because professor lotito is great at facilitating a seminar and the content is really interesting!",
                "Yes, it was interesting and Prof Lotito is great.",
                "Absolutely! It was a fantastic learning experience and I plan to look for similar courses when choosing my next schedule.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is really interested in the material outlined in the syllabus. I would also recommend that the student has experience taking previous  political science courses to know what a poly sci class is like."
