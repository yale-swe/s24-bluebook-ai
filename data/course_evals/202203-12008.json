            "comments": [
                "I dont have any strengths to offer about this course. I do, however, have a handful of weaknesses to speak to. First, the title of the class was very misleading. We did not talk about Liberty, Equality or Citizenship in any critical way. The frame of the discussion on these topics were limited to the two old white philosophers we read. Seeing that the text was old, a lot of views and examples presented in the reading were outdated and discriminatory. Which brings me to my second point: the course perpetuated use of racial slurs and prejudice analysis of non-white cultures. The Prof. offered no recognition of these harmful stereotypes which in turn encouraged many in the class to casually use racial slurs and prejudice analysis of non-white cultures. At the very least, it could have been explicitly, briefly stated that the class should not use such terms and make such references to prohibit the harm perpetuated onto students whose background was targeted. Third: the grading of papers was arbitrary. The Prof. offered no rubric to any of the papers. Instead, papers were graded not off the understanding of class material, but menial grammatical structures. This is pointed as a weakness in this class because it is not a writing credit, and it punishes an understanding of the material. My last critique of the class is that it was not engaging, and there were no structural arrangements in the class to make it engaging. If I could suggest one thing for this class is for there to be a pedagogical partner, however, I dont think the Prof. would opt in for the program.",
                "We moved a little slowly through the material, and I might have appreciated the readings to be a little more interspersed\/alternating (rather than spending half the semester on Montesquieu, and then the next half on Rousseau).",
                "I really enjoyed the classroom discussionsince there were only about 11-12 of us, everyone had an opportunity to share and argue their ideas. Prof. Wilford really allowed each student the chance to flesh their thoughts out loud, and moderated discussion well. Lastly, readings were short enough to not overwhelm students, but detailed and relevant enough to be able to provide several points of discussion.\r\nIt could be improved by better pacing with chapters, but even then the slow pacing towards the beginning of the course wasnt too ineffectiveit made room for more discussion.",
                "Strengths: This class highly develops your skills of close reading. The professor is very well-spoken and incredibly knowledgable about these thinkers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We did not really engage with the texts critically. The ideas were not often placed in conversation with historical events or modern politics.  A consequence of reading the texts in an isolated fashion was that the class did not confront their discriminatory and often racist messages. The professor gave no dialogue or disclaimer on the racial slurs and prejudices present throughout the texts, which led to their continued use throughout the class. It is important to understand these lines of thinking, as it is indicative of political and societal thought of the time and it's important to understand how the past affects the present, but the professor made no attempt to recognize the harm caused by these prejudices nor any attempt to stop reproducing these harmful languages among the class discussions.\r\nIn addition, the grading for the class could be confusing at times. It would be helpful in the future if there was a rubric.",

                "I would not recommend this course. You wont engage with it and the payoff wont work in your favor because the Prof.s grading isnt about what you understand of the course, but rather, if youve written the essays in a rigid way. I went to a writing partner for one of the essays, who says my essay was good to turn in, still the Prof. had structural comments on my paper rather than constructive feedback about interpreting material.",
                "Absolutely, especially if they already enjoy philosophy. I myself didnt think I would enjoy this class before I took it I can assuredly say it is very interesting and applicable to a modern day society, where it has curious implications.",
                "Yes because it completely opened me up to the idea of political philosophy."
