                "The weakness of this course was that it was very unstructured. There were no designated PSETS, homework due dates, etc. There was a lack of instruction in many of the homework assignments and projects. If the course was more structured with its assignments and lectures I think it would be beneficial.",
                "The strengths of this course is how it is broken down into 5 main categories suited for grads\/ undergrad seniors. The main weakness was how early we had to wake up for the course.\r\n\r\nAlso I wished we covered more statistical tests and how to deal with different types of large data.",
                "Strengths of the class included the variety of data-analysis and modeling techniques covered. This class served as a great introduction to these quantitative methods in MB&B and could be used as a starting point to develop these skills further depending on relevancy to one's research interests. However, the syllabus and instructors were unclear, especially the final project, which took place during finals period and had a presentation and a final report component. More communication could have been provided to allow students to develop the proper expectations and plan around the final project, rather than having it sprung on us in the last few classes. Also, some of the final project topics seemed to be harder than others."
