                "This course has only strengths! I absolutely love this language, and the classroom model translated surprisingly well over Zoom. The work was very enjoyable (or, at the very least, educational), and I always looked forward to going to class.",
                "This was a great course. The course was very well organized and went through a lot of content in a short period of time. I think a major strength is the constant practice of signs from the current unit and previous units. Also, there is a good balance between practicing sign production yourself and comprehending others' signs. The only weakness I can think of are due to the way Zoom restricts the signing space.",
                "Strengths: The class is well organized, with clear expectations and structure. I enjoyed the flipped model of the class, because it allowed class time to be used for practicing new vocabulary learned in regular conversation. We received helpful feedback regularly that helped to advance our skills. No weaknesses!",
                "The professor organizes the course very well and the canvas page is set up nicely so you don't miss assignments. She is also very understanding about assignments.",
                "strengths: very well organized and easy to keep up with what assignments were due when, variety of different types of practice of vocabulary and grammar, engaging final project, incredible professor  \r\nweaknesses: none",
                "Dr. K is fantastic! Her class is so organized and she is probably the kindest prof at Yale.",
                "The course was very organized, especially for being virtual. The topics were presented in a way that was easy to grasp and built on previous knowledge. I can't think of any weaknesses!",
                "Dr. K did a great job of giving feedback, and I felt like I was always on track to improve.",

                "Dr. K did an incredible job gearing this course towards learning during the pandemic. Our class time was always well-spent, and I think we benefitted from the virtual format in that sign memorization was done before class, through videos. That way, we could replay them as many times as we needed to learn signs, which is something that wouldn't have happened in person. The only thing I think this class lacked was due to the pandemic (and thus unavoidable): more conversation in person.",

Mostly, the robust Canvas page made it very easy to stay up to date on assignments and have an easy reference for old vocab. Also, breakout rooms made it easy to stay voice-off by using the chat, and practice signing in smaller groups.",
                "Activities that were normally in person (such as games), were converted to virtual versions, but they were still very effective. It was harder to interact with people who weren't in the smaller groups we were assigned to at the beginning of the semester."

This was a very engaging and interesting course, and I could not recommend it more -- whether you are seeking to fulfill a language credit, or just take L1 to learn some ASL foundation.",

I don't know how different of an experience it will be without Dr.K as this is her last semester at Yale but this class made me fall even more love with American Sign Language and really made me feel like a more capable communicator and better signer."
