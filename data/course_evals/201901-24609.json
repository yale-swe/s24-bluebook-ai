    "I learned a lot about how to do history about intellectual movements, and I learned a lot about the intellectual movement that led to the Constitution.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about the origins of the US Constitution, the decision to write and ratify the document, and the popular interpretations of the document. The response papers (6-8 pages) taught be a lot about analyzing the primary sources we had read and setting them in contrast with each other.",
    "Great course that allowed me to learn about the history of the Constitution in a very detailed manner",
    "This was a good course leading up to the 1787 Constitution and its context. Definitely not a constitutional interpretation course, and not billed as one!",
    "Gained a deep understanding of the intellectual history of Anglo-American constitutionalism.  Saw how that was borne out in colonies.",
    "I learned so much in this class. I had never really had a solid education about the founding of the US, and this class provided an extensive and really engaging dive into that history. We learned not only about the extensive history around the Constitution and Articles of Confederation, but we also discussed how law since the Magna Carta informed the document.",
    "This course gave me interesting historical context to the creation of the U.S Constitution. While most discussion about the constitution focuses on interpretation, this course explored how and why the Constitution was enacted in 1787. By looking back to early colonial history and understanding the events of the time and motivations of the founders, this course provided a unique and informative look at the Constitution.",
    "This class gave me a deep insight into the constitutional tradition and history of the United States starting from even before colonial times.",
    "This class gave me a great deal of understanding on a topic that I thought I understood somewhat before but realized that there was so much more to learn."

   "comments": [
    "The course was well-taught and I enjoyed it. I think that more guidance on the final research paper would have been valuable. We had no outline or proposal or any other discussions about the paper till the week it was do, which I think caused a lot of stress for the students. Additionally, sometimes the reading was very dense and unreasonable long.",
    "Participation was difficult because it seemed to be predicated on having preexisting knowledge or being willing to really aggressively raise your hand. The readings were very long, but it also seemed like the professor never expected us to read all of them (he would make comments to that effect), which just doesn't make sense to me - I'm willing to do a lot of reading, but my interest in the readings declined rather quickly after one week he assigned us almost 600 pages and then after I struggled through them commented that that wasn't even expected.",
    "Would have liked if Prof. Peterson allowed for the class to thoroughly discuss the readings during the seminar. Often felt like a lecture.",
    "I honestly think this class might have been better as a lecture  Professor is very interesting and engaged, but since it's not history from which the facts can be taken as knowledge for granted, a structure of lecture and section might have been more engaging.",
    "Reading assignments could maybe be a bit more focused.",
    "My only complaint about this class is that it started at 9:25, so I rarely felt like I could handle anything until about halfway through the class. Other than that, this class is great.",
    "The way our discussions were run was one of the greatest strengths. I always looked forward to the way our readings and discussion topics would perfectly combine to highlight or reveal some interesting point about the Constitution. I would have appreciated more structure and feedback about the writing assignments.",
    "The readings and discussion of this course is very well done.",
    "Though we began to do this somewhat at the end of the semester it could have been nice to have some other kinds of activities besides discussion like prepared debates or something else like that."

   "comments": [
    "If you like American history and want to learn more about the legal and political traditions that created our country, this is a good class. You'll definitely learn a lot more if you do the readings though.",
    "Yes, this class will change the way you understand the United States Constitution. Professor Peterson does a really good job explaining the British origins of the Revolution and the Constitution, things that are rarely taught in American schools. You get to read the notes from the Constitutional Convention and ratifying debates, which will definitely improve your understanding of the document.",
    "If youre interested in the US constitution, yes. Great course that allows you to delve deep with the material.",
    "Absolutely. For anyone interested in US history, law, or constitutionalism.",
    "I highly recommend this class. Peterson is a great professor, incredibly engaging, knows his stuff backwards and forwards, and works really hard to make sure everyone is up to speed. The readings are fairly extensive, but were worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about U.S History and specifically Constitutional history. This is not a course intended for future lawyers or constitutional scholars.",
    "This course is great and helps give a great insight into many of today's institutions and foundations."
