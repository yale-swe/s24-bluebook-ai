                "My German improved greatly taking this course. I gained a lot of confidence speaking, and am much more comfortable writing longer essays in German.",
                "The course helps you get a coherent understanding of the link between the German language and city culture, thanks to the way the course is split into 6 blocks, each dedicated to a new city in Germany. I was able to polish my German, enrich vocabulary, and refresh grammar -- all of the components needed to use the language freely. Lastly, the German movies that were included in the syllabus provided a helpful insight in the contemporary culture of Germany.",
                "More than any previous class, I felt like my German skills greatly improved",
                "This course covered all aspects of German (reading, writing, speaking, listening), but the one we focused on most was speaking. Shila did a fantastic job sparking conversation, and I feel like I learned more in our discussions than I did from any textbook. The class environment was based on mutual respect, trust, and attention to detail. Shila always let us speak freely and then gave targeted, helpful feedback.",
                "- an expanded German vocabulary range on topics involving social issues, environmental problems, cultural differences, day-to-day conversations etc. \r\n- cultural knowledge about different cities in Germany as well as historical understanding of the separation and re-unification of the country during the 20th century\r\n- essential grammar (e.g. adjective and article ending rules, case coordination, word order etc.)\r\n- understanding of several different cases (e.g. simple past, imperfect, pluperfect, conditional, future) and voices (e.g. active and passive voices)",
                "I became better at reading, writing and speaking in german. This includes grammar",

                "I think this is a fantastic course. I would say that the structure of the course can mean that certain weeks feel quite overwhelming in terms of the amount of vocabulary and grammar that we cover. It felt like we had a lot more to learn for some tests than for others. In general, though, the frequency of testing and of other essays made a lot of sense. I liked MindTap's homework system, and I learned a huge amount through the semester.",
                "Strengths: the course is well-organized and systematized, the blocks are well-distributed, and are particularly helpful for those of the students who did not have a chance to visit Germany before taking the class.  \r\nWeaknesses: an additional emphasis on grammar could be helpful. It is unfortunate that the Mindtap book, which costs $100+ is so poorly organized when it comes to provided examples of how different rules of German grammar are used.",
                "This course was fantastic for improving my speaking and listening skills. The oral\/aural component of the class was extremely helpful, and I thinkalthough it was challenging at firstit helped me more than a more balanced curriculum. However, if your grammar and vocabulary background is shaky (as mine was), you might have to learn them on your own, as most class time was dedicated to interactive instruction.",
                "Strengths\r\n- absolutely incredible professor who fostered an inclusive environment that actively motivated every student to speak and thus practice oral German\r\n- the bi-weekly tests on each chapter strengthen vocabulary, grammar and cultural knowledge \r\n- learning about different cities in Germany throughout the syllabus whilst discussing social, political and cultural themes really helped contextualise what we are learning\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- sometimes the city and social\/political issue discussed in each chapter seemed unrelated\r\n- MINDTAP is an unforgiving platform so you have no leeway with deadlines (since the professor cannot make changes if you encounter problems with the software)",
                "This class being a small seminar was great because i felt like i participated more than i wouldve in a larger class, which helped me learn better. It would be noce if it were in a different room next year though. Everyone fit, but it felt a bit too snug.",
                "Strengths: I thought that the online homework was helpful, the every other week exams were good for review material, Shila is incredible and the grammar we learned felt very useful.\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't think that we reviewed past sentences structures\/conjugation and vocabulary enough. After we learned them in one unit and were tested on them, we rarely would review them or practice them again but were expected to know them. I think more repetition would have been helpful.",
                "The instructor was a huge strength. Shilas dedication and love for her students made our class super close and made us look forward to German every day. It was a daily conversation, which is what language is supposed to be, rather than a chore! The only weakness I can think of is how regimented the syllabus is, focused on churning out vocabulary and grammar memorization, for instance, rather than a natural progression focused on practicing what has been learned."

                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. So far I've taken L1-L3 in German at Yale, and I think the German sequence is extremely well taught. German is not a particularly easy language, but I think you walk away from these classes with a genuine understanding of the language and a lot of confidence communicating in it.",
                "I recommend this course for anyone who is eager to improve their knowledge of German. You will be able to enhance your speaking skills and broaden your awareness of German culture. Also, thanks to the virtual exchange part of the course, you will be able to make some friends from Germany and practice the language with them online.",
                "If you can take a German class with Shila, please do. She was both a phenomenal teacher and a wonderful and understanding person. She truly listened to students needs and checked in with us consistently. She made the difficulty of language learning as painless as possible and introduced a variety of activities to help us progress in our German ability.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Without reservation. In fact, I did. Shila is an amazing instructor, and if you have the chance to be in her German section, I cannot recommend her more highly.",
                "Definitely!! Especially if you have Shila. She is genuinely one of the greatest professors I've ever had; she cares about her students, she takes time to make everyone speak and practice German, she pushes you but also is always available to help you in any way she can. The textbook for this course is not the best, but the content of assignments and essays for the course make up for this. Meeting every day in your small class setting is very helpful, as you consolidate your learning of the language very fast. L3 is tough because it is the level where the learning curve is steepest, so honestly it is quite a lot of work. However, the rewarding aspect of your vastly improved German level after the semester is certainly worth it.",
                "Yes. You learn while taking this class and its not too much for 1.5 credits",
                "Yes absolutely! It's a great course if you want to improve your German.",
                "Absolutely, if you are invested in actually learning German."
