This course really taught me so much about historical events that were swept under the rug and allowed me to understand how all the events intertwine and connect to impact people of color today. I have come out from this class with a bigger consciousness of my indirect biases and to evaluate situations not just on the surface.",

                "I learned about the racial disparities in healthcare today, as well as its historical context -- the long and messy history of discrimination against African Americans in a medical\/scientific setting. We also learned about methods of resistance throughout history, and opportunities for improvement (what we can personally do now and going forwards) to address many of the injustices facing the healthcare system today.",

This class made me gain a lot of empathy and sympathy, and I feel like I am more prepared now to tackle issues of injustice and discrimination when I encounter them outside of the classroom.",
                "This class is insane, and I do not think I will ever take another one like it. There is so much intricate history that interconnects with health, societal structures and dynamics, race, and why modern day movements are justified and built on truly saddening and often-times maddening foundations from the salve trade to the BLM movement. It was shocking how little I thought I knew about the material. Each class ended in applause as if it was a bunch of mini-TEDtalks and every applause was deserved.",
                "The course provides a thoughtful and detailed overview of race and medicine in the US from slavery to the present with strong historical groundings. It traces many threads through history and teaches students to draw parallels, make comparisons, and dive into individual projects on topics of interest.",

Professor Roberts provided this foundation for her students so that they can understand how the issues we were facing today in the American society are deeply tied to historical racism. I learned about profound leaders in history and today (the amazing guest speakers) that I had never heard of in my high school education. I learned how deeply intelligent enslaved individuals were, especially in their healing practices, and how history has been distorted to disguise this. This was a refreshing course, I am so grateful to learn the true history, I use this in my life every day.",
                "I learned about the healthcare system in America as it relates to black Americans.",

                "It's hard to sum up all of the material that I've learned throughout the course of this semester because it's so much and all of it, not deserves, but needs to be shared. I was familiar with a lot of the material in the class yet it felt like I never knew anything at all. Professor Roberts covered a large timeline from before the Transatlantic Slave Trade to modern day and in that she broke down various topics with respect to the era of the material. It was a very conducive method of teaching and very organized from the perspective of a student.",
                "Learned how to think critically about the dark history of the U.S. as well as the racial implications in the medical field. Learned how to be a more open-minded and empathetic doctor.",
                "I learned about the history of Sickness and Health in communities of color, the (ongoing!) racialization of medicine, and discrimination within the healthcare system.",

                "The affair that race and science have that is not talked about enough",
                "You learn so much about the history of the medical system and the different ways it has continued to oppress people of color. This class covers so much important content from the way slaves were used as human test subjects for medical exploitation to mass incarceration and the racial history of policing. It genuinely changed the way I thought about the world.",
                "The class taught me how much we dont learn about how racist ideologies are so engrained in American society. It taught me about how racism can be deadly in the medical sphere.",

                "I learned about the intersection of medicine and racism.",
                "We learned about both historical events and modern history that have contributed to the current state of racism. We learned to trace specific events that occurred during the periods of slavery, summer of 1919, the yellow fever epidemic, and many others to particular lines of thinking present today.",
                "My personal growth happened throughout the semester, as I began to find ways to make small changes in how I understood the medical system. Creating the lesson plan and syllabus allowed me to comprehend how much work it takes to teach any theme in this course, such as racial science, stigma, bias, and racism in medicine, or medical exploitation. In my final project, I tasked myself with discerning how Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives would be best incorporated into the healthcare system.",
                "I was already somewhat acquainted with Black history before taking this course, but this course taught me about the struggles of Black Americans throughout the country's history on a much more intimate level than I expected. Even as a non-STEM major, the health focus of the course was so interesting; it is mind-blowing to think about how perspectives on Black health changed from slavery to the present. I also learned how to work to my own standard of excellence rather than a professor's, and it helped me gain a much healthier outlook on life as a Yale student. Take this class!",
                "I learned so, so, so muchall very, very important things. From the belief that Black people were immune to yellow fever to the racialized aspects of modern day kidney function diagnoses and eGFR, this course showed just how entrenched racism is in the U.S., produced and maintained and operating in the medical system.",
                "I learned various lessons about the history of medicine.",
                "I learned more about the history of the medical field and examined how it has shaped modern healthcare accessibility and treatment procedures. I learned how to improve my writing skills to synthesize historical content with commentary and analysis.",
                "This course taught me the history of medicine in the United States, specifically its racist origins and how those harmful legacies continue today. The course also taught me the role of academia in perpetuating violent practices and prejudices.",
                "This course covered so many things I wish I was taught earlier in my education. It focuses on racism in the healthcare system, and covers a huge range of topic within that field.",
                "I LOVED THIS CLASS! I learned so much more about the horrifying history of the U.S.",
                "I learned a LOT about the history of medical racism in the US.",
                "African and Africna American history in the context of health and disease",
                "We learned about the intertwined histories of racism and medicine dating back to the time of the Atlantic Slave Trade and extending into the present day.",
                "Greater understanding of medical racism and its violence against African Americans.",
                "How to think critically about the ways in which Black people have been and continue to be negatively impacted by modern science and medicine",
                "a paradigmatic shift to my understanding of history, as I now view history as being deeply connected to the present\r\n- a strong working knowledge on the history of medical racism in America within the larger historical contexts of the transatlantic slave trade, slavery, Jim Crow segregation (and how all of these persist in structurally racist practices and disparities today)",
                "It helped a lot in learning about the history of how medicine practices came to be.",
                "learned so much about both the history and present of healthcare in the US with respect to all different kinds of disparities",
                "How past systems of oppression are deeply intertwined with current medical care and sickness and health.",
                "I developed a deep understanding of the relationship between Black people and American medicine and its deep historical roots. This is the most impactful and important course I have taken at Yale. I feel like I have left this class with a new perspective and am so grateful I Ajax the opportunity to take this course.",
                "I learned so much about African American history and medicine! I loved this course so much!!",
                "By taking this course, I grew to be more informed about the legacy of slavery within the United States, and how that legacy is still very much alive in modern society. I've also become more aware of how biases have permeated themselves into the medical field, and the importance of being vocal about the necessity for change within this country.",
                "Historical context of the intersection of health, medicine, slavery, and race. I gained insight into current injustices and stories of medical racism that reflect the deep history of U.S. medical exploitation, exclusion, and harm towards people of African and African American descent.",
                "I learned so much about healthcare and how much of it is rooted in systemic racist medical practices.",
                "This course taught me so much. I think one of the most important things that I learned is the way in which the effects of slavery still persist in so many different fields in our everyday life. I learned to view the world in a much more intersectional, causal way. Nothing about the world is isolated; the past informs the present, housing affects health, etc. In addition to all the academic knowledge that I gained from this class, I also got such a wonderful insight into this utopian way of doing academia thanks to Prof. Roberts and the rest of the teaching staff. It was a wonderful experience being able to take a class on my own terms and I will forever be grateful that I had the opportunity to do so during my time at Yale.",
                "This course has taught me that long hidden history of African Americans' contributions to the medical field, both willingly and unwillingly. It's a brutally eye-opening course that Dr. Roberts takes care to guide you through with the intent of understanding why there continues to be disparities in health outcomes between Black and other race patients. This history is absolutely necessary to know for anyone going into the medical field, and it is an important lesson in developing empathy for your patients.",
                "We learned about the history of racism and how that has continued to create inequalities in healthcare and society. \r\n\r\nWe also learned to have challenging conversations and to challenge our own personal bias and beliefs.",
                "I learned about medicine and race, and I learned about many aspects of American history that are not covered in a typical US history class in high school. A specific line that I will take with me beyond this class is that history is necessary to understanding the present. Every issue of inequality that exists in society is a result of the history of this country, and until everyone learns the true history, perfect\/all-encompassing solutions to these issues will not be found. Slavery and",
                "I gained a good understanding of slavery and lives of enslaved people in Americas in the past.",
                "Untaught history and treating history and learning with immense care",
                "A lot about history that I didnt know.",
                "How Black people were used throughout history in the medical field and the structural racism that exists in the field today",
                "Learned how to critically analyze historical documents, learned so much about how racism lends itself to poor health outcomes in minority communities, and left motivated to change the medical system",
                "I learned a lot of deep insight about the history of African Americans and how it ties into health systems both today and of the past.",
                "I learned about the history and present day impacts of medical practices as they relate specifically to Black Americans. This course taught me parts of history that I had never been taught before, but are extremely important to understanding our current world.",
                "A deep understanding of African American history through the lens of science and medicine. Insight into the sobering reality of present day American healthcare.",
                "Learned about African American history in the United States and related health issues",
                "This course overviews racial disparities and inequities in the healthcare system by tracing the ways in which they are deeply rooted in the aftermath of transatlantic slavery. Guest speakers are additionally invited to give personal, anecdotal stories of injustices that they have experienced in the medical field. Ultimately, this course is about racism and the ways in which historic and present transgressions are deeply entwined.",
                "Learned about the history of racialized medicine, how science is not objective but rather steeped in bias, ways of resistance and countering ones own biases.",
                "Understanding of African American history since slavery",
                "I learned about how various systems, events, and biases throughout the history and present of the United States have impacted the health of African American people.",
                "I learned to think critically about biology and the medical field to examine how racism has been woven into our healthcare system.",
                "The history of health and slavery",
                "Overall I gained lots of insight into how African Americans have been treated by doctors and the healthcare system throughout history, all the way from the slave trade up until the present day. Rote memorization fo specific dates, names, and other historical facts was not heavily emphasized, but I definitely came away from the class with a much better general acknowledgement of how Black people have historically been taken advantage of and exploited by the medical field.",
                "I learned so much about the history of slavery in America and how many health practices were initially tested on African Americans. I was also relieved to learn how systemic barriers for Black people actually formed over time in the U.S.",
                "This course is an amazing re-education of U.S. History, telling largely forgotten stories from the perspective of Black Americans. More than anything, it teaches students to interrogate dominant narratives of history, and to remember them so that we can make the future better.",
                "I learned the history of medicine and science in the context of race and gender. So much of this course opens your eyes to things you never even considered to be linked to some well known figures and events in history.",
                "I learned so much in this class about the empowerment and historical exploitation of Black bodies that I did not know before.",
                "I learned a lot about black history which is a history I had not truly delved into before.",
                "About the history of black people's role in medicine, including how they have been terribly mistreated, examples of advances black people have made without getting recognition, and how we can have a role in remedying the existing racism seen in the medical field.",
                "I learned about the true and authentic history of American medicine, and how it originated from the exploitation and maltreatment of black people.",
                "I learned more about the racial health disparities in this country, both historically and currently.",
                "I learned a lot about African American history in regards to the medical field.",
                "Gained an in-depth understanding of the history of oppression in Americas health system.",
                "Learned about the history of our medical system and how African Americans have played a role in medical research and experimentation and the inequities that we still face in our medical system.",
                "I learned about the history of medicine through the perspective of African Americans and the hidden history that is not normally talked about.",
                "I cant really sum up what I've learned in this course. In terms of skills, I learned how to turn a course into an experience, to complete an assignment and envision its end goal being beyond the grade. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the knowledge I gained, I learned about a sadly really corrupt system of medicine. I learned to deconstruct the assumption that science and empirical study are absolved of human judgement and biases. I learned that my ancestors were natural healers and my people are resilient. Every topic we studied this semester was something I had no previous awareness of, even though I've spent a lot of my life learning about civil rights and black struggles.",
                "I learned how to effectively learn and take notes in a lecture class, this being my first ever large lecture.",
                "How our entire medical system in the US was built upon the exploitation of black bodies, in so many ways that you could not even imagine until taking this course. should be required for all students, but especially pre-med.",
                "I was extremely lucky to be able to take this course. I learned about the history of slavery that continues to perpetuate institutional systems within America. Examples of historical moments within this course include slavery, the creation of gynecology, and the GI Bill. This course completely flipped all the history courses I have taken during high school. American history is oftentimes whitewashed and Eurocentric and the histories of people of color are left unaddressed. Through this course, I learned how to be antiracist and how racial structures continue to kill lives.",
                "This course provided me with foundational knowledge integral to understanding the barriers within and systems upholding our racist healthcare system today. I believe everyone should have to take this course, especially if they are entering the healthcare workforce, as it taught us to think critically about the structures and patters we see around us, and the history of slavery and its impact on medicine which still impacts patient care.",
                "Incredible insight into African American history",

                "An amazing course that takes a historical approach to understanding medical racism, tracing it from the beginnings of the slave trade to contemporary day.

                "n\/a impossible",
                "This course was everything that people say  a really unflinching look at American history that makes some really powerful connections to the present. Even for people who know a good amount about racism, slavery, and health care, the course is still a valuable way to synthesize all of the information in a new light. I found the readings to be very helpful and relevant and appreciated the course's focus on learning, not grades. \r\n\r\nMy only complaint is that the course often ran over time and the lectures often seemed geared towards a longer time period than the 50 minutes allotted.",
                "In this class, you're a person before you're a student. It's understood that students should prioritize sleep and their own well-being. This should be the default for ALL Yale classes, not something unique to this one.",
                "Professor Roberts is one of the most engaging lecturers I have had at Yale. Every lecture was extremely meaningful and informative. I think this is a course that everyone should take before graduating. I truly have no suggestions for improvements for this course.",
                "overall good",
                "Engaging professor",
                "This course was amazing. Professor Roberts is a brilliant lecturer and incredible person. Each lecture was shocking, disturbing, and so engaging. Professor Roberts sturctures this course to facilitate true learning instead of memorization which is very refreshing.",
                "strength - professor and TFs and all the extra resources and events to get involved in\r\nweaknesses - people could get by in the class without coming to class or engaging in any of the material at all, but again its also a strength of the class that students get to choose their level of engagement based on what other things they have going on in their lives",
                "No weaknesses! Overall, a great course that I think every Yale student should take-- we need more classes like this that discuss these important issues that are not talked about",
                "I loved the professor but I think that this course could have been more accessible. I think that having lectures recorded is extremely helpful, especially if I needed to miss a class for certain reasons and did not have anyone to provide me notes.",
                "strengths: engaging and thoughtful professor who cares so deeply about the material and the students. every lecture feels like a gripping movie, material and readings are fascinating without being overwhelming \r\nweakness: sometimes feel like we missed important material or lectures felt a little short",
                "Strength - amazing content, Professor Roberts gives great lectures, if you do the assignments you will be okay, TAs are really nice and helpful, and the assignments are spaced out perfectly. Weaknesses - there's not a lot of grade transparency throughout the course in terms of what is completed\/ what is for a grade.",
                "Strengths: The course creates a good family. The course also teaches things that are rarely taught in school. Professor Roberts is one of the sweetest women to walk the planet Earth, and she was a real highlight of the course.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The guest lectures were really hit or miss. The lecture given by Dr. Amanda Calhoun was very divisive and added very little to the context of the course. Her language was hostile, and I simply was not a fan of her lecture (or her mini-lecture at the beginning of the course). The other guest lecturers were great! However, I wish Professor Roberts just taught every class.",
                "There were no weaknesses to this course.",
                "honestly... cant think of any weaknesses. Was such a great class.",
                "There are absolutely no weaknesses. This course is structured beautifully, and Dr. Roberts was one of the best professors I have had at Yale.",
                "honestly it was so good, i loved the personal stories that were shared throughtout",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Dr. Roberts is such a caring, intelligent, sweet professor, and she really cultivated a community of care and love in the teaching fellows as well as among the students\r\n- The assignments all felt purposeful, and I liked the freedom to explore the topics that most interested me\r\n- I also loved the guest speakers and how we got to hear a range of voices and experiences! \r\n- I appreciated that the emphasis of the class was on learning and discussing the material, not on earning a grade -- I think that this fostered more interesting conversations and allowed me to fully jump into topics that were most engaging to me\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Sometimes the lectures seemed to lack a chronological structure throughout the course of the year, and I would've liked a bit more of a clear roadmap throughout history \r\n- It was also sometimes hard to listen to the material of the class, which makes sense, and it is important to hear it even if it is hard. But I would've appreciated a greater emphasis on the questions \"what can I do with this information? what not? how can I apply these lessons in my personal life?\" earlier in the semester -- we got to them eventually, but the first half of the semester was often disheartening in that regard",
                "Major strengths included the community this course created. I always looked forward to going to lecture and section and this was because of how Professor Roberts was so engaging and truly cares about all of her students and teaching fellows. I also appreciated the structure of the course.",
                "Strengths: Prof Roberts and her teaching staff, organization of course projects and respect for students' mental healths, phenomenal lectures (Roberts and guest lectures). Weaknesses: none",
                "Weaknesses: none\r\nStrengths: excellent professor, content was incredibly relevant, engaging, as were the readings. TFs were equally engaging, and the discussion sections truly did lead to (non-forceful) discussion, unlike many sections I've had in other courses.",
                "This course is perfect - from its emphasis on student learning as opposed to perfection to its focus on Black health disparities and their historical roots, there is nothing I would change.",
                "This class is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Each lecture and Weekly Missive were written with care, compassion, and passion. I was inspired to learn every week. The format of the lectures were incredibly engaging and the PowerPoint notes were very helpful at orienting students. I cannot think of anything that can be improved.",
                "Strengths: Professor Roberts is the most amazing instructor I'll ever have at Yale, lectures were very engaging, interesting, and well-taught, the TF's were the most amazing people, Prof. Roberts did an amazing job handling sensitive material, and this class is truly the best learning experience I could have had at Yale. Weaknesses: none!",
                "This class was amazing, and I would not change anything (other than maybe shortening the length of the Monday Missives). Even though it was a large class size, there was a solid sense of community. I looked forward to coming to lecture every week and found the readings to be extremely interesting and engaging. Sometimes at Yale, it can be easy to feel like what you are learning isn't applicable outside of the classroom. However, everything that I learned in this class will affect my life going forward.",
                "Everything about this class is perfect. Nothing about this course could be improved. I only wish there was more.",
                "Only strengths. Great guest lectures. Great contextualization of African American health throughout history and hopefully looking toward solutions for the future. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses. But 50 minutes was often too short for this amazing class. There should also be no enrollment cap if possible. Everyone needs to take this course, it's so important.",
                "The only weakness that this course has is that there is only one Professor Roberts and that she is constrained to 2x a week 50-minute lectures. I could listen to her lecture for eons. Her background in theater gives the some of the absolute best lectures I have ever had. \r\n\r\nThe strengths include (but are not limited to): her pedagogy and outlook on student participation, which requires students to set their own goals and grade themselves, her ability to engage a giant lecture hall, her weekly Missives that literally are half the length of a senior thesis, her kindness and compassion, and her syllabus. I have never seen a more beautiful and all-encompassing thesis.",
                "Strengths: Professor Roberts and the TAs. They worked hard to create an open and welcoming classroom environment as well as foster academic and personal growth inside and outside the classroom.",
                "This was an amazing course. I lecture slides were very organized and understandable, they were easy to follow as Professor Roberts took her students on a journey through history. The lectures were deeply engaging, I never felt bored and I wished they were longer so that Professor Roberts could fit all of her information in! She held the attention of her audience so well and for so long. When Professor Roberts paused you could hear a pin drop in the room. I loved the guest speakers that professor Roberts brought in, it was so interesting and inspiring to hear what other medical professionals are doing with this important history. Each Teaching Assistant was so passionate and deeply engaged in the course content. This made discussion sections engaging and important as the TAs helped their students digest this heavy information.",
                "There are no weaknessesonly strengths. Amazing lecture topics, amazing professor, and amazing TFs.",
                "Dr Roberts innovative teaching style helps students learn in a way that is engaging and the content is digestible. This course truly changed my outlook on so many aspects of society specifically discrimination in medicine. I cannot think of a way this class could be improved. Only that it would be great if it was taught every semester.",
                "There are so many strengths of this course: Professor Roberts' care and compassion, her lecturing style (literally the best lecturer at Yale), the assignments that gave us the flexibility to pursue our interests related to the course, etc. The only weakness that comes to mind is the reflection component of the course. We wrote three participation reflections, a final project proposal, and a cover page reflection on our final project. While I totally understand and agree with these assignments, I sometimes felt like I was being a little repetitive simply because there were a lot of opportunities for written reflection. I wonder if there is another way to get to the core of this assignment because I do feel like the reflection component is very importantmaybe instead of a written reflection at the midterm, future students can meet with their teaching fellows and talk through their participation goals in a more casual format (I'm not sure this is possible given how large the class was this semesterbut just a thought). Or maybe instead of writing a final reflection and a final project reflection, future students can combine those assignments into one? I'm not sure. This is obviously a super small weakness that didn't whatsoever take any joy out of the class.",
                "All strengths, no weaknesses.",
                "This course was nothing but strength. All STEM majors should this course. It truly dives into the dichotomy that STEM, specifically medicine, have with political and social views. Not only does this class help people better understand the issues that Black people haves faced and still face in America, but it challenges each and every lecture attendee to reshape their perspective on racial and social issues regarding medicine and in the general social sense.",
                "Strengths: The teaching team - Professor Roberts and the TFs - are so, so wonderful and very clearly care about you as a human being first and foremost. Professor Roberts is one of the best lecturers I've ever had. I think the fact that I willingly made the trek up to Marsh every lecture is very telling. Must take!\r\nWeakness: I think that having class in a lecture hall closer to central campus would help make it more accessible!",
                "Very good set up. There were assignments, but the focus of the course was to be engaged, and show up to lecture. Less pressure on assignment grades helped me stay more focused with the course, and enjoy it and learn!",
                "No weaknesses. This is a great course!",
                "Strengths the most interesting and engaging class I have taken at Yale.",
                "strengths: professor roberts is the best person on earth\r\nweakness: literally none, this class is perfect",
                "Prof. Roberts is an amazing lecturer, her TF team is great, and the readings are incredibly eye opening.",
                "stengths -- an amazing lecture, engaged audience, emphasis on student learning rather than grade\r\n\r\nweakness -- sometimes information is hard to find in the comprehensive Monday missives (maybe separating assignments and readings into two different emails)",
                "Roberts and the TFs are wonderful and caring. They know the material very well and are able to communicate it clearly. All the assignments being pass\/fail with an option to resubmit was also a way to compel students to engage with the course in a low-pressure way.",
                "The course embodied the spirit of love, compassion, and intentionality. Professor Roberts and the entire teaching team brought so much care to the class and I would not change a thing about it.",
                "Great staff and focus on introspection. Really feel like I grew this semester.",
                "This course is the most powerful class I've taken at Yale. The class is so well structured, and the content is so important. Every student should have to take this class.",
                "Professor Roberts and the teaching staff are some of the biggest strengths of the course. They all care deeply about each student's learning and personal growth throughout the course. I wish we had deeper discussions during section about the topic of the week or the readings. Additionally, I wish there was more of an opportunity for direct engagement with course material during discussion section, but overall there is not much I would change about the course.",
                "This course is excellent.",
                "This course is incredible! Every assignment except for your final exam is graded Complete\/Incomplete to encourage a healthy relationship with coursework and the investment of good faith effort without stress over grades. I love how this lowered the barrier to entry to a course that teaches such important material. Despite this being the biggest class at Yale College, there were multiple support systems in place to support students in their learning and in their lives. The lectures were amazing, and the assignments felt worthwhile (if anything, I think the lesson plan felt a bit out of place and wish we had been able to write the op-ed instead, although I know that was an unforeseen circumstance). I only wish this counted for the MCDB major to encourage more pre-med students to take this fantastic course!",
                "Strengths: It's really well-balanced! Lectures were related to the readings, but never delved into them, expecting students to do the readings which would supplement the lecture. There was a lot of time spent on self-reflection and introspection, which meant there was always time to think about what students wanted from the course. Assignments were well-devisedone essay on a close, critical reading of any one of the readings; an op-ed (which got canceled, but I still thought was really cool); and a final project, which could be anything! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I can't think of any!",
                "The class was phenomenal and structured for you to get what you want to and need to out of it! It was a very transformative and engaging class! I have very rarely been in a class where I felt I have had the full ownership and agency to apply and learn the material in a way I find useful and applicable to my discipline and knowledge. And I appreciate how in this class I have been able to do that with the final project and the lesson plan assignments. And Prof. Roberts does an amazing job of getting you to reflect and find meaning int what we are learning!! Absolutely amazing!! I loved it very very much!!",
                "This course was great. Professor Roberts' lectures were very engaging. I also appreciated the guest lectures.",
                "The strengths of course were the teaching team and Professor Roberts. All of these individuals contributed to a unique and unforgettable course experience. They were understanding and provided guidance if needed. There were no weaknesses of the course.",
                "This course is exceptional because of the amazing work Professor Roberts has done; her investment to the course was incredible. The course also had insightful readings and assignments that encouraged students to pursue their interests.",
                "Strengths: All of the topics covered, the professor, the TAs, the focus on learning rather than achieving a grade.",
                "I thought the lectures were extremely engaging I just sometimes wished they were longer.",
                "The strengths is how well-rounded the curricula and content was. We learned about so much in so many different areas. The weakness was that sometimes I feel we didnt do enough critical work.",
                "Strengths - Professor Roberts is the best Professor Ive had at Yale. She is everything that makes this class so wonderful - brilliant, funny, and deeply compassionate toward her students. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - this class is known for giving all students an A. While it was a well-intentioned effort to eliminate student worries about grades, this meant that many people in the class skipped the required readings, treated attendance at lecture as optional, and sometimes failed to complete their discussion section assignments\/posts. This is not a class where a lenient grading system should be so wrongfully abused. The lecture and reading material is too important and I feel it didnt get the respect from all 500+ students in this class that it deserved this semester. By proxy, I felt that Professor Roberts did not receive the respect as an educator that she deserved. I fear students took advantage of her compassion and care with the grading policy.",
                "Very good lectures and learning space",
                "strengths: \r\n- lectures were absolutely incredibly delivered and very well organized \r\n- environment was positive and fostered student care and success\r\n- professor did a great job of placing the material within its proper historical context and drawing out connections between the past and the present\r\n\r\nweakness: \r\n- while the technological issues were very endearing, they sometimes unfortunately did take away valuable class time. I think Professor Roberts may want to consider having one of the TAs serve as a technology assistant for this class",
                "The TF system was very nice to have and constantly checking in.",
                "Dr. Roberts is an amazing lecturer! Every class felt like a TedTalk and was intellectually engaging.",
                "strengths - great teacher, content that everyone should know, class community\r\nweaknesses - none",
                "wonderful lectures and fascinating readings. lots of creative freedom",
                "The strengths of this course are definitely the lectures. Professor Roberts is wonderful. Although I wish she had delivered the material with a slightly heavier hand and faster pace, I found them engaging and informative. The readings were absolutely perfect. They were not too long and supported the lectures. One suggestion I would make would be to remove the grading system. I understand the intent, how very, I think the idea of a guaranteed a created an environment among the students that caused them to take the class less seriously. With such serious course material, I feel like student engagement should be of the utmost importance, and I think the grading did not support that.",
                "Professor Roberts is an amazing lecturer; super caring and incredibly knowledgeable about the subject. Personally, I found the first half of the semester, when we focused more on history, more engaging than the lectures about the modern healthcare system -- maybe because I was less familiar with the historical material.",
                "This course was fantastic! The professor covered so much meaningful content in each lecture and the course was well organized to facilitate student learning. Our discussion posts and assignments throughout the year allowed us to critically engage with the course material and produce work that was meaningful to us. From the essays to the projects, I really felt that each assignment allowed me to dive deeper into the course material and learn about so many interesting aspects of race and medicine.",
                "Professor Roberts is an extremely engaging professor and the way she handled our course material was very admirable. I think something can definitely be said about the fact that she was consistently able to keep the attention of a packed Marsh Lecture Hall. Personally, I do not feel that this course has any notable weaknesses.",
                "Carolyn Roberts is the best teacher on this campus. There is really nothing that I would say needs to be improved about this course. It is amazing.",
                "Strengths: Compassionate, thoughtful professor who truly cares about her students' wellbeing, as shown by the lengthy weekly missives and abundance of readings (and supplemental readings) available for discussion. Weaknesses: Some of the readings and lectures felt repetitive, as it wasn't clear why very related topics (for instance, on reproductive justice) were disconnected into different lectures.",
                "Excellent class with incredible course staff",
                "The strengths of this course lie in the professor. Professor Roberts is so knowledgeable, caring, and approachable. She cares about all of her students and make an effort to get to know each and every one of them. The way she communicates the material is another strength of this course. It's a shame that the university is not allowing Prof. Roberts to flourish in who she really is.",
                "Strengths: interesting course content, caring Professor and course staff\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: feeds into performative woke culture at Yale in a way that, at times, gets in the way of the work its trying to do",
                "There literally are no weaknesses to this course at all. The way the course is structured, it allows you to set your own goals that you wish to aspire towards during the semester and do the course on your own terms. Obviously, it is crucial that you adhere to the good faith effort policy, which really brings the course together in my opinion, and facilitates a productive and supportive learning opportunity.",
                "A must take! Recordings of the class could have been provided upon requests for accessibility needs. That was one thing the course was lacking, even given the want for people to come in person. I think thats still important.",
                "This was easily one of the best classes I have ever taken. Professor Roberts is one of a kind and an amazing educator and person. There was no weakness at all.",
                "This course only had strengths. The lectures were engaging and easy to follow, the professor was amazing, the TFs were amazing, and the assignments were interesting. This course also created a wonderful community, and students were valued as their full selves. The course content is necessary for all undergraduates to engage with.",
                "Strengths: Professor Roberts is an incredible lecturer, professor, human being, etc. I really enjoyed how the course was structured, encouraging us to be conscious of how we could be show up for ourselves.",
                "I like the support systems in the class, and how the staff put in efforts to make everyone feel loved and cared for.",
                "It was an amazing class, but probably meant more for people who dont experience what is taught in the course in their daily lives",
                "Strengths: Dr. Roberts is an amazing lecturer, the course is interesting, the topics are important, everything is amazing",
                "Strengths: clearly outlined readings, TAs were amazing, low academic pressure (emphasis was on what you were learning), knowledgeable guest lecturers\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes felt the course was too passive",
                "Strengths -- Flexible assignments (so as to maximize meaningfulness to students), good balance of breadth and depth, incredible teaching team\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- None!",
                "This course was taught incredibly well and was deeply engaging. The only way I would say to improve it would be to have more specific questions to respond to in the discussion posts to facilitate more focused conversations in section.",
                "I honestly cant think of any weaknesses. This course was so well thought out. The lectures are so engaging that I never felt the time pass, and the readings were carefully explained each week and it was clear that all of the assignments had a specific objective related to the class.",
                "This course is an absolute must-take. The lectures are fascinating, sections enlightening and well structured, and Dr. Roberts is an absolute gem of an educator. Assignments feel purposeful instead of the busy work we often get in other classes. To be honest, I have no notes.",
                "Lectures were highly engaging and thought provoking, section was good",
                "This course is AMAZING. PLEASE TAKE IT. In a sense, this course is its own small experiment. Professor Roberts uniquely grades according to good faith effort, meaning that the course is specifically designed to increase presence and intentionality while reducing unnecessary anxiety and mindless note-taking. Given that every concept discussed is deeply heavy, a flexible, effort-based grading system allows students to process the material in whatever way is best for them, and many different formats for assignments are encouraged.",
                "No weaknesses at all! Everything about this course was PHENOMENAL. An amazing course by wonderful professor, TAs, and guest lecturers who created a safe and welcoming community to learn about difficult topics. The readings are carefully curated each week and supplement the lectures beautifully. Sections with TAs provide a small group discussion section and circles of care that are inviting and comfortable spaces to speak up in. The TAs provide very thorough feedback on each assignment and it is clear that they went over the project in great detail. Professor Roberts holds all day office hours which is a great resource to chat with her about anything at all.",
                "Strengths: incredible professor with engaging lectures, support from TFs, and interesting readings\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had discussed the readings during lecture as well to give them context; also, I wish discussion sections had focused on readings or course material rather than exclusively discussing our personal experiences and opinions (although also important).",
                "This course provided very important information about African-American history that everyone should know. Also, the learning process was prioritized over giving students busy work or making them stressed about grading, which was a valuable experience, considering the serious subject matter. The course covered a wide range of material and at times felt rushed because there was not enough time to deeply dive in to everything covered.",
                "I think this course is incredibly strong and focuses on student learning over grades and exams. This was one of the sections that I felt students most engaged with during my time at Yale -- since we were free to explore what we were most interested in, we were more willing to discuss and engage with other stuednts.",
                "Strengths: the incredible pedagogy of Dr. Carolyn Roberts, and the way she worked with TFs to craft sections. The section for this course was one I looked forward to.\r\n\r\nWeakness: This class should be longer!!! I often found that moving at the pace we did did not give us enough time to process the material of the course, and I would have loved more time in class.",
                "Only strengths! Professor Roberts is a wonderful professor and taught a great course.",
                "A big strength of this course was Professor Roberts. She was so engaging and you could tell that she put a lot of effort into this class (for example, by creating an incredibly detailed reading list and sending out weekly missives to help students know what to expect for the week. Additionally, I felt that the assignments were interesting, engaging, and allowed students to explore topics of interest on their own. The only weakness I noticed was that although the readings were interesting, they were not really emphasized in either lecture or my discussion section and I wish I had gotten to discuss them in more depth, especially considering how much time it took me to keep up with the reading schedule.",
                "Excellent course, only strengths.",
                "Strengths:\r\nProfessor Roberts and the TFs are all so kind\r\nMaterial presented in a straightforward, un-sugarcoated way",
                "This course is amazing! My favorite part about it was the structure of grading and assignments, which gives students room to be very creative and take their own path. The level of trust between the instructor and the students was really awesome to experience, and it encouraged me to do my best.",
                "The course fosters creative thinking and personal engagement. There are no weaknesses!",
                "This course was quite strong in that it really helped facilitate learning of difficult topics over stressing students over studying these topics. In this way, I think students were a lot more engaged in taking in information.",
                "The content was the strength of this class. Very interesting. The weakness was the flexibility to not come to class or do work.",
                "Best Professor ever",
                "Could benefit from a longer lecture period. 50 mins seemed to be too short to cover all material.",
                "A strength was that the lectures were amazing. A weakness was that we didn't always get to finish the lectures so there was some content we didn't get to.",
                "strenghts: i loved the classroom community and culture and how much freedom we had to explore our own interests. also, the material was very interesting and engaging and presented in a very respectful manner. no weaknesses",
                "Strengths: Supplemental readings to give further context to lectures.\r\nWeaknesses: Not much feedback on individual assignments.",
                "Literally an amazing course can't be improved",
                "Strengths: professor Roberts is fantastic.\r\nWeaknesses: cant think of any.",
                "I think that the class does a great job of making everyone feel included, and professor Roberts really does a fantastic job at trying to engage the large lecture. Nevertheless, I think that the weakness of the course is that the large lecture can often feel less engaging due to the sheer numbers.",
                "I loved loved loved this course. So interesting, we covered a plethora of difficult subjects and delved into niche yet so important conversations.",
                "I loved this class! Professor Roberts is an amazing lecturer.",
                "The strengths of this course are the selection of guest speakers and selection of readings to supplement the topics. lectures were information heavy, and fast paced, so the readings always gave me the chance to place myself into a vacuum and closely read about a particular idea, story, or subject. The guest speakers were a wonderful addition to the class, since we learned from people who are doing the work that corrects the wrongs of the history we learn about in the class. It shows us that there are forces of justice.",
                "I think discussion sections shouldnt be a mandatory part of the course. but that is the only weakness I see.",
                "Strength: I loved Professor Roberts. The history although filled with brutality and violence revealed the racist structures around me. Professor Roberts when teaching these violent events, teaches with care and in a deliberate manner. The readings contributed to completely changing my view of the world.\r\n\r\nWeakness: this course was too short. After finishing this course, I feel that there are still significant historical gaps that must be addressed. It would be nice if this course was longer.",
                "This course was AMAZING! Professor Roberts is so kind and wonderful. We need to keep this course forever.",
                "Incredible lectures and professor",
                "more community events, felt it was hard to find community",
                "This class was very well-structured and had many different entry points to learning for its students. The readings were always very engaging and the assignments provided flexibility to the students to come to the material in the way they wanted to approach it. The class is truly designed for a variety of majors\/interests.",
                "Fantastic Professor who truly cares about the subject matter and gets every student to be interested too.",
                "I think this course is so strong in that it emphasizes self care and it allows you to decide how best you learn",
                "Everything about it was amazing",
                "Strengths: Professor Roberts is one of the best lecturers I have ever heard. The course content is not only interesting, but vital to know as any human in society. The course culture is very supportive. No weaknesses.",
                "This course was great, I think it would be better served by longer class periods, with such a large class, it took a significant amount of time at the beginning of class for people to settle down and it felt like we lost out on time for the lecture.",
                "PROF ROBERTS AND HER TEAM are a must take at Yale. The course material is heavy yet engaging. FAVORITE class at Yale.",
                "I thought this course was strong, and I appreciated the TFs and Professor Roberts' support and flexibility throughout.",
                "no weaknesses!! I loved how much care Professor Roberts put into each class and her monday missives that explained what readings we will have during the week. This class was focused on just learning, which didn't make it stressful and made the assignments more enjoyable.",
                "Strengths; Great teachers and guest speakers\r\nWeakness: Not much to hold students accountable",
                "The class was really amazing and helps students gain a new perspective on activism and healing. I absolutely loved taking this course. Not only were the lectures great, but the guest lectures really brought everything we learned together.",
                "No weaknesses! Professor Roberts is truly the most caring, compassionate, and engaging professor I have had at Yale. Every person both at Yale and outside of it should take this course, both to engage with such important content and to learn from such a wonderful instructor. Professor Roberts carefully curated this course in both content and structure to emphasize community building and personal growth.",
                "No weaknesses",
                "There were only strengths and no weaknesses to this course. The lectures, all of the readings, Professor Roberts, the TAs... everything about this course was amazing.",
                "the assignments in this course were really meaningful. I think I would have appreciated a little bit more discussion of how these issues are playing out in the present day (I assumed we'd talk about health disparities with COVID, etc.). but understand the history is also very important",
                "The biggest strength of this course is that the workload is very light as the focus is on your engagement in the class, not your performance. You dont constantly have to worry about taking what you learn and applying it to specific assignments that are harshly graded. Instead, you have a lot of freedom with your assignments which allows you to engage in this class however you want. There are no weaknesses!",
                "Strengths - AMAZING professor and AMAZING TFs. Community events (please take advantage of these, though I wasn't able to). Student-driven assignments. And of course, what we unlearned and learned.",
                "loved everything about it",
                "I believe this course should be mandated to all students.",
                "The course is structured very well. However, the discussion section could be made to be more engaging.",
                "This course was phenomenal. Professor Roberts curated lessons that were meaningful, detailed and highly relevant. All strengths and no weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: the course was a welcoming environment for everyone regardless of background or familiarity with the content, and covered important and upsetting topics in a way that was considerate, gentle, and caring.",
                "Everything about this class is perfect. This is the most well-organized, rewarding, and interesting course I have ever taken at Yale.",
                "This course is definitely one of the most unique I have taken at Yale. Professor Robert's and the teaching staff's approach to learning is based on love and care, and I really appreciated that. Professor Roberts truly cares deeply about what she's doing, and that comes across in her engaging lectures. I can't think of any weaknesses of this course.",
                "This course is very forgiving and understanding. Everyone treats each other how they desire. It is completely designed to allow students to succeed.",
                "Strengths: Incredibly engaging lectures and discussion sections. Weaknesses: No real weaknesses I wish the lectures were longer they flew by and I wanted to know more.",
                "I think it was a great class! All Id be concerned about is guaranteeing that people put effort into the course!",
                "The greatest strength of this course is Professor Roberts. This course simply could not be taught with as much depth or compassion and thoughtfulness without her. The only weakness is that some people did not take this class for the right reasons, which made section difficult for those of us invested in the material.",
                "The course was enriching and compelling unlike any other course I have taken at the university. Professor Roberts' content challenged her students to think critically and challenge their understandings of not just the healthcare system, but the current sociopolitical culture that creates inequities today. The course compels students to imagine greater inclusivity and belonging."

                "100% yes. Everyone should take this course no matter what discipline they are studying because it positions you to be self-aware and incorporate anti-racism in your lifestyle and thinking. The class is taught in a way that is super engaging, comfortable, and full of compassion. It will change the way you think about progress, creating change, and the medical system.",

                "ABSOLUTELY please take this class. But make sure you actually go to lecture, do the reading, and engage in section. the material is so important. please don't take this class if you are not going to truly listen and learn about the material being taught. The class fills up quickly so if you don't plan on being engaged please let someone else have your seat so they can learn from the amazing Prof Roberts",
                "Yes; the content is so relevant, and so important to all of us today and right now. If you only get to choose one more course to take at Yale, this should be it. Not all courses can so distinctly show you how to be a better person\/make the world a better place.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. It should be mandatory for pre-medical students.",
                "I would recommend this class to every person that can take it. It is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale, if not the best. Professor Roberts is one of the most talented, engaging lecturers I have ever had. Every class was extremely meaningful and powerful.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! THIS IS THE ONE COURSE AT YALE YOU MUST TAKE BEFORE GRADUATING! Everything about this epitomizes what learning should be about---the lectures, the professors, the content, the TFs, the students it attracts---it all made for such a fantastic learning experience. Everyone, EVERYONE, should learn about this topic.",

Professor Roberts and her teaching staff are clearly passionate about the subject matter and are experts in their fields. The way they organized class maximized my learning and made me excited to come to class. Professor Roberts' passion for the material is palpable, and any student is lucky to be able to learn from her. This course material is extremely important, and every Yale undergrad ought to take this course to be a better human.",

                "Absolutely! This course is a must for anyone here!",
                "I would recommend this course not only to another student but to literally anyone who I walk past on the street. If Yale ever loses Professor Roberts to another institution, it will be a very dark day for this university and its students. She is a star, and the university should throw all of its support behind her. If you have no engagement with other HSHM, this one is the best introduction to how the history of science and medicine matters and how race is implicated in every inch of American medicine. I do not understand how a course could be more relevant to our lives as American residents.",
                "Yes, of course. This course is great for many reasons, but most of all, it is simply vital information to know to live and work in the United States, especially in any health\/biomedical related field. Professor Roberts teaches in an incredibly thoughtful and captivating way and she is a joy to learn from and with.",
                "YES!!! a 1,000 times yes!!!! This was my absolute favorite class this year and during my entire time at Yale. I am so so grateful for this class and for professor Roberts. I think about the information we learned about African American history every day and it literally has made me see the world in an entirely different way. I was so sad when this class came to an end. I believe that every single student at Yale, especially those going into the medical field, should take this class. It was like I was listening to an inspirational Ted Talk every single lecture.",
                "Every student at Yale needs to take this courseespecially pre-meds. It will change your life.",
                "Definitely. This is probably my favorite class Ive taken at Yale so far! Professor Roberts is so amazing and kind.",
                "Yes!! Amazing class, accessible to non-History\/AFAM\/PLSC\/HSHM majors, but also interesting and important for those majors. Everyone will tell you Prof. Roberts is amazing, and she is!!!",
                "YES!!! This is an essential part of Yale!!",
                "This is the easiest course review Ive ever written.\r\n\r\nThere is a reason why AFAM 170 is the most popular course at Yale  and it starts and ends with medical historian and scientist, Dr. Carolyn Roberts. Ive been incredibly fortunate to have had more than my fair number of fantastic teachers - but Ive never experienced a more positive, enthusiastic, thoughtful, and deeply caring teacher than Dr. Roberts. To say she is encouraging, supportive and accessible would be an understatement of epic proportion. Dr. Roberts care, respect for and support of her students is an integral part of what makes this course so important and powerful  she is the ultimate, most qualified guide to take students through a 400-year journey into a very messy, painful past (i.e. Sickness and Health in African American History). Her noble objective is that the course  and the discussions and thinking that it provokes  stimulate all of us to come together, as a learning community, to imagine a different kind of future.  Dr. Roberts is a great lecturer and she goes out of her way to bring in expert guests who share their perspectives and voice with the entire class. Grading is beyond fair and straightforward  and students are provided with tremendous flexibility and options when it comes to major grade components. Not only is Dr. Roberts truly awesome, but she has thoughtfully put together a team of TFs that are deeply invested in the courses mission as well as in the students in their discussionss success and well being. This past semester (Spring 23), I was super fortunate to have Charlie Tran as our section leader  hes in his final year of his MPH @ the Yale School of Public Health after receiving his Yale BA in History of Science, Medicine and Public Health. Charlie was beyond awesome - facilitating and encouraging meaningful discussions, deeper dives on course material and always, providing helpful and actionable feedback on submitted assignments. He felt like the best kind of coach which feels in line with Dr. Roberts overall course ethos. \r\n\r\nSo again, this is easy: AFAM 170 is a critically important, topical and powerful course that every Yale student - no matter their major  could and should benefit from taking. IMHO, its also a course that should be ***required*** for any and every student interested in pursuing a career in healthcare - either clinically or at an administrative or policy level. \r\n\r\nI am beyond grateful that I was lucky enough to score a seat in this semester's course -- and have had the opportunity to learn so much from Dr. Roberts, her guest lecturers, her TFs and the course material. Im 100% confident that Ill carry and use the learnings and insights I've gained from AFAM 170 with me for the remainder of my life.",
                "Yes, it was by far the most interesting and the most different course that I have ever taken at Yale. I would recommend every Yale student to take this course, the content is fascinating and Professor Roberts is amazing.",
                "Everyone at Yale should take this course. If more professors actually taught material that is genuinely needed for the bettering of society today, we would be in a very different place right now. I say this with regards to Yale alumni who have become world leaders and the trend that shows a lack of empathy, understanding, and care. We need more Professor Roberts. Point Blank Period.",
                "Yes! Any pre-med should take this course especially.",
                "Absolutely! A must-take at Yale.",

                "Yes, everyone especially STEM students should take it.",
                "1000000% THIS IS THE BEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT YALE IT SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT. I'm a stem major and still this has been my favorite class at Yale. Professor Roberts is the best lecturer I've ever had and the content of the class is genuinely so important. I can't say enough good things about this class. It lives up to the hype and more. It's also very low stress and Professor Roberts is so nice and accommodating. Take this class if you can get in, there is no way you'll regret it.",
                "Yes! Prof. Roberts and her team are great for authentic leading and they care for their students. Everyone should learn what Prof. Roberts is teaching.",
                "absolutely. this is my favorite class i've taken at yale -- not only is the format engaging and informative, but professor roberts is kind and loving. it is the perfect combination of gravity and celebration. i wish more classes were like this.",
                "Yes. You learn a lot of valuable information in a very low-stakes and caring environment.",
                "Yes. Best class at yale",
                "Yes, especially if you have future interests in technology, medicine, or public health. The time, energy, and commitment put into this course is quite evident.",
                "I definitely would, Professor Roberts is an amazing professor. The best at Yale to be honest!",
                "Absolutely. This course was unlike any other class I've ever taken at Yale. It inspired me to learn. Professor Roberts truly created a model of education that is founded on the basis of love, support, trust, and community.",
                "Yes!!! Absolutely my most favorite course at yale. Professor Roberts and the TFs see us as more than students, they see us as people first.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! The best course I took at Yale.",
                "Absolutely, best class you will ever take!",
                "YES! This course really opens your eyes to the dark side of healthcare and its historical roots.",
                "Yes! This is the best course Ive ever taken at Yale.",
                "This was by far the most deeply impactful course I've taken at Yale. It taught me to think critically about instances that I encounter each and every day. Clear examples of racism in medicine are discussed.",
                "Yes definitely. This course is a must take at Yale.",
                "Yes! I think this is a course that all Yale students should take.",
                "I wouldand already have100% recommend this course to anyone I know! This is a perfect class for anyone, regardless of your background in STEM or Black history. In fact, I would recommend this course especially for folks who are not well-versed in Black history and\/or who are pre-med! Yes, this class is a guaranteed A if you do the work, but the material is absolutely worth learning. The lessons taught in this course are so important to know just as a citizen of this world, and while they ring especially true in medicine, they are useful regardless of what you want to do with your life. Professor Roberts is the sweetest professor I have come across at Yale, and she made a huge lecture feel personal. Please please please take this class; you will not regret it!",
                "Yes, yes, yes, without a single doubt. If there's one single course at Yale that you should be taking, it's this one. From the course content, which is incredibly important, to Dr. Roberts, who is kind and sweet and simply amazing, you need to take this course.",
                "Absolutely! It really helped change my perspective on medicine and science and how their histories are structure are embedded with racial science and how this impacts the present outcomes of medicine and science. And I really liked how this class also invited us to think about what are the implications and ways we can change this!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it teaches crucial lessons that everyone must be aware of.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student as it has provided a new course experience focused on helping the students learn, rather than obsess over grades.",
                "Absolutely! This is one of the greatest classes offered and taking it is a must for everyone.",
                "Absolutely, I strongly recommend this course to any student. This course is one that must absolutely be taken, it's too important not too. The course content and life lessons will impact all students, no matter their area of study.",
                "Absolutely! Changed me and educated me on a topic I was previously unfamiliar with.",
                "TAKE THIS COURSE!! I literally can not recommend it enough and believe everyone should take this class.",
                "I would 100% RECOMMEND THIS! IT WAS MY FAVORITE COURSE AT YALE.",
                "TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS",
                "Yes!",
                "I would, but with some caveats. I feel like the class was tailored to certain sensitivities and wasnt pushing the envelope strong enough.",
                "YES!",
                "Yes. Every human being should take this class. It changed the course of my life and my outlook on the world forever.",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes, provides important life lesson and interesting history.",
                "yes, absolutely, especially if you have any interest at all in going to medicine or a medicine-adjacent profession. It is critical for all future medical professions to reckon with and digest the racism of the past (and reckon with how history influences implicit-- and sometimes explicit-- biases today) to learn how to use our platforms as vehicles for dismantling structural racism and avoid perpetuating the same inequities and racist disparities in quality of treatment that exist today. In addition, I think that the information presented in this class is essential for all Americans to have a truly comprehensive grasp on American history.",
                "Yes! I would 100% recommend this to someone else.",
                "Yes! There is a focus on student health which we don't see often in many Yale courses.",
                "YES TAKE THIS CLASS - such a caring community and professor, and content that everyone should know",
                "yes!! an essential course to take for everyone in understanding how our past still perpetuates violence today in medical systems and beyond.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to every Yale student. This course material is crucial for every member of the Yale community to understand.",
                "Yes -- the course is very accessible (low workload) but gives a really thorough and important look into medical racism in the United States. Professor Roberts is a great lecturer, and I learned a lot of incredibly important history I was unfamiliar with.",
                "Yess!! The best course I've taken at Yale!",
                "Yes, I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. This course touches on difficult, but very necessary subject material that any student, regardless of whether or not they're going into the medical field, should be aware of.",
                "Absolutely! Any chance you can be in the presence of Caroyln Roberts is a gift. I would absolutely recommend this course.",
                "100%",
                "Yes, every student regardless of your major should take this course. You will learn so much about some of the practices of this country and to be taught by Prof. Roberts is a blessing in itself.",
                "Probably not. I think the content is very important but you could have a similar experience by reading some of the sources on the syllabus without taking it. I feel a lot of time was spent on self-care instead of learning the course material. Im sure there are people that benefited from that, but for me it was unnecessary, felt a bit patronizing, and got in the way of learning the really important content.",
                "Yes! Please take the course if you can. Professor Roberts is somebody whose class you do not want to miss. Not only is she a brilliant academic and lecturer, who puts her students first (which is very uncommon among most Yale professors), but she is also one of the kindest, most caring, and inspiring people I have ever encountered in my lifetime. The course material will be interesting to merely everybody who has even the littlest interest in the world around them.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about the history of medicine outside of what is readily available in the thousands of standardized textbooks out there. Dr. Roberts digs deep into the roots of racism within the medical field and draws connections between different practices that persist today and their unsavory origins. It's an essential course in my opinion. Dr. Roberts' approach to grading and coursework was also a breath of fresh air in an academic setting that can sometimes be too cut throat.",
                "Yes, course is designed not to get a grade but for you to learn.",
                "Yes!!!!",
                "Phenomenal class",
                "Yes! Great class and Professor Roberts is super interesting and engaging. The guest lecturers are awesome too.",
                "YES! Great class for pre-med students, but also a great class for anyone interested in learning more about racism and \"how we got here.\" I like to say that the class treats medicine and health as a case study for racism in America, and there is so much you can learn about other systems of racism (government, economics, law, etc.) from this class.",
                "Yes, I think for all pre-med students this course should be required. Generally, all students should understand the roots of the healthcare systems and how groups have been oppressed within the system if we can ever achieve change in interpersonal interaction and our medical institutions.",
                "I would (and have) recommend this course to any and all students. I honestly think this course should be required to graduate from Yale. The topics covered are so important and this class is truly amazing.",
                "I 100% would recommend this course to another student as the topic, the intersection of medicine and race, is very important to learn about. Also, the way that the course reimagined college courses was amazing. Assignments were scattered throughout the semester and provided room for students to engage with the parts of the class that resonated with them most. It was never stressful, and I felt like I could truly learn, whereas in other college courses sometimes I am forced to prioritize cramming and memorizing rather than the process of learning.",
                "Yes. The class forces you to interact with difficult and sensitive material but gives you the flexibility in assignments to seek closure\/ further knowledge on a way that best suits your needs.",
                "Very much! This class gives a good insight into slavery and racism against black people in the US. The class teaches you about the various injustices in the healthcare system and empowers you to be cautious of it",
                "Yes everyone needs to take it",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, to literally anyone. This course was the best class I have taken at Yale.",
                "I would recommend because it is super interesting and you really dont have to spend time with material that you arent interested in. This course lets you focus on what you are passionate about.",
                "YES. Take this class!! Especially if you're pre-med, you NEED to be equipped with the info we were taught in this course. If you're not even interested in medicine, this is a GREAT class to take to learn about a lot of things that have been left out of most historical conversations.",
                "Yes, everyone should take this course, especially if you are pre-med. This course sheds light on how pseudoscience regarding race continues to affect Black Americans today, and also addresses common stereotypes we believe today.",
                "YES! This was probably one of the best, most important classes I've taken at Yale -- I wish it was required. If you have a chance, TAKE IT!",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to everyone. Even if it is not a field you normally study, the knowledge is incredibly important and eye-opening to the reality of our society and country. It has changed how I look at a variety of issues and the professor and TFs were incredible people to learn from and about.",
                "Yes, this is an incredible course.",
                "Yes! I think everyone should have to take this course to get a better understanding of history explained extremely well by Professor Roberts.",
                "I could not recommend this class more strongly. This class reaffirmed my desire to go into healthcare professionally, especially when Ive been struggling with the monotony and unnecessarily punitive and dehumanizing pre med curriculum. The course material was fascinating and sobering, and Dr. Roberts is a truly gifted educator.",
                "Yes, the lectures were amazing and really made me think about health issues in America in a different way",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This course exposes acts of racism that are rarely discussed in medical school, and any student who is pre-med or interested in public health should absolutely take this course. For example, this course exposes the ways in which medical schools continue to perpetuate a belief that Black patients experience less pain. Students will also leave with a new perspective toward cadaver labs.",
                "Yes!!! A thousand times yes. Please take this course while you still have the opportunity to do so at Yale. There is no other course available like this one in its structure, support, and community. Professor Roberts and TAs are invested in YOUR success, in whatever terms that means to you and will do anything to support you to achieve that success. To make the most out of the course, I would recommend being proactive with the readings to get the most out of lecture. Lecture flies by so quickly due to Professor Robert's engaging way of presenting information and is a time for you to listen and just be present in that lecture.",
                "Yes! A great class, low-stress, very interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course because it is very important for people to be aware of the struggles Black people have faced and continue to face in this country.",
                "YES! Everyone should take this class. I left each lecture feeling like I needed to go out that very day and start working against the problems we had learned about. It is inspiring, heartbreaking, and deeply important. Prof. Roberts is a joy and you should take advantage of this class.",
                "Absolutely. This is one of the most influential and important classes I have taken at Yale thus far.",
                "YESSSS!!!!!! I cannot stress this enough. This is the best class I have aver taken at Yale. It was refreshing to see a professor care so much about us and our learning.",
                "YES! Take this course! Please the information is valuable for any future career.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, but I would give them a heads up that the topics discussed are quite heavy, heartbreaking, and often difficult ot deal with. However, if you're able to find ways to stay optimistic for the future, I would definitely recommend this class. I thought the readings were challenging (definitely not a \"gut class\" if you actually do them) and found the assignments to be unique and exciting. The weekly sections were also conducive to good discussion, and were a key part of this class experience.",
                "Absolutely, 1000%",
                "Absolutely! Such vital information to understand how America is structured socially and racially.",
                "I can't recommend this course enough! It is not a lot of work, but the lectures are amazing and thought provoking. The material is also extremely important for everyone to know, so that the world can become a safer and more welcoming place for everyone.",
                "Yes! Everyone should take this course no matter what field or interests",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students because the course content is so important and the professor allows you to engage with the material in a way that is conducive to your learning.",
                "I would. It was interesting and you got out of this class as much as you put in.",
                "Yes. This class should be mandatory",
                "Yes, important topics for everyone to learn about plus lots of opportunities to engage with the content in an individualized way",
                "Yes, definitely recommend!! The course was incredibly well-organized with very intentional assignments that facilitated learning and exploring. Every lecture was super engaging and definitely learned lots! I have also never had such a passionate and caring professor or teaching staff. This was by far the best Yale class I have taken!",
                "Yes, it was amazing to learn about all the material. I would especially recommend it to premed students, as it will be very relevant to your futures as physicians.",
                "absolutely! this course was life-changing and anyone who wishes to pursue a career in healthcare needs to take this course",
                "I would recommend this course to every student at Yale because it makes you reevaluate your knowledge on systematic racism and the healthcare system in America.",
                "Yes, I learned so much and the material was so intriguing.",
                "Just take it.",
                "PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE! Professor Roberts creates an engaging environment and I think that the information in this course is so important for every person to know.",
                "Absolutely. Everyone should take this. Highly rewarding course.",
                "Yes! Favorite class at Yale so far",
                "I would recommend this class be taken 100 times if i could. I think because it starts with science, it legitimizes harmful stereotypes that are perceived as myths. There is so much love and beauty that comes from both outrage and hope. That is the classroom environment I felt in the 500 person lecture hall and in the small 18 person discussion section.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it is the most important class Ive taken at this school. It teaches the history that is hidden from many during primary and secondary school, and its important that everyone get a chance to learn this history.",
                "absolutely! One of the best courses offered at Yale.",
                "Yes! The professor is great and the course allows you to learn a lot without the burden of too much coursework.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Professor Roberts lectures are brilliant, taking you through each time period as if you were someone being treated in a hospital. You walk out of the lecture hall after every class thinking about the implications of medical racism, making you want to enact change in your life and others. The course really allows you to reflect on your life and your contribution to others as well.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student as it contributed to completely altering my view of the world. While I have become disillusioned in regard to the current health system, I believe that the material taught in this course has helped me better understand that the healthcare system must be rectified to become effective for the members most harmed by it. I would have never learned this material in school, and after attending lectures and reading the readings, I have realized that school systems must be changed to teach history effectively and relevant to children.",
                "Yes, 100%!!! This is one of my favorite if not my favorite course I have taken at Yale. The topics we cover, and the way in which it is taught, deemphasize grades and assessing how you are doing in a stressful environment, and instead invite us to an experience of learning in which we genuinely want to engage with the material and each take creative ways to do so. This is the type of grading mantra every professor should utilize  where engagement with the material is emphasized.",
                "1000x yes!!!! Must take.",
                "Yes. Honestly believe it is necessary for people to take.",
                "This course is a MUST! Prof Roberts is amazing and you will learn SO much. Any prospective pre-meds should absolutely take this course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student. I think this knowledge is critical for all Yale students to learn about.",
                "Yes absolutely, the content in this course is so important and necessary for every student.",
                "Absolutely--this is a class of a lifetime and Professor Roberts is hands down the most compassionate professor ever",
                "YES TAKE THIS COURSE",
                "YES! If you have the chance to take this course, you are lucky. By far one of the most impactful and important courses I will ever take. Opened my eyes to so much important history and tied it back to medical practice today. Professor Roberts is one of a kind. A top course at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this class to everyone!",
                "YES. EVERYONE should take across all majors. Hands down best most engaging class at Yale. Loved it.",
                "Yes, I also thought the final project was very thought provoking because you had your own opportunity to choose a topic and the format of the topic so you had a lot of flexibility.",
                "Yes, every student should learn about this history, and Professor Roberts explains it well in her course.",
                "Yes, but more as an easy class.",
                "Yes! I think everyone should take this course because you learn so much about history that wasn't taught to most of us.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student. There are so many different entry points to this course content wise, and so much for every person to gain from engaging with the historical roots of medical racism and the afterlives of slavery.",
                "Yes absolutely",
                "Yes! This was an amazing course, and I'm so glad I took it. I learned so much about the history of modern medicine that I never knew before. I loved that the class allowed for us to follow our specific interests too through assignments like the sample syllabus and lesson plan, as well as our final projects.",
                "YES! This is a really interesting course, and Professor Roberts is really, really kind and just makes the class so warm. I learned so much and think that this history is really important.",
                "Take this class!",
                "Yes, yes, YES! Especially if you are pre-med you NEED to take this class because it is so easy to get swept up by the (conscious and unconscious) flow of racism in the medical field.",
                "Yes! This course was a amazing.",
                "I think every student at yale should take this class, it is applicable to everyone.",
                "I recommend this course to anyone who wants to approach their careers and life through a critical and empathetic lens.",
                "This is the best class I have ever taken at the school. You learn so much and get the chance to really discuss the material and the ways that you want to interact the material going forward.",
                "100000%",
                "For a class like this, it's not about whether I think you should take the course (I do! wholeheartedly), it's about whether you will take this course for the right reasons. Professor Roberts is a gem; she is warm and kind and brilliant and passionate and there for all her students. Do not take advantage of that. Quite frankly, I was in a class with a lot of white people who seemed to be in the class for an \"easy A\". Those people are racist. I watched as they ignored Professor Robert's lectures in favor of whispering amongst themselves, they laughed when we discussed the disproportionately high rate of maternal mortality among Black people. I cannot stress this enough, please don't enroll in this class if you are not going to pay attention, not going to honor the voices of vulnerable and hurt people who have decided to share, not going to honor Professor Roberts and Kenya who put their all into every class. \r\n\r\nBut on to the positives, this class is truly life-changing. I almost cried at the end of every lecture. The class made me a better student and classmate, a better (future) teacher, and a better friend. If you can enroll in this course knowing you will show up for yourself, the teaching staff and your classmates, then you should definitely take this class!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is or isn't interested in healthcare. Because this is not just a class about healthcare but also about a history that still directly or indirectly affects all of us today.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. In fact, I think every Yale student should try and take it before graduating. It is all upside and no downside and incredibly eye-opening.",
                "This class might actually change your life - it is so important to take it. It is the best class I have taken in four years at Yale.",
                "Yes--incredibly unique experience you don't get often.",
                "Yes! One of my favorite classes at Yale, and should be required for any student of medicine, history, American studies, public health, or ER&M.",
                "Yes. Every Yale student, especially pre-health professional students, should be required to take this class.",
                "Yes, definitely! This history is so essential to learn and I feel like I am coming out of this course as someone who understands our current climate much more deeply.",
                "Absolutely, in fact I have. This is one of my favorite classes I have ever taken.",
                "YES!!! critical for anyone who plans to go into medicine (I think it should be required for bio majors\/premeds).",
                "absolutely yes. i think the whole world should get to take this class.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course! It completely transformed my understanding of science and medicine, their entanglements with histories of violence, and the unsung heroes who fought and continue to fight for a more just, healthy world. In a course which delves deeply into histories and legacies of medical violence, abuse, and neglect, as well as resistance and resilience among Black people in the Americas, Professor Roberts teaches with such compassion and respect regarding these histories and the communities impacted by them, as well as the students who engage with them. Perhaps what I appreciate most about this course is the culture of care that is fostered as we embark on this journey of learning and unlearning. I will never forget my experience in this class.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! Not only is it very important history but it also was excellently taught for students of all different backgrounds.",
                "I would 1000% recommend this course to any other student. It's incredibly important to learn about the history of this country that is often overlooked\/ unspoken because it allows us to be informed about where this country is really coming from and why things are the way they are today.  But I would say to only take this class if you are willing to learn and give the content the time and attention it deserves because what we learn is important and sensitive and deserves to be treated with respect!",
                "Yes! This course is heavy, but so important. You will learn so much and probably come out a more thoughtful person.",
                "Yes; this is a course that every student, regardless of their major, should take in order to expand their perspectives on the world and think in a more critical, honest, and inclusive way."
