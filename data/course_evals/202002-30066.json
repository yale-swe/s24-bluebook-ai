   "comments": [
    "Nature of societal collapse and its causes.",
    "The course introduced me to a field I knew nothing about: anthropology and climate change. Through the course, I feel that I learned multiple classes worth of material while also seeing how Harvey Weiss, a professional in the field, approached his work.",
    "-An excellent understanding of current debates surrounding the causes of societal collapse\r\n-Where societal collapse occurs in the archaeological record\r\n-Correspondences between the paleoclimatological record of abrupt climate shifts and societal change",
    "In this course, we studied the various paleoclimate records that historians use to track climate in the past. We learned to read textbooks critically and analyze the arguments that historians have made about different collapse events across history.",
    "I had no understanding of anything that was taught in this class prior to taking it, and thus everything I learnt was new to me. The connection between climate events and ancient collapse events was fascinating.",
    "I learned a great deal about historical collapses and civilizations and how all of this relates to natural and anthropogenic climate change. I learned to critically analyze data and develop my own conclusions about why societies collapsed.",
    "The factors contributing to ancient society collapses and what makes societies fragile. Understanding collapse usually does not involve one cause. Helps reflect on modern day -- are we declining and heading toward societal collapse?",
    "This course gave me comprehensive knowledge of climatological change collapse events throughout human history. We looked at multiple events from a variety of scholarly perspectives, and I was surprised by the number of different conclusions that can be drawn from the same data about the same collapse event.",
    "I learned about the tools (paleoclimate proxies) that archaeologists use to determine rainfall and other climatic conditions during the past. I also learned about the perspectives of different authors regarding collapse, defining collapse, and the various factors that can contribute to collapse.",
    "This course covers the history of ancient societal collapses: the theories for why they occurred, and the archaeological and paleoclimate evidence that exists to support those theories. The material covered gives you the ability to analyze collapse theories critically, and has interesting implications on the future of anthropogenic climate change.",
    "I learned about 5 paleoclimate proxies and what they can tell us about 7 major societal collapses. It was difficult to read the articles at first, but with practice I was able to extract the relevant information from the scientific data.  The final essay, a two-page synopsis  of the entire course, was challenging.  It was a great exercise in concision and deciding what to include and what to leave out.",
    "I was never well informed in empires and throughout this course it taught me many things that I didnt know before abut societal collapse and collapse of empires. The discussions we have in class has helped developed my critical thinking and gives me a different perceptive on the reason these empires failed. I also got to learn that many empires during this time their reason for their collapses was a sustained drought throughout that area and it wasnt adaptable so they ended up habitat tracking to different settlements.",
    "A deeper understanding of ancient civilizations and the reasons for their collapse, as well as research skills.",
    "I learned about the impacts of climate change on societies in the past, and the implications of droughts on collapse or resilience, especially in areas that relied on rain-fed agriculture. This is especially applicable today, where anthropogenic causes of climate change can have similar effects on communities. I enjoyed learning about different societies (from Mesopotamia to the Mayans to modern ones such as India under British colonialism). I also appreciated the multi-disciplanary approach to climate changewe discussed archeology, environmental science, humanities, social theory, and history.",
    "Through this course, I was able to understand the quantifiable aspects of climate change better, as well as its implications on the collapse of certain developed societies. I was also able to analyze a number of different theories regarding collapse and assess the viability of each based on the paleoclimate data that has been found in the past century."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very interesting material and readings! Reading were alot at times though. I would have preferred a bit more structure as there were only two assignments which each constituted 50% of your grade. But, of course, that's hard given the nature of a shortened and online term.",
    "All the material was extremely interesting and engaging. Our discussions were very one sided, leaning on Professor Weiss' opinion and discussing why it is better than other opinions in the field, but maybe this is to be expected from the course. It would be nice if he put a little more effort into addressing other vantage points than just his own. However, you go through the course pretty blind, and really have no idea how you have done until your final grade is released. And 50% final exam, 50% final essay is a bit weird.",
    "Strengths include:\r\n-Extremely interesting subject \r\n-Very enthusiastic teacher who clearly cares very much about teaching \r\n-Well-illustrated talks and well-illustrated clashes in the literature on the subject\r\n-Good review of materials at the beginning of each class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Some of the graphs were somewhat odd and\/or difficult to parse (less so an issue with the paleoclimate graphs, more so with web graphs and those illustrating efficiency of different farming techniques; I'd suggest scaling the data points on the latter to be proportional with hectares occupied\r\n-Some more in class discussion would be appreciated",
    "This course managed to cover a huge amount of material in considerable depth, yet was still approachable to someone who has never taken a history or anthropology course in college. The readings were very insightful, the slides were always helpful and well organized, and it was just an overall fun and educational class. I'm sure it could be improved by having the class in person instead of on zoom, but it still managed to work really well over zoom.",
    "The length of the seminar (3 hours) made it difficult to remain focussed for the entire lesson.",
    "The strengths were the communication of the professor and his willingness to share his ideas and answer any and all questions that were asked.",
    "The final grade consists of only 2 things -- a final paper and a final exam. I know that professors don't hand-hold students to get them to do the readings, but a quick and short review quiz of important lessons from each reading would be helpful. Harvey is very knowledgeable and distinguished in this field, but sometimes I zone out because what he's saying seems insignificant to the course. One criticism I have of him is the words he uses to describe past atrocities like American slavery and the world wars, calling them amazing and fantastic stories. From a grand history viewpoint, sure, it is amazing how ancient events get repeated in the modern era. I still cringe when American slavery is described with positive words like amazing.",
    "The course was extremely comprehensive, interdisciplinary, and engaging. Since there was so much material in the short summer semester, it was sometimes difficult to stay on top of reading assignments, but other than that, the course was excellent.",
    "3 hour lectures during the summer is tough... I honestly feel like we could have easily cut an hour off of lecture time on some days. The readings were also a bit long, but a lot of the information was really helpful and Professor Weiss didn't expect us to memorize every single detail of the readings- more so just getting a general idea of what was occurring during the time period and what the authors felt led to the decline.\r\n\r\nOverall Professor Weiss is a SUPER knowledgable professor and he's very passionate about what he teaches. This was also one of the few times I actually enjoyed being assigned the Professor's own book to read. Professor Weiss is very good at explaining and describing societal collapse in a way that is easy for someone with no archaeological experience to understand.",
    "The course departs an immense amount of information in a very short period of time. That being said, it does so well: the lectures are organized and very clear. The only weakness is that the amount of information provided can overwhelm students' ability to think critically. Given the contention in the field of collapse studies, it can feel you are following Weiss blindly into his own biased understanding of the field. That being said, the course does provide the information and tools necessary to distance yourself from all theories and examine them absent of the professor's bias.",
    "This is a fascinating topic taught by an engaging and passionate professor. He presented a range of theories re societal collapse.  The readings were carefully chosen.",
    "Over the summer, there were just far too many readings too keep up with. This is a shame, because they all were very interesting readings!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Harvey Weiss is very knowledgable and you learn alot.",
    "Yes if you are looking for a low-effort but interesting class. Just know that it is disconcerting being completely blind to how you are doing in the class until your final grade is released.",
    "I would recommend this course. It covers a lot of history and material, and was really great for someone who hasn't studied history\/anthropology very much. I learned a lot, about things I've never really thought about before!",
    "Yes if this topic interested them. It is a rather specific topic that I found extremely interesting however that will vary depending on the individual.",
    "Yes, because it was extremely interesting and taught me a lot about how climate history is determined, which is something I believe to be very important for everyone to study in order to help improve our society today.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course. Understanding the past helps guide where societies are going today.",
    "I would recommend this course. Since it is so interdisciplinary, I think pretty much anyone could find something enjoyable in this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! During the academic year, it's super popular and hard to get in, so I'm glad I was able to take it over the summer. The workload wasn't too bad and Professor Weiss' expectations are totally fair. Great way to get a HU credit.",
    "Yes! This course is fascinating and well taught. It is especially relevant for students interested in natural resource management and\/or sociology and politics. I would really recommend it to anyone, though. The material covered reframed how I thought about the history of human interaction with nature, and gave me a better understanding of the problems contemporary societies face because of anthropogenic climate change.",
    "Yes.  This course was interesting and fun.  I never would have learned about these topics without the class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student especially EVST majors since the information in this class is very interesting. The reading might seem like a lot but it is very interesting material on the different empires and their history.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I would definitely recommend, especially if they are in STEM. The course integrates both history and paleoclimate data to provide a likely explanation for the collapse of many of the greatest societies of the past."
