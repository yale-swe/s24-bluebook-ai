I became much more comfortable with my spoken French and gained fluency; I feel much better equipped to use more complicated verb tenses in my everyday speech than I did before this semester.",
                "My French skills, including my reading and writing capabilities, my vocabulary, my oral fluency, and my listening comprehension all improved tremendously. At the same time, I learned a good deal more about select periods or movements from the history of France or French territories thanks to the literature and films that we studied.",
                "Throughout this course, my speaking, reading, writing and comprehension skills in French improved tremendously. I was also able to learn about different aspects of francophone culture that I hadn't previously been exposed to in terms of art, film, and history.",
                "Significantly improved written french skills, and further formalized grammatical comprehension. Increase confidence in range of reading abilities, given the different types of works taught.",
                "New French vocabulary and grammar (first new grammar concepts since placing into 140), read some interesting books",
                "Developed a lot of my vocabulary and speaking abilities in the course, especially learning how to be an active participant in a discussion.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: lots of opportunities for speaking and practice; fun and low-stress classroom environment, even when speaking in front of your peers in an unfamiliar language; consistent drumbeat of work but never an absurd amount (especially if you've been coming up through the ranks of FREN 110, 120, etc. -- FREN 150 is definitely a fair amount of work, but nothing like those earlier semesters!). Room for improvement: It would have been very helpful to have a detailed syllabus of assignments available at the start of the semester. Instead, every Thursday, the following week's assignments would be listed, and larger assignments like tests and papers were listed from the beginning of the semester. While the homework felt pretty routine and predictable after a few weeks, for the first few weeks, it was very difficult to gauge how much work to expect and how much time to budget for the class.",
                "The strengths of this course are numerous: the discussion-based format of the small class really encourages the participation that is necessary to improve your listening and speaking; the material studied is genuinely quite interestingI particularly enjoyed the books \"Le cur  rire et  pleurer\" and \"\"Art\"\" and the film \"Rouge\"; the assignments were all varied in type, and I felt like this variability between intrrogations, rdactions, and oral presentations/discussions really forced me to improve all areas of my French; and Madame Schneider was a wonderful professor. The only weakness I can think of is that it might be helpful, particularly as you're getting into the higher levels of French at Yale, to incorporate some more modern-day works and a focus on more contemporary/slangy language, so as to best prepare students who are thinking of living and studying in French-speaking countries.",
                "The strengths of this course are the discussion-based nature of the course, extensive vocabulary learned throughout the semester, and the mix of mediums(films, music, articles, books) used to facilitate learning throughout this course. The weaknesses of this course are the fact that analysis was not emphasized during the discussion of the material(the focus was mostly the plot and was not always accompanied by an analysis of the text), there was not enough nonwhite representation within the material chosen for the course, and there wasn't a proper discussion of racial slurs used in French when they were presented in the text.",
                "Strengths: excellent syllabus with good collection of different readings / issues covered; better mix of evaluations than FREN140 given emphasis on written components. \r\n\r\nNo real weaknesses, but think that 4 days / week instead of 3 would have been all the better.",
                "The course is difficult and moves at a fast pace but I think it is fairly appropriate for a language course at this level",
                "I liked all the readings and I think they each really helped develop my language skills in different ways! I wish we had had more creative projects",
                "The daily workload of this class was very demanding, as the homework often consisted of many different components, many of which we didn't even have time to cover during class. However, the course is structured well in that it balances readings with grammar exercises and vocabulary, and even more exciting content such as music videos, so the homework is not too repetitive."

                "Yes, if you want French to be a priority and are committed to learning the language. I definitely think that I could've gotten more out of the class had I spent more time on it during the week. I did all of the readings and assignments, but I think that to really solidify my French, I should have cemented the new vocab and concepts more than I did. So I'd recommend the class but would note that to get the most out of it, you are going to need to treat it as a priority, as with other courses in the French department.",
                "Yes, but be prepared to work a lot.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I had finished my language requirement with L4 French, so I did not need to take it, but I wanted to keep working on my French and had had such a wonderful experience with the French department already that I decided to take L5. I'm incredibly glad I did; it's the kind of course that feels very manageable within a fuller (5-credit) schedule, especially coming out of L3/L4, because it doesn't meet every day and you don't do nearly as much grammar work that can feel kind of rote in those other courses, but at the same time like those other classes you learn a lot and it's simply and genuinely funreally, I looked forward to going to French every day. If you have the space available, I'd highly recommend taking this class, especially if you have the opportunity to do so with Madame Schneider (though to be fair, I haven't had a bad professor in the French department at Yale, nor have I heard of one from anyone else!).",
                "Yes. I learned a lot of French",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is looking to improve their reading, writing, comprehension and speaking skills in French and are willing to put in a lot of work to make this happen. Although it only meets three days a week, there is still a substantial amount of time and energy required to fully immerse yourself into this course.",
                "I would recommend the course for anyone taking their French studies seriously: the syllabus is structured to allow students to get more out the more they put in.  The course offers a platform to explore French culture / contemporary issues more broadly.",
                "If a student was committed to continuing their French studies, yes.",
                "French 150 is definitely a challenge but if you have done L4 before you are probably used to it. Otherwise, it might be a shock but worthwhile if you are very interested in French and want to continue with it."
