                "The strength of this course is Prof. Schwartz's knowledge, as well as the wide period of history it covers. Simply from the wealth of stories and areas covered in this class, there is bound to be something that a student will find interesting. In addition, the paper structure is pretty flexible, I liked the second prompt that allowed you to analyze a primary document of your choosing. \r\nThe weaknesses of this course are the organization of lectures and the discrepancy of readings. The lectures jump between time periods, regions, and continents, and it can be a little confusing at times. In addition, the readings can vary from week to week, being either 20 pages or 200, and sometimes there is too much reading to facilitate good discussion because everyone skims it.",
                "The only thing that could be improved would be the accessibility of the readings.",
                "I thought that the topics were fascinating and Prof. Schwartz was very, very informed on everything he discussed. The lectures were very engaging! However, in the second half of the course, I thought there was very little flow from lecture to lecture -- I think the course could have benefited from slightly more structure.",
                "Weaknesses: lectures and readings do not align much. Due to the high volume of reading, I was not always able to finish all the reading and the lecture did not provide enough context to allow me to still gain a general understanding.\r\nStrengths: covered a lot of material"
