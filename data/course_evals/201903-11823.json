    "I developed a solid understanding of the basics of the Spanish language both through written, oral, and listening practice.",
    "I furthered my knowledge of Spanish.",
    "Having taken AP Spanish and the classes leading up to it in High School, this course was a bit trivial in the grammar and materials. However, being required to speak in Spanish every day for an hour was extremely beneficial and was the best takeaway from the class.",
    "Spanish grammar.",
    "I was able to develop my Spanish-speaking skills quite a lot, and found a deeper love for the language. Also, I was able to learn a lot about the history and culture of many Spanish-speaking countries.",
    "I learned a lot about grammar and also a lot of vocabulary in Spanish.",
    "I learned (and re-learned) a lot about the Spanish language: vocab, grammar, etc. I also learned a significant amount about Spanish culture and the cultures of various Spanish-speaking countries.",
    "Improved my Spanish but not enough for the amount of work required.",
    "I learned many new tenses and new units. My vocabulary as definitely expanded greatly."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths. Workload was heavier than L1, which definitely helped with keeping the language in your brain. The course could use more speaking though.",
    "My strengths in this course were my attempts to speak and to understand, staying actively engaged in conversation in order to better my listening and speaking abilities. However, I could have taken a lot of the smaller assignments more seriously and put more effort into the homework and into studying for exams.",
    "Follows the textbook, easy to understand.",
    "I think the strengths of the course is that it is really engaging for everyone in the classroom--or easy to participate in. I think it could be improved by practicing the grammar techniques a little bit more.",
    "Strengths included the strict structure and the fact that the class meets every day, and the syllabus was very comprehensive. I wish I had more practice with speaking in a conversational setting to apply the grammar we learned.",
    "This course does really well at teaching students Spanish. As someone who hadn't taken Spanish in two and a half years, I was able to re-learn most of the essential aspects of reading, speaking and writing in Spanish. One area that can be improved is the amount of work required.",
    "Good course but HARD. Try to take it freshman year before your other classes pickup. Lots of homework. Much of the reading material was above our level.",
    "Strengths include the organization. \r\nNo weaknesses were obvious however more review material would have been welcomed."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it's good for improving Spanish.",
    "I would recommend taking either a higher level, L3 Spanish course or taking Introductory L1. I feel like the material covered was almost like a permanent review all year long, which is nice if it is needed. However if a student is interested in learning new material they should take L3 and if a student is just starting they should take L1",
    "Yes- it will improve your Spanish",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. The professor was very engaging, and made the class enjoyable. Also, one is able to facilitate close relationships in the class because of the size and the activities we did.",
    "Yes, if that student was truly interested in learning Spanish than they have to learn grammar and vocab which this class offers.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to someone who's not taking it to fulfill their language requirement. L2 is a lot of work, some of it unnecessary at times. But if you take it, you will learn a lot and all aspects with regard to the language will improve.",
    "Spanish is good to take for the language credit, so yes.",
    "Yes. I believe that learning a second language is important and this courses organization made it less stressful."
