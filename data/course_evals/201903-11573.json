    "I had a great experience in this class. The speakers were very informative and every week was a different topic.",
    "Overview of theories on causes of terrorism. Current trends in far-right terrorism, Jihadi terrorism, and the relationship between terrorism and the media. Using quantitative studies to evaluate scholarly claims.",
    "Learned a lot about different theories behind terrorism, as well as societal implications",
    "Critical analysis of large amounts of readings, as well as differing opinions, and empirical data",
    "I think that this class is an excellent way to become better at stating your opinions in class. Prof. Weir does not go easy on people when their opinions are not well thought out, and I think this pushes people to be better at elucidating opinions on touchy subjects. I also think the readings from this class give a good understanding of the theoretical aspects of terrorism, although I found it a bit too focused on the single case study of the Troubles.",
    "I learnt a lot about what terrorism is defined as, the difficulties in profiling people and different instances of terrorism around the world. I really loved the course and each week had very different but engaging topics.",
    "Learned a lot about terrorism and its roots and causes- very important topic to learn more in depth about in face of the constant media frenzy about terrorism.",
    "I learned a lot about the underlying causes of terrorist behavior and about different terrorist organizations around the world.",
    "I learned about the motivations behind terrorist groups, as well as what distinguishes terrorism as an extremist tactic."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The speakers complement the class material well. \r\nWeaknesses: Fewer student presentations and more professor lectures would help bring everything together.",
    "Strengths: Solid readings, fascinating guest speakers, and Professor Weir's leadership in directing seminar conversations. Weaknesses: Need to find a good balance in terms of time allocation between class discussions and guest speakers.",
    "Great base of readings. Excellent speaker selection. Good discussion around presentations. No big weaknesses",
    "There really aren't any weaknesses to this course, the subject matter was very interesting, the professor was helpful, and there were plenty of resources available to us to help us learn.",
    "I thing Professor Weir is the biggest strength of the class. She is excellent at facilitating discussion, and is very willing to correct and critique students, meaning that participating in discussion does not just mean making everyone aware that one came to class. In addition, Professor Weir is very knowledgable about the Troubles, and due to her connections in Ireland is able to bring in interesting guests.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are a few drawbacks to the class that must be considered before taking it. First, this class is very heavily focused on the Troubles, and with good reason, as Prof. Weir probably knows more about the troubles than anyone else in the United States, and many of her contacts are in Ireland. Another potential issue is the fact that most guests are unable to physically come to campus. While generally engaged, there are frequent issues with connectivity, etc. which often leads to issues with their presentations.\r\n\r\nI think the greatest way this class could be improved is by bringing in more case studies than the Troubles.",
    "Strengths:\r\n-interesting readings \r\n-lots of different and interesting speakers \r\n-Bonnie is an amazing Professor\r\n-the student presentations were interesting to listen to \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-keep up to date with canvas as the speaker responses are not in for the next class but usually mid-week. Not a weakness but keep checking the syllabus!",
    "Bonnie is lit!",
    "Strengths: the material was really interesting and well presented; guest speakers were relevant and a strong complement to readings. Weaknesses: the majority of class time was spent on discussion or student presentations, which meant material\/readings was sometimes poorly or inaccurately  represented with little instructor input.",
    "Course material was super interesting and she brought in really cool guest speakers! Weakness was that the professor is a bit disorganized."

   "comments": [
    "Yes - great course and great professor",
    "Sure, it was interesting material to learn.",
    "Any student interested in understanding why terrorists radicalize, terrorism in different political and cultural societies, and the nuances behind who is called a \"terrorist\" should take this course. All of the readings and speakers were fascinating, and I would happily take any of Prof. Weir's other courses.",
    "Yes. The readings and speakers are great, and Prof Weir is a very engaging instructor.",
    "Absolutely. This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale and I was genuinely excited to go to each seminar, because the readings and conversations were always engaging. Professor Weir is very impressive and is able to push students to achieve more, but in a very friendly manner, which I really appreciated. Also, I was amazed by the amount of guest speakers she was able to bring in and the practical conversations we were able to have with people involved in organizations, as well as other scholars from the field.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, but with the caveat that he or she should be aware that the class is heavily based around the Troubles.",
    "Absolutely! Incredibly interesting content, great speakers and an amazing professor. Bonnie also lets you write a paper that isnt a response to the prompts so the final paper can relate to your interests!",
    "Yes! Bonnie is an amazing Professor and on top of that the knowledge you gain from this course is so important in face of todays climate regarding terrorism.",
    "Yes! You will spend a lot of time on readings and the instructor does very little teaching, the combination of discussion, readings, and guest speakers is really interesting.",
    "Id definitely recommend this course!",
    "Yes, this course definitely gives you what you put in- the more effort you put in, the more you will get out of the course."
