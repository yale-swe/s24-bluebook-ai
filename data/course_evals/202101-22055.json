                "The class is structured really well and covers a wide-range of topics within Discrete Mathematics",
                "I loved this course, although some of the content was not clearly applicable to computer science. I'm not sure if the applications will become clear in later classes, but putting more of the material in context, even if it's only \"you might use this in xyz class or in xyz situation,\" would be appreciated.",
                "The course was very enjoyable; I had a lot of fun taking it. One particular weakness was office hours being held at the most inconvenient times. The problem sets were typically due on Tuesdays, and there were a lot of office hours Wednesday through Friday, which is when I would focus on other courses, and not many office hours on the days leading up to the submission deadline. I think office hours should be made closer to the deadline, or at least, split evenly so as to allow students to use help when needed. Most students don't work on a problem set 2 immediately after they submit problem set 1.",
                "The course was taught well, and the problem sets and exams were very reasonable. I'd say the main weakness of the course is that it doesn't go in depth into any topics, instead opting for maximal breadth. I'm not sure exactly what of this information is necessary for a CS major, but I can't see how most of the content of the course would be applicable, as most of the material was either very intuitive or covering topics not directly relevant to coding.",
                "Professor Bridy always made sure to give enough time to prepare for tests and to complete psets. The ULA's and TA's grading of homework was always very thorough and they would leave a lot of comments. Same with the homework and homewoek solutions always being posted on a timely manner. \r\n\r\nThe course material was straightforward but felt very loosely structured off the textbook. As expected with introductory courses, I felt that there was a lot that we didn't get to cover. I hope this will not make future classes more difficult.",
                "Course was very good.",
                "I think the course could be related more to computer science, especially since it is part of the department, and covered less material than I had hoped it would. At the same time, professor Bridy did a great job of pacing the course, so I am not sure how more material could have been covered. Additionally, there was a good availability of teaching fellows and the consistent inclusion of practice problems during class made the material much more understandable compared to a lecture where material is just presented and students are expected to identify how to use the material in the problem sets.",
                "This class is incredibly organized and overall great. The only weakness is the lack of advanced warning about the date of exams.",
                "Great teacher and week my week workload. Only weakness would be there arent many resources outside of the class for reading that are available other than text book",
                "Strengths: manageable and applicable psets, Bridy is a very patient instructor and receptive to students' questions, exams are fair, lecture notes are organized Weakness: distribution of materials -- I wish there was more of a focus on linear algebra and run-time instead of number theory (but this semester did present some challenges that decreased the time we could spend on certain topics), could be a bit more challenging",
                "Was taught in a way that made the material easier to understand. I think the main weakness is that we dont really cover a lot of material for the class to be too useful.",
                "Nicely structured. Great teaching.",
                "I appreciated the examples that we worked through in class, but overall I thought that the lectures could have been more engaging.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bridy was a great instructor for this class, and made the concepts really clear. If you understood the psets well, you were able to understand the material in the course (and they corresponded well to each other). TAs at office hours were also always helpful with answering questions.",

                "I do wish that there could have been a little time spent explaining common mistakes that people make when constructing a proof. It was just hard to know when your line of reasoning was faulty or not.",
                "Prof Bridy is a really kind and understanding professor. He teaches with lots of examples, and combines both writing out examples with PowerPoint proofs  super effective imo. I wasnt a fan of the grading scheme though, as making just a few small mistakes end up bringing you below the average for 24-hr open book exams",

Out of all my teachers, he was the one to care most for his students, cancelling homeworks occasionally and allowing us students to feel less pressure in these times. He would also dedicate many lectures to answering questions, which was really nice. I also liked the stress-free exams that we had, since we could pace ourselves and work on them throughout the day, instead of feeling pressured and watched. This also allowed for me to think deeply about the problems and analyze them carefully, which let me appreciate the material and not just try and get it done with.",
