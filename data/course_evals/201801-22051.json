   "comments": [
    "I learned about different perspectives on human sexuality from the late 19th century to the present day.",
    "I learned so much about the evolution of sexuality through the lens of science and anthropology. I feel so much more powerful after taking this class because I am able to discuss sexuality comfortably and academically. As a STEM student, it is easy to get stuck in the rut of memorizing concepts and doing problems, but this class taught me how to think and analyze ideas and theories. I gained a new perspective on sexuality and learned how to write papers on primary sources, theory, and archival materials. I learned about Yale's manuscripts and archives room resource.",
    "Writing skills improved as course progressed. Learned to read documents critically and develop independent opinions on different writings. use of archival materials was new and very interesting",
    "Aside from gaining deep insights into each of the readings we discussed, I learned a lot about the different ways you can look at how science and culture interacts, why we value certain knowledge systems more than others, and also how to improve my writing.",
    "I learned critical thinking and how to read older documents. I learned that sexuality is very complicated, but it is important to see how people have dealt with it throughout history.",
    "By reading various sources, from psychological texts to philosophical ones, I learned about the, as the course title would imply, the history of sexuality. However, in doing so, I found the ways in which the scientific world has influenced societal views on the variation of sexuality. I also learned about how power structures affect the way sexuality is viewed and understood.",
    "This course is more about the History of academic discourse of sexuality, than it is a course on history of sexualities, if that makes sense. Although you will discover if you take this class that those two things are much more the same thing that you might seem. We learned about how different academic disciplines from the nineteenth century forward were crucial to creating sexuality as the social category that it is today, and considered what the consequences of that are. But Professor Trumpler doesn't spoonfeed you these conclusions; she is careful to let student-led discussion bring out the crucial points.",
    "I developed a greater perspective on human sexuality than just that which exists in western societies today. I also developed better and more efficient writing habits. Learning how to do a research paper using the archives was also an amazing experience."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is very well designed and thorough on Western views on sexuality; and the readings and discussions are very engaging. It would be interesting for the course to also give a broader view on sexuality in Eastern cultures.",
    "This class is already amazing as is. I would love to see more readings outside of western and European culture, but that is very difficult to do, and the readings that Maria assigned this semester have been perfect in building up our skills to read more difficult texts. The strength of this course is that the learning occurs among the students with Maria guiding our discussion. The papers are not a chore to write, and they increase my understanding of the readings in class.",
    "I thought this course was incredibly interesting, a fun class to be and participate in, and Prof. Trumpler was a fantastic instructor.",
    "This course honestly was the most well-organized seminar I've been in. The content is engaging (especially the part where we visit the archives and do our own archival work) and difficult enough that I always felt challenged.",
    "I think a strength was Professor Trumpler's ability to direct a seminar discussion. She rarely lectured, or gave us dogmatic information, instead preferring to find ways for our conversation to tease it out. She was really amazing at getting almost everyone in the class to contribute (not in a forceful manner, but by creating a comfortable academic setting), which allowed for really diverse arguments and articulations on the assigned texts. I also think the final assignment working with archive material is such a  valuable learning experience that I am sure I will be grateful for in future years."

   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning more about the academic perspective of sexuality, and the sociopolitical implications of knowledge on human sexuality.",
    "Take this course if you can get in. You will not regret it. Maria is a supportive professor who  provides great feedback during the essay writing process. You will be so WOKE after taking it, and you will feel powerful with the new discourse you have learned about sexuality. There are only three assignments and she helps you every step of the way. This class is a MUST TAKE at Yale, and I am so glad that I decided to keep it on my schedule.",
    "Really fascinating course taught be a really fascinating woman.  Prof. Trumpler really cares about her students and her students learning.  Class discussions were interesting and engaging and brought out questions that I never even thought about before.",
    "Highly recommend this course, not just a great WR credit but also for students interested in WGSS- an amazing intro",
    "Absolutely. If you're interested in how our perceptions of sexuality have changed, or to a much lesser extent, scientific history, take this class. Discussions were always interesting, great speakers came in a couple times, and the papers were fun to do.",
    "If you get it, take it! It's a great chance to delve into WGSS, even if you don't plan on pursuing any further course study in that field.",
    "I would definitely recommend! It completely changed my perspective on sexuality and science. I learned so much about a field I had never been exposed to.",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this course to another student. Professor Trumpler is phenomenal and the class is always a blast. Every T\/Th I would look forward to going to class, as our discussions were always fascinating. In addition, all of the readings were great. The papers we did always felt relevant and contributed to my learning immensely. I loved this class--I'd take it again if I could.",
    "Absolutely. Some students might discount this course because it is about sexuality, but I promise you that the lessons you take are very broadly applicable. It speaks a lot about the role of science in society, something that can be hard to find in other classes. I would HIGHLY recommend this class if you are a prospective STEM major. Professor Trumpler is also really great at improving one's writing.",
    "Absolutely! The course is interesting and challenging. The small seminar set up, especially as a freshmen seminar, allows students to gain a lot of confidence in sharing their ideas. The broad prompts for papers allows students to take assignments in a direction that they find interesting and enjoyable."
