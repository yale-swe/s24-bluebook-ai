                "I learned about what stress is, how it affects the body and mind, and ways to effectively cope with stress",
                "I learned a lot about what stress is, what causes stress, who is more likely to experience stress, and how to effectively manage stress. It involved reading empirical papers, making short presentations, and writing essays.",
                "This class taught me how to think critically about how to conceptualize, measure, and talk about stress. I am most grateful for developing my skills in asking questions about research papers.",
                "Many different aspects of stress in life, and how it affects one's health in different sectors of health, including emotional, mental, and physical. Very well-rounded curriculum gives a wide overview of the topic.",
                "I developed good instincts for what lines of questioning to pursue when evaluating an article, and how to convey the intricacies that often answer the questions beyond a yes/no answer\r\n\r\nI learned how to develop and format a policy proposal",
                "I learned stress management skills and how to read empirical papers form start to finish. I also learned that stress is a much bigger topic than I could imagine and there is almost too much to talk about!",
                "This class was incredibly helpful in learning about stress. It's something all of us deal with, often on a daily basis, and I developed a much better understanding of how stress impacts our minds and bodies and things we can begin to do to mitigate the stress. The class was rooted in biological science and also explored stress from sociocultural and psychological perspectives, seeing how, for example, systemic inequalities, stress, and psychopathology may be linked. We had really interesting discussions about the stress management framework, emphasizing the importance of both individual empowerment and systemic changes/assistance in dealing with stress and its effects.",
                "Even though stress is obviously pervasive in our lives, I've never studied the topic from academic, psychological, neurobiological, developmental, and clinical perspectives, so I've gained an enormous amount of knowledge that has altered the way I view stress and its implications in my life. Not only did we gain knowledge about the subject, we were also encouraged and supported to practice stress management skills throughout the week to manage our stress levels. Even though the weekly reaction papers were a major stressor, especially in the beginning of the course, they really pushed me to think critically (e.g., pushing back on claims, asking questions about the text that are thought-provoking, noticing nuances in and between readings) beyond just summarizing and taking at face value the findings in the papers we read. Even though I was initially intimidated by the enormous amount of writing we had to do, I definitely felt like I grew as a writer. I'm also hopeful that I will be better able to critically read and analyze empirical pieces in the future through the skills I've developed through the course."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Dylan as a professor (!), the distribution of the final grade over different assignments so no particular assignment is very stressful, the weekly stress reduction exercises, the final paper proposal (very engaging and relevant, actually exciting to do), presenting the final presentation in front of relevant stake-holders, the interesting discussions each class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: no real weaknesses! I'd suggest leaving a few minutes each class for students to plan out how they will implement the stress reduction exercise that week. This will likely result in more students engaging in them (instead of remembering them right before the stress journal is due). At first the workload was quite high, but Dylan is so receptive to feedback and adjusted the course to make the readings much more manageable.",
                "Strengths: extremely positive, understanding, passionate, and knowledgeable professor; engaged classmates; well-organized and manageable workload",
                "The class was very informative and the material was very interesting to learn! I liked learning actual skills on reducing stress in our own lives. The readings were quite heavy at first, but Dr. Gee was very understanding and accommodated the number of assigned readings.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gee facilitates very thoughtful and exciting conversations! The weekly reaction papers are also super helpful to begin thinking about conversation topics before coming to the seminar. The stress management skill learning was great! Weakness: the policy proposal project was super interesting allowed us to act on what we've learned, but the material covered on paper and presentation very similar (maybe stick to just the presentation and have them be slightly longer in length).",
                "Wonderful, really open discussion. Would have liked more time going over the literature on how to help treat and alleviate the symptoms of stress.",
                "I really enjoyed the flow of this course in weekly reading responses and reflections; they were definitely the strong point!\r\n\r\nThe weakest point of the course was the often single-minded discussion that took place weekly discussing the readings. These discussions were student-led and driven, which is great, but often meant that the class spent so much time on a single reading that had a lot to unpack without touching other readings, which also could have been sources of questions and knowledge.",
                "The strength is Professor Gee. She is so wonderful, caring, and knowledgeable. She really cares about the students.\r\n\r\nI also liked how it was more small assignments versus a couple large ones.\r\n\r\nThe weakness is that there is quite a bit of reading, but Professor Gee was receptive to feedback and it was cut down a bit.",
                "This is by far the best class I have taken at Yale. Dr. Gee is an incredible teacher and is the biggest reason the class is so successful. The material, of course, is engaging, interesting, and useful. However, the way that Dr. Gee encourages individual discussion and discovery, helping us draw important conclusions about stress and its effects and supporting us through our own exploration of stress management practices, is what really made the class so meaningful.",
                "Strengths: We had really robust, fascinating discussions each class, and writing reaction papers definitely better prepared me to engage in those conversations. I also really enjoyed the practical element of the course where we were encouraged to adopt stress management skills to help manage stress in our own lives; the course would not have been what it was without this component. With that being said, however, I appreciated that every single component of the course from journal reflections to reaction papers to jumpstarts to the final policy project were well-thought out and served a purpose (i.e., they were not just busy work that did not promote engagement in the course or with the material). The final project was also phenomenal and unique, and I had a lot of fun and learned a lot while completing it! But I have to say that the biggest strength of this course is Prof. Gee herself, but more on that later on. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not sure if this counts as a weakness of the course, but the workload was overwhelming and highly stressful at the beginning of the course (before midterm evaluations) to the point that I dreaded this course and was not able to enjoy it as much as I did during the latter half. However, Prof. Gee quickly addressed this problem when we voiced our concerns."

                "I absolutely would! All of the content is super interesting, and class discussions are always engaging. Just know that you will have to really engage with the empirical articles /readings each week in order to write a successful reaction paper (and this is the first psychology class where I truly felt I had to do this). Taking this as a senior seminar is also an awesome move. If you're not interested in doing an empirical project, doing the policy proposal for the BA is way more exciting and interesting than a traditional literature review. Dylan is also such a thoughtful and kind professor who cares so much.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class to both psychology and non-psychology students. The subject matter is relatable and well-organized in a way that is doable and appealing to students who are passionate about psychology, and students of other majors.",
                "Yes! Dr. Gee is very understanding of her students and teaches the material well. The concepts we learned were very interesting and class discussions were always very fun.",
                "I would hands-down recommend this course to other students, especially those in the cognitive science, psychology, or neuroscience majors. There aren't a whole lot of opportunities to have be so engaged in a seminar and learn so much both from the professor and from the perspectives of the other students. This has definitely been one of the best courses I've taken!",
                "Yes, this was my favorite class at Yale. Stress is an ever-important topic and the class helps you really thoughtfully think about it.",
                "Highly! Incredible course with fascinating content and an amazing professor.",
                "Yes. Professor Gee is the warmest, kindest, most compassionate professor I have ever had the pleasure of having. Our discussions showed how much she really cared, and the final paper and project are so relevant to our time at Yale, it is especially poignant for graduating seniors. Love Professor Gee and this course.",
                "Yes! As a senior seminar, this class was an excellent way to develop strategies and skills that will help in the future not just academically, but practically and personally. Of particular importance was the stress-coping mechanisms studied and practiced each week, and the reflections that followed determining what were the strong and weak points of each practice.",
                "Yes! Professor Gee is wonderful and you learn a lot.",
                "Yes, I absolutely loved this course!! If you are at all interested in understanding stress, how it impacts your present and future, and how to adaptively cope with stress to minimize its impacts, take this class!",
                "I think every student at Yale should take this class!!!!! This class was personally interesting to me (bio/psych major) and was also the most personally useful and perspective-changing class I have taken in my time at Yale. Dr. Gee really changed the way I think about stress and the role it has on my health. This class takes the perspective that your mind, body, and experiences all interact with one another, and I find that I'm now more aware of these concepts on a personal and societal level. The stress management skills introduced in this class also have been extremely useful to me, both in learning about myself and in developing a proactive, preventative stress management routine.",
                "Yes! The topic is highly relevant to our lives as Yale students (and I guess as human beings in general) and will surely change and expand your understanding of stress. You'll also grow as a critical reader, thoughtful writer, and engaged participant through the assignments and classroom discussions."
