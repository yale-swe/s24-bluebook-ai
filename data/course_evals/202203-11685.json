                "I learned a great deal of information on merger arbitrage, bond pricing, and different investing strategies.",

                "I learned more about finance, specifically how to arbitrage market inefficiencies. Qualitatively, I learned about current events such as FTX, balance sheets, capital structure, volatility, exchanges, and pooled investment vehicles. Quantitatively, I learned about bonds, YTM, CDS, and mergers. Overall, the course was very helpful in learning how the market in general works, and we had great guest speakers across areas of finance to provide further color and insight.",

                "Prof. Pascutti uses a lot of real-world examples in his lectures, also the content is very engaging. A lot of tests, but that helps with comprehension of the material and makes the final not too terrible.",
                "It was disorganized but this is a strength in my opinion. It forces you to really learn the material for the multiple tests throughout the semester. Really felt like I understood the content better because of the structure. No weaknesses.",
                "I wish there were more resources made available to us students. We never received full feedback on exams or had clear materials to study.",
                "Strengths are the material -- if you like finance already and are interested in the syllabus topics then you'll like how up-to-date this class is (often did real examples of very recent events using live data). Weakness is that because of that strength, you never actually get through the math or slide material in class which you are still quizzed\/tested on.",
                "The course covers a wide range of information that is extremely useful and practical for anyone pursuing a career in finance. However, the logistics and course organization could be improved.",
                "Best Econ class here at Yale, hands-down. You'll regret it if you don't take it.",
                "I really enjoy Professor Pascutti's lectures. He covers great content and is a super engaging lecturer who frequently converses with students in the class. While I appreciate that he is passionate about the material, though, the course often feels a bit disjointed, as he tends to jump from topic to topic. I would appreciate if there was a bit more continuity and flow throughout the semester. Problem set and quiz answers could also be a bit more organized. Overall, I loved this class -- I took Professor Pascutti's U.S. Banking System in the spring and think that there is a lot to gain if a student is willing to put in the effort.",
                "The course is really interesting and you learn a lot but it can be a bit disorganized. Pascutti is a great guy as well",
                "The class could talk a bit more about decision making at a portfolio level, on top of individual investment ideas.",
                "Interesting, but not well-organized.",
                "There could be more practice problems released before exams, and participation grading could be a bit clearer.",

                "Absolutely. Probably my second favorite class at Yale. So fun and interesting. Nothing else I could ask for in my senior year. You have to work to teach yourself the content, but it is all worth it.",
                "Not really. It's an interesting subject and Pascutti is clearly passionate about the material, but it is so disorganized that I was always stressed. The tests are curved, which is nice, but it never feels good to get a 60-70% on an exam, even if that's an A.",
                "If you're interested in the syllabus topics go for it, otherwise don't just take this as any random econ seminar that fills your elective or senior requirement.",
                "Yes, absolutely. The course is challenging and there are frequent exams, but it is probably the best class I've taken at Yale.",
                "Best Econ class here at Yale, hands-down. You'll regret it if you don't take it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in learning more about finance and the markets from a professor with extensive experience. The student definitely has to be willing to put in the work if they, like myself, do not know the most jargon of everyone in the class, but I think that it is very worth it -- Professor Pascutti's courses have been my favorites at Yale.",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes, provided they have an interest in finance and solid background knowledge. Otherwise, the numerous midterms and degree of difficulty of the content may outpace them.",
                "A wonderful intro to investing via different instruments. A must take if someone is interested in hedge funds.",
                "Yes if interested in the content. The disorganization is a hurdle to get over though.",
                "In general, yes; Professor Pascutti is great and really cares about student learning, and our TA Alice was also lovely. The course will teach you a lot of applicable skills about financial markets specifically, so it's a great course for those who are interested in going into trading or other applied finance fields.",
                "Yes, one of the best senior seminars for Econ majors interested in finance.",
                "Yes if interested in hedge funds",
