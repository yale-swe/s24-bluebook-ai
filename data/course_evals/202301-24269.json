                "The strengths of this course included Professor Mendez-Seijas and his enthusiasm and passion for our learning. He was kind, helpful, and invested in our class discussions, in addition to responding to student feedback and input. I don't think there were any weaknesses at all.",
                "The strength of this course lies in Jorge. He is the best language professor I have had at Yale. Coming into the class, I felt a little behind compared to my classmates, some of whom are heritage speakers. However, Jorge was very fair and understanding and always willing to help me improve my writing and oral skills. Despite it being a language course, this course also opened my eyes to many cultural nuances in Latin American countries, specifically with topics like disparity in the education and health system. Overall, there is no weakness (maybe besides the fact it meets three times a week for an L5 class). I recommend you take a class with Jorge if you can.",
                "Strengths: format of the class, the themes talked about were intriguing. \r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The structure of the course is fantastic and very easy to follow. Jorge outlines the expectations for the class very clearly and reiterates them concisely throughout the weeks.",
                "I truly cannot think of any weaknesses of this course. Professor Mendez-Seijas is one of the most talented educators I've ever encountered, and the learning materials and topics of this course were fascinating, engaging, and illuminating. The workload was not overwhelming- there were no exams and no huge stressful projects. Rather, each class was a discussion, and the homework was to prepare for the next discussion (in addition to a short weekly writing assignment and a biweekly speaking assignment). Amazingly organized class.",
                "Strengths: awesome classroom environment, all due to our fun group of classmates and also Jorge being a lively, intelligent, dedicated teacher.",
                "The variety of units in this course offer something for everybody. The 200-word writing assignments were long enough to generate substantive feedback but short enough to be manageable; I almost wish that there had been more. Group discussion in class was significantly more active than in lower levels, with dialogue, disagreement, and discussion filling the air in most meetings. The layout of units and lessons made sense and was interesting. The variety of sources (articles, documentaries, speeches, essays) helped us interact with the language in a variety of ways.\r\n\r\nThe last unit, on constitutional design, could use some refinement. It's tough to write somebody else's constitution, because constitutions should have a special relationship with the history and tradition of the people who live with them. As an outsider, it can be difficult to pay appropriate respect to these dynamics; one way to get a little closer would be to pick a single country instead of trying to do all of Latin America at once. Alternatively (and I think that this is more in line with the spirit of the unit) the project could focus on a declaration of rights, which are usually meant to be more universal.",
                "Most of the topics of this course were incredibly engaging and personally relevant to me as a Latino, which kept me very engaged.  My only gripe is that there was oftentimes too much of a focus on Spain as opposed to Latin America and the U.S."

                "Yes. This class continues the best parts of lower level Spanish classes--especially the variety of topics and assignments--with more flexibility and freedom and less rigid structure and workload. My classmates were generally dedicated and active in class and I feel like I really improved my Spanish communication. Exactly what it promises to be and exactly what I was looking for.",
                "Even if you feel confident in your ability to read, write, and speak in Spanish, I would highly recommend this course as the topics this course covers to help students gain proficiency in the language are in and of themselves incredibly interesting and fun to study/discuss."
