                "This course, being very discussion-heavy, fell victim to a bad room layout. It was tough to join in the conversation when sat at a long rectangular table and not having a chance to talk toor really physically seemany in the classroom. Nonetheless, Henderson did a fantastic job trying to facilitate conversation by having us play games with each other at times or prompting students with different opinions to work through them. This helped engage us and also allowed us to get closer with our peers, which further facilitated conversation. I feel at times that Henderson focused too much on giving context to the readings or quizzing us on them (of which there were many, some droning and unnecessary but others extremely riveting) instead of applying the lessons laid out in the readings to the modern day. I feel this class would also greatly benefit if it was a course that met twice a week for less time instead of a class that met once a week for around two hours."

                "YES! Please take this course if you get the chance and are interested in campaigns, political persuasion, or the heresthetics of government. Though I think the course focused a little too much on history than it needed to, the things I learned in this class about persuasion and politics are things I will carry in my mind throughout my career. Henderson is also a wonderful professor with a sharp mind and experience in the field, making his insights ones that you truly wouldn't have access to outside of this course. I wish he would've given more wisdom to us."
