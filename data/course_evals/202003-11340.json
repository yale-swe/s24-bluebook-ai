                "You'll live or die depending on who your TF is and how much they're willing to help you. Lecture material is interesting but executing is a little dull.",
                "Strengths include interesting material and organized lectures, as well as great section discussions.",
                "lecture is relatively unexciting, some problem sets are easy and some are really difficult, but the content is interesting and it's a good survey of many topics",
                "The slides over zoom worked pretty well, I think that each lecture was well paced so that it wasn't too fast or slow. I missed the ability to ask questions in person.",
                "Strengths: the lectures were engaging and straight forward. Professor Mendelsohn was incredibly passionate about the material and took the time to answer questions from students in class and in office hours. Andie was an incredibly helpful TA who actively monitored the chat during the lecture and led wonderful discussion sections.\r\nWeaknesses: some technical difficulties during the semester",
                "You learn things, but the pacing is slow and the pset questions aren't talked about in class. If you're lucky, you get a TA who teaches the questions in section, but not all of them do. The psets are also sloppily written. The process of doing the psets usually involved asking a TA for clarification, the TA back-solving some stuff from the answer key, and then giving you the clarification. The quantitative questions on tests aren't any better, only there you can't get any clarification. At minimum, checking the psets for errors and ambiguity before sending them out would be much appreciated.",
                "The class is among the easiest I've taken at Yale, but it still follows the standard economics major curve, leading to a severe rushing problem (which you learn about in the class - LOL). Professor Mendelsohn claims that because students, especially at Yale, will spend as much effort as they can competing for the top grades of the class, he does not seem to care as much for students' wellbeing (he blatantly refused to drop the lowest problem set grade that most other classes allow to help lower students' stress if they have one really busy or off week). Thus, the class is ironically even more competitive to get the highest grades.",
                "This course covers quite interesting material, but seems to gloss over the details of many aspects of environmental management. Since classes were only 50 minutes long, it felt like we would talk about 10 concepts per class, with one or two slides dedicated to each concept. Lectures moved at a very slow pace, but it seemed like we moved through the material too rapidly.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, some concepts taught in this class are at odds with established climate science and other economists. For example, we learned that 4 degrees Celsius was the optimal warming target, and that climate change would affect only a small chunk of the economy. Professor Mendelsohn also claims that $5-10 is the optimal price for carbon, although other economists estimate numbers at least 10 times as high. I do realize that part of taking a course with a researcher in this field is understanding the different approaches that they take to problems. However, at times, it seemed that even the TAs seemed skeptical about the material that Professor Mendelsohn was teaching.",
                "The lecture is painfully boring and feels a lot longer than 50 minutes. There was also almost no overlap between what was taught in lecture and what was tested in problem sets. Section is crucial for understanding the math behind the concepts explained in class.",
                "The lectures were not super engaging and I struggled to learn from them.",
                "The syllabus is well-structured. Sometimes it's frustrating that the course is quite American-centric.",
                "Its a well taught course and the slides are useful. My biggest issue was that we received feedback for the first three problem sets very late, which made it hard to improve \/ learn from mistakes before the next one is due.",
                "I believe the course could be improved by going over more technical examples either in class or in discussion section.",
                "I think the problem sets felt quite disconnected from the lectures, I think they could have covered material that was covered more in class.",
                "This class raises very interesting points and makes you contemplate the best course for the economy moving forward.",
                "Strengths: pretty easy to grasp materials. Weaknesses: the entire field of environmental economics needs to be revisited. The material is neocolonialist and racist and erases the history of indigenous peoples.",
                "The professor clearly knows a lot. However, I thought the math on the slides was poorly explained, and the math was mostly left to the TAs to explain during section. I really didn't like the Excel homework we had. Even the TAs got different answers in the answer key, so there was a huge variation in what we turned in. I think there should've been more direction and clarification when it came to the quantitative p-sets. Grading also took FOREVER.",
                "Strengths: Professor Mendelsohn is super knowledgable and engaging; I really enjoyed going to lecture. Sections are very helpful and all of the TFs this year were great. \r\nWeaknesses: Problem sets (esp. towards second half of semester) were not really that based on lecture; you have to go to section to find out how to solve them. Problem sets are also not similar to tests.",
                "The lecturer (Dr. Mendelsohn) is fairly engaging and seems to have a passion for the material. The lectures could have been a bit less monotonous, but overall they were well done. The TAs did not seem to always be on the same page which resulted in some sections being much more useful than others with regards to being able to complete the problem sets. The problem sets and exams were also incredibly poorly written, vague, and ambiguous, which overall made this probably the most poorly taught class Ive had at Yale.",
                "Professor is great, TF Andie was fantastic. I would say the one thing was that problem set questions were not discussed or covered in class and it was often difficult to figure out some questions without the help of the TFs. This was evident on the final exam for the last question, where it seemed as if something we did not fully learn how to interpret and approach",
                "Good",
                "Learn a lot of material. Also the 50 minute time frame helps learning by having a shorter time frame to be focused on with virtual classes.",
                "This course has strong material, but there is a disconnect between the problem sets and the lectures. The problem sets do not really test the most interesting material of the course, or develop one's knowledge of the issues. What could really improve this course is if the problem sets were geared towards learning more about environmental economics and less learning how to solve basic problems.",
                "Loved the course teaching itself but was difficult to engage over zoom in a lecture",
                "Strengths: Mendelsohn is incredibly-informed on the subject matter and provides objective takes on climate change; TA Andie is cool\r\nWeaknesses: literally everything else. the course is disorganized and Mendelsohn feels compelled by the econ department to force TAs to grade harshly. psets were graded inconsistently across different students. i had to reach out to TAs to change 4\/10 pset grades because my friends would get a question correct but mine would be wrong even when we had the same\/very similar answers. The final had several written errors and questions were worded ambiguously so the TAs had to constantly clarify things throughout the exam. This ended up resulting in an average exam grade in the low 70s and the highest grade in the class being a 91 (with 100+ people in the course). The TAs told us that there would be a curve but my friends have already checked their final grades and there was no curve, nor did Mendelsohn express to us if a curve exists and what exactly it is.",
                "Good lectures",
                "Strengths: Very clear connection between different lectures.",
                "It was dry at times but definitely more connections between homework and class",
                "I think the course is very well organized to convey the major topics.  I cannot think of a way to improve the course that can be achieved in only one semester, but I would have liked to spend more time on each unit.",
                "Strengths: Topics are interesting, midterm and final were reasonable\r\nWeaknesses: The psets are almost completely unrelated to what is taught in class. Because of this, your pset performance will almost entirely depend on how good your TA is",
                "The strength of the course is the material itself. The course covers important and interesting material while providing a economics perspective on issues we hear about a lot. The course is at its best during lecture and discussion section when the passion of the professor and TAs comes through. Professor Mendelsohn clearly cares about this class a lot, and same goes for the TAs.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of the course mainly have to do with course administration, specifically in three areas. First, communication was not easy. The lack of a piazza for the course made it difficult to have questions answered, and email oftentimes did not substitute well. I'd imagine that TAs got multiple questions a lot, and they sometimes seemed frustrated when they received a question more than once (which is totally understandable) but could be alleviated with a course-wide piazza. Second, the structuring and wording of assessments was poor. Oftentimes, it was difficult to understand what a question was asking. This problem was exacerbated by the lack of good communication channels and by a lack of dedicated time to go over practice problems. Some discussion sections went over practice problems while others didn't, and we never went over practice problems in lecture. I think it was good to have discussion sections and lecture cover material instead, but maybe a recorded video of a practice problem would be good. Third, grading was inconsistent. I rarely got good\/clear feedback in a timely manner from the class, and I seemed to lose points for things I didn't think warrant a point deduction. We were told at certain points that some TAs carried most of the grading burden on their own, so I hope that's changed in the future so that students can get clearer feedback quicker.",
                "There are a lot of weaknesses to this course. The lectures are extremely slow and repetitive, so I don't feel that I learned a lot of new concepts. The problem sets almost felt like they were a separate course because the lectures did not go over the techniques needed to solve them, and instead these techniques had to be gone over in section. This would probably be a challenge for someone who does not have a strong economics background. Overall, I don't feel that I learned that much, which is a shame because the topic of the course is so interesting and it has a lot of potential.",
                "The strength of this course is the content. It is super interesting and that helped me to be engaged in lecture. There are several weaknesses in this course. Pset-wise, you basically have to have the right TA to perform well on them. Thankfully, the virtual environment allowed me to jump to different discussion sections and I was able to find a TA that guided the section through the pset. Having experienced both methods of approaching a pset (critically thinking vs guided thinking), I still feel like I learned more through the guided thinking method for the psets. The professor needs to standardize this across all sections. Another weakness was the ambiguity on the exams\/psets. They are poorly written and if you don't put the time in to ask clarifying questions, you could totally misinterpret the question. This happened a lot during the final exam and it causes unnecessary stress.",
                "One weakness of this course was that some concepts in the problem sets were never reviewed in class.  It would have been helpful to address the new concepts more, especially with application of the equations we learned.  I only knew how to use these equations because fo practice in section.",
                "Weaknesses: we were taught very little content that helped with PSETs. Without my TA, we would have never been able to figure out how to complete the quantitative PSETs. It felt like everything I learned came from the TAs. It was not a very engaging course.",
                "The course does a good job of moving quickly through several topics, and never leaves students underequipped to do any of the tasks that the psets or tests ask of them."

                "The grading was awful. We went six problem sets without knowing our grade. Some of those problem sets were cumulative so students didn't know if they were doing anything wrong until it was too late.",
                "I appreciated that the lectures were recorded and synchronicity was not required.",

                "The lectures, discussion sections, and office hours were all held virtually.  Given the circumstances, this was necessary and did not significantly interfere with my learning.  I cannot think of any way to improve the virtual engagement practices in this class.",
                "Online discussion section was great. I also really appreciated Professor Mendelsohn making the exams open-note. For other classes, taking closed note exams with cameras pointing at our workspace created a lot of stress and burdens for students already struggling. I'm really glad Professor Mendelsohn recognized our burdens as students and made it more manageable without sacrificing our education.",
                "My TA was super lenient about attending or participating in section which was great. I had other responsibilities such as helping out at my parent's workplace, making lunch and dinner for my younger siblings, and tutoring my cousins and little brother. I only missed one section because of these factors but having that option allowed me to worry a little bit less. I liked that the lectures were recorded. I loved the virtual office hours. It was way more convenient and efficient than attending them in person.",

                "Yes! This is a great course for Economics majors who are also interested in science and climate change.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course as an easier econ credit. Course content is overall pretty interesting and relevant, problem sets are manageable (and almost always done in section) and exams are fair.",
                "I would recommend this course. Professor Mendelsohn really knows what he is talking about, and his lectures are interesting. The workload isn't that bad.",
                "Yes! This material is so important, and Professor Mendelsohn is very passionate about the material and explains it in a clear, manner.",
                "Yes.",
                "No. If you're looking for a gut, there are guts out there that are both more interesting and more likely to actually improve your grade. It's not that the material is hard, but the math questions on tests will penalize you through the entire question if you get one of the earlier sections wrong and nothing else. Also, the relatively easy material means the curve is hard. If you want to learn about managing the environment, be prepared for the question of equity to be mostly glossed over, with gems like \"islands countries are dramatic examples\" when talking about the uneven impacts of climate change. Unless your academic interests lay right at the intersection of economics and the environment and you don't have any other options, there's not a good reason to take this course.",
                "I would recommend this course, both as an economics elective or as interesting course outside your major. It does not require any prerequirements beyond basic calculus and gives great insights into the economics perspective of environmentalism and natural resources.",
                "No, unless they are interested in natural resource economics. Unfortunately, even though my focus is on this subject, this was one of the poorer quality courses that I have taken at Yale. The material is quite interesting overall, but the problem sets are not explained in lectures, and there are few existing resources, such as additional practice problems, to help students study. This was immensely frustrating. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, some concepts taught in this class are at odds with established climate science and other economists. For example, we learned that 4 degrees Celsius was the optimal warming target, and that climate change would affect only a small chunk of the economy. Professor Mendelsohn also claims that $5-10 is the optimal price for carbon, although other economists estimate numbers at least 10 times as high. I do realize that part of taking a course with a researcher in this field is understanding the different approaches that they take to problems. However, at times, it seemed that even the TAs seemed skeptical about the material that Professor Mendelsohn was teaching. Professor Mendelsohn certainly does not align with most climate activists on the urgency of this issue.",
                "Yes. The content isn't difficult but you have to be willing to put yourself through dry lectures.",
                "Yes, I think the concepts are interesting and important.",
                "Yes if you want to learn more about environmental economics",

                "It is an easier econ elective credit, but it's still not as easy as people make it to be. Only take it if you're interested in the topics. I actually thought the content was really interesting and enjoyed hearing from Mendehlson. He's really knowledgeable. Even if you don't agree with his stances on climate change, it's interesting to hear his take on some of the issues we're facing.",
                "Yes, take this class if you are interested in environmental policy and economics. Professor Mendelsohn is really kind and a fantastic lecturer. TFs hold office hours frequently and I actually enjoyed going to section. It's got a low workload and exams are fair as well. One of the better econ electives out there!",

                "Yes! Interesting and insightful without being overwhelming.",
                "Definitely not, because your grade will not reflect what you learned in the class. Mendelsohn feels forced to grade harshly so he assigns weirdly worded psets\/exams to bring down grades. The final had several written errors and questions were worded ambiguously so the TAs had to constantly clarify things throughout the exam. This ended up resulting in an average exam grade in the low 70s and the highest grade in the class being a 91 (with 100+ people in the course). The TAs told us that there would be a curve but my friends have already checked their final grades and there was no curve, nor did Mendelsohn express to us if a curve exists and what exactly it is.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course. Material is interesting to learn and many new developments in the field keep it exciting for those looking to learn more about the economics of environmental management.",
                "Yes if they wanna learn interesting practices",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about different aspects and POVs of climate change and natural resources.  I am an engineering major with little economics experience, but I did not feel out of place in the course.",
                "I can't recommend this course in the current format. My TA was horrible and she would not teach the same topics as the other TAs.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. For all its flaws, the course covers really important topics and reinforces certain very important economic theories (especially about the need for government). Professor Mendelsohn is really passionate and knowledgeable as well.",
                "Absolutely not. This course had minimal intellectual challenge so I don't feel that I learned a lot. Based on the intellectual challenge of the course, anyone who puts in minimal effort will understand every concept and from that stand point everyone should be getting an A grade. However, I'm assuming this is due to the econ curve, what ended up happening is that every assignment and exam was graded extremely strictly and the points that were taken off were due to minuscule and insignificant errors. My TA would literally go over the problem sets in our sections step by step, sometimes with the exact problems, and I would still end up getting points taken off for things like not having units. The frustrating part about this was the arbitrary point system because again the content was extremely easy so based on understanding alone, again everyone should have received really good grades. I'm personally not someone who is super hard on grades, but getting a non A grade in a course that is this easy and based on arbitrary grading rubrics is ridiculous. Based on difficulty this class is absolutely a gut, but because fo grading you could tank your GPA and on a course on this intellectual level it isn't worth it.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course especially for people who have not been exposed to an economic approach to environmental management. Although I don't fully agree with all of the assertions made pertaining to the scientific aspects of the class, I learned a lot about how environmentalists and economists need to work together to manage resources so that it'll lead to the best outcome for planet and people.",
                "Yes, especially if this is an area of interest for them.",
                "No - if you're an EVST major. It was incredibly frustrating at times to be taking this course which was one of the designated core social science requirement options. It felt like Mendelsohn was ridiculing stricter environmental protections and regulations, claiming that we should strive for a 4 degree world instead of trying to limit emissions below 2, touting adaptation and geoengineering solutions saying that mitigation was just too expensive, that recycling was essentially pointless, that natural gas is good for the environment full stop without considering methane leakage, earthquakes, etc. The parts about water management and other natural resources could be interesting but having to learn and take notes on his climate theories and ideas was really hard.",
