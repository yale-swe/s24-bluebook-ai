This course really forces you (in a great way) to reevaluate your preconceived notions about how we have been socialized to fear (or judge, accept embrace) certain drugs and why this has been the case as it is so often not about the drug itself. It completely changed many of my views and has made me a more thoughtful person overall.",

                "No weaknesses. Prof. Ramos curated a beautiful syllabus that highlights BIPOC experiences (so rare) in such a respectful way. All of the readings are more than doable and so interesting that you don't realize you are doing homework.",
                "This course was very engaging. The class was a very safe and open space for the exchange of ideas and questions. The reading list was perfectly curated for class discussion.",
                "You learn things in a format that makes every thing interesting and humanizes it. you're not just learning information but also how it effects real people.",
                "I have no weaknesses to share, this class was hands down one of the best classes I've taken at Yale! Strengths include: incredibly engaging class material, students, TF, prof, and readings; assignments were meaningful and organized to maximize our learning, excitement about our own topics, and feedback from both peers and the teaching team; incredibly caring and safe space for invaluable discussion.",
                "The seminar is so open and non judgemental, was a fantastic space for learning",
                "Strengths: Everything about the course! I loved how Professor Ramos provided a larger context in the beginning of our seminar and allowed us to use both our readings and additional knowledge to meaningfully contribute.  Everyone was actively engaged and opened to one another! Both Professor Ramos and Sydney were great at providing us with additional context and were very available to answer any of our questions. \r\nWeaknesses: Nothing",
                "This was an amazing course. The only thing I would want more of is more scientific descriptions or readings about the medical side of things.",
                "I really enjoyed the discussion seminar format and Professor Ramos and Sydney were definitely strengths of the course. I would say a potential weakness would be the readings - I know the reading load for a seminar class is usually high, but there were often times when I wished we could go deeper into the readings or times where we'd be assigned a reading that was barely covered in class.",
                "Strengths: This is the best HSHM seminar I have taken and one of the best classes at Yale in my opinion. Prof. Ramos is an incredible instructor and created a super warm, engaging learning environment, facilitated as well by Sydney and the other students. The readings were fascinating and Prof. clearly spent lots of time designing the class, bringing in other forms of media like videos, art, and podcasts. I feel very lucky to have taken the class with such a dedicated professor despite him also being busy with his clinical work.\r\nWeaknesses: None come to mind, perhaps there could have been more opportunities for drafting and getting feedback on the final paper. Another guest speaker (perhaps an addiction specialist or historian of drugs) could have been a super interesting addition but again, the class was great on its own. I would just encourage future students to really show up with an open mind and share your thoughts without fear of judgement, because Prof. Ramos just wants you to learn and grow.",
                "Wonderful and genuinely caring professor and teaching assistant - very understanding of the difficulties during the pandemic\r\nVery open and vulnerable class - great discussions\r\nUnpacked readings together, everyone was really engaged\r\nWalked us through writing processes, helped us develop skills",

This class was very engaging and informative, and the readings were always interesting. I walked away from each class feeling like I had learned something new. If you are a premedical student or are in anyway interested in psychiatry, take this class. The final paper could be a bit challenging, but it is worth the work.",

Prof Ramos is absolutely amazing and makes the class so welcoming and engaging.",

                "Yes! Really interesting and complex readings - helped me develop my writing skills, and I was able to write about what I was interested in. The professor and teaching assistant created such a welcoming and engaging environment.",
