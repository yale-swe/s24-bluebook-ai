I have already been able to put these techniques to practical use.

I also learned about commentary traditions in South Asia. I also learned to take seriously the transformative power of South Asian meditative practices.",

                "The professor is very kind and engaging and makes the environment safe to ask any questions and truly learn.",
                "Strengths: Extremely interesting conversations, well structured progression of readings, reasonable length of weekly readings, very responsive professor who provides well-thought out feedback, thought-provoking and creative written assignments\r\nWeaknesses: wish there was more opportunity for people to share what they wrote in their weekly journals/have dialogue about them",
                "Strength: Structure. The course seems to veer of on seemingly unrelated tangents at times. But it was all masterfully tied together by the end of the course which created a holistic approach to gita study.",
                "the discussions we had in class are interesting",
                "The biggest strength of the course is the strong emphasis on close-reading small chunks of a difficult text---the Gita can be speed-run in 90 minutes but each chapter takes hours of reflection to digest. Secondary literature (by which I mean contemporary scholarship) plays a minor role throughout the majority of the semester, which is wonderful because you receive the closest thing possible to an unmediated experience with the text. The use of weekly reflections rather than short papers is also particularly helpful for stimulating habits of close reading, as are the commentarial assignments (no wasted time on research papers or anything like that).",
                "The seminar format was a strength of the course. I appreciated the lecture-style it took at times since it was a brand new topic for me.",
                "Strengths: Great discussions, amazing instructor, learned a lot from classmates and professor and challenged many of my prior views\r\nWeaknesses: Very little feedback given throughout the semester, mostly due to the very flexible timeline of assignments"

Professor Kachru is very intelligent and knowledgeable about this course, but humble enough to show that he is willing to learn from his own students as well. He asks thought-provoking questions, cracks jokes often, and is very light-hearted. He strives to make the classroom exciting and is always open to changing up the flow with student requests. I learned a lot not just about the Gita, but also about myself through this course. It was always refreshing to come to class.",
                "Yes. But read up on the Mahabharata beforehand so you aren't confused intially",
                "Yes. You learn alot about yourself throughout the course.",
                "Yes. This course has the potential to change your life as it did mine, so long as you take seriously the idea that the Gita contains wisdom worth unpacking. I also cannot imagine a better introduction to the humanities, especially for a STEM student who will not be taking many classes. The work is low-intensity (as far as technical expertise is concerned) but remains deeply and immediately rewarding.",
                "I am not sure. In a class titled \"Bhagavad Gita\" you might expect the entire Bhagavad Gita (<200 pages) to be read. It was not. You might expect the majority classroom discussion to center around close analysis of specific passages and supplemented by contextual explanations of the story, the characters, and the setup. It was not. \r\n\r\nMuch in the way you cannot teach \"Applied Math\" to students who have no understanding about \"Basic Math\" (order of operations, algebra, calculus), this course tries to teach \"Applied Gita\" to students who have not yet developed an understanding of the \"Basic Gita\" itself. The majority of readings applied the Gita in other contexts of Thoreau, Oppenheimer, Gandhi, and ancient commentaries. I am sure this was a well-intentioned exercise, but it is not appropriate for an introductory course full of \"Gita beginners.\" The fundamentals and basics cannot be glossed over. A student can only perform these exercises successfully if they have a requisite level of comprehension about the Gita. Similarly, the majority of classroom discussion was on \"meta questions\" about the nature of life/death/conflict. I am sure the Gita is a useful resource for such questions, but again, it is not appropriate for an introductory course full of \"Gita beginners.\" A student can only do this successfully if they have a requisite level of comprehension about the Gita. Otherwise, it can feel like a loop of questions with no continuity/relevance to the text.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the other students to do not feel this way -- if so, I guess I'm the odd one out.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to other students.",
