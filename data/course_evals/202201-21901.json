                "I learned about how energy works on a local, university, and national scale. We discussed various forms of green energy and how they can\/can't be applicable to different settings. The feasibility of \"going green\" was a major focus, in regards to policy, culture, and personal beliefs.",
                "I learned about general viable\/nonviable options for energy usage inn the future, and what are key features to look at and evaluate. I improved some in being able to work independently as well.",
                "I developed a general understanding of energy systems in the USA",

                "I learned how to google and research to find things on the internet for the PSTs",
                "This course was a thorough and valuable survey of modern energy issues. I especially appreciated the focus on the mathematical\/quantitative side of energy; this was the first QR course I have taken at Yale, and found it useful and challenging, yet doable for someone with little math background.",
                "This course gave me a broad introduction to current technologies and concepts in energy and environmental technology. I also got a basic introduction to the necessary physics.",
                "I learned not only about U.S. and some country's energy use but also specific examples with Yale itself! The content was not difficult to understand, although the lectures could be a bit dry. Some topics we covered: solar, wind, and hydro energy, some experiments with clean energy as a way to combat the issues with fossil fuels. The guest lectures at the end are super cool and a great way to connect with the industry!",
                "I learned alot about Yale and Connecticut's energy sources.",
                "This course taught me an introduction to understanding energy, environment, as well as public policy. Many of the physics was a review from the basic physics I had learned in high school, but the course encouraged me to apply it in the context of energy. The guest lectures were also great, but I would say that they were cool and interesting more than informative."

                "You get out of this course what you give into it. There are few assignments but many lectures that are quite informative but if you choose to not pay attention you will only get a small amount of the full benefits of the information within this course. I recommend this course to anyone looking to learn more about energy in any facet or amount, as you are introduced to a wide spread of useful information and can dive into your area of greatest interest for the final project.",
                "A strength is the workload. The final project is very well paced and spread out to make the work manageable. Dr. Prober rarely asks for big projects\/homework without manageable time or giving extensions and help as needed. I didn't think I got as comprehensive a view of energy and public policy as I'd hope. I think a little more organization and structure would have been helpful. It was good science class for non-science people, making material manageable and not overwhelming, but I could've learned more.",
                "Homework should not be assigned to be do day of on Sunday night. Even if it is a short assignment like assigning questions for a guest speaker, it is stress inducing to receive an update about homework being due the very same day.",
                "Strengths\r\nNice professor \r\nInteresting content \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\nNeeds more organized lectures with main points and key takeaways emphasized\r\nNeeds more organized problem sets. The TFs struggled to work through them with us in office hours",
                "I would not recommend this course to others. The lectures were dry and the psets were incredibly difficult as they were not related to the lecture material.",
                "Strength  diverse lecture topics and visiting lecturers\r\nWeakness - repetitive content and difficult to study for exam (no guides\/outlines\/key subjects)",
                "The content itself is very interesting and there are great guest speakers, but at times the lectures can be dry.",
                "The psets were challenging as they were very math heavy while the lectures were policy heavy so it was often hard to complete the psets. I really enjoyed the wide range of guest lecturers too.",
                "I liked how the class was structured- 3 PSTS, 1 final exam, lecture style. I think that made the work very feasible and I was never overwhelmed by anything. I think the weakness was simply that I didn't know how to do the PSTs because the questions seemed obscure\/random at times so I had to resort to googling answers. The TA didn't help much in the help sessions.",
                "Strengths: Covers a wide array of material, good foundation for energy\/environmental studies, helpful TAs\r\nWeaknesses: Disorganized, Psets often don't reflect what is taught in class, covers a lot in a short period of time but slows down as the semester progresses",
                "I think that this course is structured really well-- I like that the problem sets are assigned in the first part of the semester and that we are given time to work on our presentations later in the semester. I also think it covers the issues thoroughly. However, I also think that there is a lot of repetition from lecture to lecture, which I think could be improved.",
                "The course is structured in a very lecture-like format, making it hard to feel very engaged with the course as someone who learns best in seminar-style environments. Also, much of the homework feels very disconnected from the course material, being heavily quantitative while the course itself is not. I also wish we had discussed policy more. Strengths-wise, I got a very broad and expansive introduction to the field, as someone with very little experience, making it feel approachable and less intimidating. Professor Prober is also very kind and understanding, making the class an overall positive experience.",
                "I believe a strength is that the course offers entry-level material that is easy to understand and learn. With that, it's understandable that the lectures could be a bit slow at times and not as fascinating as a more complex class. If you already are interested in clean energy chances are you already know a lot of the things talked about in the class (although it's always good to review), but if you don't know much this is a great place to get started! Another strength was the guest lectures Professor Prober brought in at the end. Also, the workload is not high and very manageable, especially with the help of the TAs. The final group project is not stressful (as long as you pace yourself and find a group you work well with). Midterm was also fairly based on lectures and slides, no trick questions.",
                "Strength is that Professor Prober definitely cares about his students, is generous with his time, and clearly very passionate about the topics. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  So much of this course was taught on Zoom because of guest speakers, and I don't think the disengagement with virtual lectures was worth it. Would've much rather had 1 Zoom guest speaker max. Additionally, despite not processing some of the content, the course felt repetitive because while information was given multiple times theoretically for retention, it was often presented in exactly the same way, so if you didn't get it the first time you wouldn't the next few times or when asking a question about it. I would've appreciated more variety for different learning styles. Lastly, and most importantly for me, there was no connection to systems of oppression, which is deeply related to all of the course content. There was no mention of the displacement of and\/or violent harm towards BIPOC communities when discussing pipelines, thinking about global conflicts over oil, and so much more. It is imperative that we ingrain these acknowledgements (at the very least!) in all courses, ESPECIALLY stem courses with legacies of scientific racism and false claims of objectivity\/neutrality.",
                "I think the organization of the course suffered. It was usually unclear where we should be in the textbook to study for our p-sets. Also the content of our assignments rarely reflect the content of lectures.",
                "Strengths - As promised, this course was not a significant amount of work on average. There were psets in the first half, but the second half was essentially just attending class and working on the final project.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I think this class would benefit heavily from greater class participation. It felt exceedingly high school like when no one ever asked any questions or participated Professor Prober simply presented the material and that was that. Even if participation was incentivized by being a certain percentage of the final grade, that felt like a major flaw of the class."

A lot of information and several  different, sometimes unrelated, topics were thrown at us in one class period. The psets were confusing for students and even TFs.",

                "I think that this is a pretty easy QR\/science class that is also useful for anyone interested in energy or energy policy. I left the course with a much-improved understanding of the electrical grid, different fuel sources, and problems facing energy today. It's not the world's most riveting or exciting class, but I generally enjoyed it.",

                "If you're interested in learning more about clean energy and you don't already know a lot, absolutely! Otherwise it may be a bit boring\/repetitive. But, I went into the class already having an interest and I found it was a great class to add to my schedule that wasn't frustratingly difficult and I still liked the material. Professor Prober is very understanding and the TAs are great. Great CR\/SC credit for non-stem majors!",
                "I would not. The material was not well organized and the forms of presentation weren't engaging.",
                "I think that you get exactly what you put into this class I personally didn't love it and would probably not have taken it again had I had the foresight, but I also know that this material can be incredibly interesting to some people. Those people definitely got more from the class than me. Classes can sometimes feel the slightest bit monotonous, and the midterm was randomly difficult, but overall it was a solid gut."
