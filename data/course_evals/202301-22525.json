I learned how to pitch in journalism, craft an angle, spot gold coins, structure effectively, and improve draft after draft.",

If you are interested in journalism or health profession or some combination of both, she is the professor you want to talk to.",
                "Strengths: Outstanding & accessible professor who makes class engaging and rewarding. Fun student workshops, eye-opening lab visits, and informative speaker events. Prompt, clear feedback on all writing and fair grading.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: High workload. Lengthy readings that I sometimes didn't find relevant/helpful.",
                "This class has a fantastic curriculum. I mean the readings, the speakers, the discussion, the workshoppingwe even had out of class trips and experiences. Professor Epstein puts her all into teaching and it shows.",

I almost felt like I was getting to indulge myself by writing about what I actually cared about, not about some random piece of literature about dead English people that I could not care less about. Writing came easy because I wanted to know more, even outside of the class. This course is so enriching for you and ACTUALLY makes you learn how to write. Premeds, take note!",
                "Strongly recommend to anyone interested in/looking to improve their science/medical writing. Prof. Epstein is a fantastic teacher who makes the class fun, engaging, and rewarding despite its high workload. You'll get to participate in a variety of fun events (i.e. talks from authors/journalists, visiting a pathology lab, visiting art museums, etc.) and will improve your ability to write nonfiction prose considerably.",
                "Absolutely. Im so grateful to know Professor Epstein, especially as someone hoping to go into journalism. Everyone was pretty daunted by the prospect of the final project, but she whipped us into shape by the end in a way that prepared us well to tackle big topics. You will really feel your growth. If you have any interest in medicine or writing, you have to take this class because you will grow not only as a writer, but as a connoisseur of medical/scientific knowledge. There is so much beauty in learning how to write (and read!) well.",
                "Yes, regardless of your interests this course will enhance your ability to write about topics clearly and powerfully.",
                "YESS. This was by far the best course I have ever taken and the professor is absolutely amazing.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to any student looking to learn about scientific and medical writing. We attempted an interesting diversity of essays, including a news story, a patient profile, a book review, a small screenplay, an opinion piece, and a long journalism piece. Each of them required me to understand different aspects of scientific communication, and I left the class as a much more well-rounded writer.",
