I was given time to flexibly research a topic I am passionate about in a facilitative environment with other passionate individuals. One weakness is the 5000 word product, which does not accurately reflect the type of writing that we have to do in a research setting. It encourages us to produce less concise products, which can set harmful habits in future research settings."
