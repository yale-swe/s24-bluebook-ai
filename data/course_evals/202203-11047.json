The biochemistry and biophysics concepts covered in this class are taught very well and are very useful in other biology/chemistry/physics courses.

I feel that the class was taught very well, which helped me truly learn the intuition behind many of thee formulas we utilized in the course rather than just memorizing a formula or how to do a problem. Going through the derivations and the use of analogies to put what we were learning into context was very nice and that is what personally helped me grasp the information the most. I learned that there is so much behind biophysics like physics or statistical thermodynamics, which made me even more interested to take those classes.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Enrique is an engaging lecture, Miranker has a kind heart, first half of course is relatively well taught\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Light/optics and second half of the course is highly disorganized and confusing; mathematica feels irrelevant to concepts covered in class - at times the links between what we are coding and learning in lecture is not made clear enough, or I'm missing the big picture or linking details",
                "Strengths: professors did a good job making class interactive, kept students engaged, made an effort to get to know the students. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: we spent sooooo much time going over each topic in lecture that it almost lulled you into a false sense of security where you don't really feel like you have to pay attention (because the class is so slow) but there is actually new information being covered. Poorly paced class (psets could be a breeze or could take forever, depending on the week) \r\n\r\nThis is a rare instance where a course could benefit from actually having more content. I think it kneecapped because its 200-level, and oftentimes got the sense (or knew) that course content was being (needlessly?) dumbed down.",
                "I think that the strengths of this course is the first half of the semester which focuses mostly on understanding molecules and developing a sense of molecular empathy. The material is taught very well and the content seems to be very cohesive. I think that also the pests and having to write code in Mathematica is a strength of this course. Though, I think that the course would be better if python were used. I think that the weaknesses of this course are more towards the second half of the semester with the spectroscopic techniques section. The material does not feel very contained and the concepts seem much less accessible. I think that by possibly limiting this material and focusing in on the concepts that this portion of the semester can go better.",
                "The biggest strength was Prof. De La Cruz. His lectures were perfectly paced, and interesting. I learned the real world applications of those techniques as well. There were many weaknesses, unfortunately. The lectures after october break were disorganized, uninformative, and diluted my interest in the subject so much that i switched majors. In addition, without previous coding experience, the coding PSETS were quite difficult.",
                "Weaknesses: Very unclear on grading and grade boundaries which is stressful.\r\nStrengths: Nice teaching team.",
                "STRENGTHS: This course was taught very well and made some concepts that previously seemed very complex and intimidating much easier to understand. Prof. De La Cruz and Prof. Miranker did a very good job of teaching us these difficult concepts. The lectures were interesting and engaging, sections strongly reinforced our learning, and the professors are great and approachable. WEAKNESSES: The Mathematica problems on the PSETs were difficult and required us to know lots of functions and techniques not taught in class. The second half of the class was not taught as well as Prof. De La Cruz's half at the beginning of the semester and made the second midterm quite difficult. It was not made very clear what we were expected to know. The grading of the in-person portion of the second midterm was very strict. It wasn't enough to answer the questions; very specific explanations were required to get points for each question.",
                "The second half of the course was a lot less structured. I did not understand the goal of what was being taught and how it related to the overall scope of the course.",
                "The lectures and problem sets were very engaging and I learned a lot from them. \r\n\r\nI did not really understand the point of the Mathematica portion. I would rather we have used a coding language that is more widely used like R or python, and I don't think the instruction we received in class was sufficient for the difficulty of the problem sets. In addition, the lecture slides for the last part of the class (light/matter) wasn't in enough detail to succeed on exams and problem sets.",
                "Strengths were definitely all of the content we were able to cover. I felt like i definitely learned so much, but sometimes applying it was more difficult. Particularly, the use of Mathematica was difficult for me to grasp. It was very difficult for me to develop any intuition with using that programming language/platform for some reason. even though it was difficult, I am glad we did the Mathematica problems because it demonstrated a way for us to use statistics for biophysics.",
                "Strengths: fascinating subject matter; enthusiastic professors/engaging lectures; engaging code-based problem sets\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: incredibly disorganized, chaotic class; lots of errors on assignments/unclear instructions/last-minute changes caused considerable stress; lectures seem to jump around between concepts at random, with no real unifying thread; most concepts are inadequately explained with poor analogies that leave you even more confused",
                "Strength was emphasis on developing an intuition for complex kinetics and experimental approaches to biochem/biophysics. It could be improved by more clear explanations of for which scenarios certain ideas/theories are applicable and where they don't hold up because oftentimes it was confusing to learn an explanation of a biophysics phenomena and then be told later that it doesn't apply in certain contexts or that it was straight-up false. For the Mathematica lectures, it was helpful to code along with Prof. Miranker in class and the comments on the mathematica pset solution was very helpful.",
                "This course started off great in having organized, cohesive lectures that were generally interesting and engaging. Then fall break happened and lectures became incoherent and gradually disconnected from one another. Instructors were not accessible at all to get feedback and TAs and ULAs became the primary source of guidance in making sense of whatever information was thrown at us during lecture. The expected level of rigor and detail from the final did not come even close to matching the level at which material was taught in lecture, PSets, or section so student grades suffered and many of my peers were rightfully overwhelmed and panicked by this course by the end of the semester.",
                "The strengths are the incorporation of the coding aspects to the course, which offers a very interesting take on biochemistry, as well as the focus on new biophysical material. The weakness is the instruction at times, particularly in the second half of the course.",
                "Strengths: All professors were great, TAs very helpful and held review sessions\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture slides were posted in a disorganized way, would have been helpful to number them Lecturer 1, 2, 3, ... and place them in a single folder on Canvas",
                "Strengths are definitely the professors and TAs. The two professors (at least in my year) are the MB&B DUS (Prof. Miranker) and the department chair (Prof. De La Cruz), respectively. If you are an MB&B major, through this class, they will be accessible to you and it will be a good opportunity to get to know them. A weakness of this course is the fact that it is so new, so the structure/content/problem sets of this class have not yet been well calibrated. I took this course on its 2nd iteration of teaching, and I still felt like we were figuring it out as we went. This can cause some chaos and uncertainty in the course.",
                "Strengths: good breadth of topics to introduce students to biophysics and the MB&B major, solid lectures (especially Professor De La Cruz's), an emphasis on understanding concepts rather than just memorizing facts, mostly fair exams, helpful discussion sections\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: pset problems were sometimes convoluted, the lectures introducing Mathematica could use a little more structure/organization to better equip students for the psets, not many example problems in class",
                "strengths:\r\n- The TAs (Zion in my experience) has a very strong aid in this course.\r\n- courses touch on a wide range of topics\r\n- interesting course\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n- class felt disconnected between professors\r\n- at times class notes were vague\r\n- little material outside of given notes to review",
                "Dr. De La Cruz was a phenomenal lecturer.\r\nMathematica was not taught well in the class, and it was the most difficult aspect of the class.",
                "Strengths: The profs and TFs of this course are extremely engaging and passionate in teaching and guiding students! Collaboration is also highly encouraged in this course.\r\nWeaknesses: Mathematica wasn't taught very well in lecture. I felt that much of the code was only taught depending on your section and ULA office hours.",
                "Strengths: No final exam, just two midterms which fairly tested the material of the content. Reasonable workload, availability of peer tutors and TFs, variety of concepts covered within the field. Material was regularly reinforced. Good introduction to interesting concepts.\r\nWeaknesses: Problem set questions were sometimes convoluted."

                "I would recommend this course to another student - especially if they are thinking about majoring in MB&B. The material that is taught seems to be very useful in more upper level biology classes and seems very important for research. Also, by teaching some basic computational skills the course allows prospective biology majors to not be afraid of computers and view them as a tool to advance their research.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in biochemistry or biophysics. I think it is a super useful course to learn the basics of biophysical and biochemical ideas and theories and I am sure that the things I learned will be helpful throughout the rest of my time at Yale.",
                "I would tentatively recommend it: The new professor was awesome and will be taking over the bits of the course that required the most improvement in future years. Furthermore, it is a required course of MB&B majors. Plus, the material is very interesting, so as long as you are willing to learn a lot on your own, you will have a good experience. If you prefer organized courses, though, I can't say i recommend this.",
                "Yes. But while the course is not that difficult it is also (probably) harder to do well than I initially thought.",
                "Definitely! The concepts we learned in this class are very helpful for other biology/chemistry/physics courses. I took MB&B300 Biochemistry and MCDB330 Modeling Biological Systems at the same time as this course and found very useful applications of things we learned in this class that helped me learn the other two classes better. Additionally, Prof. De La Cruz does a great job teaching concepts that would otherwise have been very difficult less intimidating and easy to learn.",
                "Yes, great introduction to biophysics for anyone interested in the field. The professors and TA's are nice and the workload is fair.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they are majoring in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry or are particularly interested in learning about biophysical math and lab techniques. For people who already have an interest or practice with these topics, the class was very interesting because it met the desire to learn about these things by covering so many topics and techniques. If someone is not interested in biophysics, they would likely find the course difficult and boring because it mainly discusses biophysical techniques and the math behind certain things, and without the interest already that would probably feel overwhelming rather than exciting as I feel it should be if someone were to take this course. The professors do a good job of making the class fairly conversational and collaborative, so if everyone in the class is not interested in the topic, it gets difficult to really talk about the more refined details the course can cover.",
                "No; not worth it if you don't require it for the MB&B major",
                "No. I understand that this course is unfortunately a requirement for MB&B majors, but the way it is structured currently seriously needs some reevaluation. Instructors are not accessible by any easy means. TAs and ULAs were the only guidance I feel like were sufficient. This class is advertised as baby PChem and to be very chill by lecturers, but is far from it. Additionally, the coding required from this class would have not been possible without some coding experience, so instructors should either adjust the coding assignments to be more accessible for novel coders, or set a coding requirement for this class.",
                "I would recommend this student to those who can use it to fulfill one of the semesters of biophysics required for the MB&B major. Otherwise, the content is interesting, but not all that essential.",
                "If you want a primer before more advanced courses or are interested in biophysics, it is a fantastic course.",
                "Yes, if required for MB&B or for pre-med/bio students interested in grounding their knowledge of biomedicine in physical and chemical context",
                "If you are an MB&B major, you probably have to take this class, unless you are willing to take pchem (which you can still take after taking this course). It's a decent class that isn't depressingly hard that will count towards the major.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I think this course provides a good foundation for the MB&B major. The professors were great, and the class environment is very much supportive and collaborative rather than competitive. The material is relatively digestible even with just knowledge from AP Bio and/or the intro bio sequence (BIOL 101-104), so this course should be fine to take before biochem or other upper-level science classes.",
                "if the course was a bit more organized then yes.",
                "The first half of the class was very enjoyable. I loved to sit in lecture, listen to Dr. De La Cruz talk, and appreciate the art of learning for fun. I did not enjoy the heavy emphasis on Mathematica as the semester progressed and was discouraged at the end.",
                "Yes! Definitely try this course if you are interested in learning about biophysics. Everyone is very supportive, and the content is broad but manageable.",
                "This course was helpful and well-organized but don't take it just to avoid P-chem. There is still MBB major requirement for 300+ elective in math/cs/physical sciences that must be taken in conjugation with MBB275. So you have to take 2 courses in lieu of two semesters of P-chem. it does benefit understanding of the major as a whole."
