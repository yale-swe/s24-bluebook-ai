In the process of completing each assignment, I learned how to capture important information in the literature, how to extract information, and how to complete a complete small paper. In the final assignment, I learned how to work as a team and completed a complete paper with your help. I grew up rapidly in this course and learned a lot of knowledge, so I want to study environmental science more."

Complete and substantial PPT can help us review and preview very well. The interactivity of the teacher in class is also very high, and everyone can put forward and solve the problems in time. The tas will also help us with some information."

With the teacher's clear narration, this course deepened my understanding and love for environmental science. In addition, I feel very fulfilled in each course and can learn a lot of useful knowledge, which will bring good guidance for our future major choice."
