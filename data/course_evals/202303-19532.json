                "I learned basically everything there is to know about Ovid, at least what can be learned in an undergraduate course. I gained better translation skills and poetic analysis in classical Latin. I learned about Latin poetry in the early empire, even beyond Ovid, but of course focusing on Ovid within the greater literary and historical context. I learned how to translate more lines for each class than I ever had done before.",
                "Accurate translation and close reading of Ovid's texts, including grammar, syntax, versification, scansion, and more literary devices. Contextualization of Ovid's texts within greater Roman history.",
                "We got a good overview of the corpus of work Ovid produced over his lifetime and the context he was working in. The course also helped me develop my close reading skills and helped me understand more nuances of grammar and vocabulary."

                "Kirk is incredible, nothing bad to say about the course. We maybe couldve spent more time analyzing works as a whole, but I really have no complaints.",
                "This was a very strong course, with few weaknesses. The readings and Professor Freudenburg's insights on them were great, and our class discussions were very interesting.",
                "This course really engaged me, especially in the class sections. The discourse with Professor Freudenburg was unbeatable, and I learned a lot from him and my peers. The pace of this course was challenging, but it made me adapt in ways that improved my Latin skillset. I think this course could use some more discussion time, with less focus on pure translation in class, which took up a lot of time. I felt that class time was best used discussing the themes of the works we were reading, directly consulting the text we translated for homework.",
                "Strengths: Prof Freudenburg was great, very willing to meet with students and excited about Ovid. He listens to students' thoughts and opinions. The quizzes were fair and a good way of doing assessments for the course. I liked the openness of the final project, though there could have maybe been some more formal guidelines for it. Weaknesses: Maybe more written guidelines for the final paper, and perhaps less in class translation. For me personally, it didn't feel necessary to go over everything we read in class and maybe we could have spent more time discussing the text."

                "Id recommend any Latin course with Professor Freudenburg. Ovid was a lot of fun!",
                "Yes. Ovid's work is fascinating. Professor Freudenburg is sharp, insightful, and fun, and I recommend all Classics majors or students interested in Latin poetry take seminars with him. The course is structured similarly to most other L5 Latin seminars, with students closely reading chunks of text in class.",
                "I would recommend this course. The pace was kind of crazy -- up to 120 lines per class by the end -- especially for my first semester, but it's doable, even with another difficult class. The content is great, and Professor Freudenburg facilitates great classroom discussion. You do need to enter with significant knowledge and skills, but of course that much is expected with a 400-level seminar.",
                "Yes. Ovid is an incredible author and Prof. Freudenburg is an incredible professor.",
                "Yes--it's a solid Latin class and a great overview of Ovid that can also prove helpful as you read other Classical authors. To non-majors who have a strong Latin background and an interest in Classical literature, I assume the class would also be worthwhile."
