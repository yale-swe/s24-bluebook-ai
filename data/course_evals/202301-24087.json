It provided an overview of the artistic knowledge needed to succeed in analyzing great works of art and also allowed us to explore the connections among them.",
                "I developed a deep understanding of Caravaggio and his works, as well as an introduction to the cultural and artistic scene of his time. I also expanded my skills of visual analysis and interpretation."

                "Not very well structured",
                "Fantastic course. So much better for not having section. Meant we could really take a deep dive into Caravaggio for each of the 75 min lectures. Professor Suthor is a wonderful lecturer, able to combine close looking with contextual arguments.",
                "Strengths: some theory was interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the content was boring and not interesting",
                "Strengths-- great\/passionate professor, very organized curriculum, terms for success are very clearly outlined\r\nWeaknesses-- I would have rathered a 50 minute class + section, as there was not much room for discussion+engagement",
                "Strengths: Lectures were super engaging, and I love how Professor Suthor doesn't give us the \"answer\" right away but makes us think about it on our own first. Theo was also an amazing TF. He was always eager to help us improve our writing and provided excellent feedback.",
                "Course was very well organized, all material very accessible, professor was kind and responsive, only improvement would be to go see any of the works in person\/ art gallery trip.",
                "This class was wonderful! I would've like to take a trip outside of the class room but definitely not necessary.",
                "Professor Suthor and Tho were amazing instructors. Professor Suthor made consistent effort to know students' names, and Tho held open office hours.",
                "It was very beginner friendly and Prof Suthor and TA Tho were very open to questions.",

I really liked the way the class was structured  we spent the lecture period closely looking at one or two of Caravaggio's works in great detail, so we spent a lot of time examining each work and digesting the material. It's a great class for both humanities and STEM people, and I think it teaches a lot of important skills about observing and noticing the little things.",
                "Absolutely. You will learn lots about one artist -- and he's such a great artist, as you will learn over the course, that 13 weeks doesn't feel like too much on him. But you will also learn about other artists in the period and before to whom he's responding, and above all how to look at works of art in depth.",
                "Not really I didn't think it was interesting",
                "Yes! This was by far my favorite art history course at yale. Caravaggio is so interesting + the professor's enthusiasm makes the class worth taking. The readings are realistic and comprehensive, and the assignments are well spaces out",
                "Yes! Not a lot of art history classes at Yale focus on just one artist. This is a great opportunity to dive into one artist and his oeuvre with an amazing professor.",
                "Yes, this class really was very informative, especially for someone with no art history background and it was genuinely very interesting.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. For anyone interested in learning about one of the most pivotal painters in the western canon, this class is for you. Professor Suthor is a very passionate and knowledgeable lecturer as well. However, you will inevitably learn some things about the bible as context for the paintings.",
                "Yes; it was enriching, and the instruction was amazing.",
                "Yes, it is a great course to students who are new to History of Art and want to get a head start. I learned how to write visual analysis papers which will be useful for my future art classes.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to all students! It was absolutely fascinating and suitable for majors and nonmajors alike!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It was accessible to both people with a background in art history, and to people completely new to the subject. Both the professor and the teaching fellow did an amazing job running the class and supporting the students. Lectures were engaging and well organized. The workload was very manageable and relevant to the course."
