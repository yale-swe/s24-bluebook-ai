                "Improved French reading, writing, and oral skills through assignments and class participation. Also learned to discuss complex literary analysis / history topics in French.",
                "The greatest insight into theatrical analysis I gained was covered in the second class of the semester when we covered Peter Brook's The Empty Space and his corresponding theories. Though the course lent itself to some comparative analysis and historical contextualization, much of it devolved into an investigation of Moliere's works that is not applicable to other areas of study.",
                "I feel as though I've learned almost all there is to learn about Molire: why each of the plays we read was written, what Molire's slapstick theatrical style is and why it worked/works, why his plays are relevant today, how they are performed today, what works in an adaptation and why, how dance and music and song made its way into straight plays, a little about Molire's life, the tension between theater and the religious establishment, a little about 17th Century French royal politics and international relations... I could go on. I left each and every class having learned something, and for the better."

            "comments": [
                "The reading responses due at 8 PM were kind of hard to manage sometimes. Maybe moving the due date time a bit later would help?",
                "Strengths: such rich discussions, everyone could always participate and feel like they were being listened to.\r\nAreas of improvement: more partner discussions so that quieter students can gather their thoughts before having to share.",
                "Strengths: This course was excellent! I really enjoyed the plays that we read, and I walked away from this course feeling like a Molire expert. I loved that we considered the question of how to adapt old plays in the modern age (now whenever I watch movies based on old books or plays, I think about how the director successfully/unsuccessfully adapted the original source material). I think this course gave me a stronger critical eye, and I also feel more confident about my spoken French. Also, even though they were tedious at times, I think the reading responses were helpful in improving my written French and organizing my thoughts for discussion. Weaknesses: Sometimes the reading responses were tedious, especially on busy weeks. Maybe it would be better if they were double-spaced instead of 1.5-spaced? I also wasn't sure if the final project was equivalent to the final paper, which was ten pages, 1.5-spaced. But otherwise, I really enjoyed this course!",
                "The strength is definitely the Professor and the way he made the course engaging for students. Prof Schuwey definitely knows a lot about the topic but is also open in his approaches and allows for various interpretations / new ideas. The twice-a-week writing assignment can get difficult though, especially with reading, but it actually encouraged better reflexion for class.",
                "The pre-class assignments were an absolute pain and the worst part of my semester. The syllabus says discussion questions are assigned weekly, there's actually one before every class. They entail a full page of writing in response to the assigned text, and often requiring additional research with supplementary materials. Sometimes only one day would be given to read an entirely new play and submit a response to it prior to class. Sometimes the pre-class assignments were never discussed in class, making the work seem futile. The texts were interesting, though I wish more space had been made to accommodate students of varying French skill levels, as this course is cross listed between French and Theater studies. The course seemed to cater most toward French majors in that respect, and the workload for a non-fluent non-French major will be much greater. Unfortunately the seminar was structured more like a lecture with the professor leading a presentation then asking for student responses to specific topics. Students were never offered the opportunity to lead the discussion as a group without guidance or input from the professor. This seemed to limit the scope of the discussions we had about the pieces.",
                "Strengths: Professor Schuwey is a brilliant professor and discussion leader. This class had some of the most animated discussions I've been privy to at Yale, and I always left feeling like I had learned something new walking away every Tuesday and Thursday. Schuwey structured each play's discussion around three class sessions, with a specific topic. Normally, we'd tackle the play's content, some specific theme, and then something a little more abstract or bizarre (but also very intriguing) on the third day, before moving onto the next. Sometimes, I thought we'd have no way of discussing the play for yet another day, but Schuwey surprised me each time, managing to fill so much into what I thought was so little. This class is titled \"Revising\" Molire; take that with what you will: it's not some bore of a class, tirelessly analyzing a 16th Century text. These plays are full of life, and so was this class. You could also choose to do a creative project in place of all the major writing assignments, which was a fantastic idea--not having to write a full, research-based paper at the end of the semester was such a breath of fresh air.\r\nWeaknesses: this class is a lot of work. Having a written response paper due every night at 8pm is... sometimes a lot. I understand why he wanted them to be turned in at 8pm, but for a lot of people, me included, that type of schedule isn't sustainable with extracurriculars and other courses. Especially on nights when we had to read an entire play, then respond to the play in written form. I also am not entirely sure how the written responses were used in class; I felt like he chose a few each class that helped structure specific discussion points, but there were certainly other comments that would likely have been equally as interesting to talk about. Also, the standards for creative projects are through the roof! I understand he expects great work, but those expectations may need to be toned down just a little!"

                "Yes, definitely! There's a lot of work, but it's worth it. This is the best French class I've ever taken at Yale!",
                "Would definitely recommend! You improve not only your French but also literature analysis skills and also gain historical knowledge about the era. And also learn so many things about Molire. The class requires work and careful reflexion in essays though, so be prepared.",
                "Yes. It is a niche mode of theatre that I appreciated the opportunity to engage with, though understand that it will feel more like a lecture course and the workload will require strong organizational skills.",
                "Yes! Molire might seem really boring at first, but I promise you, as much as we call him the French Shakespeare, he is not anything like him! Shakespeare is difficult to read even as a native speaker of English, but Molire is not as much of a challenge, AND the content of the plays makes it all the better. There were plays where I burst out laughing, and we watched adaptations on stage of the plays where we all could not stop laughing in class. This class, above all, was fun -- it was a treat and a joy to come to each and every day, because I knew I'd leave class taking away something to think about for the rest of the day. If your French is ready to read plays and discuss them at length, take this class, because you won't regret it. But keep in mind that just because they're plays and quicker to read than novels, the amount of work expected is no less--response papers due for each class session, likely accompanied by some reading, and relatively high standards on writing and major projects/work make the workload a little greater than just a breeze through Molire's work."
