    "Strength: quick paced, lots of interesting readings, actual workload is not too high, excellent instructor\r\nWeaknesses: Hansen and Quinn, the textbook, drops tons of paradigms on you in just a few chapters, so the memorization load is not well dispersed. This can be solved for by continuously practicing though.",
    "The course is very well taught, though fast-paced. It's not an issue, but it's important for a student to be fully involved every class session.",
    "The course is extremely well-organised to facilitate learning. Zach often supplements the textbook with extra material to help explain concepts. He also gives little snippets regarding the historical\/literary context surrounding some of the readings we do in class as foreshadowing for later. The only main detraction is the timing for the vocab quizzes. They often cover stuff that we will cover later during the week, and as such we rote learn the words but don't really understand their purpose until we go through the grammar points. Perhaps incorporating the vocab quiz into the lab quiz will help with this.",

    "This course is great! Definitely take it if you are looking to learn Attic Greek.",
    "Yes! Its great language if you have the motivation, and the readings are so interesting. Zach was an excellent instructor, but I don't think he's teaching it again unfortunately. Hansen and Quinn is a great book with few flaws.",
    "For a student looking to learn the language, the course is excellent.",
    "Yes. It is a lot of work but the results are absolutely worth it! Being able to read the original sources will greatly help you with research!",
    "Yes because Zachary Wolens is an amazing professor and is incredibly engaging"
