Also, the professor would provide some brief insights at the end of every student lecture, which was helpful.",

                "It was a good opportunity to gain experience teaching content to peers. Sometimes I felt like there wasn't enough content per lecture to keep things interesting, and a good chunk of the time each lecture ended up being spent on example problems which I sometimes found repetitive.",

If you want to learn academic public speaking, maybe it is a good course for you, but then again, you only give 1-2 talks. So, in general, I would say that this course is probably not worth taking unless you are a math major and want to fulfill the senior requirement.",
