    "Basically a book club with Gaddis.",
    "An introduction to Machiavelli, Clausewitz, Berlin. Became a better writer as the semester progressed.",
    "Professor Gaddis line-edited every paper that we turned in. Most of my professors at Yale have not done this, and it makes a huge difference. You should absolutely take this class.",
    "At its core, this class teaches about balancing contradictions, engaging with history beyond a traditional academic context, and most importantly, thinking.",
    "Listening to Prof Gaddis pontificate for an hour and fifty minutes each week, I learned about the basics of Grand Strategy and how these principles apply to future US-China relations. A fascinating class, and became a better, more creative writer in the process with Gaddis' creative essay prompts.",
    "Teaches you to think in a broader, more practical way about history. Working with Professor Gaddis is certainly an honor, and if you take this class you should go to his office hours as much as possible to talk about the course, papers, life advice, etc. The readings we did certainly opened by eyes to the reality of China's rise to the level of and perhaps even past the U.S., and learning to think in grand strategic terms about this issue was new and interesting.",
    "Learned about politics, world history, and grand strategy. Prof Gaddis is a gem, and every word he says is discerning, witty, insightful, and gold. I am thankful I took the class, and personally learned a ton. However, I also had to learn how not to be annoyed at the students who regurgitated material  that we all just read  without insight, in a strange \"I'm so insightful\" tone. As if they had come up with whatever they were quoting straight out of the book.",
    "Started with the foundations of grand strategy, especially as they related to Professor Gaddis's book, \"On Grand Strategy.\" This book led us to leaders\/thinkers such as Lincoln, King Philip, and Machiavelli. We then tried to use the tools we developed to look at modern scenarios, specifically the rise of China and United States grand strategy for the future. Overall, I think it was useful in exposing me to different historical figures and situations that I could look to for reference in the future, and in its emphasis on \"common sense\" thinking.",
    "An appreciation for what grand strategy is (or might be), and an ability to apply this framework onto cases both ancient and modern. Professor Gaddis this semester decided to focus the latter half of the class, after we studied his book, on China's Belt and Road Initiative. I enjoyed the discussions and the insights he had on the topic.",
    "First half of the course was a \"mini Grand Strategy\", covering his book and related writings. The second half focused on a relevant current event (US-China relations), and in applying the concepts from the first half to these scenarios."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "At times it felt like the course didn't have much direction, but it was usually nonetheless interesting.",
    "Fantastic readings. Gaddis was a good seminar leader, not great, but that was largely because of some students in the class who tended to try and dominate discussion. Could perhaps introduce readings about the semester's topic (for us, it was the Belt & Road Initiative) a bit earlier and connect the topic more to the theoretical readings. Definitely keep all of the pre-topic readings. \r\n\r\nBiggest weakness - the size. Cutting down a bit on the number of students could really benefit this class.",
    "The material was interesting and the papers were challenging. I wish that Professor Gaddis had given us a clearer direction in each prompt, but the exercise in exploring different ideas (even without complete success) was helpful.",
    "Few weaknesses, so many strengths.",
    "Strengths: excellent professor, rich discussion, very interesting reading list\r\nBe forewarned, compared to most Yale seminars, Professor Gaddis does most of the talking. I took the class for him, not the other students, so glad he guided discussion, as I learned a lot more from him than my peers (or I had been talking!). That being said, he often opens it up for student input and for students to float ideas.",
    "Strengths: readings are incredibly interesting if you're able to get through them, Gaddis, student discussions can be really good depending on the day.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: paper grading can seem arbitrary and the feedback isn't clear. If I were to repeat the class I think we should do some sort of revision on one of the papers. It sometimes feels like there's no real chance to make your work product better which is unfortunate.",
    "Strengths- Professor Gaddis, and the carefully selected course readings. I learned 75% of my takeaways from this course from Prof Gaddis + his readings, and the last 25% from synthesizing in the course of responding to innovative essay prompts. This was my second class with Professor Gaddis and it was a joy to return to some familiar concepts in-depth, and to explore, with greater nuance and vividness, the idea of grand strategy and how it has shaped history. Professor Gaddis illuminates new ideas with a strangely bright, vivid grasp of narrative and storytelling, You simply don't find this kind of insight anywhere. He makes new ideas feel intuitive, and challenges us with captivating and gripping writing prompts. Grateful for his passion, delivery, and expertise; for the exposure to new ideas and flavorful historical anecdotes that I'm sure will stick with me through the years to come. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - students. Some were really wonderful and attentive, with discerning insights. Some were strange in that they spent most of class regurgitating what we had all, literally, just read. Is this what most history and political science classes at Yale are like? (I doubt it, but it makes you wonder...)",
    "Being able to hear from Professor Gaddis is definitely the biggest strength of this course. He has a wealth of knowledge and experience when it comes to grand strategy, so there is a lot you can learn just from listening. He talks for long stretches in seminar; whether or not you consider that a strength or weakness will probably vary depending on what you want from the class. The class is pretty large, which can sometimes decrease the feeling of engagement in seminar. Seminar discussion is also driven by Professor Gaddis, so it is a little bit less free-flowing than might be expected. If he doesn't like what you have to say about something, he will let you know.",
    "Professor Gaddis' insights are definitely a major strength of the class. However, he ends up talking for most of the seminar, and when discussion does take place it never really turns out as a discussion but more responses to Professor Gaddis' questions. That being said, I still enjoyed the class because I came in anticipating this would be more a leminar than a real seminar. As long as you change your expectations for what class dynamic might look like, you'll be able to gain a lot from Professor Gaddis' teachings.",
    "Strengths: The material and readings were new to me, and I found them very engaging. The paper topics were provocative and my favorite part of the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Discussions could have been better. It seemed like there was a fair amount of groupthink and a lot of the answers seemed to be rehashings of that weeks readings. I had hoped to have more substantive and interesting discourse."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would, I think it is interesting to hear Professor Gaddis's perspectives.",
    "If you are able to read 100-200 pages a week (sometimes down to 30-40, sometimes up to 350 for the books), I do recommend this class. Their are genuinely life-applicable lessons for leadership and approaches to problem solving. Gaddis is a font of knowledge, and hearing him speak about things such as Berlin, the Cold War, and China is something you can only do at Yale. I do recommend having some writing experience coming into the class, but that definitely does not preclude STEM or other majors  my STEM friends probably enjoyed this class the most.",
    "Yes. This course is a window into grand strategy, and is a must-take for anyone interested in both ancient history and current affairs.",
    "Take this course. Professor Gaddis is amazing. I changed my mind about a lot during this course.",
    "Don't take the class, just read Gaddis' book.",
    "Absolutely--this course reflects the realities we live today, informed by the histories of Xerxes, Pericles, Philip II, Queen Elizabeth, Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, and to the many presidents of the United States. It's an exploration of the strategies of these figures, and a broader understanding of strategy and its place today. TLDR; take it if you love history, are interested in strategy, and want to challenge yourself in thought and writing.",
    "Yes absolutely. Gaddis is a treat, essays are all creative, and the topics (grand strategy and US-China relations) were all fascinating. We don't talk much about foxes and hedgehogs (our last assignment was to replace them with a metaphor of our own!). Take this class for Professor Gaddis (he's an intellectual giant and a font of humor), take it for the material, or take it for the workload (four 5-page creative essays that were fun to write). As someone who did not want to do the GS program b\/c of its focus on social and economic issues rather than military strategy, this course was an excellent alternative, as it actually covers military and geopolitical grand strategy and is taught by one of the three founders of GS!",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes. One of the best classes you can take at Yale. You'll learn about how to think about things on a broad as well as nuanced level; how to glide across a general landscape and incisively choose a point of view on strategy. I'd highly recommend for students outside the history\/political science domain. The takeaways will enrich how you think about your impact in your own discipline. Email for a spot in the class early! If you can't get into the class, then read \"On Grand Strategy\" by Professor Gaddis, \"Two concepts of freedom\" by Isaiah Berlin, and \"The Originality of Machiavelli\" by Berlin. They hold some of the most important perspectives from the class.",
    "Would recommend it, just by virtue of who teaches it. The reading is also interesting, and the seminar is a good environment to discuss the ideas contained within those readings. The writing can be a little challenging, as you need to figure out what he wants. He definitely gave out a few C's on papers throughout the semester, but don't let that scare you away from taking the class. It's a good opportunity to work on your writing.",
    "Yes! But with the caveat that one must anticipate this may not be as participative a seminar as other classes, because Professor Gaddis talks for most of it. However, there are certainly opportunities to be personally engaged in the class  he assigns four papers that are quite unconventional and personal, and these are avenues to apply the intellectual thought you've heard in seminar onto your own personal lives and beliefs. I really enjoyed writing the papers for this class.",
    "I think the perspective you gain from this course really is unique and practical. I would certainly recommend this course",
    "I found the topics and readings extremely interesting, and appreciated the chance to hear Gaddis's opinions and perspectives. I enjoyed the papers, and emerged a better writer. The class discussions, however, were somewhat disappointing. Overall, I still thought the class was worth the time and effort in offering a chance to explore these topics."
