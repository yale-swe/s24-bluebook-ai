                "The most eye-opening course I've ever taken. We discussed and directly engaged with the 3% problem in translation (< 3% of books published in English are translated from other languages), the politics and economics of translation, the complex role a translator possesses, and how translation (or the lack thereof) impacts our perception of everything.",
                "I learned how to contribute to a discussion thoughtfully, and listen to others. I also learned how to do close readings and analyze arguments.",
                "Learned so much about the history of translation, and its developments throughout centuries across the world!",
                "This class completely changed the way in which I approach language, translation, reading, and writing. In terms of writing skills, I had never done any sort of argument analysis essay before taking this class. I learned how to read texts closely to create a conversation of my own. The selection of texts for this class was fabulous. Each one had a different style and philosophy than the other. As such, I also learned to evaluate writing style while I read, which guided me in my own writing.",
                "As an international student, I infinitely improved my English writing skills. I learned how to write shorter sentences and in which ways I could write my own voice. Regarding the theme of the class, I learned how translations have a deep impact in our life, and what is the role of untranslatables.",
                "In terms of knowledge, I learned about the basics of translation theory, the politics of translation on a personal and global scale, and the rhetorical choices and strategies writers employ in their works. As for skills, I learned how to effectively edit and revise papers, how to conduct literature-based research, and overall gained confidence in my writing abilities.",
                "I improved my ability to synthesize information effectively, to think both deeply and broadly about the course texts, and to engage with the material on a personal level. I appreciated the encouragement to connect with the texts deeply and apply the themes to my own areas of interest. The last two papers in particular gave me a lot of freedom to research and explore topics of my choice within the context of the course theme of translation. I believe that the opportunity to write so independently while finding connections to theories of translation helped me engage with the course even more. I was especially pleased with our peer review workshops because I read so many personal, insightful applications of translation theory that I had not thought of. Overall, I find that my instructor and classmates raised my awareness of many different perspectives. I am grateful to move on as a far more informed writer and person.",
                "I greatly improved my writing and research abilities, and was also able to begin making the transition from rigidly structured high school level writing into college writing.",
                "I learned how to read dense academic texts. It's annoying sometimes but a useful skill. I also learned a lot about the intricacies of translation which I found have many applications in my own life. I finished the course with a sense of the abstract theory of translation but also a deepened personal connection to the language dynamics that I specifically experience."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Prof. Zo Burgard is incredibly knowledgeable about translation and thoughtful with her course curriculum. Every week had a theme and structure (discussion of translation + relevant discussion about writing). She also left timely and thorough feedback on each assignment and encouraged us to discuss ideas with her while working on our papers. Additionally, she created a very open and welcoming atmosphere for each student to share their ideas and questions. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Small class was a perfect environment for a discussion. I was always so excited to go to class every day, knowing that I will learn something new and fascinating. I also loved the threshold thoughts exercise, really made the atmosphere comfortable and warm. Overall my favorite class this semester!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Readings were a little challenging and long, but might be related to my own reading pace.",
                "Very good layout with excellent choices of readings, maybe a few more modern readings mixed in if the course were to add something!",
                "Strengths: engaging subject matter, good classroom environment (thanks to threshold thoughts and the ambiance set by Zo), the course format (Tuesdays for topical discussions and Thursdays to finish up these discussions and talk about writing) was particularly nice and seems much better than some of the other 114 courses (e.g. where a whole month was spent on just composition)\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes discussions were somewhat slow or more one-sided, but this got better as the course went on and people became more comfortable sharing their ideas; sometimes the readings were quite long and difficult to finish especially with the amount of writing we were expected to complete",
                "This course was very well structured. In a given week, I appreciated the emphasis of our course texts on one day and emphasis on writing composition the other day. I found that equal importance was placed on improving our skills as readers and as writers.",
                "The strengths of the course is the manner in which it introduces you to the style of writing that will be expected of students throughout the rest of their college experience. I also enjoyed having the four different types of papers as it allowed us to write in different styles. The peer evaluations were another strength of the course, I felt that these really assisted me in the editing process.",
                "Strengths: the people usually are interested in the topic. The papers have a lot of support and guidance built into the writing process.\r\nWeakness: discussions are sometimes boring since it's a bunch of first years. The texts can be ridiculously dense and abstract."

                "YES! Take this class, you will not regret it. I looked forward to the class every week & it was often the highlight of my day. We had very insightful discussions, a welcoming atmosphere, and my writing significantly improved.",
                "Yes, especially if the student has thought about translation and wants to go really deep into translation theory.",
                "Definitely! Expanded my knowledge of the translation world greatly!",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Although it just so happened that nearly everyone who enrolled in this class was bilingual, translation theory is relevant for everyone.",
                "Yes, definitely. Anyone interested in translations or linguistics should take this course. It gives a broad view about Comparative Literature, humanities, translation theories, and even politics.",
                "Yes! Beyond the obvious improvement in my writing, this is one of those courses that changes the way you think about the world around you! The readings were genuinely interesting and engaging, as were our discussions surrounding the ideas in the texts and how they connected with both our personal experiences and the world around us. Could not recommend my this course enough despite it giving me an existential crisis about what I want to major in! :)",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it is an excellent way to improve one's skills of analysis and synthesis. Engaging with so many texts, finding connections within society, and writing clearly and coherently are skills that are useful in all fields of study. I encourage any student to take this course.",
                "Yes! Definitely take this course if you are worried about college-level writing or looking to improve your skills.",
                "Yes, if you are a weak writer. If writing is one of your \"things\" don't bother. Most people in this class are not great writers and are looking to improve at a basic level. If you can, challenge yourself by taking a more advanced course."
