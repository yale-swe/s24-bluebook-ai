    "Strengths: With going to class every day, speaking skills improve a lot over the semester\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes hard to devote as much time as needed to learn material fully before the next quick deadline to know it by. The turn around time for learning is fast paced",
    "Having it every day was rough",
    "It was boring but my spanish improved.",
    "This course does a good job preparing students to speak Spanish at a conversational level. The course covers consider vocabulary, but more importantly it emphasis proper grammar to speak in different tenses, which expands the types of sentence constructions you can use to speak or write with."

    "Yes, but keep in mind that it will take time every day of the week, which can be a drawback. Definitely worth it in the long run if you want to learn Spanish, though.",
    "Yes if they want to take Spanish.",
    "yes but tell them it boring.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. I think that the pace and breadth of the course is challenging but manageable. The instructors provide plenty of practice, though this comes at the cost of having class five days a week. Overall, I think that, if you are even mildly interested in studying Spanish, you will find the course to be instructive and helpful."
