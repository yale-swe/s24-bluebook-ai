                "strengths: clear lectures and the teaching team was very responsive to questions\r\nweaknesses: the homeworks and labs did not prepare us well for the midterm and final, lectures were just ok I'd say",
                "Strengths: thorough PowerPoint slides presented well by the professor; lab sections each week were pretty good and the lab keys and homework keys provided were helpful. R is a good platform for learning but might be difficult for beginners.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: R is strange at times and seems unnecessary for some simpler concepts.",
                "The class presented a lot of important material, however, I felt that it was poorly adjusted for virtual learning. The first exam set-up was a bit tragic with a confusing organization. This was fixed for the second exam but it was still not optimally adjusted. Additionally, going through labs while on zoom should have been recorded. I understand that attendence in section was mandatory and therefore section was not recorded, but there was so much content covered during the labs and I and various other students had a hard time keeping up with having the screen being shared as well as trying to run R studio. It was a lot to handle on one device.",
                "i did not like the teaching style. the professor went through the lecture way too fast and didn't really teach, he only read off of the slides.",
                "consistent workload and learning, the exams were terrible though",
                "In terms of homework and projects, the class was straightforward. However, I think the exams are what made this course very difficult. The amount of questions we were expected to answer in the duration of just 50 minutes led me to not completely finish any of the exams, which caused me a lot of anxiety and stress.",
                "Good lectures and slides.",
                "This course was organized very well, with many resources available. I liked using EdDiscussion to get questions answered outside of class, and the TFs and professor were very helpful and knowledgeable. The one thing that I did not like was the first exam format on Qualtrics, but the teaching team took the classes' feedback and changed the format for the second exam.",
                "i think that sometimes lectures could have used the entire 75 minutes instead of 50; sometimes content was rushed through or underexplained. but overall i think i learned a lot from the class",

                "Really clear and organized, clear expectations.",
                "Strengths: easy to follow and understand, passionate about statistics Weaknesses: went a bit too slow at times (too much time on mean, median, and mode); required attendance for live lectures, which would make me disengage and just watch recorded lectures later anyway",
                "The lectures were extremely fast-paced, especially for an introductory course. The lecture format of the course made it very hard to comprehend the material and follow along. In addition, we utilized the programming language known as \"R\" but it was mostly used for problem sets and barely included on exams. Exams were extremely hard to prepare for since the problem sets were very unrelated to how the exams were formatted.",
                "Strengths: very well-taught, TFs always available for questions and very supportive, highly engaging lectures with a strong live component, challenging problem sets that made students engage more with the material\r\nWeaknesses: extremely strict grade cutoffs, Sunday night problem sets and no office hours over the weekend to help with questions, some TFs clearly more engaged with the course and more dedicated to students than others",

                "The lectures were well taught and understandable. More time for the exams would have been appreciated.",
                "I think the course was organized very well with clear mechanisms to get help if you needed it. I really like how many modes there were of getting help such as ed discussion, office hours, and individual meetings. I do not think that the course had any weaknesses really... I had made a note about including cc in lectures during the course evaluations which was promptly included which indicated to me that the professor and TFs were really invested in our learning and interested in our feedback.",

                "The strength of the course was the PSETs which greatly helped to clarify some of the concepts, as well as the detailed lecture slides. However, the lack of practice test questions made it difficult, but I believe that was only due to the fact that the course changed to R.",

                "The live lectures were really hard to attend especially since it was during lunch time, so I would have to eat lunch during class and just pay attention to get the required attendance questions - it seemed meticulous and unhelpful. Recorded review sections and lectures helped so much especially when tests came around. EdDiscussion was probably the most useful resource because it helped clarify questions after especially when we were too nervous to do it in a class setting, but the required number just clouded up the forum with useless questions.",
                "I think that the professor could have been easier on students in terms of attendance and participation as the class did take place over zoom and we are under the circumstances of a pandemic.",
                "I think it was overall successful - the live lecture participation requirement certainly made for a more engaging learning experience. The lab sections were very useful to delve deeper into the material and answer questions. Since this was a course in computing and statistics, the remote format worked quite well",

                "Ed discussion was so incredibly helpful, because a lot of the questions I had were shared by others. Recorded lectures were not too helpful, as the recordings did not have the slides in view.",
                "The PSETs and discussion sections were very helpful and succeeded. Additionally, the recorded lectures allowed students to go back and touch up on any concepts that were unfamiliar. The Pollev questions were very helpful as they provided a way to gauge our understanding of the material. The first midterm was very brutal for the class, but the final did fix a lot of the complaints. I do hope the final grade accounts for the issues of midterm 1 as that exam did not accurately represent our knowledge of the course material.",

The format of the first online midterm was really bad (qualtrics survey), which made the exam quite a stressful experience (also the timing is extremely limited). Thankfully the format was changed for the second midterm (gradescope), although I think the time allotted was quite short for the number of questions. \r\n\r\nUsing EdDiscussion was very helpful, as it allowed us to ask questions about anything related to statistics and get input from both our peers and the teaching team in a quite efficient way."

                "yes",
                "yes!",
                "Yes! This is a great introductory statistics course which allows you to explore other methods of modeling such as R Studio that you would not have previously learned prior to taking this course.",
                "Yes, great teaching staff.",
                "Yes! I took this course because I wanted to become a more thoughtful consumer and reader, and the course definitely helped me become more confident in statistical models.",
                "If you need a QR credit and are in the social sciences, definitely take this class! It's not necessarily a gut but its manageable and offers stats skills helpful in real life.",
                "Yes. It's a good stats course for psych students, not too difficult, and gives you everything you need to know (pretty much) for understanding (and writing) good psych papers.",
                "Yes. This class was not set up incredibly for COVID, but I do believe that it covered a lot of relevant content and teaches you how to use many important tools",
                "no i did not like this course or the teaching style. maybe with another professor",
                "You are probably looking at this course because you need it for PSYC or CogSci or something, and if it fulfills a major requirement its not that bad. I wouldnt particularly recommend it however if you just need a QR credit, unless you really want to learn about psyc stats and R for some reason (but you may get more out of other S&DS courses)",
                "Yeah it's pretty good",
                "I would recommend this course for any psych majors/cog sci majors (even if it is not required for the major) because of the foundational basic tools it provides you in order to succeed in future research.",
                "if you're a psych major or interested in stats yes. also i think its a pretty interesting and useful QR, just make sure you take it with friends",
                "Yes! If you need an intro to statistics / haven't taken statistics in high school and are looking for a course with approachable content that will probably be useful to you (ie being familiar with R), this course is great!",
                "Yes! I think this course does a great job introducing students to statistics and coding. It is also great that no experience is necessary, and I still feel like I learned quite a bit.",
                "Yes! Very well taught and well organized. Feel confident using and navigating R and understanding basic statistics.",
                "If you have any prior knowledge of stats at all, I would take the higher level class, especially if you need to learn RStudio significantly for a lab. It's a great 5th class though or for the QR credit if you just need it, but I wish I took 230 with my friends because sometime this class felt like a waste since I had already taken AP Stats.",
                "If you have experience with statistics and R, then this class will not be a problem for you. It will be challenging for those like me who had no prior background.",
                "Yes, especially if you are a Psychology major, but also if you are interested in learning the basics of statistics without getting too deep into the CS side of it",
                "Yes. Well structured. Good for beginners",
                "Yes, this course is a psych major req first of all but would be good for anyone wanting to learn important concepts behind statistics and get a basic handle on R programming.",
                "Yes, learning statistics and how data is managed is very important, especially if you are going into the psych field!",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, great stats course",
                "Yes, it's a good intro to stats.",
                "I would definitely recommend this to other students, especially those that do not feel as confident about quantitative/math related subjects. It was both approachable and challenging and I feel a lot more confident about statistics going forward.",
                "Yes, overall I found this to be an enjoyable course that was a great intro to statistics for someone who had never studied it before.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student as the information learned can greatly aid your understanding of statistics and research practices.",
                "Yes. You learn a lot about how to read and analyze data, and this knowledge comes in handy when reading news, research papers, etc.",
                "Yes, I think it offers a good foundation in statistics and the courseload is manageable",
                "I would recommend this course. It gives a good overview for stats and R.",
                "If you are taking it as a requirement or are looking for an introductory statistics course",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course more strongly to people who have not taken AP STAT. The first half of the course is almost identical to AP Stat. This course does well to solidify basic concepts and was a great introduction to learning R and applying tests to the real world.",
                "Yes. It's a great QR, a fair class, and Ilker is a fantastic professor.",
                "Yes!!! The course is very well organized and the teaching team is great. Professor Yildirim is a very nice person too.",
                "Yes, it's a great intro to stats that will be very useful in reading and actually understanding psych papers.",
                "As far as QRs go, this is not so bad. Especially if you are a psychology major, it will not be as tough to get through as you think!"
