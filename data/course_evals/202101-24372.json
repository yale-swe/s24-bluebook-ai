                "I think the strengths of the course was the wide breadth of information and knowledge that it provided. One weakness of the course was the material on the psets was not always indicative of the material presented in lecture, which is one improvement that I might make. One major benefit of the course is that it wasn't information overload like some of the other courses at Yale, so it was possible to really focus in and internalize what we were learning.",

                "While the content is interesting, once there was no incentive to take notes, it was difficult to pay attention in class due to Zoom fatigue. The course did a good job at providing basic concepts in energy, but it was difficult to remain engaged.",

More strengths than weaknesses and minimal improvements. \r\n\r\nFew improvements would be to ensure that the PowerPoint posted before class aligns with the content during the lecture. At times minor or major alterations would be made making the lecture difficult to follow. As for the midterm, maybe a clearer outline of the main topic.",

It seemed like we would often watch videos multiple times or return to very specific topics (and have the same discussions over and over again), and the lectures were a little bit slow and rambling. The best part of the class was the guest speakers.\r\n\r\nThere was also low engagement from the class in general, with hardly anyone using their cameras or contributing class. This made the class not very engaging to be in.\r\n\r\nThe strengths of the class are the guest speakers and the final project, which was fun and worthwhile.",

                "I would recommend the course to another student because it was a good mix of science and policy. The content was fun and manageable, with a lot of interesting case studies during the lectures.  Though I would warn that the problem sets can be calculation and math-heavy, it was tolerable as long as you paid attention to the examples given in class, the math equations lecture, and frequented TA help sessions.",

                "Unfortunately, no. The class material scrapes at interesting topics in energy, but seemed like a lot of time that wasn't used maximally for discussion\/exploration of energy topics. Lectures can be frustratingly dry and slow. \r\n\r\nIf you are really looking for an easy science credit, this would be a good (but not very thrilling\/engaging) choice. The math is not too difficult, and the concepts are easy enough to grasp. \r\n\r\nThe best parts of the course are the guest lecturers and the final project. Professor Prober is also a really nice person, but the lectures are just hard to sit through.",
