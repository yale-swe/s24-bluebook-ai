I also received an overview of many different movements of experimental literature, and I learned how to approach manifestos.",
                "I learned about \"experimental\" (and primarily twentieth-century) fiction in French covering a wide range of literary movements and theoretical approaches.",
                "Learned about French experimental literature and how to analyze manifestos.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The works read and secondary resources consulted were all incredibly interesting and enlightening. Class discussions were always very enriching. Weaknesses: N/A",
                "strengths: great discussions, remarkably detailled feedback on work - always knew what was expected of me\r\nweaknesses: needs something to break up the 2-hr session, either a break or more variation in activities, should dedicate more time to synthesis of ideas as we go (sometimes got lost in the complexity of all these genres) , I also wish we had gotten closer over the course of the semester - maybe this would have been easier in a classroom with more lighting but alas!",
                "Strengths: class was very clearly organized, good variety of different essay topics, reasonable workload and interesting collection of works that were studied, also had more hands-on classes where we visited the Beinecke to look at the archives of works we discussed \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "The material was fascinating. There was a lot of it, and at times I wondered whether we were sacrificing depth for broad temporal/methodological coverage, but it never felt like too much. The essay prompts were well organized to encourage us to explore several writing styles and topics in French. Discussions were always engaging, and the end-of-semester trip to the Beinecke was especially exciting.",
                "The course is organized very well and demands engagement. It is sometimes hard because there is so much reading but we do not have the time to discuss all of it.",
                "Strengths: The texts were unlike anything I had ever read before. The pace and structure of the class was comfortable. The first essay allowed us to analyze at a paragraph level rather than a book level. This eased us into the subsequent essays, which entailed a more global analysis. Thus, the goal of the essays focused more on improvement, which made them less intimidating. Weaknesses: There were weeks where we would cover an entire book in one class. We sometimes got caught up analyzing a particular passage for a long time, forcing us to skim over the rest of the book. I don't think it's worth sacrificing some of the texts we read, but I think keeping the discussion moving along would be beneficial. One change that might facilitate this is by distributing some questions to think about prior to class.",
                "This course covers French literature I never would have covered otherwise, and although a lot of the works were quite weird, I always left class discussions feeling like I learned something new. Although the manifestos were sometimes long and difficult to understand, I feel like they did ultimately enrich my understanding of the literature we covered for the class. The course also had very engaging essay topics, so I never felt like I was writing typical 5-paragraph essays. I was instead able to write more creative works, which was unusual but very cool to be able to do. My only weakness of the course is that the workload was a bit higher than advertised, with me often having to read 140-50 pages per week instead of 100. However, this was a minor weakness and the course was great overall.",
                "Lots of in-depth conversations, but could be a lot for a 2-hour seminar that meets once a week."

                "Yes! Lot of reading, but my skills improved substantially, and I'm no longer afraid to pick up big French texts.",
                "Yes, Id recommend this to any student interested in more contemporary and modern French literature and who enjoys discussions. This is truly a class where you get what you put in, but I feel like most students are drawn to participating since Prof. Cadieu provides such interesting questions and suggestions. The workload is also manageable, and Prof. Cadieu makes the class a very supportive and comfortable space.",
                "This class is excellent, and delves deeply into experimental literature through a multifaceted lens.",
                "Any student interested in the French language and in so-called experimental literature - and prepared to produce and engage with large amounts of writing in French - can get a lot out of this course.",
                "Yes I think it really opens up a whole new genre of literature and teaches you how to analyze manifestoes and non traditional novels.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in French literature. Experimental literature seems intimidating but Professor Cadieu was very cognizant of the foreignness of this realm and really helped ease students into it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The material covered is unusual but fascinating, and the class is organized in a way where it is easy to understand the ultimate goals of the author when they created their work. It also is extremely engaging, as it includes class discussions, a Beinecke visit, reading news articles, engaging with ChatGPT, etc.",
