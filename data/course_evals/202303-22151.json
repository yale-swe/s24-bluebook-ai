                "I learned how to reconstruct philosophical arguments and think very critically about philosophial ideas.",
                "This course taught me how to analyze philosophical arguments and how to write philosophical objections. I also learned about the foundations of Western and near Eastern philosophy. As someone who was never sure of what philosophy was, this course opened my eyes to the ways in which philosophy influences every sphere of life. Learning about the different schools of philosophy has definitely cleared up some questions about life that I have.",
                "I learned a lot about the structure, history, and practical worth of philosophy.",
                "Ancient Western philosophy- as well as reading and writing skills",
                "I gained skills in argument reconstruction and text analysis, while also getting a strong background in classical philosophy. I feel much more prepared going into further philosophy courses to reconstruct arguments and engage critically with texts.",
                "Directed Studies Philosophy introduced me to philosophical reconstruction, analysis, and objection. Professor Buturovic fostered an environment that encouraged nuanced analysis and critical thinking, in a way that no other class at Yale has provided me. In particular, we deconstructed philosophical arguments at such a granular level that we were able to (1) fully understand highly complex philosophical axioms, and (2) reconstruct the argument better than the author made it -- identifying the flaws and deficiencies in the author's original argument. Moreover, this class gave me confidence in philosophical writing. Professor Buturovic's comments are exhaustive, thorough, critical, fair, salient, and nuanced; she provides perhaps the most detailed feedback I've received to date -- providing margin comments AND a 300-400 word executive summary of strengths\/weaknesses of the essay. This granularity of feedback allowed me to understand the strengths AND deficiencies of my argument and objection, enabling me to understand multiple facets of improvement: argumentative clarity, textual precision, philosophical analysis, and craftsmanship of writing. Above all, I feel that DRST Philosophy Fall taught me a far greater understanding of the Western cannon than I otherwise would have had. I believe Professor Buturovic is responsible for this lucidity. In seminar, Professor Buturovic would frequently connect readings to the cannon they built on (e.g. connecting Parmenides and Anaxagoras as Pre-Socratics to the evolution of Platonic and Aristotelian thought, relating the arguments of Empedocles and Alexander of Aphrodisias to later Islamic Philosophers, linking Aristotelian boulesis and Stoic prohairesis to Augustine's On Free Choice of the Will). These intra-textual connections drew a clear line in the evolution of thought, which I think is unique to our section of DS Philosophy.",
                "DS Philosophy was by far the most difficult, and by far the most rewarding. I learned so muchand I mean SO much; the sheer quantity of material I've absorbed in just four short months is astounding to me. Professor Buturovic, above all else, helped me focus on understanding the simpler components of each philosophical work and really nailing them down, before moving onto the grand philosophical questions that linger behind. This helped me greatly in my reconstruction of incredibly complex arguments, and helped cultivate skills like syllogistic organization.",
                "I had never taken philosophy before and over the course of the semester developed intensive philosophical reading, analytical, and writing skills. It challenged me to consider all kinds of views that I would not have otherwise thought about and how these views change people's approach to their daily lives.",
                "This was truly the best class I've taken thus far (although, I've only taken one semester of classes). I had never read a philosophical work before, much less taken a philosophy class. This course taught me how to read philosophical texts, how to think about those texts, and how to talk and write about them. I am positive these skills will serve me greatly during my time at Yale and beyond."

                "This course was very well-structured and easy to follow. I did not personally enjoy a lot of the readings, because I did not find them applicable in my personal life. Sometimes the readings felt too abstract and difficult to understand. A strength of the course was that the lectures were very helpful to understand the philosophical arguments.",
                "Strengths: VERY, very thorough introduction to important philosophers of Western tradition and near Eastern tradition. Lots of discussion time for critiquing and corroborating philosophical arguments. Very engaged professor and teaching staff. Lectures were highlight of my week because of how the lecturers connected the topics to the real world.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: overwhelming amount of Aristotle. Maybe break it up with something in the middle (if that's even possible?)",
                "Strengths: very broad, comprehensive curriculum with strong focus on student improvement throughout the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lecture quality was a mixed bag. most were \"good,\" in the sense that they were well-prepared and essential to the syllabus, but few had the same energy or intellectual creativity as other DS tracks.",
                "It is extremely fast-paced, but you do get good insight in general for ancient western philosophy.",
                "This course aims to teach its students key skills in the philosophy while also exposing them to a great number of texts. At times, I wished that we could spend more time on certain texts. \r\n\r\nThat being said, I think Plato's Timaeus should be added to the reading list...",
                "Strengths:\r\n* THE PROFESSOR. This 4000 character text-box cannot do Professor Buturovic justice. Her seminar was brilliant. I will attempt to explain the strengths of this course through an explication of Professor Buturovic's seminar: (1) ANALYTIC RIGOR. Professor Buturovic explained the nuance behind philosophical arguments in a way that is unique amongst DS professors. We delved into ideas like Agent Dependency in the Euthyphro, the Compresence of Opposites as they related to Plato's Phaedo, the Existential, Veridical, and Predicative Definitions of Knowledge vs. Belief in Plato's Republic, Stoic Prohairesis as they related to Augustine's Free Will, etc. The unparalleled nature of Professor Buturovic's analysis made the class discussion especially sharp, as our section grasped deeper nuance and more rigorous connections in the texts. (2) FREE MARKET OF IDEAS. We built our understanding of the text with rigorous seminar discussion. However, Professor Buturovic rejected a dogmatic interpretation of text. Instead, we debated all ideas. We debated Platonism vs. Aristotelianism. We had calm, conversational, critical discussion of highly nuanced ideas -- debating Professor Buturovic herself as she played the devil's advocate to stress-test our interpretations, and debating our peers as we tried to figure out the meaning behind our texts. This free and open academic discourse made our seminar especially special. (3) STRUCTURED FLOW OF CONTENT. In Philosophy, it is very easy to get 'lost in the sauce.' Professor Buturovic maintained organization and order in class by providing structured outlines of our discussion at the beginning of each class; these were documents for us to take notes on, which also provided an implicit structure for our discussion. In that way, our seminar could explore ideas, while we followed a structure of pre-established content, allowing us to stay on track and get through high quantities of content, while exploring the quality of discussions. (4) META-TEXTUAL COMMENTARY. Professor Buturovic provided us contextual explanations with CODAs, explaining how each text 'fit into' the larger cannon, explicating how ideas grew and evolved, and providing us a broader understanding of the text beyond simply words on a page. In this way, Professor Buturovic gave us a higher-level understanding of texts, by allowing us to figure out how texts evolved from each other, influenced each other, connect with each other, and respond to each other. We truly understand the 'cannon' as opposed to a series of independent texts. \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES:\r\n* none. fantastic class. best experience at Yale to date. lectures are incredible. seminars are brilliant. MUST TAKE FOR STUDENTS.",
                "Honest opinion: I have no suggestions for DS philosophy. I think it was so well-executed; the lectures were absolutely fantastic, as were each of our sections. I had a great deal of fun, absorbed a psychotic amount of philosophical material, and thoroughly enjoyed the process of writing my papers.",
                "The greatest strengths of this course is the way it presents centuries of individual philosophical thought and texts as interwoven and dependent on each other. The influences from other philosophers are clear from the start and it helps students make their own connections both to modern day philosophers and texts from other fields. I understand due to the time period this course focuses on there are a limited pool of female philosophers, but I think it would have been fascinating to get at least one example of the female perspective at the time as an opportunity to compare both to male philosophers of that period and those in the modern day.",
                "I hope that in the future students are given more instruction on how to write philosophy papers. Although we had one paper-writing workshop, and devoted maybe an hour to talking about writing these papers in class, I don't think this was enough. Breaking down not only the structure of the essays, but what a good paragraph and\/or argument reconstruction looks like, would be quite helpful."

                "I could not recommend this course enough. DS Philosophy in itself is an incredible, thought provoking class, but talking it with Dr. Buturovic made it that much better. Philosophy is not easy, and they often don't give you a ton of instruction in how to read the texts and write the papers, but after a while you start to get the hang of it! Our seminars and lectures were all fantastic."
