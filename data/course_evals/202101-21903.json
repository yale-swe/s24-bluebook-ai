A lot of the final answers to questions were \"we don't know\", but that's not really a fault of the class and is mostly just a reality of how physics acts weirdly for really really big and really really small things.",

They're mandatory, but it was just listening to a very boring, very confusing lecture for 90 minutes (she often stopped early). I don't know how I would have survived if the lectures were in person; over Zoom, I just had them play in the background as I did other work.",
                "Strengths: The material was super interesting! I hadn't interacted with the course material in a while and it was cool getting everything explained. \r\nWeaknesses:  I think the fact that we learned about it from a non-mathematically rigorous course meant that we didn't really get a complete picture or understanding of the material. Sometimes it was quite difficult to discuss or explain the topics without the use of math. That being said, this is probably not a weakness if you're taking this course as humanities or social science major.",
                "Strengths: Lecture format and asking questions\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe more discussion between students",

                "I think its one of those courses that is hard to keep engaging over zoom. But incorporating more assignments that allow students to work together would be good!",
                "This is a very interesting course which does a great job of introducing complicated topics in science to non-majors in an understandable way. There is plenty of time to ask questions and you are encouraged to think about stuff on your own as well.",
                "Its an amazing class especially for those who arent math/physics majors and want a science credit. Its well organised with weekly homeworks being set right after class giving a full week to complete. Marking was always quick and with good feedback. I felt there were no weaknesses.",
                "I think this course is very good at explaining the concepts well. Professor Caines brought a great energy to the classroom and was always ready to answer any questions we had. The readings were also interesting, although long at points. I do think the weekly reading responses could be graded on completion or something more forgiving than this semesters grading system trying to answer the questions perfectly became pretty stressful for me especially as we went deeper into the concepts, and rather than being excited by new ideas, I was scared that I wouldnt understand them and lose points on the homework (especially because we wouldnt have an opportunity to ask questions in class before we turned in homework.)"
