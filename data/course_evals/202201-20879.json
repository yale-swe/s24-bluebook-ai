                "Strength: I found the lecture videos to be helpful in understanding the materials and the experiment. Additonally, compared to CHEM 136L, the experiments done were more connected to the concepts learned in CHEM 165 lecture as compared to CHEM 134L and CHEM 161. Though they were a lot of work, the pre-class quiz and the post-lab quiz ensured that I was understanding the material needed. \r\nWeakness: The lab reports are incredibly long. I didn't think the pre-lab in-person lectures were necessary since the videos did a good job covering the experiment so I am happy that the in-person lectures were removed.",
                "Strengths  - None\r\nWeaknesses - Too stressful and challenging",
                "Why am I 2 credits worth of work for a 0.5 credit class",
                "Lab reports due on Monday have no good office hours before hand. There seemed to be a lot of small details on the lab report that were impossible to get without sufficient time spent in office hours. It was not enough to attend lab and watch pre lab lectures. the way the class is set up, with a pre lab quiz, post lab quiz, lab, and lab report all on the same day- it doesnt make sense.",
                "Strengths: explanatory, informative, and in-depth experiments\r\nWeaknesses: unreasonable workload and unclear expectations, even after asking for clarification",
                "Strengths: The TFs (only some TF office hours were really helpful, though) and Prof. G were very kind and provided us with help when we asked for it. There are so many resources to do well - you are truly only limited by the lack of time to adequately watch all of the videos and effectively study for the class. Weaknesses: I felt that at times the postlab and prelab quizzes every week, along with lab reports, watching video lectures, and doing the experiments in lab during class time, in addition to attending office hours every week, was A LOT for any class, regardless of how many credits we got for it. I think a major weakness of the class is the grading system where we are pitted against each other and graded on a curve -- much more collaboration and teamwork could have been achieved if all the pre-meds were not so focused on trying to do better than everyone else to get an A. Changing the grading system and removing the post-lab quizzes would make this class astronomically more manageable and enjoyable.",
                "The course was pretty horrible, the pre and post lab quizzes required a lot of time to study for and the labs were fairly simple and boring. The grading rubrics for the lab report had many weird clauses such as on a graph where I had a title it was marked down. This was only a half credit class and had more work than any of my full credit classes and the curve for the class is very difficult for all the work required. The prelab lectures both on video and in person were repetitive and uninformative.",
                "The experiments were not always the most interesting, but usually promoted a thorough understanding of fundamental chemistry concepts and laboratory procedures. The amount of pre-lab videos and in-lab lectures was a lot at times. Though it could be repetitive, I thought the way the material was presented facilitated retention of information and a thorough understanding of the concepts. I did not think the course was that much higher in workload than Gen Chem Lab I. The lab reports were challenging but the TFs and professor were very accessible and available to help.",
                "The lectures and preparation of the course is very organized and logical. \r\nGrading and rubrics should be revised to emphasize efficiency and proper visual information organization rather than focusing on trivial details like the size of a graph in comparison to the page. (The graders and professors should take courses in basic graphic design and visual thinking so they can create more efficient lab report templates.)",
                "Strengths: Very thorough introduction to chemistry, each week covered a different important chemical concept\r\nWeaknesses: workload is high, lab reports take a while, and postlab quizzes have some stupid questions on them that are basically just memorization of chemical compounds. For a 0.5 credit class, it was a lot of work. I think I spent almost as much time on chem lab as I did a number of my other classes each week.",
                "Strength: Dr. G is actually a really great teacher. So many students harp on him and although I have some thoughts on this class, he really is a great teacher. Cares about his students a lot. The class also reinforced what was taught in chem 165.\r\n\r\nWeakness: there are a lot. This class made me feel so defeated all of the time. Spending 12+ hours on lab reports, taking quizzes that don't make sense, and doing experiments that make even less sense than the quizzes. I just can't see how this class's work load is justified. \r\n\r\nYale, get it together. Up the credits, or cap the workload. Want to know why so many students end up choosing humanities majors after their first year? Because STEM at Yale isn't fair or suited to teach undergrads. Nearly 20 hours a week I dedicated to this class. FOR A HALF OF A CREDIT! That is the same as working someone for 20 hours and paying them for 10.",
                "This course was extremely intense. The workload was heavy for a 0.5 credit class. However, that being said, I learned a tremendous amount about chemical concepts, the mathematics behind the subject, and experimental techniques. I feel as though I have come away much more knowledgeable.",
                "I felt like the experiments were more varied in 136L than 134L. Although I would say that there was too much to do for the course each week, I gradually got accustomed to the workload.",
                "Dr. G. simply has to go. He has an archaic and sadistic view of education and teaching. I'm not sure what the strengths of this course were, but it sure could be improved by finding a new professor.",
                "Strengths: diverse variety of labs that allowed us to understand chemistry topics in synch with gen chem lecture\r\nWeaknesses: inconsistent grading rubrics",
                "The strengths of this course included its organization. However, there are many improvements that can be made. For instance, considering that this class was only 0.5 credit, we were expected to not only complete weekly lab reports, but also a pre lab and post lab quiz. The amount of work required for this class did not reflect the 0.5 credit. The post lab quizzes were also mostly testing how well we were able to memorize the lab manual, rather than an application of the content we learned in lecture and in lab.",
                "Strengths: The prelab videos helped with understanding the content in the gen chem lectures\r\nWeaknesses: The pre and post-lab quizzes and lab reports got to be very stressful; I think Dr. G loves chemistry a lot but also wants his students to love it as much as him; for the heavy amount of work it's only worth 0.5 credits",
                "I feel like this course was very helpful in supplementing what we were learning in lecture, and I often learned more from this course than from lecture. This was all because of the pre-lab lectures and the manualsI found them very helpful. However, this course felt much heavier than a 0.5 credit course, which ultimately led to me having to drop another course because this one took up more time than I expected. I believe this was because of the addition of weekly (for the most part) post-lab and pre-lab quizzes that required a pretty decent amount of preparation. Paired with the lab reports and preparation for lab (which I feel is a justified time spent), the workload often stressed me out more than I believe it should have for a 0.5 credit course.",
                "This course was very challenging. I think it should be more than 0.5 credits as I had to spent so much time on it each week.",
                "A weakness of this course was that it has a very demanding workload.",
                "This course is a great addendum to the general chemistry lectures, and will really further your understanding in some concepts.",
                "The class could be improved by allowing more flexibility to accommodate for different learning styles.",
                "Weaknesses: overbearing work load, unrealistic expectations for lab reports (rubrics are very detailed\/specific but we don't have them so we don't know what they're necessarily looking for unless we are told)",
                "The class had significantly way too much work for a half-credit class. Also, having it on Monday, the class went faster than the lecture, and therefore it was unfair because we were quizzed on material that we have yet to learn in the actual class compared to those who took it later in the week. It was way too much work.",
                "Strengths: your lab skills\/techniques I prove a lot once you take this course. The TAs for the course are also fantastic.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of the experiments felt very menial and the workload was way too much for a 0.5 credit course. The lab reports took up so much time (consistently 12+ hours) and the difficulty levels of the pre-lab and post-lab quizzes were so inconsistent that it was impossible to ever feel adequately prepared for them.",
                "This class was a lot of work with little pay off. The post-lab quizzes test memorization more than understanding, and the lab reports were tedious. In all, the focus was not on learning except for the actual experiments, and I think this class and its difficulty could be very intimidating for people who want to go into STEM fields.",
                "strengths: very clear lab procedures and prelab lectures\r\nweaknesses: the prelab and postlab quizzes were excessively specific, which often made them hard to do well on. also, we are given far too little time of the prelab quizzes so much so that the grades are not reflective of an actual understanding of chem\/chemistry lab",
                "The pre and post lab quizzes were very difficult; I wish there was a more direct way to show our learning in the laboratory techniques than simply memorizing names of species, etc.",
                "Strengths: very interested professor\r\nweakness: very rigorous weed out course.",
                "Absolutely too much work for a 0.5 credit class. Post lab quizzes are ridiculous and unnecessary.",
                "This course  has very many assessments, especially for a .5 credit class. I think that this made the course overly stressful and distracted from actually focusing on the labs.",
                "Strengths: you learn a lot through practice\r\nWeaknesses: the expectations for lab reports were not always clear",
                "Strengths: There are some nice labs. Weakness: labs are very long and exhausting. Lab reports are also very time consuming and harshly graded. Prepare to study a lot for a post lab quiz on your lab day (these quizzes can be hard and require some memorization). This course should be less time consuming because it is only a .5 credit course. Dr G would give us pre lab lectures to then repeat the same thing before conducting our lab.",
                "Weakness:\r\n- lots of work for a 0.5 credit course\r\n- takes more time than my full credit courses",
                "Strengths: I feel like the lab manuals were well equipped to allow students to learn about and understand the topics we were investigating in the lab. The labs were most of the time fun to do when they were not extensively long. I found being able to work with other people fun as well. The TFs were also very helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like sometimes there was an overwhelming amount of work to do in a week, with the postlab quizes at the beginning of lab, and prelab quizes due before lab. In addition, there was preparing for the lab by reading the manual and the weekly lab reports. Sometimes I felt like I couldn't really spend a lot of time understanding the lab, although all the materials were provided, because of the sheer amount of work to do. Sometimes the labs are really long and the lab reports are sometimes vague in what they are asking as well.",
                "There are so many different office hours to attend so that you can receive help. The quizzes are unnecessarily difficult. I do not know anyone who received a 100 on every single quiz or even close. The quizzes require you to memorize formulas and complexes, which is not something real scientist have to do. They become known through years of practice but they are not tested on the Arrhenius equation weekly. I never knew what to expect on an quiz, so they were near impossible to study for. The experiments were well designed, but I believe the assessments put a huge damper on taking the course. The lab reports were lengthy.",
                "The lab reports were highly work-intensive. They consumed much of my time, to the point that it started impacting my grades in other classes. I don't think that the course would lose any of its rigor or value if the lab reports were made less time-consuming.",
                "Weaknesses: Dr. G taught it",
                "The course had such a high workload with lab reports that included lots of graphs and analyses I felt weren't necessary. Also, the pre- and post-lab quizzes were very hard.",
                "Strengths include having good TF's to help during lab reports. Weaknesses is that the lab reports are very lengthy and require much time and effort.",
                "The amount of quizzes is a lot at times and can be very stressful. In addition, post-lab quizzes were often incredibly difficult despite studying.",
                "The strengths of this course are that Dr.G was very passionate about improving our knowledge in Chemistry and was very good at explaining concepts to us so that we understood what was happening in lab. Some weaknesses were that we sometimes had to have pre-lab quizzes, post-lab quizzes, and lab reports due on the same day in a week along with preparation for the new lab, and this could be quite stressful.",
                "The weaknesses of this course is that the instruction was lackluster. Unless the student did a lot of preparation with resources outside of the course and spent a excessive amount of time on the reports, they would do poorly.",
                "This course is much, much too much work for a 0.5 credit course. The expectations were insane and points were deducted for the most minor errors.",
                "I liked the format and how some labs were combined two week.",
                "Strength: Dr. G is fantastic, really emphasizes learning content. \r\nWeakness: length of prelab materials.",
                "Having the post-class quizzes be virtual.",
                "Excellent teaching by Dr. G, very detailed pre-lab guidance and very thorough post-lab quizzes.",
                "The strengths of this course is that we get experience in the lab. Past that most other aspects of the course are weaknesses. The lab reports were either way too long and took hours to complete, or they were super simple and left students wondering why the work couldn't have been more evenly split to avoid having too much workload in a given week. Also, many of my friends, including friends who had never done this before, had to stay up super late or even all night to finish the lab reports, especially the first lab report. We were expected to do really long and tedious lab reports with little guidance, and half way through the semester Dr. G made it so rubrics weren't available to TF's, so then we really had no guidance. In preparation for each lab we were required to read a multi page long lab manual and watch prelab lectures to understand what was going on and take. prelab quiz. The prelab quizzes were unnecessarily stressful and under strict time constraints. The post lab quizzes were under the same strict time constraints and on very specific material from the previous lab, sometimes taken weeks prior, that we were supposed to memorize without guidance on what specific part of the lab we were supposed to memorize. Most weeks many students bombed those quizzes. Dr. G would also at the start of the semester give lectures before the lab that were relevant, but extremely long winded which caused us to have to stay later to finish our labs which were already long and exhausting. In all, the workload for this class was entirely unnecessary, especially when considering that this is a half-credit class.",
                "Strengths of this class was how it forced me to actually study my lab manuals. I was less confused in lab as a result. I was also forced to look at my data and analyze them thoroughly through the use of making graphs and performing vigorous calculations. When I finished a lab report, I had to go back and learn the material for the post lab quiz. I found that this lab course was very hard but it required me to actually learn material and practice calculations. A weakness of this course was the workload. I found that this course was very work intensive. I spent more time on this class than my actual general chemistry lecture class.",
                "There were no real strengths. The course was WAY too difficult and time consuming for it to be a half credit course. The instructor was not very kind when asked for help. The TAs basically taught all of the material we were supposed to learn during the lab after class in office hours because it was virtually impossible to take this class and do well without significant aid.",
                "The experiments and time in lab is enjoyable but this course is very demanding for a 0.5 credits. It was often significantly more work than my 1.5 credit language course. I probably spent 15+ hours a week on this one class. Additionally, the scheduling of the assignments was not ideal. Various times in this course we were tested on experiments from a month previous. Having to study for such a quiz in addition to completing a lab report, studying for the lab quiz, and preparing for the next lab, was overwhelming. The post lab quizzes were not always helpful because they quizzed us on topics we had already gone over and practiced by completing the lab report. This lab course is more rigorous than gen chem 1 lab.  I think these issues could be improved by removing the post lab quizzes and in some cases, shortening the lab reports.",
                "There was too much work for a half credit",
                "Dr G was mean",
                "No strengths. It just caused a lot of stress and I feel like lab courses are supposed to help increase ones excitement to interact with\/engage with the subject its about. For 0.5 credits, I honestly felt overworked.",
                "The strengths of this course is how it augments our learning in general chemistry lecture and the opportunity we have to practice various lab techniques. The weaknesses are the heavy workload that doesnt match the amount of credits it is and the post-lab quizzes that go beyond measuring our understanding of experiments and ask obscure details that sometimes cant be found in the manual.",
                "The grading for lab reports was just too inconsistent within the TAs. The post lab quizzes had too much basis on memorization of the lab report itself, when the lab report would be do after the post lab quiz, so sometimes a student would not be able to effectively answer.",
                "Again, for a 0.5 course, its very demanding. I feel like it grades students on a basis that is pretty unfair considering last semester the A cutoff was a 98.2%!!! Like at that point everyone knows what theyre doing but this class is structured to be your typical premed weeder course.",
                "The postlab quizzes were, in my opinion, unnecessary.",
                "Good flexibility in response to sickness throughout the semester",
                "The Professor sucks. The labs were graded too hard. The TFs (minus Jana) also sucked.",
                "The main weekness was the difficulty of the course and focus on learning the material rather than performing the labs and experiments. I think that the structure of the course is very flawed with the pre and post lab quizzes and their difficulties\/content\/emphasis.",
                "the course was very organized but it was overly challenging in that the allotted hours per week dedicated to this class surpassed what the expectations of the half credit were. the guidelines for the lab reports were sparse in comparison to the expectations of the reports.",
                "Strengths were that we got a various range of laboratory skills that was very complementary to our general chemistry class; the postlab quizzes were quite hard and the lab report guidelines were very strict (as well as very long).",
                "One strength of this course is that the TAs are very helpful and are always willing to answer questions. The labs are also very interesting and we got to use many new techniques. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course is that it is a lot of work for only being 0.5 credits. Many weeks I found myself spending more time on lab than any of my other 1 credit classes. I also sometimes felt like even if I understood the concepts, I had to do a lot of rote memorization to do well on the quizzes. In order to improve this class, I would recommend that the information on the quizzes be more centered around problem solving instead of memorized information that we likely won't retain in the future.",
                "The actual experiments designed in this course are wonderful. On the other hand, the organization of laboratory assessments was not good.",
                "Sometimes certain steps of labs do not provide any useful information and seem somewhat superfluous. An example of this is in Experiment 9 where we had to conduct several tests and note down our physical observations, except that we were told what the results of each test should be, which basically made actually doing the tests pointless from the perspective of this class.",
                "I strongly disliked the structure of this course. The class was not designed to teach us anything - it felt as though it was meant to make us fail.",
                "There was a very high work load for this course, between pre-lab assignments, lab time, and post lab assignments.",
                "The course itself is fine. However, it is also rigorous. For only half a credit, the class is simply not worth the effort required. 2 assessments, a lab, and a lab report weekly constitutes much more than half a credit.",
                "The lab reports are ridiculous, the lab is too long, the TFs hate it and everyone is miserable. Literally an absurd amount of work and no benefits.",
                "A strength of the course is how hands-on it is. However, some major weaknesses to this course were that this course 1) was not conducive to learning without fear of grade (for me, it felt like every mistake I made wasn't an opportunity to learn but rather pressure as I considered how this would affect my grade) 2) was given a curve that might negatively affect people depending on the day of the week in which they had lab.",
                "Pre-class lectures were a waste of time. Class should be 1 credit",
                "The workload of this class is significant, more significant to me than a normal half credit class. I feel that the time I was putting into the course was almost equivalent to those of my other 1 credit courses. Another slight weakness of the course is that the labs performed are sometimes on material that wasn't covered at that point in time. The pre lab lectures help with this, but having gone over the content in the general chemistry class prior to the lab helped greatly in my understanding of the lab.",
                "Did not match up well with lecture course. Often ended up needing to know information and concepts that were not covered in the lecture course. I spent around 20 hours on each lab report, and attended office hours, often several times a week, and still struggled to perform well on post lab quizzes. All of this despite performing well above average in the lecture course.",
                "Strengths:\r\nCourse challenges you \r\nWeaknesses:\r\nPost lab quizzes are more about memorization than understanding.",
                "Strengths: aligned well with topics learned in class. Weaknesses: lots of unnecessary time commitments. Prelab lectures were extremely long and could be condensed into a fraction of the time. Labs often featured an additional component that had nothing to do with the lab, making us stay much longer than necessary. Lab reports had such complex requirements that required a lot of time to complete.",
                "The strengths of this class is that you will learn more about lab and workings of chemistry. The weaknesses of this class is that there is much memorization that seems unnecessary for lab.",
                "strengths: great resources from TFs\r\nweaknesses: high workload, more support on post lab quizzes",
                "Strengths: Pre-lab videos were very clear, the instructions on the lab manuals were very clear, TFs were very helpful\r\nWeaknesses: workload was insanely high, not enough instruction on lab reports",
                "Very fast paced, but fun and stressful",
                "A strength of the class was the TAs and their helpfulness. A major weakness of the class is the poor teaching setup of the class. The professor demands too much memorization of random information while providing zero understanding towards students.",
                "Strengths: in-depth lab manuals and pre-lab videos. I was able to engage with each experiment deeply. Weaknesses: some post-lab quizzes tested us on memorization, which is not a great indicator of understanding.",
                "Strengths- Working with lab equipment\r\nWeaknesses- Inability to speak with the professor without being berated or feeling like we're stupid for asking the question. Extremely harsh grading system, rude TA's, difficult pre and post lab quizzes with no opportunity to study for them so we all end up failing them anyways, the list goes on",
                "The course is extremely redundant. There are too many grading tools that evaluate the same knowledge over and over. For instance, there was a pre-lab quiz, a lab report, and a post-lab quiz to evaluate the same knowledge about a particular experiment. This is a huge weakness since it makes the course feel repetitive. It makes the course feel like a slog and kills almost every intention to learn.",
                "Id like more guidance on the lab reports since they make up the majority of our grade.",
                "The strengths of this course was how for the most part it aligned with the CHEM 165 which helped understand the material more. The weakness was the great emphasis on the pre and post lab quizzes and having to really put in a lot of time into making sure many of the little details of an experiment were known as well as how to solve every single example problem from the manuals.",
                "Strengths of the course were that the subject material aligned well with chem165 so it helped me understand the material better. The weaknesses was that weighted distribution of grades did not make sense. The pre lab and post lab quizzes had a significant impact on your grade even though you spent way more timeon the 50 point lab reports. The work load was also much higher than a lot of my other classes even though lab was only 0.5 credits.",
                "There was a very high workload for the course which required a lot of time committed when the course is only worth half a credit. This course probably had the highest workload of all of my classes and none of said work could be done during the provided class period. having less quizzes, lectures to watch, questions to type up, or experiments to complete would help lower the workload to be more reasonable.",
                "This course was way too much work for a .5 credit class. I had more work for this class than my 1.5 credit class. The instructor was rude and condescending to his students, and when we requested he make some minor changes, he proceeded to say that Yale students aren't of the same caliber we used to be. The feedback we were given seemed to have no purpose other than to make us upset with ourselves, and didn't offer any ways of improvement. The workload needs to be reduced and the instructor needs to learn how to be at the very least tolerant of some mistakes.",
                "The strengths were developing lab skills and being able to better understand the material covered in lecture by learning the material in a different way and from a different professor. This course can be improved with the post lab quizzes. These quizzes required memorization of unnecessary information such as the chemical formula for a large molecule and intricate chemical reactions. Additionally, it could be improved if the grading criteria for the lab reports was more clear.",
                "This course was simply overly rigorous and I felt like much of the grading, especially on lab reports was somewhat unfair",
                "The strengths was that it really enhanced my chemistry knowledge and the lab itself wasnt too much. The con was probably that the high work load took a bit getting used to and was a bit stressful. However, it was nice that Dr.G was always willing to help.",
                "Sometimes, the material in this course did not align with the gen chem course. As a result, we were expected to learn about material that we did not have proper exposure to yet. There also was not a lot of assistance that we could access outside of the course.",
                "The length of many lab reports seemed to be very excessive. I believe the workload could be reduced significantly by the instructor. However, I did learn a lot of chemistry in the end of this class due to the sheer amount of time I spent studying for the quizzes and completing lab reports.",
                "Way too much work for a half credit class",
                "Strengths were the pre lab lectures. Weakness was the postlab quizzes and the harshness of the grading.",
                "Weaknesses: post-lab quizzes felt pointless, sometimes like you were supposed to just memorize the manual, even small details that weren't relevant to the purpose of the experiment. Prelab videos were long and sometimes redundant.",
                "Strengths: helped teach a lot of chemistry concepts\r\nWeaknesses: too great of a workload for a .5 credit class. \r\nHow it could be improved: Either increase the amount of credits given for the class to match the workload or decrease workload (make the pre\/post lab quizzes similar to those given Im Chem 134L).",
                "I found the experiments to be engaging and they taught me a number of concepts that I had only explored in class. However, the lab writeups (esp LAB 1\/2) were incredibly tedious and much more work than last semster. Also, the postlab quizzes were a nightmare and required intensive studying and essentially memorization of the manuel. Review beforehand!!!! In no way was this a half credit course. Any week you have a lab report due is automaticallly a hell week.",
                "I enjoyed the pre-lab briefings in the beginning of the semester. I found them very helpful and a good overview of the lab material. The labs however were very long and complicated. I wish they could've been shortened or we were shown a demonstration on how to properly do the lab so it could run smoothly.",
                "Strengths: TAs were great, experiments can be interesting, curve is *probably* better than in Chem 134L; but honestly the TAs (see below) were the best part of Chem Lab and their dedication made the class a whole lot better, they deserve a lot of credit for their time and care for us students \r\nWeaknesses: This course is brutally difficult and busy - you can have prelab quizzes, postlab quizzes, and lab reports all due within a day. All three are incredibly difficult, time consuming, and unpredictable. The quizzes in particular can be brutally difficult and time restrictive. The mood\/culture of the class is toxic, tense, and competitive. The class ends up becoming a battle of attrition, where you and your classmates are distinguished based on how far youre willing to go to beg TAs for answers and how many hours youre willing to prepare for quizzes and lab reports.",
                "This course is just a really awful experience when taken in tandem with CHEM 167. The curriculums do not line up so its double the work. The last time I had seen topics covered in CHEM 136L was junior year of high school during AP Chem because the Adv Gen Chem track does not cover that stuff. I did not have time to relearn AP Chem because I am a spring season athlete so that resulted in me failing almost every single quiz. The quizzes are just ridiculous too, they are too heavily based upon memorization. I wish they had been more conceptual. All memorization questions are not good measures of learning.",
                "The course has a high workload, which means you are forced to have a very detailed understanding of the lab and the science behind it. However, I thought a lot of the work was just excessive, like having to take a pre-lab AND a post-lab quiz for each lab - doesn't it make more sense to just have one quiz per lab? Also, Dr. G expected us to watch the pre-lab lecture before we came into lab, but then he gave basically the same pre-lab lecture when we came in - which I'm glad he stopped doing mid-way through the semester after a student complained. Other than that the course was fine, but it was just frustrating to have such an excessive workload, especially for only a 0.5 credit course.",
                "This course is extremely difficult and much to time consuming for a 0.5 credit class. I often spent more time on work for this class than chemistry lecture. A lot of the assignments were very redundant. We were asked to watch pre-lab lecture videos before coming into lab, but then we would also be given an in-person lecture on the same information that lasted 30min-1 hour. This took away from the time we were actually doing work in the lab. A lot of the procedures we performed in lab required more trials than were necessary and sometimes seemed to combine two seemingly unrelated experiments into one. Both the pre-lab and post-lab quizzes were unnecessarily difficult and required thorough studying of the lecture videos and lab manuals each week, which often took 2-3 hours. The lab reports were graded very strictly and points were deducted for even the smallest mistake. This necessitated me spending about 2 hours just checking each lab report for minor errors after it was fully completed. This course could be improved by structuring it more similarly to CHEM 134L, which was a more resonable course in all aspects.",
                "The biggest strength of the course was Dr. Ganapathi's enthusiasm for teaching chemistry. However, the workload and grading policies made the course onerous to the point of being difficult to learn. Especially for a course worth only a half credit, the lab reports took an unreasonable amount of time to complete, and much of this time was spent trying to word and format the reports to adhere to the rigid grading rubrics, rather than actually trying to understand the concepts.",
                "One of the weaknesses of this course was that it was not tailored to student learning, but rather how well a student could simply memorize the content of the week. The pre-lab quizzes did not help me and were rather just there to affect my grade."

                "You likely have to take this course anyway, so here are tips to actually succeed: 1. During the first week of classes, go to every TF's office hours throughout the week and figure out which TFs are most helpful in answering your questions. 2. Start the lab reports the DAY you get out of lab and email Dr. G. with any questions you have about how to do things. 3. Actually watch the prelab lectures and take careful notes -- anything that gets repeated more than once usually is important to know! 4. Study the lab manual the night before for the postlab quizzes. The class is not difficult if you manage your time appropriately and spend a little time each day throughout the week to spread out the workload. When you're not pulling an all-nighter to do the lab report (I never had to!) this class becomes so much more enjoyable and you get to focus on actually learning chemistry and can appreciate how much time and effort Dr. G puts into the class.",

                "Absolutely not. If you are in this course, you are probably taking it because it is a prereq, and I still can't recommend the course. You will be stressed out, confused, and exhausted throughout the semester.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student to supplement understanding in gen chem II lecture!",
                "Definitely not. This 0.5 credit course required more hours of work than my 1.5 credit course. I would only suggest taking this class if it is absolutely necessary. For instance, if it is a requirement for a major or if the student is pre-med.",
                "Only if it is a major requirement or prerequisite.",
                "Yes, if necessary. However, I hope the proper adjustments are made for this course so that the environment is easier for students to learn.",
                "No, unless premed\/stem major.",
                "I feel like this class gets a really bad rep, but it could honestly be much worse than what it is. The workload is not very high, just make sure you start working on the lab reports with combined experiments ahead of time. The grading on the lab reports is definitely not lenient, but I wouldn't say it's overly harsh. The pre-lab and post-lab quizzes are harder than they were in chem 134L, which can make the change very daunting. Unless this class is a requirement, I wouldn't go out of my way to take it, but it's not as bad as people make it out to be.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student pursuing chemistry. While it is a more difficult lab then Chem 136L, Dr. G throws no curveballs. Every question he asks on quizzes and labs can be found in the course material. The class is hardwork, but manageable.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who will continue to pursue a chemistry related degree. You will learn a lot of skills, but this course is definitely a step up from 134. You have to be prepared to spend a solid amount preparing for postlab quizzes and writing the lab reports.",
                "I would recommend this course only if it is a requirement for their major.",
                "No. It was a course that was difficult not because of the content but because of the structure, so the wasted hours on lab reports (probably 6-12 hours per report) and studying for pre and post lab quizzes felt completely unnecessary. Everyone I know who took this class neither enjoyed it nor felt like they were learning much, and were only taking it as a pre med or major requirement",
                "No. Unless it is a required class.",
                "I would recommend it only if it is required, but I would highly recommend trying to place out by placing into organic chemistry.",
                "No, but you probably have to take it as requirement of your major if you are even looking at this. The class has a very high workload but is certainly manageable, so do not worry too much. Go to office hours for help on the lab reports",
                "This is a required course for the premedical track. While it is very time consuming and difficult, it is doable! Best of luck :)",
                "Not unless you need it as a requirement.",
                "No unless absolutely necessary or the course changes.",
                "This course is very difficult and requires lots of worknot necessarily because the information is overly challenging but because the course is structured so that you need to constantly work on long study guides (to be expected for a lab course) as well as prelab quizzes, post lab quizzes, prelab lectures, videos of the lab procedure, and studying the lab manual. This takes so much time, so come into this course prepared for this.",
                "No",
                "Only if you are super committed to the major \/ premed track. It is a ton of work. Dont expect it to be easy. If you commit, it will definitely be rewarding.",
                "If you dont have to take this course, dont. Dr G is very intimidating and the course is very time consuming.",
                "Yes, if you understand chem. It's a hard course and definitely has a lot of work, but is enjoyable if you like the material.",
                "I think if a student has to take gen chem lab as a requirement, it will give good exposure. It would be a good course to take if you are not that worried about the higher workload. If you have a heavy schedule already however, it might be stressful to take this course at the same time even though it is interesting.",
                "You have to if you are pre-med. I would only recommend otherwise if you have a LOT of time on your times and want to go into some sort of research.",
                "No.",
                "Only if it is necessary for their future career.",
                "Yes only if you have to take it.",
                "Only if you have to take it. Workload was very high and quizzes are frequent and difficult",
                "I would not recommend this course. The only reason I took it is because it is a major requirement.",
                "Only take it if you have to",
                "No, I would not. It was too much work.",
                "Yes it was interesting and hands on",
                "Yes - great to reinforce gen chem topics.",
                "Yes, I truly learned a lot about chemistry from this course in a hands-on way. Many of the concepts I have learned will be sticking with me for many years to come.",
                "I would only recommend this course if they absolutely needed it for a requirement for their major or premed. Nobody should take this course if they don't have to. It honestly felt that taking this course was a primarily a test of how much of a beating we were willing to put ourselves through.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because for many biology and chemistry majors, this class is a pre-requisite.",
                "No. Absolutely not. If Dr. G is teaching you should take it off sequence. I know there is the whole group identity thing where you want to take a class at the same time ass all your friends and you dont want to get behind and so on, but take a different class in the spring. Seriously.",
                "Only take this course if you have to or if your idea of a good time is dedicating your time and soul to this chemistry lab. Multiple people in my lab section dropped the course because it was often not manageable.",
                "Only if required",
                "No unless its required",
                "Unless you absolutely have to take this class, do not take it. It is so tedious, curves down so significantly, and I don't feel I learned much at all.",
                "No",
                "No. The amount of time I had to put into this course made me lose sleep and detracted from my engagement in other classes",
                "If this is a requirement for you, I would recommend taking the course. If it isnt, I would suggest finding a lab course that has a workload that matches the 0.5 credit weight. This course had a workload that was greater than some of my 1.0 credit classes and was one of my least favorite classes this semester .",
                "Very high workload, but do able. You would think it is a one credit course with the expectation of depth of the reports.",
                "I would not recommend this course because there was a lot of busy, and it felt like the class wasnt set up to help me learn but rather to just give me an excessive amount of work.",
                "Its manageable because you get used to the rigor eventually but it might wreck your gpa if youre not dedicated to it",
                "I would not, unless required by they are required to take the class.",
                "I would NEVER recommend to this course to another student unless absolutely necessary for the major or for pre-med. beware of Dr. G!!!!!",
                "I would only recommend this course if someone wants to go to medical school or would need this course as a prerequisite. Otherwise I would not.",
                "no, unless they are a premed student as part of their requirements. I believe that this class was simply impossible to pass without peer collaboration with lab reports and the labs themselves.",
                "Yes, it is a good way to develop lab skills",
                "I would not recommend this course to a student unless they have the time to make this class one of their top priorities. The lab reports and quizzes took up a lot of my time, and I sometimes barely had time time for other class' assignments.",
                "Take this course only if you have to.",
                "I would recommend it if they really needed the course as a prerequisite. I do not think I would recommend taking for fun.",
                "Not unless its required.",
                "This course is a large workload, but if a student is interested in running experiments relating to the knowledge they are learning in Chemistry lecture I would recommend this course to them.",
                "If not enrolled in pre-med courses or a chemistry related major, I cannot recommend this course. It is too much work for too little payoff.",
                "Do not take this class. It ruined my semester and almost made me change my career path (which is the point). It is awful.",
                "This course does teach some valuable skills; however, it requires much more time than a 0.5 credit, so I would plan accordingly. In addition to the actual content, I believe that half of the grade to this class is meticulousness.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Although it is more work than I had originally anticipated, I did gain valuable laboratory experience that will help in the future. I also feel that instructors make themselves available to help students.",
                "Absolutely not. Confusing content and extremely stressful.",
                "Because of the workload, I would just recommend this course to students who need the credit.",
                "I would only require this class if it is required.",
                "I would not recommend this course to other students unless it is absolutely necessary.",
                "Overall, I would not. I believe that this class presented many challenges that could have been easily avoided while maintaining the same amount of rigor and teaching opportunities.",
                "Only if it is a requirement for your major or medical school, otherwise the workload is too much compared to what I got out of this class",
                "I would recommend if you are a chemistry major or interested in chemistry as a future career.",
                "No. The professor ruins the experience and makes me unable to recommend the class.",
                "I would recommend the course because it taught me to appreciate the laboratory.",
                "Absolutely not, unless you want to ruin your day by going into this lab spare yourself the mental headache and take it over the summer or drop whatever major requires you to take this lab. Its not worth it",
                "Unless you have to take this, don't take the lab because it is unnecessarily stressful and workload takes more than 10 hours per week for only 0.5 credits. The instructor is unsympathetic and harsh for no reason. Overall, many students dropped this course after the first week.",
                "No unless you have to take it for your major. There are better uses for your time.",
                "Only if it is required for your major or for pre med.",
                "No I would not recommend this course because it was a lot of work for half of a credit and was supplementary to chemistry lecture. While the chem lab skills gained are appreciated, I don't think it was worth it.",
                "No, not if you have to take it with Dr. G. The course itself was not bad, and the content wasn't extremely difficult, but the level of specificity we were expected to memorize and write back down for a grade was just stupid. Requiring me to memorize something does not help me learn. I would rather be asked to apply a concept to a situation then memorize minute details. This class was so stressful for a half credit, and it's not worth it with this instructor",
                "If a student does not need this course for Premed or their respective major, I would not recommend taking it. It is too much work for half a credit and required me to study for two quizzes a week and complete a lab report that takes a lot of time.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless it's required for your major",
                "if it is required for their major\/career",
                "Yes, but only its required",
                "No it was an awful course. The workload was insane and the professor assumed that the students knew how to use Excel and certain lab instruments when he shouldve taken the time to teach people of all levels in a polite and clear manner.",
                "I would not take this course unless it was required for my major.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but I believe there are many changes that can be made to further benefit future students, such as consideration of the heavy workload that currently exists. There were weeks when I spent upwards of 15 hours on this course OUTSIDE of lab (going through the manual, studying for the pre-lab and post-lab quizzes, and completing the lab report), which far exceeded the 3-5 hours per week expected of a 0.5 credit course (per Yale's course load policies).",
                "Nope. Way too much work, dont do it unless its a prerequisite. Chem labs at Yale just dont teach you that much and theres way too much focus on the lab reports which basically get graded on how well you can count sigfigs and label your graphs. You dont learn much because more of your time is spent on tedious busy work.",
                "Not unless you really like chemistry and I'd take it with other courses with a less demanding workload to balance it out because this lab will take up quite a bit of your time.",
                "No i would never recommend this course to another unless they needed it.",
                "Yes, only because this class is usually a requirement for a major\/pre-med.",
                "I found the experiments to be engaging and they taught me a number of concepts that I had only explored in class. However, the lab writeups (esp LAB 1\/2) were incredibly tedious and much more work than last semster. Also, the postlab quizzes were a nightmare and required intensive studying and essentially memorization of the manuel. Review beforehand!!!! In no way was this a half credit course. Any week you have a lab report due is automaticallly a hell week.",
                "Yes I would because although it can seem very difficult, I think it's a god learning experience an Dr. G genuinely cares about chemistry and the students. Working with him in office hours taught me more chemistry than in the general chemistry lecture course.",
                "I would NOT recommend this course unless youre 100% sure that you want to do pre-med or major in a science that requires this course. This course is so difficult, arbitrary, chaotic, and stressful that it almost completely ruins the fun in chemistry and conducting experiments. Even if you do ok in this course, the brain drain and time wasted on this course is more than enough to ruin a semester or your ambitions in science!",
                "Not unless its mandatory. The workload is just ridiculous and this class definitely had a poor impact on my mental health. The lab reports are just too long. The learning goals of the class can be achieved with much less workload. This needs to be prioritized because learning is sacrificed due to sheer volume of work.",
                "No unless you have to take it.",
                "Yes but only if they must (ie chem major or premed)... and are ready to be very proactive about their learning... do NOT take Monday lab (:",
                "No, I would not recommend this course to another student because it requires a huge time commitment for only 0.5 credit. I also did not learn much from this course, all of the time spent on it was just revision of small details that are not important to the understanding of chemistry.",
                "Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this course to another student. While the labs themselves could be interesting, and often illustrated important and fascinating chemistry concepts, I often found the labs to be tedious and long. The lab reports, in addition to preparing for multiple quizzes per week, gave the course an unreasonable workload for a half credit (or even a full credit) course. Ultimately, I spent more time trying to fit my work to the grading rubrics than understanding difficult concepts.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless their major requires it.",
                "NO! Do not take this course if you absolutely don't have to. This class was one of the reasons why I decided to switch out of the MCDB major."
