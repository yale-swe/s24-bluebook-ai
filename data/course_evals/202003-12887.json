                "Strengths- Dr. Daz is the best professor that I have had at Yale. He knows how to teach, he is a nice guy, and he cares about his student's success. He wants to see his students learn the language, and that really makes all the difference. Thank you Dr. Daz! \r\n\r\nWeakness- Some of the assignments were a bit unclear and the due dates were a bit shady. However, the course was taught perfectly and all the exams were fair and graded fairly.",
                "strengths: lots of practice both on your own and with others\r\nweaknesses: a lot of work was assigned that was never gone over, so it was hard to learn from doing it since you never knew when you made mistakes, there were a lot of additional things on canvas on top of what was on the syllabus, so it was difficult to figure out what needed to be done, the constant breakout rooms during class got monotonous and I think we could have benefited from more variety in learning",
                "Overall the focus of the class on actually practicing Spanish and listening was useful. I thought more of a focus on Hispanic culture would have been helpful to contextualize the language more. Additionally, the administration of some important assignments was quite clunky. I regularly felt deprived of the full time allotted for quizzes and exams and considering that many of the exams were difficult (excessively so in my opinion) to finish within the time provided it was quite a challenge to lose 3-5 minutes at the beginning of classes.",
                "The syllabus was very detailed but somehow unclear. There was a plethora of material which is helpful but overwhelming.",
                "While certainly different online, I liked how Prof. Diaz handled this course. Not having synchronous classes every day of the week was helpful in managing my time and being able to learn at my own pace and review other material I needed to. While there would sometimes be confusion on what assignments were due when, a quick email to Prof. Diaz would always quickly clear that up and having a section group chat was also great to make sure you were on the same page as everyone. In all definitely a good course to improve your Spanish and I thought Prof. Diaz was good in the online format.",
                "It could be improved with less quizzes about readings, although a strength is wrapping information from multiple lessons into the tests."

                "I'm not sure if this is caused by the move online or if this is normal for L3, but as the class is, I don't think I would recommend it. It felt a lot less organized than L1 and L2 spanish and generally more overwhelming due to that lack of clear organization.",
