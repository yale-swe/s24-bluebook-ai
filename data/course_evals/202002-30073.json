    "I learned about the history of Hollywood from its early beginnings to the modern studio. I learned the numbers and stats behind the business and the trends that led it to be where it is today.",
    "I gained knowledge of the film business industry and its history. We learned how the current major studios got established and how they expanded their power throughout technological advances. We learned how these advances changed the industry and how satisfying consumers has had to adapt.",
    "From this course, I gained knowledge of both the history and current process of Hollywood, as well as necessary background on how television and streaming, among other technologies, have affected the development of the business.",
    "I learned about the history of hollywood and a lot about how business works, particularly monopolies and different levels of integration.",
    "History of film industry + future prospects. Very thorough coursework and engaging final project!"

   "comments": [
    "This course greatly benefited from the quality of the prerecorded lectures. These were efficient and effective methods through which to transmit information. The readings and live lecture expanded on the information presented in meaningful ways. The course showed a good progression through the different time periods. Nothing felt too fast or too unmanageable.",
    "Strengths are that it is a thorough history and truly pulls back the curtain to the film business industry. Weaknesses are that it is purely lecture and there is not much engagement with students.",
    "The biggest strength the course was the breadth of information that it covered. The lack of day-to-day homework assignments also allowed for more time to really absorb the information and to work on the final essay. One major weakness was that the out-of-class readings & videos and the synchronous lectures felt repetitive. Specifically, Zoom class used the exact same Powerpoints as the video lectures that we were supposed to watch before class, and a lot of the information was just being repeated word for word. The class also almost never ended on time, which led me to lose focus near the end of class. I also did not like the partnered format of the final essay, especially since communication is more difficult when you can't talk to the person as you walk out of class, having instead to send emails that may or may not get a prompt response. I also think that the class could have been more interactive.",
    "The strengths of this class were the readings, all very interesting. The professor is very nice and the way assignments are structured (with just a paper and two exams counting toward the final grade) gave me room to focus on learning the content. The pre-recorded lectures were very well organized. \r\n\r\nThe weakness was that if you go into this class knowing nothing about business or economics, you'll probably find yourself a bit lost. I wish the Professor would have given an intro to certain business and economic concepts that I had been totally unfamiliar with.",
    "I think the main weakness of this course was the lack of overall interaction with the professor and fellow students.  The online zoom format really reduced the interaction that helps one maintain enthusiasm for the material throughout the course.  I found the pre-recorded lectures were excellent and informative and made the live lectures somewhat redundant.  I feel that if we are restricted to online courses until the pandemic era is over, the course would be better if the live lectures were more focused on interaction given that the same material is covered by the pre-recorded lectures.",
    "The course is really interesting and is updated pretty much daily to keep up with current events and trends, so the information feels really pertinent. It can be hard to keep up with all of the readings, but you'll do just fine even if you have to skip a couple.",
    "No weaknesses. Professor Johnson did a great job!"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course in a heartbeat. This was a great and highly informative course that offered all of the information and insight I was hoping to get out of it. Nearly all aspects of the business from the major studios, to indie films, to streaming were covered. The instructor even slightly altered the course in order to keep it as up to date as possible.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student studying film or very interested in the business behind it. However, if you are only somewhat interested or not at all and looking for an easy credit, you will find this course not engaging.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student that is interested in working in any aspect of the film industry.",
    "Yes! Really interesting and absolutely necessary if you want to market yourself as an actor, filmmaker, producer, etc and want to know what you're going into. The Professor is really there if you need anything at all.",
    "Definitely. The material covered in this course is not only interesting, but the application of what we learned into our final project was especially rewarding."
