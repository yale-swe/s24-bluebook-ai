If you are a History of Art major, which you certainly do not have to be to take this course, you learn how to do a formal analysis specifically on sculpture. Because it is also traditionally a 'lesser' form of art, this course certainly teaches you how to appreciate sculpture too.",
                "How to understand the dilemma between the artist and their artwork, and more importantly how to separate the two. Questions of race and sex and discrimination in sculpture were answered and explored.",
                "I leave this course with a rich understanding of a century of change in the world of sculpture and having been introduced to the period's most celebrated artists. I highly recommend the class to anyone interested in the discipline of art history, though particularly those eager to shore up their sculptural bona fides."

                "I've taken several History of Art courses at Yale and this is the most comfortable I've felt. There was a small group of us, but the intimacy allowed really involved discussions. There was never any judgment and everyone was supportive of one another. There are many readings but they are interesting and informative. There's also a good balance in class between discussing the readings, formal elements, and opinions. Being able to visit the galleries are of course always a plus. Our lectures by the curators were incredible.",
                "Truly an exceptional course on all accounts! The readings are insightful, complementary, and build on each other beautifully. Professor Ferando offers encouraging feedback and ensures that all students contribute to class discussions. This course is perhaps most outstanding for its size (five students total in Fall 2021) which produced a tight-knit cohort of students who shared freely. Of course, much credit is due to the academic environment Professor Ferando took great care to foster.",

                "Yes, if you are interested in sculpture and open to learning about new artists and techniques.",
                "Absolutely take this course! The content, professor, and class size really facilitate learning. You will want to get involved and will look forward to gallery visits, especially. The workload mainly gears you towards one large research paper at the end which will feel rewarding and also make the large workload at the end of the semester lighter if you put in the work throughout it. You do not have to be a History of Art major at all.",
                "YES YES YES!!! The content is so engaging and Professor Ferando cares so much about what she teaches and her students. You are learning about race and sex in the context of art and sculpture. This was my first art history class and it was definitely so worth taking it! The intimate seminar setting helps you grow and take advantage of talking to your professor and peers about concepts that are new to you. You also get to visit the YUAG or the YBCA every week which helps you apply the knowledge you gain in the classroom.",
                "Add this course to your worksheet immediately! Hands-down one of my favorite classes at Yale and a wonderful experience for students of all levels of familiarity with art history. Don't be dissuaded by the course number! Professor Ferando is tremendously accommodating and always willing to help!",
                "Yes absolutely! Professor Ferando was outstanding and so was the interesting. I loved going to class, and it felt like an incredibly safe space to learn and discuss."
