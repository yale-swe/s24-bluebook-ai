    "I feel like I am now able to carry out a conversation in French for a lot longer and with better vocabulary than I was before taking this course.",
    "I feel that my french skills and ability to speak the language have vastly improved.",
    "I obtained a better understanding of the French language in terms of grammar, syntax, and vocabulary.",
    "I learned to speak some more french",
    "Language skills, for one, and an appreciation for learning the language itself regardless of grades. The work ethic the hours of homework forced me to develop was also invaluable.",
    "This course solidified many aspects of the french language that a high school education wasn't able to do. The relevance of the lessons and enthusiasm of the professor made the class fun and insightful."

   "comments": [
    "Given how high school French classes often emphasis grammar over speaking and listening, I feel that one of the strengths of French at Yale is that it does the opposite. Grammar rules are largely learned through homework and are clarified in class. That being said, it does require more work to make sure you're up to par on all of the grammar rules before taking tests.",
    "We spend a lot of time talking and conversing with our partners, but I feel that it would be a lot better if we conversed with a teacher or another more experienced person because I really do not feel that I improved much talking with my partners.",
    "The class was wonderful in giving me a more firm grasp of the french culture and language but I felt that the workload was somewhat excessive.",
    "The high level of engagement required in the classroom setting was a strength. Engaging in conversations in French helped me make use of the grammar rules we just learned while also giving me the confidence to speak French more frequently. However, although the French in Action videos were useful, workbook assignments were often overwhelming.",
    "Weaknesses\r\nHomework doesnt help for the tests and takes too much time. I would rather just study the textbook than be graded on useless homework.\r\n\r\nStrengths\r\nProfessor Hugonny was great\r\nSmall class size",
    "The only weakness of the course was that the textbook would often interfere with the insightful lessons the professor would come up with. Most often these lessons were more engaging and made learning the language easier than that of the textbook."

   "comments": [
    "Yes it's a great class!",
    "YES! This course is a lot of work, but if you're prepared to stick with it diligently, I believe you will see improvements in your speaking, listening, and writing.",
    "Yes! I love French and feel that learning new languages is an incredibly important aspect of one's education.",
    "I would recommend but with a caveat. French at Yale is one of the more difficult languages and just because you did well in high school french does not correlate to doing well in Yale French classes",
    "Yes, if you are interested in French but arent thoroughly proficient in the language, this class could serve as a great foundation.",
    "Yes, it teaches you French well."
