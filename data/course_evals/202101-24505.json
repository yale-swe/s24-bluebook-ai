                "I absolutely LOVE the mastery-based grading and learning system for this course. It makes so much sense in preparing us for life, where we will likely be able to work hard at something and gain mastery over time. It is so less stressful than other courses, where your grade is just one midterm and one final. I wish every course was graded this way!!\r\n\r\nThe only hard part is that we didn't really have enough time in the last couple of weeks to get through all of the material, making the assessments more difficult. One topic, in particular, we didn't go over at all in class. But, I think in normal years this isn't the case. COVID is weird!!",
                "If I were to take this class again, I would want to work on/ walk through together more related problem types in class, especially those that appear in the psets.",
                "Again, the strengths of this course are the multiple opportunities to show knowledge of the skills learned throughout the year, so that each person could focus on studies and various points and learn at their own rates. I used the tutors to my advantage to focus on anything that I was struggling with, and not just the lesson that was taught that particular week. It really helped me learn calculus much better. The only improvements I would want would be in person class (LOL).",

                "I am not sure if mastery learning is new because of the pandemic, but it should be more widely used! \r\nJamboard personally did not help engage the class, it is difficult to \"write\" on, depends on what electronic devices students have access to. \r\nLive virtual lectures are okay, class duration was just right for me.",
