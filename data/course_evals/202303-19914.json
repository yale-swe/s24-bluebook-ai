As a composer and songwriter who has heard lots of lessons about the \"right\" way to create lyrics, it was really good for me to take a course about medieval lyrics, which of course exist beyond our own particular expectations and conventions of what a \"lyric\" should be. I learned that medieval lyrics don't have to rhyme, scan, or do any of the \"things\" we expect. They were written on mugs, walls, and the margins of textbooks. They were deeply sensory, multilingual, diverse, and idiosyncratic. Moreover, often feminist, irreligious, humorous, enigmatic, and/or alchemical... In addition to learning that there is not a \"right\" way to write, there is no single \"right\" way to read, and medieval lyrics necessitate ways of readings that are often beaten out of us by school, like sounding out words and staring really really hard at parchment."

                "Cool course. Well structured. Too much reading. Never really got the importance of reading medieval poetry besides its fun to look back at manuscripts from the past.",
                "Lots of strengths. I think the course is structured very well. I loved the breadth and depth of (largely unexpected) readings each week and people's excellent responses to them. I liked that class sessions were organized around discussion, but found it often stagnated or then revolved around the same few people who tried to fill in the gaps, which is always a bummer. I also really loved the latitude we were given with the midterm and final projects. This is the only English class I've taken here besides some good essaywriting seminars, and I'm really glad I did because it was as interdisciplinary and rich as I hoped. If I could wish for any one improvement, it would be for one or two more class visits to the Beinecke! :) That was so fun."

I'd recommend seeing if the first class or two leave you asking lots of questions -- that's a good indication your curiosity will motivate you through this course, which is necessary in a course like this where you can largely \"choose your own adventure.\""
