    "It's a good layout for a course, with the units designed around cities keeping things interesting. The Essays were also a good way to measure skill. \r\nThe tests often felt unrelated to the chapter, but I'm not really sure how that could be fixed.",
    "The material is pretty fun and outside work is challenging but not a burden. That said, tests are all but impossible to study for, given that half of them are taken up by listening and reading activities, which are entirely dependent on you being proficient in German, not knowing a particular set of vocabulary or a piece of grammar.",
