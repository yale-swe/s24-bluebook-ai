                "Strengths: low workload. Weaknesses: the class gives an unfair amount of advantage to people with perfect pitch.",
                "Strengths: The class was relatively low workload and not stressful. I also genuinely improved in my aural skills abilities\r\n.\r\nWeaknesses: We would often start class 5-10 minutes late and not get through the material we needed to cover that day. We would also often repeat exercises that weren't as useful to aural skills. For example, we spent way too much time on octave identification in isolation rather than practicing dictation and how octave identification is used in context. The class came from a wide range of backgrounds, so the professor would often have to explain very simple music theory concepts that I thought were prereqs for the course. I had taken AP Music Theory before this course, and I felt bored in class a lot since we would spend so much time on how to read notes on a grand staff, which was supposedly a prereq for the course. It did not really feel like a 200-level course because of this, and some more advanced concepts were glossed over. The tests also did not feel very representative of what we learned in class (the class was asking what the difference between seventh chords were during the final, which was one of the concepts tested), and the extra credit on the exams was entirely dependent on having prior knowledge of inversions that we had never talked about in class. I also expected to learn more about improvisation since it was on the syllabus, but we barely covered it.",
                "less nitpicky with grades, more opportunity for grade improvement",
                "Strengths: great for practicing aural skills, good activities for practice, assessments matched the material and pace of the course. Weaknesses: the class times were short and sometimes it felt like not a ton was covered in the amount of time that we hadI would have appreciated a little bit of a faster pace during the class times themselves.",
                "It was a pretty engaging class and didn't jump from topic to topic",
                "Strengths: small class size and welcoming environment made it easier to learn new skills, and I appreciate that the class accommodates a range of abilities. Weaknesses: somewhat unstructured, and a lack of clear goals sometimes made it difficult to know what to practice."

I took this class as a senior majoring in economics, and it really pushed me out of my comfort zone. This class teaches skills that have to be practiced, and the amount of material there was to learn and practice felt a bit insurmountable. However, I improved a lot throughout the course, and I am very glad that I now have a better music theory foundation!"
