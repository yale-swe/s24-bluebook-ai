   "comments": [
    "You really learn to see beyond socially constructed borders on what is considered \"Asia.\" Professor Siu's instruction on theory and how she built on this with real world examples and literature was just so helpful as a student.",
    "I learned how to think of Asia as interconnected and fluid rather than bounded and static. Each week we discussed different topics that spanned a wide range of places and time periods, each one contributing to a more nuanced, complicated understanding of Asia.",
    "I gained deeper anthropological skills to better analyze trends and scenarios.",
    "We did indeed learn about cultures and markets in Asia in this course, but we learned so much more! Prof Siu really sought to break down the paradigms and mindsets we have that restrict or bias the ways we think about Asia and honestly about the world such as the tendency to have very Eurocentric points of view or the idea of Asia as simply a geographical landmass, static and unchanging. Prof Siu's approach combined both history and anthropology to inform our views of the world, and this class really just stretched and challenged my mind in so many ways!",
    "I learned a lot about shifting the point of view from seeing socio-economic phenomenon through Western lenses of interpretation to focusing on the locality and historical context of cultures and markets."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course leaned on the lecture side of a seminar but Professor Siu was such a good lecturer that it woudl be hard to complain about that. Some of the readings were intense and dry, but this was co-listed as a grad seminar so it is to be expected.",
    "The structure of the course, including the topics covered and the readings for each week, were very helpful to developing a more understanding of Asia. I appreciated the depth with which we engaged with each reading, discussing its main points, strengths, and weaknesses. The course would have been greatly improved if each person had more opportunities to speak during class. It ended up that class discussion was dominated by two (White) individuals in the class who at times may have benefited more from listening than speaking. It may have helped if the professor intervened more to encourage a balanced discussion, especially since many people had good insights to give and lived experiences related to some of the course content.",
    "Strengths of the course include students' agency to choose topics for presentation and review for the midterm assignment. Many students were able to tie in relevant knowledge from other courses\/life experience to enrich topics meaningful to them. I wish there was a bit more interactivity in the class. I love listening to Professor Siu lecture about topics she is passionate and knowledgeable about; that is why I took the course. But, I also enjoy finding ways to have guided discussions led by the professor or teaching fellow to allow for knowledge synthesis.",
    "Having Prof Siu is such a gift because she is an amazing speaker and has so many important and rich ideas and thoughts to share and is also just so caring and kind to her students and very open-minded. Her wealth of knowledge and experience is invaluable! \r\nI would say the workload for this class was pretty fair except at the very end we had a pretty substantial paper to write, but she gave us ample time to talk to her about it and discuss ideas with her so just make sure to not procrastinate!"

   "comments": [
    "This is a great anthro course that I would recommend to anyone looking to get a good theory base but also to explore beyond constructed borders and ideas of ethnicity, history, etc.",
    "I would recommend this course because Professor Siu is an insightful scholar and friendly professor. Although it is a seminar, Professor Siu gives a lecture for about half of the class, so if you prefer seminars in which you dive straight into discussion, this may not be the class for you. I would also recommend paying attention to the types of people in the class; some of them may end up talking too much and dominating class discussion.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student with some interest in East Asia and\/or in cultural-anthropological topics. I really enjoyed the subject matter of this course and think it is appealing to most globally-minded students. I would caution a student, however, that although it is possible to get by without finishing all work for this course, doing so obviously detracts from the experience, especially when learning with a well designed syllabus and an eager professor very excited to share her knowledge and experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to those who really want to stretch their idea of Asia and ultimately of the world. To think beyond the very subconscious parameters and mindsets we have and to see the world in a different light. Rather than the actual content of the course, it was the shifts in thinking and approaching things that really stuck with me and I think will continue to stick with me. I really enjoyed the course!",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to students who are interested in seeing how the interdisciplinary nature of social sciences come into life through interpretations of current developments and issues in Asia."
