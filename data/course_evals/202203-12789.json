                "This class is well organized, and the syllabus is so refreshing for a language class. It's not bogged down on the grammar and vocabulary, forcing you to memorize so many words you may never use. This class is well set up for language use, not just studying it in a technical way. I would have appreciated less group work only because it was difficult to coordinate with other students, but otherwise not too many weaknesses!",
                "Strengths - Professor XGP was the highlight of this course. She is very kind and thoughtful, provides great feedback on essays on projects, and always strives to make the class engaging and fun. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - It might be beneficial to spend some more time practicing grammar and conjugations. I understand the rationale behind the focus on culture and broader themes in the homework and activities, but sometimes I felt like I just needed to practice conjugating all the verbs we had learned in class.",
                "It's well structured, but too many days.",
                "strengths: teacher and class atmosphere are super fun, light, and enjoyable\r\nweaknesses: whole class is taught exclusively in Portuguese, so students often feel lost",
                "Professor Gonzalez is wonderful and makes sure no student is left behind. The class is structured in such a way that it is impossible not to feel like your grew a lot by the end.",
                "The immersion of the language was both a strength and weakness, because it forced me to actively talk and listen in Portuguese, but it was also a weakness in that something I couldn't respond in class because I had no idea what was being said. I do like the small class size and it allows for a more closer connection with the teacher."

This is a great fairly low stakes opportunity to exercise a part of your brain not too many other classes engage, and the class is structured around genuinely interesting and fun topics.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. You will build a solid foundation in a new language in a very supportive atmosphere.",
                "yes. Good intro to Portuguese",
                "would recommend if you want a light language class, but not for those who want to dive deep into a language",
                "Yes it is a great option to fulfill your language requirement!",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed the class because the workload and grading was on par with the introductory aspect of the class, but the class itself was immersive in Portuguese which made it challenging.",
