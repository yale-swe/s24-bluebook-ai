The writing assignments make you critically engage with the course material and get a good surface level idea of how art history works. The professor does a great job at keeping the class engaging!",

We started with a general overview of the Greek gods and their most common attributes in art, then moved towards discussions of myths of specific heroes and gods, along with topics like Homers Iliad and Odyssey, the history and mythology of Olympia, drama in Ancient Greece, and the underworld as a motif. In the end, I felt that I had a comprehensive overview of Ancient Greek mythology, along with good historical context and a large variety of ancient artworks. The art historical focus leads to strong skill building in visual analysis and contextualization, while the substantial yet approachable primary source readings increase reading comprehension, in particular for ancient and difficult texts. Meanwhile, the papers and sections emphasize synthesis and clarity, two more skills that are definitely developed in this course. Overall, this course was a great look into Ancient Greek history through an art historical lens, providing a fun way to build a variety of verbal skills.",

                "Strengths: Professor Gaifman and the TAs keep the class pretty lighthearted. The lecture topics are rarely boring, and lectures are fairly short and easy to listen to\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the weekly readings are quite long (though not all of them are necessary to participate in section)",
                "The writing assignments were all interesting and fun, but there was only a little connection to lectures. I think more testing throughout the semester like open-book canvas quizzes on readings, even if just multiple choice, would be helpful to ensure we knew plots and character names before really digging into analysis in section. While I feel like a learned a lot, lectures could sometimes be all over the place so I didn't even really know what I was learning. Somehow providing a more basic overview of myths \/ important themes \/ timelines would be helpful (although maybe I just wasn't comprehending well enough).",
                "the structure of the course is good as a writing credit. a lot of our sections focused on how to prepare us for our papers. you just have to be engaged because everything you learn from weeks 1-4 is the foundation for other critical thoughts and papers you have to write. the paper timing was just really close together. by the time we got feedback for paper 1, paper 2 was due 5 days later!! that was not conducive to success of comprehension especially since paper 1 wasn't what my TA was looking for",
                "The professor brought an excellent energy to class, but the lecture format made it difficult\/less probable for students to reciprocate.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gaifman is extremely enthusiastic and a positive person. She has a good sense of humor and her lectures are never boring. The topics taught during the semester were also interesting and tied together well at the end. All the TAs are also amazing people.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",

                "Strengths of the course were that the professor is fun and engaged in the content. Weakness is that the grading is totally subjective and depends entirely on how your TA grades. Some TAs wont give anyone over a B and others only give out As. The TAs vary a lot.",
                "\/",
                "Strengths - really good prof + TA\r\nWeaknesses - final paper + final exam is pretty egregious (should be one or the other)",
                "Better TFs!!!! Content was interesting but dry at times",
                "This course covered interesting material, assignments were engaging and mentally challenging without being too much work, and lectures included lots of examples and visuals that helped illustrate the material. However, I felt that the class did not dive into the intersection between art & myth as much as it could have. Instead, it sometimes felt like we were just going over Greek myths and looking at some vases that depicted the given myths. Also, not the fault of the instructors, but most of the students seemed to be taking the class as an easy credit and were not super engaged. Overall, I felt that the class did not draw students in and ask them to dive deep as much as it could have.",
                "The main strength of this course was the structure of topics and content, and how focused it was on specific items or buildings instead of trying to encompass a wide range of objects. The specificity allowed for a deeper and more focused understanding of art analysis.",
                "This course was very strong in its ability to distill the elements of myths conveyed in texts and plays as they relate to the art pieces, and teaching students to recognize differences between texts and the artistic portrayals. The lectures were all delivered in an engaging manner and they were recorded if you couldn't make it to class so this made for a really flexible experience with the class. Teaching fellows were very helpful with writing skills and essay organization and I think generally pretty available across the board.",
                "Assignments frequently did not feel very intellectually involved. A greater emphasis on interpretation of Greek Art, rather than a simple description thereof, seems like it would noticeably improve the learning experience of the course.  Assignments also felt a little too rigidly structured and graded at times, taking away from the creativity of the writing process (it almost felt like such creativity was punished).",
                "The layout of the course was very good with each class learning something new about art and myth.",
                "very basic stuff if you have any background in the arts or humanities. could have used much more opportunity to elaborate upon what we're learning in order to actually get something substantial out of it",

                "Professor Gaifman is a huge strength of this course. She has so much energy and does her absolute best to make the course engaging and accessible for everyone. Even the quizzes (which were given on somewhat random weeks) were very doable, although I did not really see the point in them other than as a reading\/lecture attendance check. The time we spent in the YUAG during section was super fun and interesting. There were really no weaknesses in this course.",
                "Strong lectures, good writing assignments. Really good analysis of the pottery I wish there had been a little more in-depth focus on this; perhaps even closer case studies on specific vases, with notes on the lecture slides about artistic and literary points. Could have had more guidance for the final paper, particularly in choosing a topic. Fantastic class!",
                "I think that this course was very interesting and fun, but I would suggest having a little more guidance on what exactly the professor is looking for in the essays, perhaps by providing examples since the essays for this class are very different from those in high school courses.",
                "Classes were a bit boring. I think the instructions on the writing assignments could have been more clear.",
                "The course sometimes moved too fast, so that it was difficult to follow all the information being taught. There was also minimal direction on a few areas of instruction that led to confusion or difficulty in completing at a high standard some of the assignments.",
                "Strengths: Good breadth, great TA's, Professor Gaifman is knowledgeable, well-organized slides, loved the YUAG visits. Weaknesses: The section quizzes felt unnecessary, and the questions seemed poorly chosen--it was unclear what answer the question was looking for, and it was easy to give far too little or far too much information. The course really feels like it is geared to people who have no interest in Classics and have no college writing experience either. Gods and classical works were constantly connected to modern movies as a way of introducing them, which was sometimes entertaining but also felt unnecessary. An excessive amount of time was spent in sections painstakingly going over the basics of essay writing--theses, topic sentences, etc. This may be a strength for some students, and others may feel bored.",
                "Class didnt relate\/ engage enough with assignments.",
                "Strength: all the materials are accessible; the course is introductory so those who are not art history majors can engage easily; low stakes; great writing credit for non-humanities majors\r\nWeakness: none",
                "Strengths: Lectures are interesting and cover a wide variety of topics within Greek mythology, the course makes great use of the antiquities collection at the Yale University Art Gallery, weekly readings are engaging and not too demanding, papers for this class were genuinely fun to write.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Most of the art featured in this class is pottery, with a good amount of sculpture and some architecture sprinkled in. This is mostly due to the fact that most surviving Greek artwork is pottery, but the visual analyses of pots can nonetheless get a bit tiresome.",
                "strengths: engaging lectures \r\nweaknesses: grading can be a bit arbitrary (depending on who your TA is)",
                "I really loved everything about this class. Dr. Gaifman's lectures were really engaging and the workload is completely manageable. I took class as a WR credit and it was really fun. You get a lot of flexibility with the final essay too, which is nice.",
                "The sections were good! Really enjoyed them, in addition to the low stakes quizzes too.",
                "The main strengths of this course were the extremely engaging material and lectures, the reasonable workload and readings, and the helpful and interesting sections. I was always excited to start the readings for the week and go to lecture, both of which just felt like consuming storybooks of fables. Moreover, the readings were always quite approachable, and there was rarely an unreasonable amount to read (with exceptions of the Iliad and Odyssey weeks). Likewise, the lectures were short and energetic, with really nice summaries and contextualization for the readings along with presentation of related materials and artwork. Like the readings, no prior knowledge was assumed (though it does make keeping all the mythological names straight a bit easier), and technical jargon was kept to a minimum. Furthermore, the writing assignments were short and quite open-ended (especially the final paper), and there were only two of them (three for the WR credit). The final exam was a relaxed take home test with plenty of time and open-ended essays that allowed you to express your opinions and focus on what you knew best. Sections were also quite engaging, with lots of trips to the art gallery, visual analysis and synthesis practice for the papers, and fun activities and extra credit opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe only real weaknesses of this course were the (very) occasionally monotonous lecture format and the confusing and unnecessary quizzes. Sometimes it just felt like we were listing out mythological figures endlessly, and many of the vases we looked at started to blend together; moreover, the class was very large and thus it was easier to become disengaged. This was usually alleviated with some dynamic content like videos or audience participation, so continuing to include these aspects helps these inherent large class problems. Beyond this, the only issue with this course were the three quizzes in section, which were supposed to provide a quantitative measure of class participation (40% of the grade) but just ended up being confusing and stressful, as the topics often shifted the morning of the quizzes and they tested arbitrary memorization not in the spirit of the rest of the course. It would be better to just let TFs determine the participation grade directly and maybe implement reading responses or some at-home replacement to the quizzes instead."

                "I would definitely recommend this course, whether you're an art history major or not. It's an interesting way to learn about ancient Greek culture, art, and mythology and understand how to write visual analysis papers of an art piece in conjunction with a textual representation.",
                "Yes, but only if you have a pre-existing interest in the subject matter.",
                "I would recommend this to anyone.",
                "yep if you want something with not too much of a time commitment in the hums\/arts area. if you already know you're at all interested in this realm and want to be pushed probably take a higher level class",
                "YES YES YES. This course is amazing. It was super interesting to learn about Greek mythology through an art history lens, and Professor Gaifman presents the content in such a beautiful and digestible manner that makes this course a delight to take. You also get to visit the YUAG a lot and study many of the pieces there in great depth which is amazing in and of itself. Easily one of the best classes that I've taken during my time here.\r\n\r\nThat said, I wouldn't consider this the guttiest of guts (at least if you take the WR credit like I did, which meant an extra essay). There is a final paper and a final exam which wasn't great but you get so much flexibility with what you get to write about that they can honestly be kind of enjoyable. Also, like a lot of other big lecture classes, your grade will likely depend on your TA.",
                "YES. Take it, Prof. Gaifman is super good at lecturing, and you will have fun learning about Greek myths. The course is also not meritless, you'll improve your writing, and you can get creative with your final paper and compare the themes of Greek myths to your favorite movies, art, or TV shows (think like anime, surrealism, or Mean Girls)",
                "Yes definitely it was fun and informative",
                "Yes!! A very low-key, low-risk way to engage with Greek art and the art history department at Yale. Its so great to have the opportunity to take class in the YUAG and Professor Gaifman is excellent.",
                "Yes, take this class!",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course for a humanities or writing credit that is not terribly stressful but also provides interesting material.",
                "If you're interesting in greek history.",
                "To non-majors, yes, this is a very good and manageable course that gives you an introduction to ancient mythology and art. I would probably not recommend this class to Art History\/Classics majors--you can find a more engaging and challenging course.",
                "Probably not. The assignments felt separated from the class and didnt promote attending class.",
                "Yes, especially those who are interested in greek myths",
                "Yes - especially the writing credit.",
                "Yes, if you want to get a taste of art history while studying the origin of myths that have influenced works like Percy Jackson.",
                "Sure, it is a fun course.",
                "I would recommend this course to other studentsProfessor Gaifman is an excellent lecturer, and the course material is fascinating, especially for students who have little knowledge about the ancient Greek world. The workload for this class is not at all overly demanding, and discussion sections often featured fun activities and visits to the YUAG which really enriched the course.",
                "Yes if they are interested in learning about art history as a discipline but have never taken an art history class before",
                "Definitely recommend! It's an awesome class and Dr. Gaifman is great. The course is set up so you can learn without stress, and it's honestly one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale.",
                "yes, its not stressful but still interesting and you learn something from it",
                "Yes, if you've read Percy Jackson or you just want to learn more about Zeus or Herakles.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in Greek mythology and\/or history, especially if they enjoy or are intrigued with art history in specific. It is a great way to get a writing credit in a course with engaging material (if you enroll in a writing section), and it is a good, low to medium workload final credit to round out a schedule (with an added bonus of a writing or humanities credit). Moreover, it is just a lot of fun, with approachable readings, energetic lectures, and engaging sections. I would not recommend it to anyone who does not want to spend a lot of time talking about Ancient Greek myths and history, though that is probably obvious from the title. Otherwise, I think most students would really enjoy this exciting, low-stress course.",
                "YES! it was a very interesting class."
