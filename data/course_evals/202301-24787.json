                "I learned a lot about patterns of repression.",
                "This class offers a robust foundation in understanding many different facets of repression in dictatorships. I gained an understanding of what dictatorships are, the different types of repression they employ, and what academic literature about repression looks like, as well as knowledge of many case studies.",
                "This was a great introduction to comparative authoritarianismthe study of dictatorships around the world!",
                "The course covers exactly what the title promises: repressive tactics and coercive apparatuses of different authoritarian states throughout history. The course is highly dependent on reading research papers which furthers one's knowledge on political science research methods and deepens one's understanding on how to deal with different research challenges (i.e. sampling bias, randomization issues, etc.)",
                "This course allowed for a deeper understanding of general points concerning repression and dictatorship, and also served to provide a survey overview of specific regimes.",
                "I learned about repression in dictatorships, including harder forms (arrests, forced disappearances) and softer forms (propaganda), and how regimes use such repression to stay in control.",
                "I learned about what methods certain dictatorships used to coerce people to comply to their regime. I was able to do this by looking at case studies where certain aspects were dominant. I learn to investigate in more detail certain aspects on control and repression as I believed that they weren't repressive but can actually affect people."

            "comments": [
                "I truly learned a lot throughout this course that I would have never learned otherwise, from theoretical aspects of a dictatorship to how actual dictatorships spawned and survived. My one suggestion for improvement would be that the lectures were often just regurgitations/summaries of the readings, which felt a bit redundant at times.",
                "Pop quizzes are unnecessary.",
                "The readings and lectures were always interesting, and the final project/presentation is a great strength of the course because it allows students to take the lead in exploring a case that they find interesting.",
                "Strengths: Really interesting material and exposure to strong political science research; good balance of lecture and discussion. Weaknesses: Class material does not extend much beyond the readings; syllabus prioritizes breadth over depth. The course could be improved if lectures spent more time  on theory and related concepts instead of going over specific case studies from the readings.",
                "Loved the structure and the topic; communication around reading quizzes could have been done better to avoid confusion. Loved the final paper and presentation. Professor Gandhi is very nice and knowledgeable, but her lecture style was sometimes a bit slowit felt to me at times that she took longer than was necessary to explain a concept.",
                "The course is pretty run-of-the-mill in terms of structure. Despite being seminar sized, the course consists of lectures which go over the readings that were assigned at the end of the previous class. There's room for improvement to either allow more student input or perhaps some independent discussion as it made doing the readings redundant. Though you could say that one could simply not do the readings, the looming threat of pop quizzes ensured that one did the readings which--when juggling multiple classes--added a great deal of stress.",
                "The course was an amazing introductory course. I dont think the reading quizzes were necessary, and the course might benefit from some more student interaction.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gandhi is such a great lecturer, I genuinely regret ever thinking that the class would be boring as she makes an effort to keep everyone engaged. I loved the structure of the class as we were presented with the idea that dictatorships have happened but they can also continue in our times. The readings really helped clarify/explain new topics and I really appreciate that ass I didn't feel that it was busy work or the professor trying to sell their own material to students. Other than being a great lecturer, Professor Gandhi is one of the most understanding and fair professors I've had at Yale; she really makes a space lively and makes everyone feel seen and welcomed.\r\nWeaknesses: Not really, I feel like the only weakness is the grading scale. I found her scale weird and couldn't really understand how she deducted points or what she was looking for at times. I know it's something really petty but other than that, this is a great course."

                "Yes, especially if you're a political science student. My focus is American politics, but I found myself growing extremely interested in comparative politics after taking this course. You learn a lot about different regimes and about different histories, which helps to not only deepen your understanding of dictatorships but also contextualize a lot of contemporary conflicts/nations.",
                "yes",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who would like to study dictatorships, regardless of major.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in getting an introduction to poli sci and/or the study of dictatorships. The class has a fairly low workload, but it also doesn't go very in depth on each topic.",
                "This course is a strong Poli Sci lecture course that focuses on case studies to learn about authoritarianism in different settings worldwide, many of them not-so-well-known, during the 20th and 21st centuries. The final project and presentation provide lots of opportunities for independent research on a regime of your choice. Recommended.",
                "Yes! Gandhi provides a measured and critical perspective of the repression and dictatorship that allows for deeper learning of the subject.",
                "Yes, I would. Prof. Gandhi is a great instructor and the content is equally interesting. Even if a student is not a political science major, if they are willing to put some effort in they will leave this course with a new understanding of political concepts and how some regimes/governments are able to sustain themselves to this day.",
                "I would recommend this course in a heartbeat. The topics are extremely important and can be seen in modern world leaders. Fair warning, a lot of the topics discussed in class are pretty strong and can impact your mood, I would recommend taking it easy and taking breaks in between readings so they don't cloud your day. Professor Gandhi does a great job of delivering these topics with respect and care which I really appreciated. Make sure to complete your readings before every class because she may have pop quizzes once in a while."
