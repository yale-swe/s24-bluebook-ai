    "This course really drilled the foundation's of French. You go over over the imparfait, the pass compos, near future, present tense, and LOTS of pronouns. You really get a good understanding of the very basics of French Grammar.",
    "I was able to gain stamina and learned so much more French than what I thought I could.",
    "Through this course, students were able to rigorously learn basic-level french. Through means of conversation and listening, students were able to understand sentences, read prompts, and write in the french language.",
    "I learned a lot of introductory French vocabulary and grammar.",
    "I learned Intro French"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengthens: you learn a lot of French and you can see your progress quite easily. \r\nWeaknesses: This course moves so quickly, and some weeks it seems as if the test material is straightforward while on others you may not be quite certain what is being tested and what was just discussed in class.",
    "Strength: Taught almost entirely in French and the class setting is small so every student gets attention. Makes his availability times clear.\r\n\r\nWeakness: None that I can think of at the moment",
    "Strengths of this course included excellent professor engagement throughout the semester. Confusion was cleared several times in the semester through their hard work. One weakness would be through a vast amount of the course being through audio, lack of having examples and lessons on paper sometimes caused difficulty to confidently prep for lessons. (Although the course workbook did do wonders in terms of understand lessons).",
    "Good course, lots of student participation. Keeping small class size is key."

   "comments": [
    "If you are willing to put in the time. This course is no joke and some weeks you will be pulling out your hair wishing you took an easier language, but if you want to learn French then you will.",
    "Yes! French is the language to take. It is a beautiful language taught by great professors who care about what they're teaching.",
    "The importance of learning any language is essential in this ever-growing cosmopolitan society. Through French, the \"language of love,\" students are healthily challenged to expand their thinking and are placed in a situation in which they learn more of not just the French language but French culture as well.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student that wants to learn French, but warn them that it is very hard. There are weekly tests and you meet during reading period but you learn a lot of French. It is helpful if you know a Romance language or have taken some French in high school because the course moves very fast but the work is manageable and rewarding if you want to learn French.",
    "This course is difficult, but very well structured for students who want to be fluent in french.",
    "yes, well taught class"
