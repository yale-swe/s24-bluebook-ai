For instance, we learned how to view and address historical events and themes from a critical, academic perspective. The culminating projects for this class were thought-provoking and so original. My classmates were all wonderful scholars, and I look forward to seeing what they publish in the future.",
                "I learned about the history of the North American Southwest through the lenses of race and sexuality.",
                "I learned a lot about borderlands history, definitely, But I think the most valuable learning from this class were the skills. This course had as its goal for its students to understand borderlands, race, and sexuality as analytics\/frameworks when writing (or reading). I think it definitely achieved that goal for me. I came into the course not having this skill, of viewing texts or sources from certain frameworks, but I can now say 100% I gained it. I am now able to read texts and sources using these lenses. I think this course also taught me a lot about the process of writing scholarship. We talked about the context in which scholars wrote, how that influenced their work, and the implications of the analyses they presented. Also, our entire course was also based around epistemology and critically thinking about the writing of history, like no other course I've taken did before. I really learned a ton in this class."

Even though the class was very small, we were all engaged excited to discuss the readings. I really loved how close-knit the class became. Even though it was virtual, we all formed a community in this space.\r\n\r\nIn terms of improvement, I would've loved to engage with different borderlands and the histories of other communities in addition to the American Southwest. Also, I wish the course had been once-a-week longer seminar instead of a twice-weekly shorter seminar.",
                "I liked the breakout sessions and the class activities.",
