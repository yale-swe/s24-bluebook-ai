            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Focus on rigorous proofs\r\nWeaknesses: 1. The design of the course is very poor. Beginning with proof techniques is good, but as soon as that is over it begins looking at vector spaces. This makes linear algebra feel very irrelevant because we start getting deep into the weeds of the subject prior to learning its importance. In a past linear algebra class we began with just understanding linear equations and looking at why we even want to learn linear algebra. Then, we did some proof techniques, learned linear transformations, and then vector spaces, etc. This organization just made everything we were learning easier to understand its purpose. 2. The problem sets aren't that interesting until later in the course. Many of the earlier psets are incredibly tedious and don't add to understanding the material and feel like simple practice. Though I will say the later psets are incredibly good and effective (last 3-4).",
                "The course was well-balanced overall, and there were no weaknesses.",
                "Emphasis on proof writing was a strength. A weakness was that the linear algebra concepts felt too conceptual sometimes and it was hard to grasp what you're writing proofs about.",
                "Worksheets with definitions \/ theorems for each class",
                "Strengths: material, problem sets, exams\r\nWeaknesses: lectures",
                "Strength: PSets and exams were tough but fair and helped build understanding. Weakness: Lectures were poorly taught and often spent too long on specific proofs that were not relevant. Very difficult to build a conceptual understanding of the material from the lectures.",
                "These teachers almost seem to have the goal of you having to learn everything by yourself. There are no TA office hours. The Professor office hours are unhelpful. The course was poorly taught so often I went into office hours needing a full explanation and they would expect me to learn by explaining it to them. There are problem sessions in place of TA office hours, where they go over practice problems, but they dont post solutions. I, like every other Yalie, cant make them because Im busy, and this I lose TA interaction entirely. This is made worse by the fact that they are not 1 hour sessions throughout the week, like other classes office hours, but two hour blocks on specific days, meaning if I have to miss it, theres not another one later that night to make.",
                "The course was fairly well taught. I do not think it is wise (personally) to begin with the abstract vector space and linear maps, and then move to matrices - it would have made MUCH more sense to do this the other way around, in my opinion. The course content itself is very good.",
                "Sometimes the lecture material seemed super confusing at first, but when I watched videos I found on the internet is was explained in a much clearer way. The PSETs were good in terms of helping to clear up the material though. The professors were approachable and happy to answer questions, which was nice. I thought the exams were usually okay in terms of assessing what we had been taught.",
                "It was taught well.",
                "I found the way the class was taught, which was basically just following proofs, did not help me develop an intuitive understanding of the subject matterI often had trouble actually grasping what a basic term actually meant, since all concepts were presented in this somewhat un-intuitive proof format, especially given that I had no experience with proofs before coming into this class. I also think the order the concepts were presented in didn't make the most sense, since the beginning of the course featured the most abstract general concepts, which through foundational to linear algebra proofs, I think would've been easier to grasp a bit further on.",
                "I felt like the professors could have done a better job at making the course interesting. It wasn't until we got to the end of the course that I saw how everything tied together. Also, the introduction to proofs could have been better. Professors not only needed to teach you the theorems, but tell you how they are used.",
                "It is a great class. I wish they posted solutions to practice problems. Otherwise it is excellent.",
                "I think notes taking was very helpful with learning the material.",
                "I think the teaching was very weak and the feedback\/support was minimal.",
                "Lectures are boring and no engagement with proofs. Teaching of content was solid.",
                "Well organized.",
                "I think it's a pretty great course. The material is interesting and it's the right level of challenge. It's a ton of material but I honestly think that's the right call. Only areas of improvement would be more dynamic lectures, but that's down to the prof.",
                "The strengths were that the concepts were interesting, and the class was well organized. The biggest weakness was that the content was not taught very well. I often felt confused in class and the professors didn't always explain the concepts clearly.",
                "Strengths: my professors was willing to help with problems and other questions throughout the semester, both over email and during office hours\r\nWeaknesses\/Improvements: I think that it would be helpful to have proof writing workshops (like in Fall semester), because as someone with no background in proof writing, it was very difficult to go from the basic proofs in the beginning of the class that were supposed to \"ease\" us into proofs to the actual linear algebra proofs. I would also say it would be helpful if study guides that were more similar to the exam content were provided before exams. I appreciated the practice problems we received, but they were problems that were decided to not be included on the exam which meant some concepts in the problems weren't really tested on the exam. I also think it would be helpful to have office hours that are not predominantly during times when people have classes. A cheat sheet on the midterms and final would also have been helpful for all the definitions and theorems, especially ones that had many different properties.",
                "Strengths: The homework assignments really taught me the skills needed to succeed, the professors were all very nice and supportive\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were mostly here's a definition, theorem, and proof and were not always very engaging. The office hours were often at times that made it impossible to attend, and the homework was very hard to do without help so not being able to go to office hours was difficult. We also didn't have review sessions before the exams, and we had to memorize everything for each exam, which I didn't feel was very productive in us actually learning higher math.",
                "I appreciated the abstract approach we took to learning linear algebra, because I feel that this generalization offered more power to the subject. For example, I like that we learned about vector spaces from a set theory perspective and analyzed their properties before discussing vector\/matrix representations.",
                "Improve: better time management (ie, fitting all the material into each lecture) especially towards the end of the course\r\n\r\nOtherwise great",
                "One of the strengths of this course is that it is extremely rigorous, so I really had to put a lot of work and effort in. If I didn't, I think there's no way I could have kept up with the pace of the course because we went through a lot of challenging material in depth in a fairly short time. I think that one of the weaknesses of the course is that the first two weeks of the course, when we reviewed terminology regarding proofs before beginning textbook material, gave me a false impression that the proofs we would be doing would be fairly obvious or only a few steps. I think a disclaimer that the course would pick up and get much harder once we started material from the textbook would have made me more prepared once we got to that point.",
                "I would say the strength of this course is a strong class dynamic, which does a pretty good job of not leaving students behind, with instructors staying behind after class to field any questions. However, I would say that the office hours were not really office hours but rather \"problem sessions\" which were often not very helpful.",
                "This course could use some changes in the pacing. The beginning portion was really easy and we spent a lot of time on it and it felt boring. If this time was more distributed to cushion the later harder stuff it could have been nice.",
                "First of all, not all material in the class is covered. There are topics that are skipped so I feel like I didn't get the full linear algebra curriculum. I also feel like the class lacked intuition -- that is, it was heavily conceptual and difficult to understand at times.",
                "This course spends time introducing linear algebra topics accompanied with proving these concepts. These proofs are very difficult and are sometimes very abstract. A possible modification to this course could be introducing visualization of the concepts into the lessons. Lessons were taught very algebraically and were never really given a picture\/physical representation that made them easy to visualize. Because of this, I had to look elsewhere to begin to understand the uses and intersections of the topics.",
                "The grading is this course was indelibly frustrating at times  especially with how nit-picky the points taken off are on psets and tests. I think it was taught well, Ovenhouse was a good lecturer, however the structure of the content often made linear algebra more confusing than it needed to be.",
                "I did not feel that the course was well structured to support student learning. To clarify, I enjoyed Prof. Ovenhouse's classes and thought that he was a clear lecturer. It was more the organization of class as a whole that was frustrating. Before the before the first midterm, the initial plan of the instructors was to not release solutions to the practice problems. It was only upon numerous student requests that they were given. In math, timely feedback is essential to improvement, so I don't understand this reasoning.  \r\nFurther, on days where Prof. Ovenhouse was absent, we would have the other instructors come to substitute. When Prof. Martone taught our class, many people were very lost. He went too fast, assumed we understood too many definitions, and failed to explain well. It did not feel like the professors were entirely on the same page.",
                "Strength: Nick is amazing at explaining concepts and answering questions. Weakness: No outstanding weaknesses to be honest. It's not an easy course, but anyone who puts in the time and effort and asks for help will manage.",
                "Videos that followed the content like they do in math 120.",
                "The main strength of 225 is that learning the language of proofs and sets was interesting throughout the class. Some of the proofs while very challenging were interesting to come to an understanding of and it was interesting to be able to stack proofs with every subsequent one being able to be proved by ones learned before. However, I felt that the way the lectures were structured prevented me from learning from them as many focused heavily on the proofs for theorems without adequately explaining what the theorem does or how certain aspects lead to the proof. Also, the majority of office hours were structured during times when I had classes. I find it a bit counterintuitive to have math office hours scheduled at the same time as physics class time as many physics majors take linear algebra at some point in their college career. The class also doesn't provide any idea of how to solve the problems to the peer tutors making it harder for them as they have to come up with ideas on the spot to help students. This all led to the majority of what I learned coming from either the textbook or videos on youtube rather than class resources. Finally, reading feedback or answer keys on proofs was sometimes confusing if you didn't understand the proof as they tend to be too vague to piece together what you don't understand. Overall, the class is trying to cram so much into one semester that it ends up making most of it unintelligible and when you try to get help for the class, there are unnecessary barriers in the way.",
                "The strengths of the course involve the opportunities for engagement through office hours, problem sets, and practice materials for tests, as well as the emphasis on the development of proof-writing and argumentative skills. The course introduced a completely new area of math that is helpful for higher level courses. \r\nA weakness of the course was the lack of in-class practice, as most theorems and proofs discussed in class were intended to develop a base understanding, but did not necessarily build your ability to tackle the more complex (less-straightforward) proofs on both tests and problem sets. This resulted in exams not always being congruent in difficulty level with in-class practice and even problem sets."

The fact that these were exclusively held during normal class times (like between 11-1pm) and were so few and far between meant seeking help was extremely difficult. The decision to hold the TA session on a Friday morning wasn't wise, and then to move it to 5-7pm once per week - straight after the main ULA session and covering the whole dining hours - was no better. The ULA workshops turned into frantic P-set help sessions and undermined their entire purpose. Without a change in this structure, I could not recommend 225 to anyone who doesn't *need* to take it.",

But it's a great experience intellectually and if you're the kind of learner who likes learning for its own sake and would rather learn something interesting and useless over something boring and useful, you will like this course. (obviously the useful\/uselessness is not that extreme, but I do think I'm the former kind of learner and that's why I enjoyed it).",

                "Yes, if you need it for your major or truly, absolutely, love proofs and math.",
                "If you are interested in learning about higher math and want a heavy workload, proof-based course, then yes! If you are a math major, this course will set you up very well for future math classes. However, if you are just taking this course to learn linear algebra or take a fun math class, I probably wouldn't take it. I often found myself becoming incredibly stressed out about the homeworks and exams, and I wish the class had a stronger support system of help. If there were more office hours, especially with the ULA's, that would have made this class more manageable.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in mathematics or an adjacent field of study. The course is well organized, its expectations are clear, and although the material is quite theoretical I found it rather thought-provoking. I also felt that all three instructors were truly invested in the class' success.",
                "Yes because linear algebra is very important.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in more theoretical math or if they are trying to figure out if they want to pursue more theoretical math because I think that taking this course is a good way to figure that out if you're not sure. If a student knows that they explicitly do not want to pursue more theoretical math and they don't need this course for any particular requirement, then I would strongly recommend that they take MATH 222 instead.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! I learned a lot and fell in love with proof-based math, which I very much was not expecting.",
                "Yes, I like the first question of every assignment and how it teaches you how to think about learning. Very good introductory course.",
                "Only if it was required for their major. If not, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this class.",
                "I took this course because it is a requirement for my major. For anyone who is not required to take this course and is also interested in Linear Algebra, I would advise them to take 222, a class more focused on doing Linear Algebra and exploring it's applications.",
                "Yes if you need to take it.",
                "Depends if they organize better.",
                "If you have to for a requirement, then yes.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you are a math or cs major who requires the introduction to proofs. If you are taking this class only to learn the mechanics of linear algebra, I would not recommend it as the class almost requires you to learn all the material on your own and goes into more detail than most learning linear algebra will need when first being introduced.",
                "Yes, definitely take this over 222.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student deeply interested in theoretical math and interested in devoting large amounts of time to studying the course material, completing problem sets, and attending office hours. The course is rewarding and enriching, but has a very sizeable workload, and due to the amount of material and new math strategies being introduced, can take longer to comprehend compared to other courses. Overall, the course was both very interesting and very challenging."
