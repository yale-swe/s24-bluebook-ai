The course is quite detailed, with biographical histories of composers\/eminent figures of significance, socio-political context, and musical analyses of works by the composers that are discussed. These analyses are meant to highlight elements of pieces that are characteristics of the era\/school in which they were composed.",

I was able to practice and improve my musical analysis skills through written analysis assignments and my ability to identify salient aspects of different classical genres through listening assignments.",
                "I gained a lot of knowledge on the ideological themes and musical changes that occurred over time with the western art-music tradition. It was especially interesting to learn about the different perceptions of program music and absolute music as well as the different philosophical ideas about the trajectory of western art-music."

                "Really interesting!! Gundula did such a good job of making the material interesting and applicable. I loved learning about and listening to the music in class. No weaknesses to say",
                "The course's main strength was its professor, Prof. Kreuzer. She delivered every lecture with an air of excitement, organization, and charisma which made the course very enjoyable to engage with. The slides she displayed were all very well-made, and her infographics\/annotations of musical characteristics on scores were highly detailed and easy to comprehend. \r\nI wouldn't call it a weakness necessarily, but the course is so incredibly chock-full of details and information which, when it is time for the 2 factual quizzes, can make it quite burdensome to figure out what to prioritize when studying.",
                "This course is amazing! Professor Kreutzer is an amazing professor and an engaging lecturer! The content was so much fun to read and listen to! I'm not sure how necessary the sections were, but given the online classes, they were a nice way to discuss the content.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is Professor Kreuzer herself, who is passionate, obviously knowledgeable, and an excellent lecturer. Her enthusiasm for the subject shone through even, even in a virtual setting. The material was fascinating and comprehensive. The readings, mainly sourced from Taruskin's Oxford History of Western Music, are also very engaging, and the Taruskin probably helped me think more rigorously about the production of historical narratives and historiographic methodology more than any history class I've taken at Yale. However, the tests (two factual quizzes and two listening quizzes) were very tough, with multi-part, very specific questions and a panic-inducingly short completion time. Factual quiz questions also didn't ask about composer biographies, despite those being discussed in both lecture and readings. Without access to recordings of the lectures, I would've found it very difficult to study (and I don't think I take terrible notes!), especially since lecture slides weren't made available. Essentially, I would've liked to know at the outset what type of material was going to be quizzed so as to focus my studying and notes. In that vein, studying was made much easier when around halfway through the semester, Professor Krezuer began including detailed summary lecture slides of a composer's stylistic features, which were big components of the quizzes. This was a game-changer and really helped me do better in the second half of the semester.",
                "I think the first factual quiz caught some of us by surprise, and there was less guidance up front about what we should prioritize in our studying, but this was addressed in time for the second factual quiz. The use of a Spotify playlist to host all music relevant to the course was very convenient and made studying\/engaging with course material much easier.",
                "The timeline of the assessments and writing assignments is helpful for keeping up with the material. I think it would be helpful to have more streamlined reading assignments or readings that were different from what was talked about during the lecture because sometimes the readings felt redundant."

                "The course was very well-organized despite the limitations of virtual learning. Prof. Kreuzer's slides and audio examples were delivered almost always without technical difficulties (and in the times that there were issues, she was able to solve them without much delay). \r\n\r\nThese are not issues that Prof. Kreuzer may be able to address more than they are technical limitations of Zoom, but two things that could be improved are (1) the framerate when screen-sharing videos (they are almost always around 1-2 frames per second)--perhaps it would be best to focus on audio so as to not be distracted by the choppy visuals--and (2) when speaking while a musical example is playing, the audio cuts out and makes it impossible to hear what is being said and decreases the quality of the music being played.",
