                "Learned elementary Spanish (speaking, reading, writing, etc.)",
                "Language, verbal and nonverbal communication, cultural information, etymology of words.",
                "This class has really helped me understand what it takes to learn a new language. After taking it, I feel confident in knowing the steps I need to continue working towards understanding Spanish.",
                "I learned a great deal of spanish, both in terms of speaking and reading a writing.",
                "For someone with no Spanish experience coming into this course, and having taken language courses from other Yale departments, I'm still very impressed at how much I was able to get out of this course in such a short period of time. Especially in terms of my abilities in reading comprehension and speaking, those built up faster than they have for any other language I've learned.",

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course was that it was a small enough class where I felt like there was an environment where it was safe to ask questions, make mistakes, and have positive reinforcement from my peers and instructor. The class also had a lot of opportunities for small group work, which meant that I got to collaborate with others in class and we could all work towards learning this new language together.",
                "This course is excellent and very well-organized, and it teaches you to learn Spanish well. I think a little more in-class focus on grammar (which we learned mostly through homework) would be helpful.",
                "All around very good course, occasional disconnect between daily Supersite lessons and class lessons, was often tedious and sometimes a cause for confusion. The way Supersite grades certain activities is also a bit unfair sometimes, so maybe a closer review of those correction procedures in activities would be helpful because it is a category of our grade that is based on accuracy. I also think that the pace of the course made vocabulary retention really hard sometimes. There were days where we would be introduced to 5-10 new verbs and be expected to recognize them in passages the next day. Those were just quick turnarounds, so a day in between that we re-emphasize the most important verbs vocabulary words would be helpful. That said, I loved that this class was more than just learning a language. It was learning the history of the language, how it came to be, its variations that resulted from its diaspora, the reason things are the way they are in the language, and the nuanced aspects of the language that make knowledge of it so important. Really like the seminar-based, interactive nature because that communication is truly crucial to language learning.",
                "I liked the professor, and I think the small discussions between 2-3 people in class was helpful. The biggest issue for me was that I didn't feel comfortable enough with the language to fully engage in participation. That could definitely be a me-thing, but I think the speed of the class and the way each section was structured hindered me from improving my communication skills.",
                "Strengths of this course were keeping all the students engaged. Professor Russell did a great job of this. Weakness would be maybe incorporating more culture.",
                "The small class size is a strenght and having a good instructor makes it a lot easier. There is definitely a bit too much homework, it is very difficult to keep up with it.",
                "I think the biggest strength of this course is that the daily work never felt like fundamentally busy work. I always understood why I was doing an assignment (for the most part), and there was just enough variety to keep me not feeling super drained. Also, I loved reading el escabe cubano and how culturally focused all the big assignments were. \r\n\r\nThe weakness I think was the group project. I did not get anything out of this project frankly, and don't know how much could have been gained from it. In general I think group projects are not suitable for language learning at all, and this one did nothing to change that perspective."

                "Yes definitely!",
                "Definitely. I took 4 years in Spanish but I have learned far more in this class than in those 4 years. I had a baseline understanding of most we did this year but never knew the reasoning behind any of it. This class has given me a comprehensive understanding of the Spanish language up to where we stopped. Great class, learned lots, and nice class feel despite lots of work.",
                "I think if the student is a  particularly consistent worker who would be willing to put a disproportionally large amount of time into this class, I would recommend it.",
                "Yes I would. Do not be scared to continue spanish in college if you have taken it in high school or if you just want to start. They do a great job of easing you in while also keeping it challenging",
                "I definitely would! Everyone in the U.S. should be learning Spanish right now if they are not already doing so. It will only become more useful as time goes on, and there's a brilliant language department right here at your disposal.",
                "Yes, I would because I feel confident that if I stick with Spanish learning, I'll achieve fluency."
