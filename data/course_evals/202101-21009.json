                "Strengths: Prof. Goldberg was a fine lecturer; PSets did a good job of covering the material of the week.\r\nWeaknesses: sections seemed off-topic and a little bit of a waste of time; lectures didn't cover mathematical examples (that's all that exams and PSets were) but that's what section was for; some surprise questions on PSets and exams that felt a little unfair; grading was generally fair; peer tutors were somewhat hard to get in contact with and office hours weren't super accessible (at least for me)",
                "I think it could have been nice to show problem application in the lectures as well.",

                "This is a great class to learn about microeconomics.",
                "The course was very accessible, and the instructors did a good job of keeping the material approachable. I found some of the review in the beginnings of lectures a bit redundant; we could have moved to new material each lecture and kept the length to an hour rather than an hour and fifteen minutes. I didn't find the content especially intellectually engaging, but then again, it's an introductory lecture. If the goal is to build a foundation for future, more interesting courses, it succeeded. I appreciated the organization of the course and the routine nature of the problem sets. I always felt prepared for exams and thought the course functioned well online. It was one of the best organized courses of my semester.",
                "I think the strengths of this course were the number of graphs drawn to portray material, weekly sections, the review sessions hosted before each exam, and reviewing the material at the beginning of every class. A weakness would be the lack of attendance during classes.",
                "A serious revision of this course needs to be done. There is nothing redeeming or enjoyable about this course in its current virtual state. If it weren't for my amazing TA, I simply do not know what would be okay about this course. The lectures are EXTREMELY dry and hard to follow. The most frustrating part of this class is how the review sessions and the review content you are given for the tests are never reflective of the material covered in the exams. It seems like you can never study or prep enough for what they give you. I suggest that the econ department thinks strongly about who they want to be the professors of this course & how they want to frame this course to be better for engaging students in the material & not continuing to alienate students who may not be so interested in econ.",
                "The professors were really helpful and good at explaining concepts. There is no weaknesses to the course.",

                "strengths: Canvas and assignments were well-organized; Daniela Morar was a great course director and section leader; the textbook for this class was interesting and helpful for understanding course material; the workload was manageable: weekly p sets and 2 midterms and 1 final; if you haven't taken econ in high school you might need to read the textbook more diligently which take some more time\r\nweaknesses: little individual attention and feedback and fast paced lecture",
                "It was hard. Go faster in beginning and slow down later.",
                "I don't think this is Yale's strongest classthe professor clearly cared about teaching but was not the best teacher, and there is a limited willingness to hear from students. That said, this is not a super difficult course and there are a number of supports to make sure it goes well. A major strength: Joseph Ribaudo, one of the peer mentors for the course, went above and beyond to help students understand material.",
                "I really enjoyed how Professor Goldberg recapped the previous day's lecture at the beginning of each lecture. I would have liked for there to be more questions to the class that we could be called on to answer, but I understand that that was difficult this year due to the nature of virtual learning.",
                "The extra resources in the form of teachers assistants and peer tutors are very helpful with fully understanding course material",
                "This class conveyed a breadth of basic information on microeconomics, and was very approachable and accessible to people like me without any background in economics at all. The workload is very manageable and standard. However, the material is dry and the second half of the course felt more rushed.",
                "The last third of the course was taught so quickly that most students did not retain the information that was being taught. Over Zoom, and even in person, this class could benefit from a 5-minute break in the middle of the lecture because every class was packed with info. I liked that Prof Goldberg reviewed material at the start of the class. I wish that the class could have been more engaging and more interactive. Outside of the lecture, my section was not very helpful. The class could have benefitted from doing a practice problem or two during lecture.",
                "this was a difficult class over zoom with some glitches with so many people and so many skilled economists from around the world and sometimes it was hard to understand what was said",
                "I thought Office Hours were helpful. Joe led amazing review sessions. I thought they gave ample review material. I thought lectures were a bit slow and confusing. Also we didn't get enough time to complete exams",
                "Great teacher and tas. Very smart and explained concepts very well",
                "The only strength of this course was our peer tutor Joe. Without his office hours I don't think I would have completed this course which was honestly very disappointing. In lectures the professor only quickly scratched the surface of the content that we were expected to know in p-sets and exams. The lectures were very disorganized and tended to rush through major topics which made it hard to follow along with the textbook when the professor's content was insufficient. The discussion sections were a disaster. My section leader (Tolga Koker) was very hostile, unprofessional, and extremely unhelpful. As a result I stopped going to my section and instead better used the time by reviewing the content on my own. The final was extremely difficult. I have spoken with many students and we all agree that none of the lectures, sections, or review sessions prepared us for it. I also have no idea what my grade is and neither does the professor. We are given a percentage grade in canvas but she said to ignore it because she does not know what the curve will be. I truly regret taking this class this semester because I have heard such great things about the fall semester professors. This leaves me to conclude that the problem is not with the class but with the instructors.",
                "this course was not taught well. It was hard to stay engaged. the PowerPoints were hard to follow",
                "This class taught all the basics for an introductory microeconomics course, but I do wish it had been more interactive in terms of sections and doing practice problems. It often felt like we were given so much information and not taught what to do with that/how to apply it to problems.",

                "Penny is a very clear lecturer. She is good at explaining difficult concepts and she also does a good job explaining how intro micro principles apply to real world issues like healthcare, climate change etc. \r\nWeaknesses- idk this is a basic intro econ class so if that doesn't interest you fundamentally then you won't enjoy this. There is definitely some learning curve if you're not a big QR person but also it's very doable to do decently well...I am definitely not a QR person!",
                "The course is a great introduction to microeconomics with a lot of interesting commentary on the content. More discussion about the application of the material could be very nice (e.g., making some, but not all, of the optional readings necessary and covering them a little in discussion section or in lecture).",
                "strengths: great TFs, great prof, systematic homework\r\n\r\nweaknesses: sometimes content + teaching combined make the class a little dull",
                "It was a really good foundational class. The challenge of big lectures though is that student engagement was low and I found it hard to find students that were passionate about learning the concepts.",
                "Strengths: Professor Goldberg is always a win. She gives clear, compelling, amazing lectures and incorporates fascinating real-world examples to ground the often theoretical economic concepts. I found the lectures engaging and pertinent to real-world events.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I found the TAs helpful but the other teaching staff to be quite cold. There was very much a \"fend for yourself\" attitude.",
                "Professor Goldberg was an excellent professor: very knowledgeable and approachable\r\nAdditionally, there were an ABUNDANCE of resources to help you do well, including AMPLE office hours and peer tutor hours before every PSET, midterm or final",
                "Taught well, although I had trouble engaging with the material",
                "Strengths: How well it's organized and how exact it is in deadlines, grading, etc., as well as extra resources made available and really awesome section leaders.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures are boring and not engaging.",
                "The virtual format and teaching style made it very unenthusiastic and somewhat hard to engage with.",
                "There were some real weaknesses to this course. I thought that it was a tough class to focus in especially on zoom, and wasnt engaging enough for me personally. I also found the tests incomparable to the practice tests we were given, which was probably a feature of zoom/open note test taking.",
                "The lectures based on theory were interesting however the tests were too practical and not enough practice done throughout lectures",
                "this course was difficult to engage with, mainly because the online lecture format was something I was not used to",
                "The course often did not relate to test material. I felt like I learned a bunch through the practice tests, problem sets, lecture, discussion sections, textbook, and review sessions. However, all of that content that I mastered outside of examinations was on the tests, yet there was often content I had never been exposed to through the variety of ways I engaged with this course. It is very confusing because I don't understand why you would test on material that had never been explored. More often than not, students with prior experience in economics benefitted from this because of this classes curve, which I think is somewhat classist.",
                "The lectures were somewhat boring and monotone. However, it was well organized and the expectations were clear.",
                "The lectures were not very helpful and it was more beneficial to independently read through the textbook than attend lecture; Exams are very hard; professors not accommodating",
                "I think the strengths of the course were the great lectures by Professor Goldberg, the length of the problem sets, and the availability of office hours. The lectures were very engaging and interesting. The problem sets did not require much time, and there were office hours with peer tutors and economics professors to help you out. This was a class where you could get ample help if you sought it out. I would not necessarily call it a weakness, but I felt like the final was much harder than the midterms and problem sets.",
                "The lectures were very dry, which made it difficult to pay attention in class. Discussion sections were very helpful in understanding the material.",
                "Strengths: I think the peer tutors and resources provided to students to study are very helpful. There are plenty of practice problems and the psets are very helpful in gaining an understanding of the material. \r\nWeaknesses: Personally, the lectures were very unengaging. I found them a bit slow and difficult to get through when trying to review content. The course also picks up quite a bit after the first exam, which isn't necessarily a weakness but it is something to know.",
                "Strengths: the teaching team is very strong and you could get help easily. The course is organized in a way that is not toooo intimidating for beginners although some of the concepts could be a little alien if youve never touched Econ before. Professor Goldberg is pretty clear with stuff.",
                "this class was pretty informative but very boring and not very engaging at all--there could have been more interactive activities (polls) and questions and more examples of applications to real life",
                "I wish there were options for \"section\" earlier in the weeks. Wednesday conflicted with my literature class. Thursday evenings were sub-optimal because I almost always had a long assignment due on Friday mornings. And the Friday options started at 5:30 or 6:00 am my time (PT). This may have just been a problem for me, but I would have preferred other options.",
                "Awful",
                "The lectures did not include a thorough emphasis on problem solving and applying the learned concepts on real life issues. However, the reviews in the beginnings of the lectures were helpful. Time constraint was a significant problem for every single exam administered in the course. If the exam timings are going to be the same in the future, it would be highly beneficial for the instructors to give insights and practice problem solving under a given time.",
                "Strengths: Discussion sections were helpful in dealing with tricky concepts/problems and the math behind topics touched on in class\r\nAt the beginning of lecture, Professor Goldberg always reviewed the previous lecture's material, which was helpful at times.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Both lectures and my discussion section went too fast. I often found myself having to rewatch parts of the lecture that were brushed by way too quickly.",
                "80 minutes of straight lecturing is very exhausting. I would prefer if there was a 5 minute break in the middle of the lecture. Also, we learned a lot about specific economic terms and their mathematical models, but we never really went into depth on what they meant abstractly, or what they mean practically outside of mathematics. Im certain that 70% of the class could not accurately describe what the marginal rate of substitution means in real world terms. The strength of this course is the 15 minutes at the beginning of each class that Professor Goldberg takes to review the previous classs material. That was extremely helpful.",
                "Strengths: Covered a lot of material in the course of one term and did a good job trying to synthesize the material at the end. Weaknesses: Lectures could be quite confusing and the professor often seemed unwilling to give much time to student's questions.",
                "Penny is SUCH a great lecturer. I love how she usually goes over some of the concepts that we've learned in the previous lecture as a refresher, and then dives into new material. However, I feel like outside of class, I wish there was more assistance in terms of more availabilities for office hours from peer tutors.",
                "Instructor/TFs provided very clear explanation for concepts",
                "This course was separated into many well-defined sections which was helpful in learning in the information and the professor slides/lecture outlines were detailed and very helpful for studying. Also, all of the teachers part of the course were very helpful and accessible for questions.",
                "The course could spend a bit less time on case studies but the material was thought clearly.",
                "-all of it was wonderful, greatly designed",
                "I would have liked to see more real world applications of the material",
                "The strength of this class was the quality of the instructors. Penny Goldberg is an outstanding lecturer, and she makes the class interesting. In particular, the undergraduate learning assistant Joe was an absolutely amazing instructor. A weakness could be section turnout -- few people utilized section to the fullest.",
                "Lots of resources outside of class for help. Well organized and structured for units to build off one another.",
                "Strengths were that the course material was covered very in depth so it was easy to understand. A weakness was that it sometimes felt very slow at the beginning of a lecture and very rushed by the end.",
                "A strength is the amount of practice we got as well as how we reviewed the material from past classes as the course progressed. A weakness is the lack of engagement opportunities during lectures.",
                "The lectures were very theoretical. Which is understandable. However, I would prefer more practice questions in the lectures as well. It the examples were side by side with the theory, I am sure I would gain a better understanding of the work and I would perform better in the tests.",
                "The course is well structured so that new material is introduced at a pace that keeps things interesting without it being overwhelming. The sections with the TFs are useful for getting additional practice on concepts you feel shaky on, but they don't provide any additional knowledge or insights if you are understanding the course material.",
                "I found the general atmosphere of the course to be stressful and my section leader, while helpful, was extremely negative, telling us to prepare to fail our exams because they would have to make the exams much harder this semester due to their online format. This was not encouraging. I found the lectures to be hard to follow because they were long and there were days when I wasnt sure the professors heart was really in it. The professors presentation was always somewhat monotonous. I found the final exam to not be very representative of the review sessions (all of which I attended) and felt frustrated by the exam after I had worked so hard all semester and done well (had an A). I also found it difficult to take this class virtually because they were not accommodating of West Coast students (we had to push for the final exam time to be moved to a better time for us)."

It was nice that there were no pre-lecture videos or required readings for the course.

I do not think any improvements could be made in this regard.",

Whether you want to be an economics major or not, this course is very interesting and makes you think about actions taken by companies and governments much differently. You gain a basic understanding of microeconomics, and the course is not particularly hard. I felt that the problem sets were fair and manageable every week. Discussion section is a great way to clear up concerns in the class, and Professors Koker and Morar were great. The midterms were very fair and not too difficult as long as you studied a good amount. However, the final was pretty difficult compared to the other work in the course. However, grades are curved and the course overall is fantastic.",

Penny tries her best to not place emphasis on the mathematics, but more on the concepts, and she is SUCH a great lecturer. She explains things very clearly, and you just learn so much about how economics is applied to the world as a whole--especially towards the end when we learned about insurance and monopoly (regarding patents). I now have a better idea of how the world works and I'm so thankful for that. \r\n\r\nGiven the circumstances of COVID, we had additional support from other professors, however, I would've liked more support on the problem sets if there were more availabilities from other professors or peer tutors. There are however multiple study sessions throughout the semester--take advantage of these and go to office hours!",
