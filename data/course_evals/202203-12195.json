                "I learned a lot about how the legacy of Japanese imperialism persists in East Asia, and how contemporary society is, in many ways, a reflection of the region's colonial past. I also learned how to write short essays effectively, and communicate arguments concisely.",
                "This course was an amazing introduction to the field of anthropology, which I learned about for the first time. Additionally, the course taught me to write concisely  our assignments are very short essays  and this is an extremely valuable skill which I was able to apply to other classes too. Finally, I learned so much about contemporary Japan.",
                "I learned to be more concise with summaries, as it was a skill we worked on frequently for weekly discussion posts. I learned to find my own style of summarization and annotation through the various articles and films we were given to review. In this course, I worked on skills pertaining to film analysis, and journalism, among many other forms of writing. I liked that the materials we reviewed varied in medium, as it made consuming content not only easier to visualize but also gave context to many historical events that we would otherwise have little to no connections to.",
                "I gained a much more comprehensive understanding of Japan and of how to interpret history and recognize the impacts of history in the current day.",
                "I learned about the effect of WWII on Japanese culture. We studied the effect of other major events since then. Read through a variety of sources and discussed in class.",
                "The impact of World War II on modernity in contemporary Japan",
                "This was a great course covering all aspects of Japanese society after World War II. While not technically a seminar, the structure of the course emphasized open discussion and conversation surrounding the weekly readings\/movies. Coming in, I didn't have many expectations for a gut, but I can genuinely say I learned some interesting facts and tidbits surrounding Japanese history. Great hums gut.",
                "I learned so much about post war and contemporary Japan, which I was not at all familiar with before. Beyond that I think the course did an amazing job of showing the important complexities of history.",
                "The ways that the defeat in the WW2 affects Japan today.",
                "I learned about contemporary Japanese history and how it evolved in response to World War II.",
                "Japan's contemporary history, anthropology basics",

                "I learned a huge amount about Japanese history and the moral\/ethical aspect of society.",
                "I learned how to think critically about geopolitical issues that may seem one dimensional. Discussing topics like the 1972 Joint Communique, comfort women, and post-war poverty was extremely insightful experience.",
                "Overview of 20th century Japanese history and the modern day impact it has.",
                "I learned a lot about Japanese history and the ways in which World War 2, specifically, functioned to shape Japanese society into what it is today. I had never taken an anthropology class before, so this class was really interesting to me. I also was pretty unfamiliar with Japan's history, so this class certainly opened my eyes in a number of ways. I really enjoyed the readings, especially since I find socio-political issues to be very interesting. I don't think I learned any particular skills, but I certainly gained a lot of knowledge on issues that I wasn't familiar with prior to taking this class.",
                "Complex understanding of Japanese psyche post war",
                "The lasting impacts of Japan's quest for empirical expansion during WWII and the how contemporary Japanese political mindset and values came to be."

                "Strengths: Professor Koga! She was really knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the course material, and made clear that she really cared about her students. I also enjoyed the weekly discussion posts, as they helped me synthesize my thoughts from our assigned readings and films. Finally, the readings and films themselves were clearly chosen very deliberately to maximize student learning.\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "The only weaknesses are that the professor's directions for assignments are originally unclear. However, she and the TF are always available for questions so in the end I always confidently knew what I was doing. Other than that, I can only think of strengths for this course. It is an amazing introduction to Anthropology and Japan, it teaches valuable writing skills, and it is overall fascinating. The professor is engaging, the TF is great, and the workload is low, although all assignments feel like they have a clear purpose. I learned so much in this class.",
                "This course is very laid back in terms of graded assignments but has more than sufficient content to review every week.",
                "The material is absolutely fascinating, from the readings to the films that Professor Koga assigned.",
                "Really enjoyable class with super fascinating readings and thoughtful, but short assignments. I'd appreciate it if we had more time to cover all the readings we do, but the overall design of the course is really well planned and Prof Yukiko is extremely kind and enthusiastic for a 9am seminar.",
                "Strengths: great professor, great readings and movies to read\/watch\r\nWeaknesses: discussions in class were one-sided, although this is definitely due to students as well.",
                "Strengths: very broad range of readings and movies and topics covered, all with clear connective threads\r\nWeaknesses: probably would be better as a smaller seminar? Would improve engagement in class for sure from students",
                "9am in Watson is tough, but the movies and readings for this course made it all worth it. The lectures can be a bit slow and a repeat of the readings, but this class offers a critical perspective to a very overlooked area and time of history (from the western academic pov). The midterm and final papers are fun and not too stressful.",
                "A big strength of the course is the workload. Since the structure of the class calls for weekly readings\/movies instead of every class, you can put off your weekly discussion post-response until Sunday night. The midterm and final assignments also called for precise writing, rather than pages of work.",
                "The pairings of reading and films that were tied to a weekly theme was a great way to structure the course. Yukiko is so passionate about the topics and it comes through in her lectures.",
                "The readings and movies were interesting and the discussion in class was good. I feel like we often ended up repeating the same ideas though, and I probably learned the most from the history that was discussed in class.",
                "The topics are contemporary which makes them relevant to modern day events. The topics we cover are interesting and we watch great, some films I would watch in my own time. At times some of the topics feel a little repetitive.",
                "Strengths: Incredibly interesting content, great reading\/movie selection\r\nWeaknesses: Could have more structure around in class engagement",
                "Professor Koga has experience from her on-the-ground work in East Asia that enables her to relate to the topics she is teaching about on a deep level, bringing a valuable perspective to the lectures.",
                "Strength was how class was about discussion and we could witness differing perspectives based on the same material. Weakness is that there was low engagement due to it being a discussion-led course with such a high student count.",
                "Readings and movies assigned were interesting, assignments were manageable and interesting. Lectures were good but often rehashed what was in the readings a bit too directly.",
                "It's lecture style without slides which can be a bit hard to follow at times. But overall the prof is very well spoken.",
                "Strengths: Assignments, especially the midterm project, were structured very well for collaboration and reinforcement of learning. \r\nWeaknesses: 9am classroom discussions were at times slow. I would have appreciated small group discussions since this seminar is relatively large.",
                "The class is a little large to be taught in a seminar style, especially when there are no definitive checks on who did the readings or visible participation grades.",
                "The professor was great in providing many views and positions on the complex issues that we discussed in class. However, she could improve by structuring her discussions more concretely. Some times I find myself getting lost in all of the storys that she gives, and it hampers my ability to extract the main idea, and I dont remember much from that particular class.",
                "Great lecturer and the narrative-like style was great. Loved the materials used for the course especially the movie. I would recommend capping the class size and running it almost as a seminar rather than a lecture.",
                "The strengths of this course are its assigned readings and movies. I found all of them to be very interesting and engaging, although I did think it to be too much at times. The main weakness I think would just be the lectures. It was supposed to be some sort of seminar, participation supposedly being a part of our grade, but I felt like the class was not conducive to any form of participation or conversation whatsoever. The lectures themselves weren't the most engaging, and I feel like I really only gained knowledge from the readings rather than from participation in lectures.",
                "S: superb weekly reading material; midterm project was intellectually free; constructive in class discussion; format of essays fall perfectly with reading summaries style\r\nW: lectures were less informative; time slot was not good; lack of clear feedback on canvas",
                "Strengths: Being able to explore the evolution of Japan from WWII to post WWII and modern times through powerful movies and documentaries of their respective time period; the workload was also relatively low which made it easy to balance with other classes"

                "Yes! The course has changed and deepened my understanding not just of Japanese history and society, but also how empire is remembered in contemporary contexts. The class was so thought-provoking that I found myself thinking about course readings again and again throughout the semester.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone, especially students who are interested in Anthropology, Japan, East Asia, or the history of imperialism. I learned so much in this class about the topic and about writing, and I am so glad I took ANTH 213. Our professor is amazing and passionate about her field, and our TF is helpful and interesting. I was never stressed about this course, and I always came to class excited to learn more.",
                "This class is one that I would highly recommend to anyone. As it is an anthropology class, it had elements of history but focused more on cultural and human elements of certain events and periods in Japanese history. I find that this made seminars easier to participate in because there were no particular prerequisites for the course. Those that were more well-informed on history may bring it up during the seminars, but this was not what was expected of general commentary from the class. As such, even making simple observations on articles and films was highly encouraged, and thus, it was easier to engage fully in the seminar.",
                "Yes! The course provides a great, comprehensive look at Japanese history. The readings and films are fascinating to say the least, and Professor Koga is a great lecturer.",
                "Yes. Yukiko was an amazing professor to have. It's clear she cares about the material she teaches, and is academically and personally involved with many of the topics we covered.",
                "Absolutely! Even if you don't have a strong background in Japan\/Asia, this will be a good introduction.",
                "Yes definitely take this course if you are interested in learning more about the nuances of postwar Japan and its relations with other countries! Compared to a history class, this course really looks closely at how an empire actually ends and the aftermath. The readings and movies are all interesting, and Yukiko is highly knowledgeable.",
                "Yes, definitely. I needed a HUMS credit and this was a great easy HUMS credit that was still very interesting. The course can be as engaging and fulling as you want it to be.",
                "Yes, if you are at all interested in Japan this course is a very interesting and thorough way to look at contemporary Japan.",
                "Yes, it was a pleasant experience without too much work and I still learned a lot about modern Japan and the work of anthropologists. Professor Koga's experience working with victim's lawsuits in Asia is amazing.",
                "I would recommend if you are interested in Japanese history. I took L1-L3 Japanese and it was great to learn about the fuller picture of contemporary Japanese history.",
                "Yes. It has great content!",
                "I have always wanted to learn more about contemporary Japan, and what I learned in this class has certainly given me a more informed perspective on the country's past and present. I would certainly recommend this class to those who are looking for a similar experience.",
                "I highly recommend this course to any Korean-American or Korean students or any student who has learned of Japanese history through the lens of the victims. I think that this course widened my perspective on what went on in history and how accountability is not only being asked by East Asian countries but also by people within Japan who recognized the oppression caused by Japanese government. I learned a lot about history from different lens and from people who experienced history differently.",
                "Yes! Prof. Kogas expertise makes the course fascinating and insightful.",
                "This class is pretty light tbh. Aside from lectures there are no tests and only 1-2 essays total. It's really interesting and the professor is well spoken if you're interested in the subject, she is super super knowledgeable and passionate. The class can feel a little dead in the morning but then again it's a lecture. A good gut especially for history and also interesting.",
                "Yes! This class is extremely interesting for those interested in how Japan is the way it is today.",
                "Yes, its a great class to learn about the history and origins behind current Japanese societal and political issues.",
                "Yes, especially for the interesting movies and readings.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student in order to learn about contemporary Japanese society and the ways in which it evolved into how it is today. I think it is kind of basic, common knowledge that everyone should have, especially since so many people engage with Japanese pop culture on a day-to-day basis. Because of this, I think it is a good course, mainly from all of the knowledge you gain from the assigned readings and movies. However, I wouldn't say this was the most engaging or exciting class I've taken at Yale. I really enjoyed the material itself, so I truly wished maybe the class was formatted a little bit differently to make the lectures and assignments more enjoyable.",
                "Yes; I hope to see professor Koga demonstrate her extensive knowledge in Japan through other classes as well; the class was critical to reshaping my opinion of Japan, and I believe it is important for all students to take this course, maybe as a first year seminar",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about not only how Japan has evolved as a nation but as well as the impact it has had on other nations (especially China and Korea); as we se more and more people consuming Japanese media and pop culture, I think this course offers a great amount of insight into how Japan has rebuilt itself and its identity post WWII."
