I found that Irina was much more focused on helping us learn and grow than forcing us into assignments and exams before we were ready. I had so much fun in class every day, and will honestly really miss it. The only weakness I can think of is a lack of communication between the prof and the TF. Often, it was a bit unclear whether we had an assessment, or when that assessment was, due to this lack of communication. But other than that, I loved the class!",

I feel I have a much stronger grasp on the language and grammar.",
                "yes if you enjoy russian language",
                "Absolutely. Irina is an amazing teacher and was extremely kind and understanding throughout the entire class. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in furthering their knowledge of Russian.",
                "Absolutely! This class was my favorite Russian class I've taken at Yale! I felt so actively engaged in my own learning and that of my classmates, and was truly happy to come to class every morning. L3 is also a nice place in the Russian language learning process to really focus on honing your speaking skills and synthesizing written grammar with spoken grammar. It's an excellent course."
