I gained insight about the research of certain speakers here, as well as the opportunities for graduate school. I also learned about a particular area of biomedical engineering I was interested in through one of the projects.",

As someone who is not a BME major, it was not exactly geared towards me, but I still ended up learning a little bit about how biomedical engineering overlaps with other STEM subjects, which was fine considering how chill this class was.",

                "A great overview of paths in BME and interesting discussions.",

            "comments": [
                "More engaging/more interactive so I could have gotten to know the other prospective sophomore majors as part of the class.",
                "The guest lectures were very interesting, but there wasnt much discussion between classmates as is typical of most seminars.",
                "loved the course, great way to introduce and excite people about their major",
                "Strengths: The guest speakers are amazing. I really enjoyed hearing from the professors representing the different concentrations in biomedical engineering, as well as Professor Gonzalez. I became comfortable with approaching professors after class and striking up conversation about their research, and I feel like this class did a good job of encouraging engagement between students and Yale BME faculty. I also liked the assignments. They were very casual and low-stress, but provided an adequate opportunity to engage with BME research and innovation. \r\nWeaknesses: I think the biggest weakness of the class is the class size. The class is called \"Sophomore Seminar,\" but there were a lot of people in this class that it frankly felt more like a lecture. I feel like this class would benefit from an enrollment cap (and opening up multiple sections if necessary), or restricting this course to BME majors (I know quite a few people who were taking this since it was an \"easy\" credit, but had no intention of actually majoring in BME). I also thought that some of the non-Yale guest speakers were lacking and very industry-focused. I would have liked more representation of graduate school panelists since a significant portion of the class was interested in graduate education.",
                "I dont feel like theres other courses like this one that really let you learn about potential career paths. The panels and guest speakers were very useful in learning how people use biomedical engineering and the different paths that people take to get to where they are. I also liked that the class was not too high of a workload.",
                "This course was great; I learned a lot, and found it to be a great break from the demands of my workload.",
                "Strengths: very laid back and not too regimented, which made it nice as a fifth class to take out of interest and exposure to BME rather than a source of stress. KMJ and all the guest speakers were very friendly and supportive.",
                "All the speakers were very good and provided a good overview of career opportunities as a biomedical engineer.",
                "This class had the strength of providing a variety of speakers to offer their advice and experience.",
                "I don't think there were many weaknesses at all. It was super helpful for me and I networked a ton with the individuals that came in.",
                "All strengths, well taught, really liked the guests in the course and the course was designed well",
                "Strengths: Dr. Miller-Jensen was an amazing prof to lead this course. She is so kind and had an amazing way of keeping the guest lectures relevant to the student's goals and interests.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures could get slow at times and near the end of the class a lot of people were not paying attention. Maybe some way to help engagement? Maybe some hands-on or trip-like activities where you visit different labs or industry facilities?",
                "I think that the class was amazingly structured to facilitate learning about the profession, learning about individuals within the profession, and learning general career/ internship advice. I loved how people came in each week to present. However, some presentations were difficult to digest as some of us still do not have great research experience so cannot grasp topics as well--thus, sometimes a simplification of research would have been helpful. The final presentation at the end also resembled more of a high school project. I felt that it wasn't really necessary as submitting a group report would have been easier and just as effective. It also would have created more time to have more people come in and present. I do wish there was a document that contained the contact information of everyone we met that would have been more organized for the course.",
                "It is a bit of a shame that this class is only worth half a course.",
                "Covering the different tracks and having speakers come in was a great combination. I really enjoyed being able to ask them questions. Also, meeting faculty members and hearing about their work was a strength. The course could possibly be improved by having more interaction between people in the class so that we could have more of a chance to engage with our peers in the major.",
                "The largest strength of the course is the eclectic selection of guest speakers, who come from academia and industry, as well as current seniors and recently graduated alumni. Listening to their experiences was immensely edifying, and helped me think about the role that BME graduates can play in the world. One weakness might be that classes aren't always very engaging: it typically followed the format of guest speaker giving a lengthy monologue and taking questions afterward. While this was sometimes effective, and guest speakers on the whole were quite engaging and very passionate about their work, it was also the case that many of those listening stopped doing so halfway through the class. Maybe mixing up the format from time to time and encouraging student participation through hands-on activities would help with engagement.",
                "Strengths: getting a course in BME that isnt a prereq!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think it could do a much better job of getting the students to know one another. Because its not a huge major, and because we will be taking classes together for the next three years, I think it would have been a lot more beneficial and I would have gained a lot more from the course if I had gotten to know my classmates more."

This course made me learn more about myself and what I think my role in biomedical engineering could look like in the future. Do yourself a favor and take this class.",
                "If you are a BME major or considering it, definitely. If you are at least vaguely interested in BME and need a chill half-credit, this is the class for you. You will have a very light workload from this class so if you're on the fence, may as well just take it.",
                "Yes. It provided a lot of good information and I found the readings and speakers to be concise, informational, and effectual.",

                "Yes, but only to a BME student as it was especially designed for BME sophomores. I do not think someone from another major would have found this course useful. For a BME student though, I find this to be a practical, easy course for those simply looking to learn more about the major. If they don't already, I think all majors should have a course like this one.",
                "This class is mandatory for students majoring in biomedical engineering but I do believe it to be worthwhile regardless.",
                "I would 100% recommend it to anyone thinking about BME  the course is extremely helpful for understanding the field.",
                "It's a low-workload course with a lot of interesting guest speakers. Would highly recommend for BME sophomores thinking about doing research/internships in the summer. Also a great class to get career advice from people in academia and industry.",
                "Yes. If youre not a BME major, its still interesting, although it doesnt fulfill any distributional requirements."
