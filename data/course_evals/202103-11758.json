                "This course really teaches you how to be a better writer. By writing the five essays, which all had pretty distinct prompts, I learned how to better edit my essays and efficiently a write a first and second draft.",
                "This course honestly completely changed the way I approach writing essays. I learned how to facilitate an experience for a reader instead of simply narrating my own reflections. I explored the difference between implicit and explicit analysis, and experimented with weaving implicit arguments into my essays. I learned how to write without hyperbole and exaggerationwhile those can be effective in certain modes of writing (satire, for example), I realized my writing could be much more powerful without them. I developed my ability to revise my work, applying feedback from workshop and office hours.",
                "We read modern essays in many different styles to showcase what a non-fiction creative essay can look like, and we talked about the techniques that the authors employed to make their essays so successful. The course also teaches you to read closely and examine structure, literary devices and historical context",
                "I greatly improved my writing and learned many new literary techniques. I consider myself to be a more mature writer after this course.",
                "I learned to write a variety of different types of essays through this course. Through the feedback we received from workshops and edits, I learned how to apply some of the writing techniques and styles we observed in our readings to my own pieces. There were edits I received that pointed out things in my writing that I hadn't even noticed before, which made me pay attention to the details more as well. The readings we discussed in class also helped me develop my close reading skills and notice different styles, tones, literary devices, etc. that the authors used.",
                "I was exposed to a wide variety of techniques and styles that I had not been previously exposed to. I learned to read, analyze, critique different pieces of writing and implement the styles into my own writing.",
                "This course sharpened my writing skills in all the ways I needed and beyond. I gained the ability to use language precisely, craft better structures for essays, and get my point across more economically. I also feel that my close reading skillsboth of established authors and of my peersbecame more keen as the semester went on.",

                "I learned different techniques about how to write a creative nonfiction essay. This was a new type of writing for me which allowed for lots of growth in the many forms of creative nonfiction. The concepts of defamiliarization, game, and show don't tell."

            "comments": [
                "The course readings alone taught me a lot about writing professionally. I appreciate the discussion-based classes where we could voice our own thoughts on the material, sometimes challenging the professor's assessment of a piece. The writing workshops were incredibly helpful and encouraged engagement with my peers' writing.\r\nI think there are a few days where we had too much reading for homework. As a result, we weren't able to discuss every essay, which is a shame because there are some really complex pieces that did not get to enter the conversation.",
                "Strengths of this course included the breadth of essays we read, the workshop experience, and the open-ended/student-led nature of our in-class discussions. \r\n\r\nPotential weakness: The format of this course lended itself to some students participating a lot and others not at all. I'm not sure how this could be addressed, and do think it may just depend on the group's dynamic (e.g. how many loud vs quiet voices there are).",
                "The course is extremely versatile and very engaging. The essays I read in class felt extremely relevant and were super interesting. I loved the course because I had the chance to read many different styles of creative non-fiction writing, and I thought the readings were great. English 120 is a lot of work, but its worth it!",
                "This course was fantastic, no complaints.",
                "I enjoyed the discussions we had in class. I was fortunate to be in a class where all my classmates were also engaged and involved in the discussions, as well as an amazing instructor who was able to lead those discussions and help us reach important concepts/patterns in the readings. The workshops were also helpful, because I was able to get feedback from all my classmates and see the general trends of areas in my essay that people thought were strong or needed improvement. There were definitely a couple times throughout the semester where I was not able to finish all my readings before class when there was just a lot of work piled on (like midterm seasons), so there definitely were some heavy readings.",
                "One strength of this course is the fact that students write 5 different types of essays. I wrote a profile essay, a place essay, a satire piece, and more, and due to the fact that the prompts were so different, I was able to improve on different aspects of my creative writing. I think some weaknesses of the course is that it for the most part, only covers more recent essays. We read a few older pieces from James Baldwin, but other than that, they were relatively recent. The course could be improved by potentially including older essays in the curriculum that way we are exposed to even more techniques.",
                "The professor and syllabus for this course were extremely strong. The readings were engaging, helpful, and insightful. I would have read the essays we were assigned on my ownI never felt as though the readings were grueling to get through. Professor Millner led the class through difficult readings so that we would parse the language for the most meaning and to help our writing. Additionally, she created a truly joyful classroom. At times the disparities between deadlines for the various essays made some due dates feel as though they were approaching faster than others.",
                "The course does a wonderful job of explaining great ideas, various writing tools and how to deploy them in personal pieces. It truly makes you look at writing differently.",
                "strengths: Maggie Millner is very attentive and willing work to with students inside and outside the classroom. Very knowledgable!\r\nweakness: Participation is sometimes forced and rather tough grading on papers",
                "I really loved taking this course. I found the readings to be interesting and the essays to be compelling. Class discussions were enjoyable. It was definitely a course where you could get as much out of it as you were willing to give.",
                "Strengths were the constant engagement with quality writing and the process of turning in a draft and receiving feedback. Sometimes discussions would focus more on the content of the essays and less on their writing strategies."

This course transformed the way I write and gave me such an appreciation for literary essays. I left it a much more confident writer and thinker. The small-group environment was conducive to compelling discussions.",

                "Yes, 100%. If you are looking for a writing course to take, I highly recommend this one. It's relatively less work (obviously you do have to put in work, but the actual workload isn't bad at all), and honestly really enjoyable. I guess this depends more on how your instructor runs the class, but the discussions are very engaging and the readings are not super boring either for the most part. My instructor was also super understanding (I had to ask for extensions while I was sick, and she was very supportive and kind). Even comparing my experience with other friends who took different sections of English 120, I don't think I've spoken to one person who took this course and said they hated it.",
                "I would most certainly recommend this course to another student and, as a matter of fact, I have already convinced my roommate to take it next semester. I learned to improve on my creative writing skills, which was a great challenge seeing as I had mostly only done rhetorical, expository pieces of writing in the past.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the professor and the syllabus were extremely strong and I felt as though the course was enjoyable to do work for and to attend. Also, the skill for writing a creative non-fiction is so important and universal.",
                "I cant recommend this course enough; it expands horizons, changes your outlook towards writing, provides you insights into what other people think about your work, and develops fundamental skills to improve everything you write.",
                "Yes, tough English course but well worth it. I felt like I improved a lot as a writer.",
                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely! I think this is a class that everyone at Yale should take. Understanding ho to write personal essays and share information in a compelling way is a necessary skill.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who wants to improve their creative nonfiction writing or to someone who wants to engage with excellent nonfiction essays. I would not recommend it to someone who wants to learn writing more generally."
