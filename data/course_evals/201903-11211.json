   "comments": [
    "Learned how to write better and analyze music better",
    "Close reading and literary analysis of texts involving music and literature, writing\/argumentation skills.",
    "I learned about classical music, literature, and how to analyze art.",
    "I learned how to read Literature closely and form logically sound arguments that are always backed by evidence. I learned to approach music from a literary perspective, and vice versa, to gain a deeper appreciation for, and understanding of both art forms.",
    "This course broadened my knowledge of classical music as well as adding to my repertoire of literary classics. I improved my skills in close reading and essay writing as well. The different papers I wrote all worked on core skills in academic writing, including close reading and using theoretical works to bolster my arguments.",
    "I greatly improved my writing in general, but especially my ability to read a passage closely and analyze more thoroughly.",
    "Writing effectively and analytically.",
    "I learned how to look at music from a literary lens and look at literature from a musical lens. This course also introduced me to the Yale library and how to find sources. You'll learn how to write a Yale paper.",
    "I was exposed to some really cool texts. Most of the insights and knowledge came from my own individual work and interpretation and not from the class.",
    "I learned how to deeply analyze nont-traditional texts such as a symphony, a ballet, or a movie. I also improved my writing skills.",
    "I learned about how music and literature relate to each other. I learned about the prescience of music in literature and how they both influence each other.",
    "I learned how to better closely analyze texts, how to write more clearly and develop my arguments, and how to strengthen my theses and topic sentences",
    "I gained several skills I would not have expected after the course. It has given me a new perspective and lens to view art, literature, and music. It has heightened my appreciation for both classical and more contemporary music. Similarly, I learned the side of literature that interests me the most and through the variety of literature read in the course, I have found a style that I enjoy. I have learned how to critically pick apart passages of literature and pieces of music and how to interconnect the two."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "it was for the most part good! more time with peer review, probably",
    "Strengths: Many of the texts that we read were very interesting, and Professor Skorupa is a really great instructor. She helped guide class discussions very well, and I feel that I gained a lot of insight from our discussions. The course also helped prepare me for college-level writing and analysis. We also took a few fun field trips (to YUAG and New York City) that helped give us a new perspective on course content. The class also felt like a close community, which was definitely helpful as a first-year.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course was a bit disorganized in terms of content, but this was probably just because it was the first time the course was being offered.",
    "The class was interesting and engaging, but the courseload was really intense and we didn't spend enough time on the material we received as homework.",
    "Everything we read in this class was super interesting, and getting to choose both the topics and the texts on which we would write allowed us to further explore something of interest or a class discussion that particularly intrigued us.\r\nGiven the amount of reading we had, along with the difficulty of writing literary papers, the workload of this course was higher than that of any course I had taken before (the workload was definitely manageable, but don't expect to be able to throw together a paper from scratch in just a few hours). \r\nAt some points I did wish we could spend more time talking about each work (some class discussions didn't get too in depth because of time constraints, ex. we definitely could've spent several class periods on just a single section of Proust), and having less reading might help make the workload more manageable as well.",
    "The course was fascinating, both in subject matter and discussions. Professor Skorupa did an excellent job organizing field trips to the YUAG and to the MET Museum and MET Opera in New York City, which were all amazing experiences to have that added a great deal to my understand of the texts I read. The only downside I can think of for this course was that the canvas page could be confusing and contradictory at times, creating some logistical confusion about due dates and assignment instructions.",
    "I think that the course does a great job at looking at the idea of music in a new light. However, I felt we didn't go in depth enough on the describing music aspect ourselves. Additionally, at times the course felt a bit unstable. Classes would go over time and we would have discussed half of what we were supposed to. A few passages that we were told to read were never discussed in class. Finally, some of the books we were told to read would have very little to no focus on music, making it feel pointless at times to read considering the main objective of the course.",
    "The course was paced well as the papers were evenly spaced out throughout the semester. Sometimes the readings were assigned in a short period of time so it was a little overwhelming.",
    "Weaknesses: There is a lot of reading for this course and papers. A LOT of Orpheus. You don't really know your grades because she doesn't post them online, so you have to go to office hours which are typically super busy and always behind. \r\nStrengths: Prof Skorupa is very flexible and understanding when it comes to deadlines, especially because this class was brand new. The other students were great and discussions were always insightful. The trip to NYC was a lot of fun, too.",
    "The workload was much more than any other class that Ive had and so the class became more about reading as much as possible than understanding the readings. The strength of the course is that people who are interested in music with cool opinions will sign up, but the course itself didnt take advantage of what everyone had to offer. Further, the choice of texts was also very interesting - there just were too many. The feedback I received on my writing was extremely passive as well.",
    "This course has the benefit of being unique. No where else can one take this same course. A weakness that this course had was its structure, or lack thereof. I understand that taking a new course entails some uncertainties and changes, but very rarely was I clear about what was expected of me in this course. This could be improved by following a syllabus. Another weakness of the course was the fact that the first draft of each paper was included in the final grade with the same weight as the final draft. A first draft should be in place for a student to explore a possibility for a paper, not as a dominating part of the final grade. The grade for the first draft could be a completion grade separate from the final draft grade or a smaller percentage of the final grade, but certainly not fifty percent of the final grade.",
    "I feel that some of the texts were interesting such as the awakening and the Proust. However some I thought were not very relevant to the course even though they may have been interesting.  I think some of our discussions were interesting and very intellectual. However I would have liked if they were more like Socratic seminars where we speak to each other and respond to each Instead of raising our hands to ask a question to someone elses response or respond. In addition, some of the texts were too long and were not relevant to the course.",
    "We did not get through all the readings and for some of the ones we did get through, we did not go as in-depth as I wish we had. Especially since we had a lot of reading per class, I found myself skimming some sections which defeated the purpose of close reading. Also, toward the end of the semester, everything felt a bit crammed and we had papers one right after the other. However, class discussions were productive, and we had a lot of student participation. I loved the film screenings and visits to New York and YUAG, and our class felt like family.",
    "The strength of this course lies in its variety. There are days where we sit and discuss literature we have read or music we have listened to in the classroom, but there are also day we go to art museums or libraries, have speakers, go outside and incorporate the environment into our discussion, and go to an opera. The texts and music we see from this course reflect this variety. They both draw from both classical and contemporary periods and from all different types of styles. This course could be improved in the way that it feels for some students. While some days fit well with what I wanted from the course, other days felt to me as if they weren't as strong because they strayed a little too far from the theme or topic for the day. Also, the course could be improved by having a stronger-defined plan in mind as some days were very free in the sense that there was no clear material for the day."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "yep. fun, and taught a lot.",
    "Yes, if they like music history and\/or reading. The course is a lot of reading and writing, and if it isn't something that they particularly enjoy, then they might not like the class. On the other hand, if they are interested in music history, then they will probably gain new perspectives on the role of literature in music (and vice versa, of course).",
    "If someone is willing to do the reading, I would recommend it. But, if the workload cannot be managed then I do not.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student with a strong passion for either music or literature, and at least an interest in the other. If this sounds like you, take this course. Music and Lit was unlike any class I had taken before, and exploring the interplay between the two forms gave me a whole new perspective from which to approach each (ex. being a musician, I found it eye-opening to really dive into the literary influence on music, and how an understanding of literature can improve one's understanding of certain musical works). The workload may feel like a lot, though it'll definitely teach you what it's like to be in a college writing course. \r\n\r\nIf you have only a moderate interest in either music or literature (or a strong interest in just one), you might find that this course improves your understanding and appreciation for both. If you're a slow reader or writer though, this course may not feel like it's worth the amount of effort you have to put in.",
    "Absolutely! This course was fantastic. I could not recommend it enough. Especially for people that are interested in classical music, this course is very interesting. Even for those that aren't musical, the course would be very enjoyable, and really gets at the heart of human emotion and what music and literature really mean to us. 10\/10 excellent course.",
    "I would recommend this to any student that is not too comfortable with their writing skills and enjoys music in some aspect. The professor gives clear feedback on papers and is always willing to help if you arrange an appointment.",
    "I would recommend to anyone with a passion for music.",
    "Yes, this is a great class to take even if you don't have a background in music. Prof Skorupa is very good about making the course first-year oriented-- meaning that she introduced us to Yale resources and gave us opportunities to talk about the Yale experience in general.",
    "The course needs to undergo some major changes. Only then would I recommend for another student to take the course.",
    "If you are interested in music and how music influences literature and vice versa, then yes. If you also want a lot of practice in writing then yes.",
    "yes, definitely. Its a lot of work but its worth it and you meet so many great students. Go to office hours and utilize the Poorvu writing center resource, and your writing will definitely improve",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. This course fit exactly what I was looking for as a first-year in a Yale course. The material was something I had not really thought of before arriving and started as a course to fill a writing requirement. However, it led to me developing an interest for the course and the applications to both modern music, literature, and art and their interconnections. It also has a good amount of variety that I was not expecting in a seminar course in the sense that we took trips to go to museums or libraries that allowed me to think of the course in a different way."
