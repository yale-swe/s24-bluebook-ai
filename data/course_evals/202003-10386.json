Perhaps a little more active engagement in lecture wouldn't have hurt, but the main thing was learning from Professor Bushkovitch's wealth of knowledge, so the lecture style was definitely the right one.",
                "There are no intrinsic weakness in this course. It is simply that lecture courses as whole dont engage me intellectually on the same level as a seminar, and that effect is increased when the whole course is online. The discussion sections were fruitful and the lectures were informative but easy to digest."
