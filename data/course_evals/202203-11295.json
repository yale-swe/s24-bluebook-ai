                "The biggest strength was Prof. Toorawa and the way he structured the class. While the reading load was a lot, you could also get away with not doing all of it (which sounds bad but really means you could do as much as you could but focus on learning rather than stressing for a grade). He also put an emphasis on creative assignments which was soooo refreshing and necessary. A weakness would be confusion sometimes about what I was MEANT to be learning. But that's also the way we've been conditioned to think about school, which is part of what this class gets you to challenge/question.",
                "Strengths: it was a very, very nice time. Conversations were always great and fun, and the assignments provided a wonderful opportunity to \"think outside the box\" and not worry about pointless formalities (the assignments are very well designed and really encourage creative thinking!). The biggest strength was the amazing selection of readings!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the biggest weakness was that the class only met once a week, and therefore the discussions about these great works of literature was superficial, lacked more depth... but I think that was it!",
                "Dr Toorawa is a really great guy and he makes class fun. His whole method is very unorthodox, however, which makes things interesting but not necessarily the best for learning. The class met only once a week, which made things difficult. Nobody had much experience with these texts, so most questions in the seminar were surface-level and didn't go anywhere. One class a week dedicated to lecturing on the material would have been beneficial, followed by a seminar in which we could discuss ideas.\r\nThe syllabus was also hit-and-miss. Some of the reading choices were great, such as the weeks on Arabic poetry and Sufi mysticism. Other selections were practically unheard of, and didn't really suit the survey style of the course.\r\nThe work consisted of eight thought papers, half of which could also be artistic creations. While it was fun to be able to respond with a drawing, I would've preferred a couple of serious papers so that I could really get to grips with an idea. As it is, I felt like I wasn't able to form any lasting ideas about the readings. The final was a sculpture followed by a write-up on it. Again, I like the philosophy of this idea, but it was a little disappointing not to have any academic work to be proud of at the end of the semester.",
                "I loved the course format with thought papers and outside lectures. It was a fun, relaxed, and interesting course. However, I felt like, all in all, we didn't engage very much with the texts compared to other lit classes I've taken. This was partly because classes often felt more like participatory lectures rather than a discussion, due to a very large class size for something that should be a seminar. Discussions sometimes felt unproductive or insubstantial, which was unsatisfying to read a book and then feel like I didn't get as much out of it as I should. As much as I liked the freedom of the course, I think I would have gotten more out of a more focused syllabus and discussion.",
                "The lectures are not engaging enough. Toorawa is a wonderful and undeniably knowledgeable lecturer, but I find myself wanting to discuss more of the 400+ page reading we did. This may be an issue of time constraint in the class this semester and its once-a-week nature. Perhaps a bit more intellectual guidance in taking down this giant works would have helped students digest and internalize these works better.",
                "Strengths: course instructors very invested in what they are teaching and passion carries the class, selections are for the most part very interesting\r\nWeaknesses: this is inevitable, but by nature of it being a survey class without a lecture, discussion is minimal and we move through each topic quickly",
                "Strengths: Dr. T, interesting readings, the option to do more creative responses instead of a paper every week, the final project was really fun.\r\nWeaknesses: Readings sometimes felt excessive to the point where I (and others) didn't do them all every week, readings were a little disjointed (however, this is the first year of the class, so I am sure that will improve next year)."

                "It's a get out as much as you put in kind of class. If you're unaccustomed to thinking outside of the box or creatively I definitely recommend. Prof. Toorawa teaches more about life than literature, per se.",
                "Yes, definitely! The reading selection is absolutely amazing, and the conversation and atmosphere is really good. Be prepared to read a lot!",
                "I would recommend another class with Dr Toorawa, just not this one. He's very knowledgeable and makes class an absolute joy, I just think the format and content of this class were a bit disappointing.",

                "I would recommend it! I got to be exposed to a lot of literature I hadn't read before and learned a lot of history. The option to do creative projects for the response papers and the 3D final project helped me engage with the material much more than I would have otherwise, and I had a lot of fun doing them. Dr. T is an absolute gem, go to his office hours at Maison Mathis even if you don't have a specific question -- he is happy to just chat!"
