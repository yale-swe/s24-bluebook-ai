Now I just need to expand my vocabulary and study irregular conjugations.",

                "Strengths: Supersite, cultural lessons \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Speaking practice, lots of assignments that are worth virtually nothing",
                "Sections that allow a greater range of speaking with students and TAs would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: I liked the Supersite and structure of the class generally. The asynchronous class on Wednesday with the discussion post was also nice and appreciate that it was structured around learning cultural elements / ideas we haven't seen in class.",
                "Strengths:\r\n* I like how discussion-based and collaborative this course is. It is good that we can talk to our peers and learn from each other and practice our Spanish improvement. I like that out final project was a group project, and I enjoyed working with my partners a lot.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n*Because we covered so much content throughout the course, I feel that the harder content was glossed over more than it should have been- especially towards the end.\r\n\r\n* I completely understand why Profe Russell talked in Spanish the whole time because that is how we learn. But if there are words we have not learned in Spanish yet, I feel as though what is said in Spanish would be clarified in English immediately after. For example, I would sometimes feel lost because Profe would tell is instructions for a Canvas assignment or class assignment in Spanish, but I didnt understand what he really said at all.",
                "This course did a great job of introducing concepts, however, I feel that there were a few weaknesses. First, the amount of study time before exams was very short (we were often notified of exams only 2 or 3 days prior), thus, memorizing vocabulary can be very hard. Second, I wish there was more accountability for memorizing Spanish vocabulary (like weekly quizzes or a timeline for when we should know certain things). Third, I found the asynchronous Wednesdays to be largely ineffective. I wish there was more time spent on revising concepts and incorporating those into the Wednesday lessons, rather than writing in English mostly. \r\n\r\nThere were a number of strengths, too! The smaller class size allowed for us to communicate and practice Spanish more, supersite was a very effective way of learning prior to classes, and Linguameeting was a great way to self-check our proficiency. I do think, though, that communicating with Spanish tutors at Yale or with fluent Spanish-speakers on campus would be more economical than purchasing Linguameeting sessions."

The class is pretty interesting and the course is structured in a way to facilitate engagement. Also, if you have Ian Russell he is super kind and helpful.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student; It is definitely manageable. The only thing is that it is hard to keep up with Canvas assignments because their due dates are random. At first, I thought that the class was structured to where we only had asynchronous Canvas assignments on Wednesday, and then it seemed that it randomly switched up at a certain point- things were suddenly due on Tuesdays and Thursdays that I originally was not aware of.",
