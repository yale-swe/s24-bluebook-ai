                "Taking this course allowed me to apply my existing neuroscience knowledge to fascinating concepts of human interaction and sociality. In addition to exploring countless research papers and studies, our class was able to form new hypotheses, discuss our curiosities, and apply our knowledge to facets of everyday life (particularly social media and its neurological effects). This course both galvanized and expanded by neuroscience knowledge, and I possess a stronger understanding of the fascinating, hidden processes that govern our everyday interactions.",

                "I found no weaknesses with this course, rather I thoroughly enjoyed all of the material and the way in which it was taught by Dr. Crockett. This course does a fantastic job of presenting interesting facts and ideas regarding neuroscience which allows its students to engage with the material in new and exciting ways which are both intellectually challenging and thought-provoking.",
                "Virtual lectures were good, but it was hard to stay engaged over Zoom",
                "Great course! One strength was that we covered a wide variety of social interactions/dynamics-- both positive and negative-- so we weren't too narrowed in on one topic. Not many weaknesses to speak of!",
                "This course was exceptional in a multitude of ways, including its organization, breadth, depth, relevance of content, applicability to modern society, student involvement, and academic rigor. The papers on the syllabus were intriguing and well-selected, and the course assignments and assessments accurately reflected what we learned in class. I find it difficult to point out any glaring weaknesses; this was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
                "The material in this class is already pretty interesting as-is because of its relevance to our every day lives, but Prof Crockett did an excellent job of making it even more interesting by embedding video clips within lessons that demonstrated the phenomena we were studying, whether through a ted talk or through a social experiment. Prof Crockett was also very accommodating of extenuating circumstances while making sure that the rigor of class was still up to par with Yale standards. The only weakness I can think of is that the lectures can be a bit dry because there is sometimes minimal interaction, but I also appreciated that Prof Crockett gave everyone opportunities to participate by asking people to respond in the chat but didn't force anyone to participate if they didn't want to.",
                "The professor and TA team were very well organized and very knowledgeable on the content they were presenting! Each class, Prof Crockett provided us with a \"pop quiz\" that was ungraded but was REALLY helpful with gauging how well we were understanding the material. I only wish I could have taken this course in person! I am sure that my engagement would have been even higher then.",
                "Lectures were great; I liked the quizzes at the beginning of each class. Our professor always answered our questions.",
                "Loved Prof Crockett and the TAs!!  Genuinely kind.  Might have liked a bit more guidance bc I did feel lost at times but their compassion for the class meant a lot.",
                "Dr. Crockett had us do breakout room discussions at the start of class, which were fantastic. At time it felt like we were learning just associations between brain regions and behavior, though (and less about why activity in these regions is important)",
                "-The lecture material was very intersting",
                "Strengths were definitely the material itself! The social brain is fascinating!",

                "Molly Crockett was a great professor and clearly very knowledgeable about this subject. She made the lectures engaging and the TF's were also fantastic. The primary weaknesses had more to do with the virtual nature of the course than anything else.",

                "Only strengths come to mind -- the material was so interesting, I felt like every lecture was a TED talk and I would rewatch them for fun. Exams and grading were incredibly fair, if not generous. Not to state the obvious, but it could only be improved if it were in person.",
                "Strengths: The final exam was made optional which was significant as it lifted off a burden for a lot of students. There was also time in the beginning of lecture where we reviewed material from last lecture that was very helpful.",
                "The strength of this course is the lecture content and reading material - Professor Crockett organizes the class wonderfully so that concepts build on each other as the semester progresses. At some points however, I did feel that the class went too quickly.",
                "Strengths: the material was fascinating, Prof. Crockett and the TF's were all incredibly supportive and kind, and the class was structured at a really great pace.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't really enjoy the breakout rooms in the beginning of every class... sometimes most people would keep their cameras and microphones off for the whole time and it would get a little bit awkward.",
                "The course was great! I really don't have many constructive things to say. My engagement was a medium not because of Professor Crockett or the course material but because of the nature of spring semester and zoom learning. I was just so tired and defeated from the past year that by the end of the semester I couldn't find the energy to attend lecture live and just watched the recordings. The lectures themselves were structured very well! Occasionally I felt that a study was introduced and explained too quickly but for the most part I really enjoyed lecture and Professor Crockett's teaching style."

Students were able to ask questions in real time, and we were often able to engage in new and exciting conversations that would not have occurred asynchronously.

                "This was bar none the BEST course to take in this trying semester. My personal life was in shambles this semester, as were many of my peers', and Prof Crockett clearly took our struggles to heart and adapted the demands of the course to help improve the wellbeing of her students. No other Professor demonstrated this level of care and compassion. She even made the final optional -- waving a magic wand for all of us that cared about the class deeply, but were struggling to make it through the semester. Exemplary professor and human being. I am her biggest fan.",

It gives both an introspective and retrospective view of the world in which we live, and it allows its students to fully grasp the material for which they are being taught while also allowing for questions that transcend the material through speculation from accumulated knowledge within the course. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will be recommending it to all of my friends and peers.",

Whether students are interested in neuroscience, psychology, sociology, or pure human interaction (which is inherently applicable to life itself), this course provides an excellent intellectual experience. The topics are both interesting and relevant, the studies are fresh and well-designed, and the final paper (which has students analyze a social media app from a social neuroscience perspective) is genuinely fun to work through. A wonderful course.",
