                "Strengths: Prof Hgglund is very dedicated to the material. He really cares a lot and he has a really extensive knowledge of the text. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We did not cover all of the topics on the syllabus, which often had to have edits, while Hgglund is usually a clear lecturer he does move rather slow. There was not a good opportunity to actually discuss the text itself (I'm glad others in the future will have a lecture + section format as this was a seminar slot but lecture took place the whole time) and I think we ran out of time at the end of the semester, so there was not much of a thread woven between all the distinct weeks in an explicit way. Also, the 70% final paper and 30% participation divide was not something that completely bothered me but it can be a challenge for those who like lots of assignments.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hagglund is an expert, who is excellent at answering questions and clarifying ideas. His Powerpoints were incredibly clear and helpful,  and his handouts greatly supported my understanding of the material. You get such a special opportunity at engaging deeply with a great work of philosophy with a stellar philosopher professor.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses!",
                "The course is well-organized to facilitate learning; the reading is manageable and discussion goes deep.",
                "Would have loved to get through more of the book but Prof Hagglund made the dense and quite difficult text very clear and understandable",
                "Strengths: Hgglund is a fantastic lecturer and thinker with an original interpretation of Being and Time. The syllabus and secondary readings are fantastic.\r\nWeaknesses: nothing about the content of the class. The only negative is that meeting only once a week can make it difficult to keep momentum if a lecture is cancelled/you have to miss a class.",
                "This course had a nice week-to-week workload in terms of readings. \r\nOne difficulty that I had with this course pertained to how the syllabus kept being modified, and sometimes I felt that lectures didn't match up with the readings for that week because we were catching up on the previous week's topics.",
                "This course was fantastic--I enjoyed every aspect of it. Professor Hagglund is the most engaging philosophy lecturer that I've had (and as a former DSer, I've seen a large number of different professors give lectures!). Hagglund was able to distill Heidegger into the clearest language possible, while clinging to all of the subtleties in Heidegger's philosophy. Professor Hagglund also met with us one-on-one for our papers; these meetings were invaluable for understanding Heidegger at the deepest level, and for challenging our readings of Heidegger. Hagglund is the best!!!",
                "It would be great to have a bit more discussion time in class, even though it is a lecture I think having more time to discuss specific parts of the readings would be really helpful. Sometimes it felt like it would be good to be more rooted in specific parts of the texts."

                "The physical workload of the course as a seminar was less than a standard Yale course but the intellectual capacity needed when approaching SZ and the supporting John Haugeland readings is much, much more. I have never read readings so slowly. I think that I would recommend the course to another student but I can admit that by the end of the semester, I was a bit bored because it just got so abstract and disconnected. That being said, SZ is an essential text for anyone interested in continental philosophy, or honestly normative life itself, so it is really nice to have a better understanding of it. I do not read German but if you can that probably also makes the course much better.",
                "I would-- it's a great course to begin understanding Heidegger",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, although the paper being worth 70% of your grade is certainly a consideration.",
                "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Must-take for philosophy majors, and still 100% worth it for non-majors. Hgglund is amazing and manages to make this traditionally obscure and difficult text relevant and captivating. Any class by him is worth taking.",
                "If a student is looking to understand more about Heidegger or just interested in an innovative approach to understanding the world, I would recommend this course.",
                "Absolutely, 100% Hagglund is the best philosophy professor that I've had, and Heidegger is really a blast to read once you've understood the basic concepts and neologisms he uses in his writing. If you are even remotely interested in Heidegger, there is no better introduction than Hagglund's class.",
                "Yes! This was one of my favorite courses Ive taken at Yale. It is great if you have a philosophy background or are just interested in expanding your worldview!"
