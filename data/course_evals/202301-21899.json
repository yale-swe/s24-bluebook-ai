                "Excellent course instructor and support from TA and Chris. Really enjoyed hearing the insightful observations and conversations that occurred naturally in class between all of us.",
                "The course has a detail-oriented approach to reading papers, which was beneficial for my understanding of complicated biology publications.",
                "Only 1 (maybe 2) papers per week, so you can really read them in-depth and come to class prepared. Also, discussions would take up the whole 2 hr class period just for 1 paper, meaning that the discussion wasn't rushed and you could really learn about papers well.",
                "Strengths: The teaching team was great and knowledgeable! The workload was fair, and the papers were very interesting to read. Weaknesses: Maybe doing an quick overview of common statistical tools used in genetics research may be helpful. We had talked about a ton in class, but doing a quick lecture with them might help pack down the material more!",
                "Strengths: course format is highly adaptable and allows us to discuss very current literature\r\nWeaknesses: it would have been good to have \"crash courses\" on topics, techniques, or methods of statistical analysis that come up frequently in papers but might not have been taught to all students in prior classes.",
                "This is unlike any other course at Yale you get the full seminar experience of discussing papers without the added pressure of written assignments. Highly recommend. The teaching team is also fantastic.",
                "I think it was perfect as it was",
                "If it can be fit into class time, an in-depth explanation of a major genomics technique at the beginning of each class might help students solidify their understanding of genomics research methodologies since we don't always get the chance to dive into discussions about the specific tools that the researchers use.",
                "The course was very easygoing, and Professor Dellaporta created a friendly environment in which students could express confusion without feeling like they would be berated or judged by their fellow classmates. Having only one paper to read each week meant we could focus on it and dedicate the proper amount of time to understanding it, rather than aimlessly skimming. I can't think of any weaknesses except that the class itself was later in the day, so when the sun set, everyone's energy dropped (but that's not a weakness of the class itself, just its timeslot)."

                "Yes! It's difficult to get into because it's limited to around 15-18 students, but if you get in, definitely take it! Especially if you are any type of STEM major, it's a super helpful class to learn how to read scientific literature and learn about different genomics techniques (GWAS, sequencing, etc.)",

                "Yes! If you can get into this class, I highly recommend taking it.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! It's structured in such a way that it first and foremost ensures that the students learn the material by providing an environment where learning is the main objective and takes away the other stress that might be associated with it. It was a safe and fun space and I looked forward to going to class each Monday because of it.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in human genetics/genomics and would like to take an in-depth look at the research currently going on in the field!",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course because I learned a lot about the current state of genomics research and technologies and the questions that might be open for future researchers to tackle. Professor Dellaporta picks papers from across a range of fields in human genomics, including medical genetics, population genetics, and evolutionary genetics, so I got a sense of how the research differs between each field and which one I might be most interested in. The seminar format encouraged students to have a strong understanding of the motivations and methods behind each figure and made the class more engaging.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this class to anyone that wants to learn more about genetics or generally how to read a scientific paper! I went in with little experience with scientific work, and I stated that in my application; Professor Dellaporta helped me a lot in navigating dense papers, and our teaching assistants were phenomenal."
