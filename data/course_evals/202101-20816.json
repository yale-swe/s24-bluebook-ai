It really felt like all of the material was actually geared around learning, which isn't true for a lot of courses.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI wish less time were spent on concurrency.  It was interesting in the beginning but it really started to drag on after a while.",
                "Strengths: Great lectures and fun labs! Material was also interesting, coming from systems programming background. Learned a lot about hardware as well.\r\nWeaknesses: Labs quizzes and midterms were graded pretty slowly and sometimes had minimal feedback",
                "The course was very technical, and the slides did a good job of covering the highlighting the important material. I wish there had been a textbook to refer to though, if I didn't understand something in class there was no book to turn to for another explanation. The weekly quizzes were good to make sure I was following what happened in the class, and the labs were challenging and encouraged collaboration.",

The TA's were also very helpful in answering questions/helping us. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: because the lab feedback was posted over a month later we weren't actually able to implement it in future labs, so we ended up making the same mistake again and again, because we weren't aware of it. If the labs were graded more quickly, we could implement the feedback and continue to improve. Also, the last few labs didn't have a rubric.",

Take it *before* Operating Systems, if you can (I did the reverse, and still found it hugely beneficial, but OS would have been much easier had I taken this class first). Prof Manohar really breaks down how computers...work, and by the end of it, you have a much more comprehensive understanding of the hardware side of things (which would be super helpful for OS classes).",

It was also great to have a partner for the labs, because it is so enjoyable to get to work with someone else! It's really cool to see how other people might approach the same problem and then learn to choose what we think is the best method.",
                "Yes! Especially if you are EECS, you should absolutely take this course. The material is really interesting and it is really cool to see how the hardware and software come together in embedded systems. Professor Manohar is fantastic. He explains things really well and is always willing to help you understand or give further insight into topics if you are interested. The labs are not too difficult, but they do become really hard to debug so make sure to factor that into the time you need for the assignments.",
