                "Strength \r\n- flipped classroom so there is lots of time for questions \r\n- lots of material to practice with \r\n- exam are very fair \r\nWeaknesses \r\n- sometimes class problems can jump from easy to hard out of nowhere",
                "One weakness is the flipped classroom style it is currently taught in. I'd prefer to learn in class.",
                "Lots of access to helpful resources like peer tutors, office hours, and review problems.",
                "Strength: Professor Ozolins is an amazing instructor and person. The exams were relatively fair (although the first exam is rather difficult). PSets were pivotal to learning concepts properly and deeply (make sure to go to office hours as psets can be quite challenging and cover material beyond the pre-recorded lectures); similarly, TAs made this course much more bearable. Personally, I got by by just watching the pre-recorded lectures (did not open the textbook) and UNDERSTANDING how to complete the pset problems and in-class problems. Although there is no curve, the class distribution seems to work out pretty nicely at the end of the semester; the overall grading structure is quite forgiving if you put in the effort to improve.\r\nWeakness: This was the first class I've ever taken where we watch a pre-recorded lecture and then do difficult problems in class (I think the pre-class quizzes could be a little longer with increasing difficulty as you go on and an explanation on how to actually do each problemwould make class time more valuable). It was quite discouraging to attend class as it seemed like I was the only one that did not understand how to do some of the problems (but rest assured, most people are also confused at first... practice, practice, practice!) The pre-recorded lectures could be shortened or at least cut out irrelevant material and replace it with more reinforcement style teaching.",
                "The strengths of this course include its peer tutor, Tiffany Liao, and the amount of material covered throughout the semester. The weaknesses include the little engagement during lecture as well as the professor's teaching style. I believe the course could be improved if the prelectures as well as class lectures were more engaging.",
                "It's good",
                "I did not love the reverse classroom set up. At times it was difficult for me to learn the material on my own. I wish there was a bit more lecture in class although practice problems are important too.",
                "Interesting material with a great professor, really helpful TAs. Lectures could be really dry at times and were sometimes the exact same as the recorded lectures plus a few more examples",
                "Multivariable calculus? Yes. For engineers? Not so much. This class assumes students already have a conceptual understanding of how multivariable calculus works. There really weren't any applications and the grading curve works against you. There are so many overachievers in this class that makes it really hard to get a good grade even with a decent average.",
                "taught very well, psets were pretty manageable, exams were pretty reasonable",

                "Only if necessary, this is not a class to take \"for fun.\" It is quite challenging and moves VERY quickly. That being said, I think I would recommend it over Math 120 simply because the amazing TAs and supportive Professor Ozolins. ENAS 151 definitely has more challenging midterms and psets BUT the cheat sheet allowed balances out the difficulty in that respect; as well, Professor Ozolins WANTS you to succeedjust reach out to him. This course is definitely more self-guided and expects discipline of its students, make sure to practice practice practice before exams. The grading structure is also much more fair than Math 120.",
                "I would recommend this course if the student had to take multivariable calculus during their time at Yale. However, I think that the workload is absurdly high and would warn that the problem sets are extremely time-consuming. This course is difficult.",

                "Try shopping Math 120. I think the curve for that class is much better. At the end of the day, if you have to take Multi, it probably doesn't matter which course you take. If you don't have any experience, you better work hard from the start to get the conceptual stuff down before things start going fast.",
