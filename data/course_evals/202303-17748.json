                "I learned how to analyze syntax from a formal perspective, using binary branching trees in an X-bar theory framework. We discussed types of movement, syntactic parameter settings of various languages (not just English), argument structure and theta roles.",
                "this course was a straightforward but well-taught introduction to Syntaxwe went through basic topics like X-bar theory and movement, while bringing in real-world linguistic data along the way.",
                "I learned about the structure of sentences, grammar, and how our cognition functions to allow people to learn any language.",
                "Drawing syntax trees, understanding the hidden complexity hiding behind language",
                "Syntax theory, especially X-bar, theta criteria, movements, case assignment.",
                "I learned a lot. It was a good introduction to syntax.",
                "You learn the techniques and principles of generative grammar to be able to analyze sentences from languages across the world, draw diagrams that represent the structure of sentences, and answer deep questions about the nature of language and how we acquire it. The course will change the way you think of language and the grammatical engine that underlies it.",
                "This course was very valuable. I learned a lot about the order of words and how different rules explain why something might be grammatical and something similar is ungrammatical. This course also helps you develop your attention to detail skills."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the 'leminar' (lecture-seminar) structure of the course is very good. Gives students a chance to engage with the material more and actually understand the process of syntactic analysis to a greater degree. In general, the content is very interesting, so it is not difficult to stay engaged. Weaknesses: Professor Zanuttini professes to care about her students, and she does on a personal level (i.e. she brought us cake for the final!), but I don't think she really understands how to express that care in an academic context. I did not get the sense that she really understood how poorly she organized the timeline for our assignments. For instance, she made assignments due on Wednesdays before class, which became a problem when we got behind and we'd be learning the material on the PSet the same day it was due. She also typically posted the PSets several days late but refused to change the due date, such that we'd have three days to complete the assignment. And she very poorly judged how much time the final should take, allotting only 2.5 hours for what really should have been a three hour exam. I think this course could have greatly benefited from a different weekly structure: class on Monday and Wednesday, Psets posted consistently on Mondays before class, office hours and section on Thursday and Friday, and then the due date for PSets on Mondays. This would have prevented a lot of the issues that arose. Also the section was rarely helpful.",
                "I think the 'leminar' style structure of the course worked well, but I would encourage the use of even more small group 'breakout' activities. These are really where I feel like I *got* concepts! As well as Comfort's wonderful office hours. I think the textbook and supplementary readings are wonderful, and found Carnie's videos super helpful for reviewing for the exam and would reccomend continuing to use those as resources .",
                "This class was very well organized. The lectures, section, reading, and homework all felt like they interlocked to give students a good understanding of the material. My only complaint is that sometimes the lectures engaged with the material in a way that made learning difficult. We would often look exclusively at examples and rarely would the overarching ideas we need to write down and know be said explicitly, which made some learning difficult.",
                "Strengths: Interesting material, very knowledgeable professor. Raffaella was patient and explained things in a clear way.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The TA gave vague corrections on assignments, and section did not benefit my learning. Occasionally I felt there was not enough time to hand in assignments.",
                "This course is very organized, has an appropriate pace, and deals with a lot theory that would revolutionize your idea of language, even if you've previously been exposed to rudimentary concepts like phrasal constituents and syntax trees.\r\n\r\nOne weakness is that there's no slides or lecture notes, so the best revision material only includes your own notes and the textbook, which can sometimes leave people a bit clueless.",
                "Professor Zanuttini was great. She explained things clearly and was always willing to answer questions. The textbook is good, and the additional book \"The Atoms of Language\" is very interesting (we don't actually read the whole thing for class).",
                "This course is extremely well organized and well paced. The lectures are exciting and raise important questions. The course is not focused on a formally rigorous account of all of the features of language, but rather takes an idea-driven approach to show how complex phenomena may be accounted for in elegant ways.",
                "The professor is very helpful and clear in her explanations and answered any and all questions students have in class. The only thing I would change is having access to a practice test or practice problems with answers before exams because the problems provided in the textbook have no answers inside or online.",
                "Strengths are that the homework is really helpful. The homework helped me better understand the topics we were discussing in class and was really fun to do. I am struggling to find a weakness with this course. It was well structured for the class it was teaching."

                "Content is super good and interesting! I developed an appreciation for syntax that I didn't expect! But I'd just be warned that it is super disorganized in its current format.",
                "Yes! be aware that it really is a high workload--a long weekly pset that requires reading as well as in-class engagement. But we got the psets back quickly with feedback so I felt like overall all the expectations were fair.",
                "This is an interesting class on an interesting subject. It has made me rethink the way I view language, which is a really impressive achievement for any class to have related to its subject matter. The class is well organized, though it does become slightly harder to understand the material as it becomes more advance, and youll rely less on lecture and more on readings.",
                "Yes! Professor Zanuttini is awesome and our in-class discussions were great.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in language and grammar structures. If you are, you will be fascinated by the world of complexities of grammar you did not even know you knew. I could see how the class could be confusing or dense to anyone not very interested in these things.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in linguistics.",
                "Would strongly recommend. This course satisfies many different kinds of needs: for ling majors it's required anyway; for those interested in taking more ling classes it prepares you for many more advanced ones such as Syntax II, neurolinguistics, and semantics; for others it's a fun So credit. It's particularly suited for STEM students as a So credit because there's so much logic and structured reasoning involved. This course is a very rewarding and encouraging experience and it's definitely worth the time spent.",
                "Yes! It's great and approachable even if you have no linguistics experience. The psets took a little longer than I was expecting but the workload overall was still reasonable, and pset deadlines were flexible if needed.",
                "If you are curious about how language is generated in the brain and what the inner architecture of language is, then this is an incredible course with an incredible professor. The course is motivated by various mysteries that arise when pondering the nature of sentence structure and develops sophisticated tools to be able to answer these questions for languages from all over the world. The course is very well organized, so I highly recommend!",
                "Yes, the teacher and the TA are very helpful, it is easy to get support in the class and the textbook is clear in its explanations",
                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in syntax. It is a very specific subject, if you are not interested in word order don't take this class because it is solely about syntax."
