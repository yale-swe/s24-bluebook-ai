                "Strengths: Quincy's connections with many Chinese artists and scholars allowed us to directly interaction with them when they came as guest speakers. Super cool. Quincy is generally accommodating and very responsive to student suggestions.\r\nWeaknesses: Quincy could have taken more of an active role in facilitating quality discussion. It felt like many students would just non sequitur a lot, so there was little dialogue or exploration of topics in great depth. The grading rubrics were simultaneously clear and not so. I think Quincy communicated expectations well, but the way in which they were graded (by Nicole) I feel is a little unfair. The primary example is that we were tasked with writing a thesis experiment. In every other class I've taken at Yale, thesis experiments\/proposals have been more of an exploratory, general framing assignment with no expectation of the level of critical analysis required in an actual paper. In this class, visual analysis was expected (which makes sense), but it seems like in the eyes of the grader, it needed to be like the first 3 pages of a final paper, rather than a proposal. I really hope that this sort of thing is clarified in future terms.",
                "Seminar was very engaging, light lectures were wonderful too. Have no complaints",
                "Strengths: Professor Ngan is passionate about the course material and about his students' engagement.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The syllabus could be structured better so as to ground students in frameworks regarding gender and sexuality and histories of East Asian nations that artworks will be analyzed from. Reading like Judith Butler should not be optional, rather, they should be required at the beginning to tie the course together more closely. This way, case studies regarding genres like Shojo Manga can be analyzed from a theoretical context shared by all students.",
                "Quincy is the best!",
                "The course benefited from Quincy's responsiveness to midterm feedback and taking a more directed approach to the discussions. The topics and readings week to week were really interesting without being overwhelming, and the guest lecturers were a really wonderful touch to the class as well",
                "The class was very well-structured. I could learn complex discourses on gender in East Asian contemporary art practices. I really appreciate professor Quincys teaching methods. Each class was very well informed, I could check the each weeks learning lesson before the class and I could read reading materials with guidelines. He encouraged students to participate in the seminar actively in a very thoughtful manner. Professor let students to lead the conversation in the class and always wrapped up each class with such an articulated way."
