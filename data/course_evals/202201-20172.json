                "The peer support incorporated into the class was a huge strength! No major weaknesses, I just think it would have been nice to see my classmates more often (perhaps through study-hall type days instead of just not meeting?)",
                "Great course overall; structure was very well planned.  Minor point, but might be nice to give students an opportunity to opt out of getting peer feedback certain weeks; several times through the year I felt overwhelmed by a deluge of feedback, and it was not until I paused reviewing it for a while that I was able to complete a draft.  Again, overall though, absolutely fantastic course.  TZB is a Yale gem!!!",
                "This is a class where you really get out of it what you put in. Some weeks, I absolutely couldn't put in any time to this class, which meant that my capstone was feeling a little neglected. You're ultimately the one with the final vision of your capstone and how it'll turn out, so it's up to you to decide how to use your time. That's not to say that you have no support; on the contrary, you, your classmates, and Prof tzb will get so close--you're never without a support system so use it! (Prof tzb had to witness many breakdowns from me this year haha). You want to get yourself to a point where you'll feel proud about the work you've done by the end of the year, and that's hard to envision but know that you'll make it through! I liked the independence this course gives us (all while still being super supportive).",
                "The freedom is both a strength and a weakness. But I cannot think of a way to improve this  there is a lot of structured support but the hard work of actually doing the project is up to the student.",
                "Very independent based. Think maybe small writing groups that stayed the same would help us really give in-depth feedback and grow and improve our projects.",
                "Appreciated the lack of structure to work on capstone, and the formal feedback pieces were helpful.",
                "The course is amazing! Ed Studies is such a supportive department, and it was amazing to be able to write my senior capstone with the support of my entire Ed Studies cohort and amazing adviser/professor tzb!",
                "The course offers ample opportunity for peer and research advisor feedback.",
                "strengths of this course were the advisors in the course, like professor TZB, as well as the immense amount of peer feedback you receive through the semester. all the peer feedback was incredibly valuable, as it pointed out things I missed in my own paper as well as things I excelled at, and it also created this deep sense of community and collaboration in the classroom- which was so necessary during such a difficult year of senior project work!! \r\n\r\nweaknesses of this course: none"

My one piece of advice to any future Ed Studies people reading this is to really figure out what kind of topic/project you'll find engaging for an entire year. I ended up realizing that having a more \"defined\" project on a specific event or person or story would have been a more rewarding experience for me, and I think I would have done a better job than with the more conceptual project I landed on.",

                "Yes. Doing research on a topic of interest and preparing a capstone write-up taught me a lot about the process of refining a research question, receiving input on a research project, and doing the hard work of writing coherently about my findings.",
                "yes!! it was so helpful to have my capstone spread out over two semesters- and taking this class in addition to EDST 400 allows you to do just that! plus it was wonderful just spending more time with my cohort in both serious, academic contexts and more informal ones, as we got to know each other and support each other throughout the workshopping and capstone process :)"
