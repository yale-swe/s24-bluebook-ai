            "comments": [
                "Strengths are that it's very interesting material and the textbook makes it a lot easier to have a central source to consult throughout the course. Small class size (~10) is also a bonus due to the fact that it fosters a community and makes office hours very accessible. Weakness is that the PSETs are sometimes very confusing due to fuzzy wording and requiring lots of hand-wavy approximations in order to solve them, some of which require going to office hours or else not being able to solve the problems.",
                "Strengths: Sohrab cares a lot, the content is relevant and engaging, great notes, good office hours. Weaknesses: exams felt very hard to prepare for",
                "Very strong course! Super engaging lectures and psets.",
                "The exams are pretty tough and dont really help learning. A final project would be much better.",
                "Strengths: \r\n1) Sohrab as an instructor. He was very receptive and welcoming as an instructor, and he has a solid support system for the students.\r\n2) The grading scheme is very generous. The psets were incredibly long and difficult, but they count for 70% of the grade so the work very much feels worth it. The exams are also weighed fairly (highest scoring exam carries greater weight than the lower scoring one). If you do well on the problem sets (which is guaranteed if you go to Sohrab's office hours and work with classmates) and not too terribly with exams you will definitely get an A-/A.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n1) The scattering of content. We learn a lot of powerful statistical tools, but it felt a bit all over the place. At times what we were learning did not feel very coherent, but I don't think there is any way to improve this since it's still pretty fun to learn.\r\n2) The wordiness of the problem sets. There are some instances where problem sets felt unnecessarily wordy. I understand that we needed to gain some intuition about the math and code we were working with, but it definitely would have saved some time if the psets were a bit more concise.",
                "The strengths were that the materials was interesting and engaging. It is well structured and well taught. However, it is certainly a lot of work and not easy."

                "Yes if you want a stat class that surveys an interesting collection of topics. Note that the content is hard and the proofs and programs are hard to follow in class but they make a lot more sense when re-reading the textbook and you learn by doing the PSETs. The workload is anywhere between 5-15 hours a week on weekly PSETS with the average being somewhere around 8 hours. Due to long PSETs, our HWs were 70% which is ideal due to the many hours put into them. Then exams are 17.5%/12.5% for your highest and lowest one. First exam was fair but i thought second exam was way too hard and unreasonable. Overall, I became better at numerical programming and solved some math and stat problems. I learned various stat-related topics such as overview of probability, Monte Carlo which is using simulations to generate statistics and insights to problems that are hard to solve, Markov chains (which uses probability and linear algebra to understand state transitions), and then some stochastic calculus to understand randomness in differential equations.",
                "Yes if youre willing to put in a lot of work. The class is very demanding but worthwhile.",
                "Yes! So much to learn. This course is super useful for students of a variety of academic background.",
                "Yeah take it if youve since a good amount of stats and youll be fine. That or diff eqs. You need to have seen one or the other",
                "Yes, BUT proceed with caution. It's aimed at final-semester senior STEM majors who have good familiarity with a few of the topics, and I took the class as a sophomore. I would recommend you take the class in a lighter semester, because APHY 470 is very time intensive. I spent some sleepless nights pulling my hair out over problem sets, but luckily they carry a lot of weight compared to exams so they felt worth it.",
                "Definitely. I learned so much. It was a challenging course, but I think it was definitely worth it as I gained a lot out of the course. As a STEM major, this was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. But beware that the grading might be tough."
