                "I learned a lot about different dream theories given by philosophers from different eras. The varied perspectives of the philosophers and my fellow students on the same topic was very interesting. I learned to critically analyze even the smallest details of a written document as well as movie scenes. It was a very interactive course and helped me enhance my speaking skills and boosted my confidence. I learned the guidelines for writing different essays.",
                "I developed insight into the abilities to analyze and interpret dreams. The course allowed me to look at test and films with a new perspective. I am also better able to analyze my own thoughts and try to discover their meaning.",
                "I have learned what it means to dream, and we tried to reveal the hidden purpose of human behavior from a never-before-seen perspective and learn a way of interpreting.  We used Freud's theory and mainly, a text from '' The interpretation of dreams'' and to analyze the dream theory 100 years ago.\r\nIt was a great opportunity to learn at Yale University.",

I learned more than I anticipated about psychoanalysis, which made me respect the field in a way I hadn't before. I learned brand new perspectives on the meaning and importance of dreams. I also had the odd existential crisis as we went into more philosophical questions of dreams and reality.",

                "Strengths:\r\n- The course is very diverse in its content and references.\r\n- The in-class activities are very motivating and thought provoking.\r\n- The discussions and questions asked in class and also in the assignments fuels and develops your thirst for more knowledge. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The classes should be longer.",
                "Strengths - the content was very interesting.\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes I didn't quite understand the connection between the material we read\/watched to dreams.",
                "Daily protocols of previous classes helped to solidify and retain learning while providing review. \r\n\r\nA little more\/clearer communication and usage of the Announcements tool on Canvas would make this course better.",
                "The strengths of the class were its discussion-based format, the variety of materials studied (text and film), and Professor North's teaching. The only weakness I found was that engagement could be low at times in breakout room activities, but this can probably be attributed to the online format and I would imagine that this does not apply to an in-person class.",
                "I think it was great!",
                "The inclusion of movies in the course material made it fun. \r\nthere was excessive course work and a lot of reading had to be completed in very little time. I am disappointed that because of poor time management and a large amount of course work, we had to drop some of the readings that I found very interesting and wanted to be discussed.",
                "The strength of the course was the discussion style of the class. The discussions were always very captivating and enjoyable. It could be improved by distributing the material we cover better since we spent a lot more time on some material compared to others, and did not get to many readings towards the end of the course.",
                "This online course was very convenient and the strengths are that we used some break-out rooms to discuss with the students and interact more with teachers and students. And the assignments and the works we have done were very meaningful.\r\n\r\n On the other hand, I want to point out if there was one-to-one consultation time with a professor, it could have been a better online session.\r\n\r\nOverall, it was a great online session.",
                "I would say that the course has a good mix of intellectually intense and fun content and I was highly engaged. Some day however did not feel too productive",
                "Strengths: \r\n- great discussions in class \r\n- readings weren't too difficult and we discussed the readings a lot \r\n- movies were fun to watch\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- because of the content of the material, essays were kind of subjective and there weren't \"solid\" answers to many questions.",
                "Strength: firstly, this course focuses on an interesting topic and offers a creative way to learn about philosophy and cultural critics; secondly, this course involves profound discussions and brainstorming in various fields and offers intensive, valuable academic training; thirdly, this course nurtures my imagination and creativity. \r\n\r\nIn this course we watched several films and they had been posted on canvas. If the films could be provided with subtitles, they would become easier to understand, especially for those whose mother tongue is not English. A transcript also works.",
                "Strength: Engaging topic, well-selected materials, insightful discussion\r\nWeakness: We aren't able to cover all the materials listed on the syllabus.  I wish there are longer lectures because I am engaged in this class.",
                "The quality of the readings\/films and the professor's knowledge were the biggest strengths in this course. You could tell Professor North had been teaching this class for a while (in the best possible way). His insights were valuable, and his discussion leader style gave me the opportunity to learn from the other students as much as I did from him.\r\nAt the start of each class, a couple of the students were responsible for summarizing the content of the previous class, which was a very helpful way to bring us back to the topic or into a new one.\r\nThe group activities and discussions we had in breakout rooms were all relevant and well-coordinated, which isn't always the case for these types of classes. Instead of just an open \"discuss this topic,\" we had specific instructions that were usually set out in a shared Google doc. This structure was essential to the learning experience.\r\nI would have loved to have seen a bit more diversity in the (already very diverse!) syllabus. Specifically, I would have liked to have read or watched more works made by women. At one point during the last stretch of the class I was a bit too aware and tired of the constant presence of the male gaze in successive works. I still appreciated all the works we went through for what they were, and was really glad to see that they were drawn from worldwide authors instead of just the usual Western canon. Still, as strong of a syllabus as it was, I think it could be improved by the inclusion of female authors and filmmakers.\r\nI also wish we could have had a bit more feedback\/a chance to discuss the papers we did in class, but I don't see a way that could have been done during the short Summer term.",
                "I liked how students presented at the beginning of each class and we had a lot of facilitated student class participation.",
                "Strengths: Really thought provoking class with interesting materials! Weaknesses: More guidance on the essays and how they are grading, some inconsistencies in this.",
                "The course covers very interesting topics that are hard to find anywhere else. There is a lot of freedom in the things that can be discussed and you will learn to make many applications of what you learn to what you've experienced."

                "Definitely  I found this class to be very thought-provoking and engaging. Professor North was a curious and passionate instructor. He allowed us to develop a deeper understanding of dreams, constantly challenging our perspectives on life and truth throughout the course.",

                "Along with writing skills, you can learn to read, we are able to understand the dream and human relationships in depth.\r\nEach student has a chance to speak up in the discussions, we are able to gain confidence, too.",
                "I would. It allowed insights into some aspects of my conscious that I otherwise would have never explored and exposed me to new types of texts I otherwise would't have read",
                "Yes! it was a great summer class. The workload wasn't much at all but I learned a lot, and enjoyed our class discussions.",
                "Certainly, the reasons are as follows: \r\nFor a student majoring in the subject of humanities, this course offers valuable academic trainings. Not only can one learn about many profound, advanced philosophical theories, but also nurtures their creative thinking.\r\nFor a student not majoring in the subject of humanities, this course thoroughly demonstrates the uniqueness of subjects of humanities. This course inspires the students to think in an \"unscientific\" but sensible, logical way, which is quite precious in a scientific age.",
                "Absolutely! Professor North is extraordinarily nice and his class is also awesome. In fact, I have already recommended this course to my friends who are also interested in developing insights about themselves.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course for any student. Dreams are one of the few experiences we all share as human beings, and the course is structured in such a way that there is a little bit for everyone in there. Class discussions are open and excellently led, the class content is interesting, and you will likely come into contact with at least one work you haven't encountered before. If you can take this class with Professor North, it's definitely a must-have. Even if you can't, I really think the content of the class can stand on its own and make it worth taking.",
                "If they are interested in the subject and like philosophy, then yes.",
