                "This is a very challenging course, but Dylan and Arthur are very approachable. Additionally, the recommended textbook has additionally videos for review online. Note that this is not an easy course and expect that you have mathematical maturity already.",

                "This was overall a great course. The lectures were very well-structured, the slides were helpful, the homeworks were hard but fair and pushed you to actually understand the material.",
                "I found many of the homework questions difficult and could have used more help in class and in office hours to engage with them fully, but I think the course overall is meant to be a challenging elective and I am aware I was lacking some background I should have had.",
                "Strengths: Excellent teaching staff (Professor McKay and Arthur are both very helpful in developing your intuition for the sorts of problems covered in this class), small class size Weaknesses: None",
                "Professor McKay is a great lecturer and he is extremely passionate about the topics covered in the course. From my perspective, the assignments were hard, but working on finding the solutions was highly rewarding! We could collaborate between us, developing a great community to learn within, and the office hours were helpful, finding all the needed help to better understand the difficult theories. I also think some of the covered topics are at the forefront of theory, therefore Theory of Computation is a course that thoroughly prepares the students for further graduate study, research, or applications in the industry.",
                "Strengths: Professor is great (it seemed like any question that was asked he could answer VERY well, he really knows the material and is prepared for every single lecture), no exams, flexible deadlines on homework, lectures were good and given slides helped a lot, got feedback on homework\r\nWeaknesses: the time of day (4pm classes in general are the worst especially when it gets dark at 4:30)"

                "Personally, I would recommend this for all CS student but can acknowledge that the material is dense. If you lack mathematical maturity, you will find this challenging.",

Dylan's passion for theory is infectious and his lectures are unfailingly engaging  I could not recommend this course (and any other class taught by Dylan) more strongly!",
                "This was the first time I've taken a class of this flavor based on the contents: you learn in much more depth starting from DFAs to Turing machines to more sophisticated machines of computation. I've learned a lot of content from taking this class and really enjoyed doing some of the problems on the psets. There are about 5-6 psets in this class of about 20 students, and you get a plethora of feedback on your assignments. However, this is not an easy class you can just tack on; I was taking this class with many things to juggle and that was a challenge for me. However, if you have the bandwidth and can dedicate yourself to this class, this is an awesome class.",
                "Yes! Take any course with Dylan. He is awesome.",
                "Yes, I think the insights I gained were valuable, the lectures were well done, and there is as much learning the be had as a student has bandwidth to engage with, which is generally a sign of a good class",
                "Absolutely! If you are a computer science major with a mathematical background and are interested in exploring theoretical computer science, this is a great starting point. The theory of computation really only became an independent field in the 20th century, so it's really cool to be learning relatively new concepts. The first half of the class begins with a broad overview of automata/formal language theory, computability theory, and complexity theory, which is followed by coverage of some specialized topics such as the theory of quantum computing, probabilistic methods in computability theory, provability/logic, and more. I'm fascinated by how many fields of mathematics come together in the theory of computation, and it makes me want to take more math classes so I can keep exploring it further. You should have a background in proof-based mathematics, however, before taking this course. The class also moves pretty quickly so having some exposure to some basic models of computation like DFAs and Turing machines is helpful. The problem sets can sometimes be pretty challenging, especially the last one, but this makes sense given that the class has no exams. Moreover, there are some rather abstract topics like the Arithmetic Hierarchy that can be difficult to wrap your head around, so be sure to review the lecture notes or consult online resources like YouTube to find some more graphical explanations of the topics covered. The problem sets are released every two weeks, though, so I think the workload is manageable.",
                "Yes, definitely! This is one of the most rewarding classes I have ever taken. I highly consider it one of the classes every CS major should take.",
                "Yes! It was a really fun course. Professor McKay is a GREAT professor and really knows his stuff. He comes prepared (I would say overprepared!) for every single lecture. I enjoyed doing the homework. They were HARD but I felt like I had learned everything needed to complete them."
