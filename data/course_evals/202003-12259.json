                "Strengths: Very well structured course that follows a clear path. Each unit of learning builds upon the last and broadens one's grammatical and speaking skills. Professor Burton was absolutely excellent. Of all my professors, she has been the most engaging and impressive over the Zoom platform. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: For a graduate student, there is a lot of work required for this course. Meeting each day and requiring homework to be completed in advance of each course was challenging. Were this class to be less demanding, I likely would pursue the next level of the undergraduate French track.",

                "In my opinion, one of the most useful French classes. It takes the material learned in L1 and 2 and gives easier ways to learn and speak the language. Intense, but great experience.",
                "The course is organized in a manner in which each unity incorporates aspects of the previous unit while also adding new material; this allows us to retain past lessons while still being able to plow ahead in our learning of French. The tests are fair and reflect the work that we do on a daily basis.",
                "Strengths - Mme. Burton is the best, there are a lot of ways to earn credit, great reading\/source material",
                "This is my third semester taking French at Yale, and I am continually impressed with the high-level of instruction provided by the department.  I feel like I am learning the language much more quickly than I expected, which is a pleasant surprise! This past semester, I thought the biggest strength of the course was the material.  All the books we read and films we watched were genuinely interesting to discuss, and were a great challenge for my French.  Additionally, this course's clear emphasis on oral production was great. Every class, Madame would use the breakout room function on Zoom to really force everyone to practice their speaking.  My favorite assignment was our presentation we had to give this semester. Everyone was allowed to pick their own topic connected to the francophone world. What was so great about this, was it allowed me to acquire new vocabulary words specifically relevant to my areas of interest."

                "I was really impressed with Madame's ability to keep our course engaging and effective despite its unorthodox format.  Again, the use of the breakout rooms to facilitate constant discussion was a great way to take advantage of Zoom.  One small improvement I would suggest for next semester relates to the final exam -- rather than conduct the final on a Microsoft Word document, I think it would have been better to conduct the exam via the OWL system like all the other tests.  The Word doc was a bit clunky and distracting given that its format would keep shifting as you typed.  Additionally, it was a little strange to have to get used to the new format after having become used to the OWL model this semester."

Yale's French program is fantastic, especially if you're trying to acquire a working proficiency in the language as quickly as possible. However, I would warn them that there is a fair amount of work required for the course, which could be a challenge if they're already taking a heavy course load.  But of course, continuous practice and repetition is required for language learning, so that should be expected."
