   "comments": [
    "I learned about modern Germany and the media of all sorts that influence German life today. I also developed better understanding of more advanced grammatical concepts.",
    "I learned about media culture in modern Germany and about media more broadly.",
    "An understanding of media in Germany, but also a better understanding of media in general. Also great practice writing in German, in particular.",
    "Through this course, I learned that contemporary German culture is vastly different than how, here in the US, we perceive it to be. The youth are very similar to US children: they love podcast, very active on social media, and creative.",
    "I learned about media and contemporary issues in Germany and developed my language skills, both written and spoken.",
    "I learned how Germans interact with each other through social media and letter writing, and more about the internet culture of Germany. I also learned a lot about other forms of media (books, TV shows, evening news, blogs), and how German expression is different from that in America.",
    "I would never think one can learn so much about different media types in such a short time. But what really caught my attention was the different cultural aspects and habits of people in Germany. I definitely improved my german vocabulary and I also feel more confident writing longer amounts of texts in german after this class.",
    "Knowledge of contemporary german culture. discussion of current political issues. Learned Different styles of writing (newspaper, letters, novels)",
    "I learned a lot about German culture, language and media through this course. I also feel like it gave me a large insight into the current German political climate and what International Relations look like from the perspective of Germany.",
    "I was able to improve my German skills. I also obtained a lot of knowledge about German media and how it differs from the United States.",
    "I certainly saw the most improvement in my speaking skills through the bi-weekly speaking journals as well as in class activities. This class was great for expanding my vocab and increasing my fluency to understand news reports, read newspapers, speak about current events, etc.",
    "Strengthened some grammar and mostly conversational ability in German."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is very manageable in course load, and the curriculum allows for a broad familiarization with German culture (especially as it relates to media). It is clear and well-taught, and I really don't have suggestions for improvement other than that the class size could have been smaller. It is so popular, though, that the professor already had to split it into two sections this semester.",
    "The strengths are the course's well-designed syllabus and the enthusiasm of the professor, Theresa. The weaknesses this year stemmed from the class's over-enrollment, which made class time a bit chaotic and made it feel like the learning was less personalized.",
    "Engaging and interesting material. Given the large size, I do not think there is much that could be done differently, other than perhaps not depending on other student's summaries of Tschick on the chapters we did not read.",
    "I liked the breadth of the course, but I did feel that the amount of time spent on each medium was a little awkward. Maybe assigning all films as homework or reading short stories as opposed to the full Tschick book could help with that.",
    "I think this was a great course!",
    "I am not lying, when I say this class had only strengths! This has been my most favorite class at Yale so far, mainly because of Theresa. She showed a perfect example, how much one enjoys a class depends on the professor. Theresa was always so organized and I never felt lost. I always knew what is going on, where are we, and why is this being done. Not to mention her \"magical\" ability to keep my attention for the whole 90min with always new and innovative classes.",
    "I loved how the course put a large emphasis on writing and speaking. I at first thought L5 would be too advanced for me, but i think I caught up well and that my speaking and writing improved. I wish the course put a little more emphasis on reviewing grammar rules. Quite a few of the people who tested into L5 and didnt take l3\/L4 (like myself) could have benefited from this.  That said I thought theresa did a wonderful job of ensuring we each built up our vocabulary.",
    "I think the strengths were a wide array of materials and formats of media covered, watching the Tagesschau every class and doing basics in grammar again. I honestly really loved this course and the teaching and I don't think it had any weaknesses.",
    "This course has only strengths. The content was very interesting and relevant. The professor is great and makes the class enjoyable and engaging.",
    "This course is extremely well designed- all content felt relevant, carefully selected, and was interesting.",
    "No improvements, Frau Schenker is an amazing teacher and taught the course very well."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students who want to learn about modern Germany. It is also a great class for keeping up with the news because we watched German news every day. This is a really strong choice for any L5 German student because it is so interesting.",
    "I definitely would. It's one of the best L5 german classes out there and will remain that way as long as Theresa is teaching it.",
    "For sure, Professor Schenker is very engaging and cares about the student's improvement. The material is also very interesting.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, especially if it is the first course you are taking after German L4. It can be a little frustrating, though, if it is not your first L5 course. Also, if Prof. Schenker is teaching in a given semester, you're in good hands.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! If this class was not limited only to German-speaking students, I would be recommending this class to anyone at Yale! I was literally excited to wake up on Tuesday and Thursday mornings for my German class! IDK why, but the vibe, Theresa, and fellow students all made the class extremely enjoyable while stimulating a very effective German language learning.",
    "If you are comfortable speaking in german and wish to improve writing and general fluency then yes! Theresa is an excellent and inspiring teacher. If you want a more rigorous review of grammar  then maybe L4 classes would be helpful?",
    "Yes I would! Professor Schenker is a wonderful teacher who makes German learning so fun. The course is interesting, interactive and engaging. I genuinely felt a part of the discussions she would foster and I never felt intimidated of the language.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a great class that allows you to learn about other cultures.",
    "Absolutely, both the content and instructor (Theresa) are great",
    "Yes if they want to maintain or improve their German speaking."
