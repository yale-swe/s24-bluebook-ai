            "comments": [
                "Making lecture recordings available would help a lot with reviewing material that was difficult to follow during class.",
                "Perhaps there could be slightly more short assignments that can help facilitate learning of the material as we go along in the class. The lack of assignments meant that it was easy to fall behind and have to review all of the lectures only in preparation for the exams.",
                "The strengths are the weekly review sessions, the thorough handouts, and the fact that the lecture is only 50 minutes at a time. \r\n\r\nThere are many weaknesses. The professors are not at all engaging when they lecture, which makes an already-dry subject even harder to stay interested in throughout the lecture. The style of grading is incredibly stressful (your final grade is either the average of the first two midterms or the score of your final test, and there are no curves, even when the class average is a failing grade), and it woudl benefit from some homework grades to pad out the scores for people who don't test well and for regular practice. There were so many points where I had no idea what the take away of that day's lecture was supposed to be, and regular homework would have helped clarify that before it was time for a test. The content covered each day was not very accessible in the first half of the course (when Paul teaches), although I did appreciate Haig's handouts. While we could use the handouts partially, Paul's were nto very detailed, and it felt like missing a class period would have resulted in being hopelessly lost with nowhere to look for help.",
                "Strengths: profs are passionate about the subject\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No recordings, hard to hear class sometimes. Not always following the syllabus and online notes well. Exams were written to be longer exams than the actual exam time is. Too much content for a \"one-hour\" exam.",
                "Strengths: The is a wide variety of topics covered throughout the course, as well as a switch in professors that gives changes in perspective if there's one particular topic that gives you difficulty.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Organization. One of the least organized classes I've seen. Everyone usually does poorly on the first two exams (means around 50's-60), putting pressure on your performance on the final. Since the class is curved and improvement on the final is rewarded, you end up usually being fine grade-wise, but it still can feel stressful.",
                "The content is very interesting, but the lectures are very disorganized, and it is hard to prepare for exams. The exams are quite difficult, even though they are open note.",
                "I felt it was hard to follow lecture sometimes because the material wasn't always presented concise or chronologically. Additionally, I felt that it might have been better if the lectures were recorded because depending on where you sat in the classroom, it was harder to hear or understand what was going on.",
                "The strengths were the lectures, they were very well thought out and explained.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of the course were the quizzes and test format of the short answer. The expectation of having to word vomit everything you know on a topic negates the purpose of asking specific questions. There is no indication that information was supposed to be provided on answers that are graded for.  You should not have to word vomit to get points on a question. The quizzes need to either be shorter or have longer amount of time. 2 hours is not enough for the amount of information we are expected to give. \r\n\r\nAn overview of the brain autonomy would be very useful as not everyone taking the class is a neuroscience major. Graduate students of other majors take this class.",
                "strengths: \r\n- content was very interesting \r\n- professors were clearly quite knowledgeable and very thorough in their e-mail responses\r\n- I thought the exam questions themselves were generally fair, although difficult\r\n- handouts and powerpoints are very helpful\r\n\r\nweaknesses: \r\n- exam grading sometimes seemed unnecessarily nitpicky, especially given the fact that the exams were difficult to begin with. sometimes it felt like you could answer a question sufficiently and correctly but still lose points if you didn't include a piece of information deemed relevant by the graders, which doesn't seem like a fair assessment of one's understanding of the course material. \r\n- lectures often felt rushed. this class might benefit from 2 75 minute sessions instead of 3 50 minute sessions each week. \r\n- making the entire course grade based on the exams felt excessively stressful. maybe making some of the \"optional\" p-sets required and turning that into 20-30% of the grade could help alleviate that burden a little bit? \r\n- in my opinion, more time could be given on exams to ensure people have adequate time to prepare their answers, especially given the fact that the exam does not cut into class time (also, the Saturday morning exam time is rather brutal although I'm unsure if that is possible to change)",
                "Strengths: Attentive\/helpful TA's and Peer tutors\r\nWeaknesses: the entire course. It's honestly ridiculous that a course that has been taught by the same professors for ten years and is required for the major is as poorly designed as it is. The first third of the semester existed only on chalkboards and was taught with microphones that didn't work. Paul would be condescending when questions were asked or when requests for better accessibility were posed. Haig avoided this issue by being responsive to input and always uploading PowerPoints after class. The exams or \"quizzes\" are too much content for the one-hour timeframe given, leading to a lot of stress and the feeling of being rushed through my work. Lack of transparency of what the cutoffs or how the class would be graded also didn't help with the overall overwhelming nature of the class.",
                "Record lectures, not chalkboard",
                "This class was very confusing organizationally. The handouts were extremely long and dense and were a far better tool for studying than notes for lecture because the lectures were very hard to follow and relate back to the trajectory of the course. I think it would be extremely beneficial to have regular assignments throughout the semester to breakdown some of the concepts into smaller chunks.",
                "You learn about some interesting topics in the course, and the workload is not high because there are no problem sets, but this makes grading stressful because the class is curved and the grade is totally dependent on midterms and the final. People did poorly on the midterms, and you have the option to use your final grade as your overall grade if you do better than on the midterms, but this means that one exam can determine your entire grade. I think it could be improved by having at least a few non-exam assignments to make sure students are keeping up or by having mandatory discussion sections. Also, the detailed lecture handouts from the second half of the course were very helpful, and similar handouts for the first half of the course + more practice problems for the first half would be helpful.",
                "The strengths for me is the structure of the course and the way the material was taught through experimental methods which I found very interesting. However, having exams as the only metric for grading was really difficult and I think this course could have benefitted from having some sort of weekly quizzes or problem sets.",
                "I felt as though I learned a lot but wasn't quite sure how clear the connections between concepts were. I also felt that the quizzes should have been alotted more time somehow, especially the final exam.",
                "This course is good in that it covers a wide scope of concepts in neuroscience that are very important to know for anyone going into the field. However, the dense content and sometimes unorganized delivery of the material can be overwhelming, and the fact that the course grade is entirely dependent upon a few difficult exams (where the averages are quite low) is stressful. I would have found it helpful to have problem sets or other assignments be factored into the grade, so that the exams carry less weight. It seems as though this is the way that this course has been taught for many years, but I really think that it is time to restructure it, as it is a requirement for the neuroscience major, and it has gained a reputation for being unnecessarily difficult. It is very possible to teach the content of this course in an understandable and accessible way, and we know that this is the case because many of us were finally able to understand a week's worth of content within a one hour session with the teaching fellow.",
                "Strengths: It really taught you to push your intellectual limits and realize how pathetic you can feel as a student if the professor does not teach properly. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Not only is it unacceptable that the exams come out to a whopping D- average (most of them came out with a 58-60% average), but clearly this was a trend on this class since many years ago, yet none of the professors including the NSCI dean are willing to look into this issue and fix WHY this might be the case. The lectures taught are extremely incoherent and difficult to understand. They are just scribbles and abbreviated acronyms everywhere with little explanation for what each part of the graph means, what each molecule does, what these long words mean, what is important for us to understand, etc. There is so much extra information in both lecture and in handouts that it is impossible, even with an open note, to expect us to master almost 100 pages of single spaced notes every exam\/quickly think of and utilize any info that might be asked for within the timeframe of an exam. Moreover, we understand that our professors are likely geniuses in our fields, but they teach us with an expectation for us to already know at least the fundamentals of these materials, and jump conclusions very much during lecture. The exams are given to us with an explanation that goes something along the lines of \"this exam should take you an hour, but just for revision and extra time purposes we will give you 2 hours!\" but in reality every.single.yalie uses all 2 hours to the last second before submitting them because these exams are very very specific to what they expect you to know, and only half aligned with the practice questions."

                "Yes if you are a stem major interested in understanding neurology. The whole grade is based on 3 tests, and they are difficult, but if you go to lecture and pay attention and study a day or two before each exam you should be fine. The content is really cool, and I liked how a lot of the course focused on learning toolkits\/how research was conducted to make key discoveries. Really cool topic, good teachers, but definitely not a gut.",
                "Yes, this is a great way to be introduced to many concepts in neurobiology. The professors are both very passionate about neuroscience and are very knowledgable in the field. There are many details about the brain that were very interesting to learn about: such as retinal adaptation, hebbian plasticity, and the specific mechanisms with which the brain uses to control muscle movement.",
                "Absolutely not, but it's required for neuro majors, so godspeed.",
                "No, unless you absolutely need to.",
                "Wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't have to take it as a requirement. If you're interested in the topic and it's not a requirement, you're better off getting access to the handouts and reading them on your own time. If you have to take it as a requirement, just be prepared to put in a lot of your own time to understand the content. Having a basic physics background definitely helps a lot for the first portion of the class.",
                "If you're a neuro major, yes, but otherwise it's not worth your time",
                "Only if they are a neuroscience major, I would not recommend this class to another graduate student unless their project involved neuroscience. It is known among the students that everyone who is not a neuroscience major should not take the class. This shows how niche the class is and lowers the potential to be beneficial to those from other majors and in the graduate program.",
                "Yes very informative great professors",
                "It is a required course for the neuroscience major. Otherwise, it's a very interesting course that fosters a more in-depth mechanistic understanding of biology, but you will have to be prepared to spend many hours working through the course content and preparing notes for the exam if you wish to do well in this class.",
                "If this class isn't mandatory for the major, I see no logical reason as to why someone would willingly take it.",
                "Only if you have to take it",
                "I took this class despite not being a neuro major. I'm happy I took it, because it is relevant to my research and interesting, but it wasn't always the easiest to learn the information we needed to. I found the handouts very helpful, but it was odd that the lectures seemed to make only a slight attempt to reference the handout material or follow the handout organization. The lectures could benefit from restructuring and improved organization.",
                "I wouldnt recommend it highly as an elective. I did enjoy learning about a new field of biology, but the first half of the courses lectures were difficult to follow, and with no assignments or feedback other than the two midterms and final exam, grading was stressful. The content, especially later in the course, is interesting, so I would suggest it if you have a strong interest in neurobiology, but go into it with the expectation of a lot of independent work to make sure you understand the content (highly recommend going to weekly TA reviews).",
                "I would if they needed it or were just interested and were willing to credit\/d\/fail. I found the exams to be very stressful and anxiety-inducing so wouldn't recommend taking it for a grade for fun, but the content I found very interesting.",
                "I would actually recommend this course even though it is a Neuroscience requirement as I feel I truly did learn a lot. I feel like there was a lot of nuanced ideas that were applicable to other molecular systems that were interesting to learn about in context of the brain.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are really interested in neuroscience and\/or prepared to self study and meet with a teaching fellow regularly and often in order to amply prepare for the exams.",
                "If you are not a neuroscience major, no. There are plenty of MIT lectures on the same topics that will teach you just as much without having your GPA risk dropping. The grades overall may come out with most students getting an A or A-, but the method we had to reach to get that grade + the amount of stress it caused is not worth it."
