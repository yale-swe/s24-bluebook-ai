                "All the ASL courses are taught by deaf instructors, and the space is one without speaking. Though the first few days took some adjusting, it is incredibly rewarding. One common practice is for the class to begin arranging themselves in a circle and presenting how they feel, going through the alphabet, introducing themselves, or responding to more complex prompts later in the semester. While this is rewarding, my class was particularly large, and I feel this took a disproportionate amount from class time spent learning new material.",
                "Strengths: great teacher, learned a lot, grades are not stressful because this class is fair\r\n\r\nWeakness: DawnSign Press doesn't match what we are taught in class a lot which is really frustrating. The whole DawnSign Press should be omitted from the curriculum.",
                "I enjoyed the course but I liked the idea of the community service even but not the actual product",
                "This course is strong all-around, and especially in the strength and care of its instructor.",
                "Excellent class.",
                "Strength: The professor!! Dr. S was an amazing professor and she is very passionate about teaching ASL and other things related to the Deaf community. Also, the events that come with being enrolled in ASL like signing tables, ASL movie nights, ASL game nights, and ASL collaborations with sports and performance teams around campus.",
                "Continue as is!",
                "It is very beginner friendly and most things are graded on participation so no focus on correctness but just giving your best effort! The group and partner activities facilitate skill building in a non-intimidating way. Unlike other language courses a component of the ASL program is to to participate and attend community events and also work on a service project, which allows you to practice with signers of different skill levels and bring you more into the ASL community. \r\n\r\nThe only small weakness is that I wish the service project wasnt so independent for an intro level class (depending on the project you choose).",
                "Strengths: Strong repetition and clarification in instruction to galvanize understanding; regular homework and quizzes to facilitate this; every professor genuinely cares about L1 students and really wants them to learn; asynchronous on one day of the week which is a nice breath; level of leniency in missing some classes as they are in the morning (and you dont feel grossly behind if you do miss one or two).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some more guidance in the community service project would be helpful; VoiceThread is a truly awful piece of software in my opinion, it would be easier to just use Google Drive.",
                "A big strength of this course is its teacher. I loved Professor Silvestri! As for a weakness, I would like to see that we are given more opportunities in the future (for example, getting a certificate in ASL)",
                "I think that the course was wonderful! Every aspect of classroom learning improved my proficiency in the language and would be considered a strength in my book. The only weakness that I can think of would be that the service project I was in was slightly disorganized as to when I would be able to complete my hours, but Covid and other factors took part in that confusion."

                "Absolutely. ASL and Deaf culture is a fascinating and important piece of Yale's campus. I feel I have learned a substantial amount and am excited for ASL 120.",
                "Absolutely. Julia is an incredible professor and really knows her stuff. She teaches you an astronomical amount and you don't even realize it. Much easier than the other languages at Yale, too.",
                "Yes! Dr.S is wonderful and you will learn so much.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I had a great experience.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Engaging, interesting, straightforward, fun. Best way to fulfill language requirement.",
                "YES YES YES!!! I think everyone should take ASL. Though it is a bit challenging, it is such a fun and cool language to learn. The class is very chill and everyone is nice and excited to learn. You also get to partake in different ASL events around campus and complete service projects relating to the Deaf community. The ASL community at Yale is also wonderful! If you aren't able to take the course, at least get involved with the community. You will still learn a lot!",
                "Yes!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! Even if you only take one semester of ASL, you will learn so much and be able to sign confidently. We live in such an audist world, and this course will teach you how to respect D\/deaf and Hard of Hearing People. if youre part of the community yourself but never had the opportunity or resources to learn ASL, this also allows for you to be connected to others. Deaf people are everywhere, so ASL is an important and useful language to know",
                "Yes, definitely! ASLaY is the most engaged and welcoming program on campus - focused on inclusivity and building communities. It takes some adjusting at the beginning to familiarize yourself with deaf space; however, after this, it really is a wonderful, and, above all, fun program!\r\n\r\nHonestly, some people are naturally more adept at signing - it is a kinesthetic way of learning that many people dont tend to fully grasp. But, with practice, everyone is at a very similar level with their own unique ways of signing and communicating.",
                "I would absolutely recommend it (I have recommended it). It is exciting to learn, helps me be more inclusive and also teaches me widely applicable skills.",
                "Yes! I would recommend this course to anyone. It's fun and engaging and the information you obtain can be very beneficial throughout ones life."
