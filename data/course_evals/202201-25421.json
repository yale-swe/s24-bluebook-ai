                "I developed the ability to place various poets in conversation with one another by assessing commonalities between their ideas and thematic elements. By examining the influence from one poetic predecessor to the next, I also gained a feel for critically evaluating how artists influence each other in mediums beyond poetry, including the visual arts and music. The course taught me that poetry, and even literature as a whole, often cannot be considered in isolation but draws upon the model set forth by previous authors; therefore, I learned that to truly understand the weight and meaning of any poem, it is necessary to recognize the ideas on which it builds and the ways by which it diverges from precedent.",
                "I learned how one can track how poets address prior poets, how artists and writers do the same, and how to track the evolution of an idea across writers over the ages. On top of that, I learned how to read poetry through this class."

                "Strengths: The professor, the material was super engaging, assignments were fun and not too hard. Feedback on papers was super clear. Not really sure about weaknesses.",
                "Riley is the most engaging and constructive instructor Ive ever met. His passion is infectious and makes the learning experience so unique.",
                "Great reading list, very knowledgeable instructor who draws out all students for good discussion, ample feedback on all writing and Prof. Soles is very responsive to email and open to meeting if there are questions about the readings or essay prompts.",
                "The seminar format of the course facilitated conversation and made welcome ideas of any kind, encouraging personal connections from our own experiences or other courses. At times, the discussions seemed to be repetitive, especially when we continued discussing the previous week's author, which very occasionally made our conversations feel drawn-out. This was oftentimes remedied, however, by the weekly discussion posts that encouraged thoughtful connection to the texts on a personal level and allowed each individual to evaluate their own interests and ties to the texts. Practicing both analytical writing and critical discussions enhanced my ability to comprehensively communicate my ideas, and also to prioritize listening to my classmates for the sake of absorbing and appreciating rather than exclusively to respond.",
                "Strengths- fascinating course, fascinating professor, content helps significantly with analytical skills, great foundational course for people interested in the arts.\r\nWeaknesses- syllabus expands near the end a bit, so the course transforms a bit from a poetic influence course to a poetry crash course. Seminar discussions seem between Professor Soles and students individually, so there was not too much student-to-student discourse."

There's truly something for everyone and you can learn so much from him. The assignments and workload are very manageable but fun, and Riley is of course really understanding. One of my favorite classes.",
                "I definitely would, it is such a special class and I learned so much spiritually and intellectually.",
                "Yes! I loved the class!",
                "Yes! If you love reading \/ want to get into poetry and even if you are already writing some yourself, I cannot think of a better course! Prof. Soles is amazing at what he does, the readings are also great fun!",
                "I would absolutely recommend the course to anyone in the Humanities major, anyone who has taken Directed Studies, anyone interested in poetry, and anyone interested in learning how to closely read a work (pre-law students, etc.). Professor Soles makes sure that everyone's interests are met in the class while furthering your writing and reading skills all the while."
