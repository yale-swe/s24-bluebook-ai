    "Knowledge of Latin grammar",
    "better reading proficiency in Latin and more knowledge of Pliny and Catullus",
    "I learned how to scan and understand the meaning behind the Catullus poems and Pliny letters.",
    "Through the Latin S120 course, I developed greater confidence in my ability to read Latin, and continued becoming comfortable with the language by translating texts, actively reviewing grammar, and learning two different meters. In addition to the incredible texts we read, my favorites being Pliny's Vesuvius letters and Catullus' Carmen 5 and Carmen 51, what I really valued about the class were the discussions, both concerning and not concerning the material. In fact, I kept a running document of all the fascinating things I learned from this course, from new vocabulary, like magisterial or nubiferous, to Guarneri Del Ges violins to the textual transmission of manuscripts to what classicists really think of Heinrich Schliemann. The themes in the poems and letters encouraged discussions on topics such as slavery, medicine, and gender in Ancient Rome, and I learned to look at each text from a different point of view. In addition to learning so much from the extraordinary and inspiring Professor Robinson, I surprisingly learned a lot from my peers. I was excited to find that each one of them brought a different experience or perspective to the table during discussions. For example, we had students from all over the world in our class, who were majoring in a wide range of disciplines, from Music to Applied Math to English to Religious Studies. Perhaps this is a constant through all Yale classes (this was my first, hopefully of many), but the intellectual diversity of the students combined with the incredibly knowledgable and encouraging Professor made it such a rich and worthwhile experience. Furthermore, and most importantly, I learned about the beauty of the Latin language and Professor Robinson truly encouraged us to explore and appreciate the astounding craftsmanship of the letters and poems. I further developed my critical thinking skills, as we were consistently urged to share our thoughts and analyses about the texts.",
    "We learned how to read and translate both Latin poetry by Catullus's Carmina poems and Latin prose by Pliny the Younger's letters. For the poetry, we also learned how to do scansion and how to read the poems in their original meter. We also reviewed grammar topics in the context of our readings and translations. We were also able to get a glimpse into Roman life, read about major events in Roman history, and had discussions about Roman social conventions."

   "comments": [
    "Strength: fun and engaging, able to understand Latin more",
    "As stated in a previous answer, one of the greatest strengths of this course was the diversity of my fellow students. The combinations of interests, experiences, perspectives, identities, etc really made this a unique group of students. I learned so much from the fruitful discussions we had concerning the material and I found that nearly every student contributed something different or had a unique opinion. \r\n\r\nWhile many of the students were engaged and often participating, it was clear to me that some of them were taking the class simply to fulfill a requirement and not out of interest in furthering their knowledge of the incredibly rich and fascinating Latin language, as I was. Perhaps this could be fixed by calling on people to participate and making sure everyone is engaged and has their camera on. There were a few students whose face I had never or barely seen during the entirety of the course. I think seeing every student's face on Zoom would be beneficial, especially since on an online platform it is harder to connect with people and ensure they are engaged.  \r\n\r\nThe course had many strengths and I thoroughly enjoyed and will forever value this one of a kind experience.",
    "Professor Robinson and Professor Swalec were both incredible teachers. Despite the online nature of the course, they were able to show us how to break down our readings and translate them step-by-step, which was very helpful. Professor Robinson used his iPad to markup our readings, while Professor Swalec used Zoom's whiteboard to bracket different portions of the text. Both methods were very helpful. Most classes were spent in breakout rooms for the first half, which was a great way for us to get individual feedback, and then in the large discussion for the second half. Loved this class!"

    "Yes - it was a fast and intense introduction to reading Latin!",
    "Yes, the professor is wonderful! Also, the feedbacks on the assignment are very helpful and fun to work on!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It not only furthered my love and understanding of the Latin language, but encouraged me to think more analytically. For me, the level of the academic rigor was perfect. The material was fascinating and overall it was a stimulating, interesting, and thought provoking course. Although I did sufficient work and preparation for each lesson, I found it to be a great balance of working hard yet not being  overwhelmingly difficult. If a student is seeking to work hard to learn more Latin and start reading complete poems and letters in an encouraging and supportive environment, surrounded by a diverse set of intellectuals, this is the perfect course for them.",
    "Yes, especially if Professor Robinson is teaching it. He broke down the difficult passages and made learning more advanced Latin approachable."
