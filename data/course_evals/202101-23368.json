                "The course is extremely well-structured.  Expectations for all assignments are clearly laid out from the start on the course webpage, along with detailed rubrics on Canvas.  Students have opportunities to check in with teammates on project progress through breakout rooms on Zoom at the end of class.  Instructors provide lightning-fast responses to student questions on Slack.  Team projects are split into a series of milestone assignments, taking the pressure off that is usually there in a big project.  Grading is extremely quick, and instructors provide detailed feedback.",
                "strengths: the teaching staff gave students a lot of opportunities to interact with other students\r\nweaknesses: lectures were a little dry",
                "I literally loved this course. The only improvement is that I wish it were in-person, but thats a function of the public health situation and not the professor or class.",
                "Overall the course does a great job introducing to students an under-covered important element of most computer science work.",
                "A lot of the tests were redundant (and very detached from real-world design processes) and grading was very arbitrary\/unclear (random points docked off for poor reasons). HCI lessons and methods were dated and couldn't be executed in remote settings while we were discouraged to use software that would ease this process at certain parts.\r\n\r\nProjects were good, but detached from one another. HCI toolkit taught seemed inapplicable to majority of the projects.",
                "strengths: it's an easy easy gut. Take it with 323 or like 2 other CS electives\r\nweaknesses: boring af. There's barely any coding, and whatever coding there is is very specific frameworks that are shoved to the end of the semester. The groups are a toss up: my first group had a pretty annoying person and my second group was ok. This is not a serious class; take it if you'd like to pay attention with half an ear",
                "It was a great class and I loved how project-oriented it was, fostering teamwork",
                "I wish that the course went a bit deeper into the latest trends and developments in HCI. I had some previous experience in user experience design and didn't feel like the lectures taught me a lot. The projects were interesting, and working in assigned groups made for an interesting challenge that is otherwise rare at Yale.",
                "Lecture material is interesting. However, I wish there were more ways to interact with the material. This would probably be easier with in person teaching, as a large part of this course is about groupwork--working with both your team of designers and users.",
                "Strengths:  Prof. Vazquez runs super engaging lectures, you are never bored and always learn something.  Overall, I also thought the group projects were designed and spaced perfectly, so that we weren't rushing or cramming work but were able to complete them and learn something in the process. Weaknesses:  There was a very long midterm that ended up taking me 6-8 hours, and was more of another project or problem set, but with limited time.   That was a bit unfortunate, mostly because it was all creative design work that is difficult to rush.",
                "This course is probably one of the better CPSC electives I have taken at Yale. The strengths are numerous. Firstly, Marynel is an amazing professor. The course content is fascinating and the lectures are not just boring monologues but rather discussions, interactive videos and games. The guest lectures in the class were truly instructive and the amount of structure in the class is immaculate. Marynel makes sure everything is clear, from the course websites to weekly reminders of what is due and tips to complete assignments. The projects are really hands-on and cement understanding. The only weakness of the class is perhaps the complexity of the second project which requires people to either know some amount of web development or to learn the basics quickly.",
                "I enjoyed how we had the second project added to the course. However, it did feel a bit rushed. I wish we had more time to implement it from the start. If we had more time, we could have put more effort into it and flushed our implementation more. I also wish we could have been able to upload our code ourselves to the CEID display to help test more instead of going through the TFs. However, the TFs were very helpful and were willing to do it when asked. Also, since we weren't really tested much on the lecture material (we used it occasionally for assignments), I felt less motivated to pay attention as the semester went on.",
                "The course was great at building on itself throughout the semester. We went through all the material by talking about it and engaging in discussion, putting it into practice, and receiving feedback.",
                "A definite strength of this course is the two group projects. They reinforce the key concepts of design process while still allowing room for creativity. The deadlines were well-spaced to give enough time to make unsuccessful attempts without too much stress. There was also ample opportunity during regularly-scheduled class time to work on the projects.\r\nA weakness of the class was the fact that everything had to be remote. I would have enjoyed the coursework far more with in person demos - but this flaw was unavoidable."

                "The multimedia approach to teaching lectures worked great. The breaks inserted in the lecture were surprisingly necessary. The only thing that could use some more structure is the second project , since testing had to be done in New Haven but some people were remote and could not necessarily fully benefit from the setup. Marynel developed many ways to bridge the gap however.",
                "I really did not like the fact we couldn't choose our partners for the group projects. Especially because of COVID-19, being assigned into groups with partners in different time zones was not helpful. Also, since I knew some people going into the class who I've worked with on projects before, I think I would have been better able to complete work for projects, as I had to deal with partners who just didn't do their work and left it for the remaining members to do for our second project",
                "Online lectures were great, obviously would be much better in person for asking questions and discussion, but this semester kept me engaged and active with the material. Breaks were a good idea!"

I gained valuable perspectives from psychology, art, and design, as well as technical details from CS.  As a CS major with no web development experience, this was also a wonderful way to learn HTML and Javascript.",

                "Absolutely. This course demonstrates a vital, little-discussed dimension of most programming work. Most computer science students would benefit greatly from this exposure.",
                "It's alright if you want a very narrow coverage of HCI that can't be found in other courses; don't expect a comprehensive survey on HCI theory, practices, or trends. Better if you are okay with teaching yourself and have time to make the most out of the projects.",
                "with caution: take this course if you need a CS gut to pad your major credits. go in with 0 expectations of actually learning anything substantial. you don't have to pay attention to lectures to do well on the exam. you don't have to actually read the resources given to do well on the quizzes. this is a 400 level CS course and I got nothing from it. I was told there would be no coding in this class and then the second project had implementation aspects to it with very little practice on how to code. most of the class is about high-level design, so making us code so close to the end of the semester was just annoying. This class is great if you go in with the right expectations: you probably will get very little out of it. Whatever you do get could have been condensed into one email. I highly encourage the professor and staff to work on developing a more meaningful and engaging course that gives students real, hands-on practice and understanding into the important of HCI rather than just showing a youtube video that we could have watched on our own time.",
                "Yes, it's a super fun class!",
                "This is a refreshing CS elective - the workload throughout the semester is low, but the final project is challenging. A lot of the lectures felt like reading Medium articles, and they were quite surface level at times. While I don't feel like I learned a lot, I still enjoyed the course. Marynel did a great job with the course organization, and I enjoyed working collaboratively with other students.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course! This course has filled in many gaps of knowledge I would have needed for the real world. Engaging with the Ethics of the design process was also extremely important to talk about and something I have never heard in any other CS course.",
                "This course was a highly engaging, experiential introduction to designing interative systems. The same principles of design are useful even in other computing domains (or other domains entirely), and the projects are fun to grapple with."
