                "In this class, I learned about the end of the world, mortality, spirituality, the after-life and the meaning of life across to many different regions, cultures, peoples and religions. It was a fantastic overview and comparison of the questions that humanity has struggled with for so long.\r\n\r\nI learned how to analyze and compare themes across many different times, places and languages. I also learned about the many different ways to conceptualize end(s) of world(s). This is something I believe that I'll carry with me throughout my life.",
                "In a class full of native Spanish-speakers, I think the most important thing I learned was bravery. Jesus was very graceful when students made errors and that made it easier to speak up in class. Other than that, learning how to read old texts in different languages was quite challenging, but Jesus made it interactive in a way that we all were able to understand each lesson.",

                "I learned how to analyze older primary sources (in spanish and english) and how to comprehend and participate in academic discussions in spanish.",
                "I learned different views about the end of the world and more about different religions. I also learned how to analyze art and texts.",
                "I really enjoyed this class and it helped me improve my Spanish and understanding of the Spanish culture",
                "I learned a lot about different ways of thinking regarding how diverse regions and ethic backgrounds associate with the end of times.",

I feel that I entered the class at an advantage given that I was raised Catholic and a lot of focus was put on Catholic teachings (obviously). My reading comprehension improved in this class, but my speaking ability got worse.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The breadth of works studied. Professor Velasco did an excellent (!!) job of providing representation for so many diverse people throughout time. This was particularly meaningful considering how rarely this is achieved. Prof. Velasco is also a fantastic lecturer -- he is hilarious, brilliant and endearing. It was a pleasure to learn from him.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, this course had very little continuity. There were a few overarching themes that were present across lectures. However, the subject material did not move chronologically nor regionally, making things feel very random at times. That being said, I appreciated the creativity with this approach because I drew connections I probably wouldn't have otherwise.",
                "Jesus Velasco is the greatest strength of this course - he is lighthearted, excited, engaging, and easy to listen to. He asks for student engagement and makes jokes constantly. The only weakness that comes to mind is that I didn't know where I stood grade-wise and that's hard as a Yale student when grades are so important. Despite this, I do think this class was one of the most fun I've taken at Yale solely because of the professor.",
                "The leminar format was a little intimidating so I didnt participate very much.",
                "I think it would have been more fun as a discussion. Still, just hearing Prof Valesco speak is a joy!",
                "The class could have been more organized to have a better understanding of how different course topics connected.",
                "Strengths: really fun class that has interesting readings and discussion\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the readings for each week were a little more clear",
                "The strengths are that the readings, lectures, and project are all very interesting and I genuinely enjoyed how unique this class was and all that I learned. However, the three quizzes we had throughout the semester made no sense. Because they were multiple choice and about very non-theoretical things related to the texts we read, like who the author was or recalling which character recited a specific excerpt, they did not measure my engagement with the course or texts and did not help me as a student at all. I genuinely enjoyed the readings, but could never express what I actually took away from them and my personal analysis of them in the exams.",
                "Professor Velasco is incredibly knowledgeable and thoughtful in his presentation of course material. He facilitates a large classroom environment into a seminar style classroom and is very supportive of student learning. Some of the readings were slightly disorganized or hundreds of pages, so clarity in the syllabus might help alleviate that a bit.",
                "The emphasis should be less religious",
                "The professor and TF were very kind and welcoming. They were also approachable. I thought the structure of evaluation (quizzes and projects) helped facilitate learning well. Sometimes the class felt long and I found it hard to focus to the entire lecture.",
                "I feel the class wouldve been better as a lecture!",
                "I liked the lectures and the professor was very engaging, but some of the reading was too much",
                "Strengths - The professor was very engaging and insightful; he made the class a great environment to ask questions and learn. \r\nWeakness - None",
                "strengths: independent\r\nweakness: not much work",
                "Clarity on what we are discussing/need to read.",
                "Strengths-the lectures were interesting and the final project was fun \r\nWeaknesses-preparation for the quizzes was difficult",
                "Jesus Velasco is a wonder to listen to. He is the strength.",
                "Lectures are interesting; quizzes seemed an ineffective way of gauging understanding",
                "Jesus is so fun! He's such a caring teacher, both for his students and the material. The only critique that I have was that the class was just a little bit too big (it should've had a discussion section for its size); it teetered a little too far in the leminar category.",
                "Some of the readings were too long and difficult to get through. The quizzes were fair and the project was fun.",
                "The course is a very interesting leminar. Occasionally it is not clear which of the readings to do, and the quizzes in the course are a little strange, but it is not too difficult and the material is a fascinating compilation of different views on the apocalypse. Professor Velasco is an engaging lecturer and extremely talented.",
                "Strengths: Hugely entertaining, encompasses a great scope, will get you thinking, the readings are fascinating, Prof. Velasco is definitely top 3 coolest professors and he is very animated, TA Brais ROCKS and the workload is low. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures were sometimes really disorganized so it was hard to follow what was going on since the texts are very advanced (for a non-native speaker). Multiple readings were in antiquated Spanish and Catalan, which was way beyond my personal abilities in the language. Some weeks there are 200-300 pages of Spanish text to read which can be daunting- or just as daunting: 4 pages of philosophy.",
                "It was a lecture so there was little student engagement despite it being called a seminar. It was rare for many students to speak in class aside from a few.",
                "Strengths - interesting readings, kind professor, variation in assignment type\r\nWeaknesses - little feedback, low level of engagement, sometimes readings were too difficult",
                "Strengths: Jesus is an amazing professor. He has so much energy and obviously cares about what hes teaching.\r\nWeaknesses: Because it was such a big class it was hard to keep everyone engaged. I think it would work better in a smaller format so that everyone gets a chance to talk",
                "This course should really be cross-listed with religious studies and philosophy and that is an absolute strength of the course. Going in expecting a run-of-the-mill Spanish literature class, I was pleasantly surprised to have my horizons expanded. I also thought the assignment organization was strong the periodic quiz/project workshop structure was helpful for checking in with myself and my group members throughout the semester and gave the course a good foundation.\r\n\r\nThis course could be improved in the organization of the syllabus moving more chronologically, or at least shifting the religious source texts earlier in the semester, would be helpful to students' understanding of more recent texts. It was often pretty confusing to discuss a text that made reference to something we hadn't learned/read yet (especially reading Herrera and Caldern de la Barca). \r\n\r\nIt would also be helpful for clarifications on the next class's focus to be posted earlier or included on the syllabus I was most engaged when I knew which parts of a reading to focus on, especially the longer ones. Situating longer readings on Mondays would also be helpful I noticed that most Wednesdays, the energy was lower because more people hadn't completed the reading.",

The workload was manageable, he really encouraged low stress levels and engagement with the material. As someone working on becoming more fluent in spanish, it sincerely improved my ability to comprehend more complex topics.",

                "Yes! An interesting Spanish class - best Ive taken at Yale",
                "Yes! The course was really fun.",
                "Yes, it was an interesting Spanish class unlike other classes I have taken before, but it is a little unclear what the grade breakdown is and what your grade actually is.",
                "I would definitely recommend the course. It is one of the most interesting Spanish classes I have taken at Yale. The material is excellent, and you will learn a lot in the lectures.",

                "Yes",
                "If you are good at Spanish this could be a gut but otherwise prepare to either try and finesse or actually need to study. Just cuz the source readings are so hard.",
                "I don't know that I would recommend this course to another Yale student unless they were serious about learning Spanish. The course is very much a \"you get out what you put in\" experience, and I felt that it was often the first class on my schedule this semester to be ignored because I knew that I could skate by on minimal work. There were clearly other people in the class who engaged much more often in class and with the readings, and I think they might recommend the course more heavily.",
                "Yes. Note that its not exactly about the End of the World as youd think of it- we spent a lot of time talking about border politics and environmental crises and things like that rather than just different versions of apocalypse. Still super interesting but different perhaps from how the course is presented.",
                "Yes! This is a good choice for an L5 Spanish credit, and also was a good 5th credit.",
