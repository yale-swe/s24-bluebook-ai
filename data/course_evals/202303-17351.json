Professor Brisman recommends an approach to writing English essays that I hadn't come across before. You pose a problem in the introduction, and spend your essay weighing up the alternative 'solutions' or interpretations that shed light on your problem. Professor Brisman would be disgruntled if I did not say that you learn a lot about life in this course. He helps us see poetry as a way of gaining wisdom or a new perspective that changes how we lead our life.",

The questions that Professor Brisman poses in class open up a really exciting class discussion. You see the poems in a completely new way. You learn which questions the reader should ask when approaching a new poem. The class is also really well structured. Professor Brisman begins each class with what he considers the most important matter, and every class is framed around the 'epigraph' that he writes on the board. We often dealt with two poets at once, switching back and forth between the two poets in class. There is a focus on close reading throughout, which was new to me -- and very illuminating!",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course. The class discussions are riveting, and Professor Brisman's questions in class stir you to see the poems in new ways and with layers of meaning that escaped you upon first reading! It's true that the Professor is a harsher grader than most teachers I've encountered, and you have to write five essays as opposed to three in most of the other ENGL 126 courses. But the workload is totally worth it! You learn how to dally between alternative interpretations of the same poem, how to closely read a single line or word, and how to view poetry as a guide to living a fuller life.",
                "I would recommend this course depending on the type of class you want to take. It you are interested in philosophical and abstract conversations, this is a great class and Professor Brisman is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable. However, if you are seeking more structured or conventional conversations, another Engl 126 class might be a better alternative."
