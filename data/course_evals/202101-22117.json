                "A very enjoyable course that anyone interested in game design and game play should take. The instructors are wonderful, and the seminars are always enjoyable to attend. You learn a lot about the work it takes to make quality games through first-hand experience. Super fun!",
                "Strengths: Very unique class, great for all types of students regardless of their interest in gaming. The seminar format made it easy to discuss readings with classmates, as well as present our game designs\/artworks for critique. The class also used a variety of methods to teach game theory, including a game presentation where the student would have the class play a game and then discuss it. As an artist, I really enjoyed viewing art from a game development perspective.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was a little difficult to understand the more technical software tutorials, but this is primarily because it was online and we were unable to follow along with the steps like we would have in the computer lab.",
                "The class is very interesting and the assignments all feel worthwhile. I learned a lot of cool skills through this class. However, the final project felt very rushed, and it would have been nice to get more time to work on that. Also, it would have been nice to be able to play the games we designed together in class rather than just doing an overview presentation every time we finished a game.",
                "This response might give away my identity, but that's fine. Note, though, that I didn't heavily proofread it, and that I may have left some points or details out for length.\r\n\r\nThe course did not seem to teach many applicable concepts on the subject matter (and if it did, they weren't very emphasized). It seemed to jump from abstract considerations of \"what a game is\" towards the beginning, immediately to a sequence of independent projects whose criteria seemed to revolve more heavily around learning software (eg 3D modeling in Unity or managing audio tracks in Adobe Audition) than working out what makes a game fun, engaging, etc. I don't know how to improve this, since I don't know exactly what these applicable concepts might be.\r\n\r\nI found a number of the concepts I do remember learning to be both a bit vague and confining. For example, in the segment of the course where we learned about defining elements of a \"game\", I could think of some examples of games that were excluded from these definitions, even as someone who is not well-versed in the game scene. We did also learn some ideas about visual art, an area I am more familiar with; these ideas, especially the ones from one particular assigned article, definitely seemed to be creatively restrictive, supported largely by logical fallacies, and generally full of holes. It seems to be a collection of self-fulfilling advice--the more widely this specific creative lens is taught, the larger the pool of \"evidence\" created to back it up--based in personal opinion, but being taught under the guise of \"fundamentals\", and harmful especially for the more impressionable minds of beginners. Though I am less familiar with game-focused concepts, I would not be surprised if there were similar issues in the teaching of that subject matter.\r\n\r\nI think the value of instructor feedback was debatable as well. The frequency and timing themselves lowered the effectiveness of any feedback; especially for the first few projects, we received little to no feedback until the final assignment grade. We did not receive any of these grades at all until right before the end of the semester, when we received all the previous projects' grades at once. Personally, I received numerous points off in areas with no negative feedback, sometimes no feedback at all, so it was unclear what I should change. Much of the feedback I received seemed highly subjective, leaning towards certain types of games\/products; in particular, the instructors seemed to prefer games that were \"more competitive\" and storylines that had higher \"stakes\". To them it seems, it would be better for all dialogue to very directly connect back to some \"overall goal\" and to have great \"consequence\", which feels like saying \"tell don't show\" (this phrase is mine, not theirs). In my mind, leaving some open space is a valid creative decision--space for a listener to visualize their own version of a fictional world, or space for characters to have casual everyday conversation--but clearly in this class it is a flaw. Fortunately I know and love stories that show otherwise (eg many Ghibli films celebrate the charm of small, \"inconsequential\" aspects of daily life), but I wonder about people who may have picked up this message without question.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there have been several instances in which I was informed that I was the \"only\" one in the class to have done something on a number of assignments, be it selecting a type of game to present, or a type of game to make, or literally disagreeing with any of the articles assigned to read over the whole course. Either I am doing something awfully wrong, and being overly critical, or this course does not emphasize individual flexibility and critical thinking nearly enough."

                "The live in-class discussions were very successful in my opinion. Both professors frequently asked intriguing questions, and I enjoyed participating and listening to my classmates' thoughts. Having assignments where we got to create things to share with the class was also very enjoyable. \r\n\r\nSince this was the first year of COVID, it was understandable that there were not prerecorded tutorials for software such as Adobe, which was the only thing that could have been improved.",
                "Some classes were devoted entirely to watching an instructor use some software, but it was almost impossible for me to absorb any of that information live, especially since both the instructor's screen and the software window on my own computer could not be simultaneously viewed fully. The recorded video tutorials were the only effective way to learn the software.\r\n\r\nAt times, points were taken off for technical difficulties, which in my view is especially unfair given that the pandemic has sent most\/all freshmen off campus this semester. I was penalized for audio sharing issues in my gameplay demo, which would not have occurred if we had done the demo in person. I don't think it was feasible to test for audio or screen-sharing problems beforehand or take similar preventative measures, especially since my demo required my classmates to share from their computers as well. Any such problems can occur if someone has bad internet connection at home, for example, which is out of their control and not indicative of their merit. On another assignment, the \"technical\" component, including the quality of recorded audio (\"clear and serviceable\"), weighed 20% of the grade for that project. At home, some students might not have high-quality recording equipment, or quiet areas to record, off the top of my head. I don't believe students should be penalized for such issues, especially now.\r\n\r\nOn another note, some content in the class should have had warnings at the very minimum; this is not directly related to the pandemic, but I feel it should be said. In particular, one instructor-led demo was of a game about the bleak, aimless despair of everyday life. The player's character had to commit suicide off of a tall building to progress in the game, which at the time was a shock to me. Well, this may come as a shock to the instructors, but some students have depression and suicidal thoughts in real life (for example, Me), and may find it more difficult to hold onto being alive when they think about the bleak, aimless despair of everyday life. Many find it much more difficult to do so when, suddenly and without warning, they have to watch someone (fictional or real) commit suicide, especially in a way they may have considered before. A real-life Yale freshman (not enrolled in this course) committed suicide on campus, and apparently isolation due to the pandemic was a large contributing factor. Be more considerate of students' lives and mental health. It's not worth the shock value."
