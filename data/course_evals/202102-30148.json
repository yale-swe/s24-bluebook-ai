I think this is a really good baseline for astronomy classes, and I would feel very confident going into another one after this.",
                "How astronomers know certain things about the universe, some observing skills.",

Mathematical relationships like wavelength radiated and velocity, stars' luminosity and brightness and temperature, gravitational force and mass, binary stars' masses, orbital period and semimajor axis of orbit.",

                "A strength was that it allowed us to apply mathematical concepts to our understanding of the universe.",
                "I found the lectures and material quite interesting, the weakness would be that there were lots and lots of videos and reading, maybe one or the other should be cut down.",
                "Strengths - the professor is great, and clearly cares a lot about the subject and their students. He did a great job of answering every one of the students' questions. The way we worked through the course material made sense. It operates as a flipped classroom, which can be a strength or a weakness, but I personally liked that the meeting times were more informal and discussion based, and that I got to watch the lectures at my leisure.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the classes, discussion sections, and both exams were all at the same time of day. This was obviously a strength if you value consistency, but since this time was relatively late in the day sometimes I think it would've been better to change the timings, especially as the exams were on a Sunday. The psets were very long and it would have been nice to have the slides from the lectures.",
                "I enjoyed the discussion nature of the class.  It was also very clear what we had to know for the course exams and psets.  The observing exercise was fun.  Garrett was a great teaching fellow.",
                "I thought that the information was taught in a way that made it interesting but discussion groups over zoom sometimes felt less helpful than just having lectures and asking questions.",
                "Prerecorded lecture videos were very informative but long and their main points were not the same as those in the psets and exams. Feedback and expectations on psets and exams are not very clear. It is good that Dr. Faison provides time during class to ask him questions about concepts that we don't understand, but he dislikes questions about homework and exams. His classes and lectures are interesting though. He likes to share current astronomy news.",
                "The professor is really great. You can tell he cares a lot about the course. Overall, the course is really good; I really enjoy the flipped classroom structure because it lets me watch lecture on my own time and then work on practice problems and clarify things I probably wouldn't have asked during class time. The only critique I have is on the quiz questions during recorded lectures. Some of the questions weren't very well defined; I wasn't always sure what exactly they were asking. The quiz questions were pretty much just graded for completion, though, so that made it more okay and less stressful about getting some of them wrong. Again, though, this is a great course overall.",
