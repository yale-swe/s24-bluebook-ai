                "the lectures were long and boring. They never involved talking about how the code works and why. they sucked. More time needed to be spent on talking about what the code does and how, espceillay for ML. This is a coding class for scientists so it makes sense to talk generally about how the concept works before applying it. But still... we need to knwo the code instead of copying and pasting.",
                "the difficulty between psets had a lot of variance",
                "Strengths - you learn a lot. \r\nWeakness - very poorly taught. One of the worst classes I have taken at Yale. Poorly taught, not well run to facilitate \"intro\" class.",
                "One of the major strengths of the course was the partner lab aspect. We were grouped into groups of three the first day of class and worked together for the rest of the year. I dont think I couldve gotten through this class if it werent for my awesome partners. Also having a lab portion during each class really helped me get started on the problem set a whole week before it was due.",
                "This course teaches many useful skills and the problem sets are well-geared towards learning as they ensure you know how to implement the theory taught in class. However, having only one class a week did mean that it was difficult to stay engaged for the entire class period and especially in the lectures, so splitting it into two sessions a week might help. The example code in the lecture notes helped a lot, as some of the early assignments were extremely difficult to code, as we were only introduced to the theory of it in lecture and did not know how to convert that to python code in the context of the assignment.",
                "I think the course content and pacing were very good. I feel like I would be successful in a research situation where I needed to create a neural network to complete some task. However, the lectures and problem sets were confusing at times in terms of wording and organization, which sometimes added unnecessary work of interpreting what I was supposed to be doing.",
                "Lectures are understandable and course content is interesting. The problem sets are germane to the lecture material and aid in understanding. There are many office hours and the TFs are helpful. The difficulty of the course is inconsistent, some problem sets required nearly all code from scratch for somewhat complicated problems and others could be completed entirely with copying code from slides.",
                "The course was incredibly well organized, and the structure of the class being set up as a lecture for the first half and computing lab in the second was very helpful in applying newly introduced concepts in a collaborative environment with easy access to TAs for additional clarification if needed. The problem sets were appropriately challenging so that we were forced to think critically about the introduced concepts, while still being manageable. Overall, it was an excellent course, and as I look back on all I've learned in one semester, particularly in regards to my increased knowledge and comfort with python and machine learning, I am definitely grateful I took this class.",
                "Strengths: You learn a lot about machine learning and explanations that may not always be offered in CS courses. \r\nWeaknesses: There is such a BIG discrepancy in grading between the graders, and the difficulty of the psets fluctuate a lot. You either spend 1 or 15 hours on a pset every week.",
                "Strengths: Daisuke is very knowledgeable in data analysis and machine learning and will answer any question you have for him. The course also gives a very thorough introduction to ML and you learn many different techniques to using ML for data analysis. Daisuke asked for midterm feedback and actually implemented what students were asking for, such as more officer hours earlier in the week. \r\nWeaknesses: The duration of time a PSET would take varied wildly which made it hard to balance the work load with other classes."

                "Just take CS 200 or ENAS 130 if you want to learn python. Just because this class has no exams does not mean you will learn in the most effective way. If you want a good foundation in CS and you are a scientiest take another class.",
                "Yes, I thought it was a great physics elective",
                "I would only to get the certificate in stats. Yes, I learned a lot, but it was not an easy / well taught path.",
                "Yes! If you are looking for a very practical physics elective, this is a great one.",
                "Yes, it is challenging but a great way to learn scientific computing.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course, especially to science students who will be doing any kind of computer-aided research. For example, all physics majors who have to take PHYS 471 for the senior requirement should definitely take this class if they don't have the skills already. I would even recommend that the physics department either require or strongly recommend this or a similar class as part of the physics major so that students aren't put in a situation where they need these skills without having been prepared.",
                "Yes I would. Im a CS major that took  this course for a science credit, and at first I thought the course was unreasonably difficult for an introduction to python, and it seems like the majority of the class agreed. But i have to give a lot of credit to prof nagai and the teaching staff for responding positively and actively to feedback to restructure the assignments in such a way that they were actually really enjoyable and instructive after the first few assignments",
                "Yes, if you are interesting in getting introduced to machine learning and scientific computing topics or if you are looking for an easy course.",
                "This is one of the weirdest classes I have ever taken. The first half of the class was quite hard and made everybody go to office hours to basically get force-fed code from the TFs until we had the answers. In the second half, the staff overreacted by putting the answers to the PSets in the slides, so PSets became copy-pastable with a few bug fixes required when the code given to us had inexplicable bugs (like typos) that made it look like the code was written in Keynote instead of Google Colab. Because of that, the lectures were 90 minutes that were basically useless. On the other hand, I like the concept of the class, that you get an overview of different techniques that gives you a place to start Googling if you ever need to use them in the future. I can't say I know how every part of a neural network works, but I do think I could solve a problem that requires one if I wanted to in the future.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would recommend this course to any student with a beginner to intermediate level of comfort with python who is looking to build their computing skills, especially in terms of scientific application based problems which may be encountered in lab settings. The second half of the course also focuses on machine learning which I found to be incredibly interesting and relevant.",
                "I would recommend this course to people who are very familiar with machine learning / python, and have the time. Even as a CS student I often felt lost about the course materials despite having worked with python before, and this is because the psets are often hard to just cook up on your own.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in ML or anyone who wants to improve their python skills."
