                "the experiments were well designed",
                "Strengths: The labs were thoughtfully organized and prepared to fit into the 3 hour time slot (1:30-4:30). The homeworks were not extensive or stressful. Dr. Guller was very nice, and knowledgeable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The immunohistochemistry lab with Dr. Kliman was not enjoyable. Scoring staining from 0 to +++ is highly subjective and falling out of use in the field now, in addition to being labor-intensive and time-consuming. Employing another technique instead of this lab would be cool. The homework for this lab was also very unclear - there were some questions where the arrow placement was unclear. Dr. Whirledge was not understanding of student mistakes and frequently had an abrasive and unwelcoming tone. She should be aware of this for future courses."
