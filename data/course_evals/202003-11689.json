                "This course did an excellent job of explaining some topics, but a lot of the time, I found myself more confused and lost after lecture than before lecture. A lot of the material should have been review for me, but I often found myself less confident on the material the second time through here in 115. Personally, I think the problem lies in the course's tendency to want to spend more time \"proving\" its concepts and thinking of them in strange, out-of-context manners rather than teaching us the calculus itself. Ultimately, I would urge the instructors to better focus the lectures on the material at hand rather than trying to make wacky polls and puzzles out of said material.\r\n\r\nI felt grading on the tests was often very strange. Multiple times, I'd get points off for notation \"errors\" that were trivial at best, or incorrect at worst: once, I made a disclaimer that I'd be writing a variable a certain different way to help keep my work organized, and then I got points off anyway even though the math was all correct (my pleas for an explanation on Gradescope did not clarify the issue).",
                "The strengths: the course is organized to give students as much help as possible, and peer tutors are super helpful for explaining concepts that were hard to understand in class. \r\nThe weaknesses: this course moved quickly, and after the Thanksgiving\/moving back home break, it was difficult to adapt to the schedule right before finals.",
                "Strengths: Homework system--the work before class and the weekly concept checks were very helpful, and the Wednesday due date for PSETs was different from my other PSET-based classes, which was a nice bonus. The Canvas webpage is organized well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While the course was structured well on the whole, there would be times when we wouldn't finish a lecture and would never return to the subject. Other times, some areas of study were not dealt with enough.",
                "One of the strengths of this course is its structure, the class is well organized chronologically. A weakness is its breadth of information covered in one semester.",

                "The course was very well-structured and flowed logically, and it never felt like we were rushing. The explorations were helpful, but sometimes they felt like chores rather than learning opportunities.",
                "More examples",
                "Strengths: so well organized, online learning modules on canvas are very helpful and coherent, lots of supports if need extra help, good use of class time in balancing lecture and discussion\/practice problems \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I was with same few students for my breakout room group for most of the semester, office hours dominated by certain people and was hard to get a question answered. Also, PSET graders did not give helpful feedback whatsoever and it was hard at times to figure out what I did wrong without bothering the professor.",

I wish that the lectures were recorded, though, as being able to go back and watch things through a second time would be great, as Zoom classes definitely don't allow the material to stick as well the first time.\r\n\r\nReliance on breakout rooms was a great idea in concept, but I always got put in the same room with two students who refused to talk or turn their cameras on, so I often just found myself working alone.",
                "The frequent office hours were very helpful.",
                "The exams were proctored over Zoom, which was a strange setup. Having to keep your computer tilted down at your paper while you looked at the questions on the same screen was not super enjoyable, and having to keep your mic on but volume down meant that occasionally it felt like you had to check the questions many times. I know some of the other courses did timed psets for exams, and this course may have benefitted from that sort of re-imagining.",

                "Strength: canvas modules, preset Desmos graphs with sliders, balance of class structure to maintain attention, mid class group practice problems, jam board for group sharing\r\n\r\nWeakness: because most of the class was freshman, I think many of them werent used to the different platforms let alone using them in a pandemic. I think a more comprehensive overview with suggestions at the beginning of the semester would be helpful  and I realize some things were also said many times. Just going over things like: jam board link is the same add it to bookmarks, the notes are posted after class if you miss something, the lectures are here on canvas.",
                "More of the lectures could be recorded so students can be more flexible especially after we went home.",
                "I think that video shouldn't be required, but it should be highly encouraged. By the end of the semester, everyone had their cameras off and I was the only person with mine on. Eventually, I caved and I turned off my camera in class. After I started having my camera off, I found myself coming into class less prepared. As it was my first class in the morning on Mondays and Wednesdays, I would sometimes start the class in bed until I would have to turn my camera on to answer questions. Looking at a bunch of blank screens with names on them ruined my productivity and engagement during class. I know that I could have had my camera on, but it was so depressing being the only person with it on.",
