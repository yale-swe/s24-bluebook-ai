                "Writing skills certainly improved - more deliberate word choice and greater comfortability with deviating from standard 5-paragraph style. Greater confidence as well in my ability as a writer",
                "I was able to differentiate between a weak and a strong claim in an essay, whether it was writing or reading one. I was exposed to different opinions that I found engaging and important when participating in a conversation. I was able to get out of the MLA format writing style and use more fun and liberating freeform format that Professor Robinson insisted we followed and became more effective.",

After taking this course, I feel significantly more confident in my ability to structure a comprehensive and convincing argument around a central claim. I also learned a lot about the significance of censorship.",
                "Through this course, I was able to develop my analyzation skills and learn to make strong arguments.",

                "This course was interesting and its readings were engaging. The feedback was always clear and easily understandable in regards to papers. There were no major weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Professor Robinson is so chill and understands that life is tough sometimes. Professor Robinson tries to create a fun environment and tries to use modern \"slang\" that can be funny and a nice break from monotone boring instructors. The class helps you to understand how Yale professors want you to write an essay (in my experience it was completely different than how my high school taught me but it may not be the same for everyone). I got to use the online library which I'm sure will be helpful later on. You don't have many essays, compared to other classes, and it's important in my opinion to take a 114 class. This class is perfect for artsy and social science students that want to learn more about freedom of expression and different ideologies from classmates and even the professor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings were really outdated and felt a little bit out of touch with certain topics that people pointed out and were a little bit awkward. Some of the feedback I received wasn't that helpful in my essays and I found writing tutors to give me more feedback and helped my grade a lot. Yeah, not many weakness, it was a good class overall.",
                "Strengths: Robinson is a great professor, really understanding, has fun\/interesting stories, good theme and discussions \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes he goes on tangents which leads to less discussion",
                "I appreciate that Professor Robinson primarily evaluated the strength of our argument in our paper. This meant that we could take more time to make sure our claim and our argument was solid, as oftentimes the form of the paper was not prioritized as heavily in grading. Professor Robinson focused on our content, not our form.",
                "Sometimes it felt a little repetitive given the niche subject, but overall interesting to me.",
                "Lots of clear feedback and a very manageable workload. Professor Robinson is very flexible with deadlines and also a lenient grader."

                "Yes! Professor Robinson is so so helpful and cares immensely about the success of his students. He also presents the topic in a very interesting manner, and provides great feedback on your papers. The class spans a lot of types of readings, and while the readings can get difficult from time to time, they are  on the whole very interesting and inform your thinking a lot!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as it helped improve my writing a lot.",
                "Yes, great course - much better writing and some interesting pieces that made me rethink censorship",
                "Yes, I think that this is a good course to take as your first writing class at yale. I regret taking this class in the second semester because I feel that I would have enjoyed the benefits a lot in my other writing classes. If you take this class, you pretty much learn to write a paper for the rest of your 4 years here and in a way that you will enjoy yourself. Professor Robinson is a character that I feel everyone needs to experience because you will rarely find a professor so chill and caring for his students. Engage in conversations with him outside of class because he is a walking library, he has a lot of wisdom to give and engages you. I was never bored at any of his classes and most of the times he would talk about Greek and Latin scholars, so I say that is pretty impressive. I think that this class also helped me to be more comfortable changing my opinion on many topics and realizing that it is okay to spend 6 hours writing a paper and getting rid of all it as long as you feel happy with your final product.",
                "YES! If you are looking to improve your writing, take this section of ENGL 114. Not a huge workload and the feedback you get will make you a much better writer. Robinson is a great and very kind professor, and is very accommodating",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially one that perhaps does not feel very confident in their writing yet. This course improved both my writing and my thinking.",
                "YESSS! Professor Robinson's classes were super engaging and I was always excited to attend class.",
                "For writing credit yes",
                "Yes! Taking English 114 is a great way to get a writing credit out of the way and Censorship and the Arts tackles a lot of interesting content."
