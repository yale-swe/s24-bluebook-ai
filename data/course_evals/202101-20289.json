            "comments": [
                "Knowledge: I feel like I really expanded my global understanding from a historical perspective. I learnt how past historians wrote what they wrote and read a good deal about what they wrote (something you'll probably never do on your own!). I really enjoyed discussing the works of Herodotus, Polybius, Sima Qian and (to a lesser extent) al-Tabari with Professor Hansen and the class. The essays really helped me think carefully about the historians\/their work and solidify my grasp on the lesson. Skills: Professor Hansen is hands-down the best writing instructor I've ever seen! Her sharp eyes never miss a poorly constructed phrase or a silly argument. Typically no-nonsense, she never hesitates to tell say to you, \"Cut this whole paragraph.\" It's often because you had to! I really appreciate her kindness, patience and laxity with grading too, in spite of her sharp writing assessment.",
                "Through course I gained an understanding of how the historical method developed and how a broad range of historians approached the discipline. I learned about some of the major debates in the field of history and how they changed over time.",
                "This first year seminar thoroughly developed both my written and oral presentation skills, as well as my ability to close-read text and think from the perspective of the historian. As my first course with a substantial quantity of reading, I learned how I best read and the best practices to remember the content, which have already become useful in various aspects of my life and studies.",
                "I improved my essay writing and learned a lot about the ancient world historians and world history around the world. I developed insights into how history is written.",
                "I gained a stronger understanding of the purpose of writing history and how historians wrote differently to achieve different purposes."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Starts with an interesting material (Herodotus, obviously!), has thought-provoking\/creative essay prompts, a very helpful\/engaging instructor, not too harsh with the grading (lax, in fact). Weaknesses: Some of the readings are really boring if you try to read everything (Marx and Weber, al-Tabari, Polybius). I wish Professor Hansen\/Yale\/experience had told us (me) that I could read just a few sections from a 50-100 page assigned reading and engage pretty actively in the class. Or that the assigned readings were shortened significantly. Please, future students, don't be too \"academically-religious\" and do ALL of your readings. Just aim for taking enough info to sustain you through a ~75 min class discussion.",
                "Strengths: the content was fascinating and I enjoyed being able to learned about geographically diverse figures (from Rome, Greece, China, the Islamic world, etc). I also felt like all of the assignments in the course helped consolidate my understanding of the material covered and Professor Hansen provided specific feedback on each writing assignment. The texts chosen were all enjoyable to read. Weakness: I felt at times during class discussion would wander and it would sometimes be unclear what the most important aspects of a particular historian are.",
                "One of the strengths of this course, especially this semester, was its size. It facilitated in-depth feedback for the students, and also forced me to step out of my comfort zone and present my ideas to the class. Furthermore, the clear organization of the course, established in the syllabus, allowed for me to be prepared for each class, especially when it came to buying all of the books on time, knowing what I should be reading, etc.",
                "Strengths: Loved the historians we read. They were fascinating and our analysis in class was deep.\r\nWeakness: None",
                "I think this course was strong in presenting a wide array of histories and historians. I grew a lot in my writing and public speaking skills throughout the course. I wish we spent more time on non-western historians and dove more in depth to the materials we read. I believe we focused on Herodotus, Marx, and Weber much more than Sima Qian and Al-Tabari. I also wish we had more time in class to freely discuss our thoughts and questions about the texts. It felt like our discussions in class always had a point or end goal we had to reach that limited the ways we could have explored the text through conversation.",
                "The format (discussion seminar) was a strength. Discussions allowed the students to share their opinions and their points of view. The debates helped students practice public speaking. One weakness of this course was that the students did not receive constructive criticism on writing assignments. When asking for further clarification on the comments, the Professor did not elaborate or provide advice for future improvement. Furthermore, the course did not encourage my writing. The majority of comments were negative and extremely discouraging. Another weakness of the course was that students had to adapt the preferred writing style of the professor as opposed to developing their own personality in their writing. Another weakness, was the lack of time to read and analyze each text. On occasion, the discussion questions for an entire book would only be available a day or two before the seminar. These comments\/suggestions are meant to improve an already interesting and intriguing course."

                "I felt that this course adapted very well to the virtual format. I liked the virtual meeting with the instructor and the opportunities to work collaboratively with my peers to better know them. In terms of how the course adopted to a virtual format there is nothing I would change.",
                "I am unsure if there were any specific, new practices implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but I am unsure, as I have not previously taken this course. Everything, however, was converted to function on Zoom, from the Beinecke visit to class and office hours. One practice that I do believe worked well was the use of Zoom for office house, especially with the waiting room feature.\r\n\r\nI do wish I was able to connect more with my classmates; however, this was more an effect of the pandemic and less of this class. Overall, I enjoyed this course and find it difficult to point out any noticeable flaws.",
                "I though the class succeeded virtually, although an in-person seminar would definitely help the flow and connection of the class.",
                "I believe conferencing and office hours on zoom were successful. I feel like we could have utilized breakout rooms more throughout the semester to engage in different conversations. Even though we only had six students, I think that zoom made it difficult to maintain smooth and efficient conversations. Rather than engaging in conversations through the seminar format, it sometimes felt like we were taking turns answering questions.",
                "A practice that succeeded was discussions on Zoom. Despite the challenges of online learning, we were able to generate intellectually stimulating conversations. In addition, the break out rooms are useful for working in small groups. The practices that can improve include the management of time during the discussions. There were instances where the discussions turned into a spiral that leaned away from the main point. In addition, occasionally looking at examples beyond the text, such as other short writings or art, might help the discussion."

                "I definitely would--unless you want to avoid reading\/writing-based classes, in which case you better stay away from HU credits. The professor is so knowledgeable and engaging (she has written lots of history text books and relates to you as a lovely mother), the global insight you gain is going to be memorable (I can never forget Herodotus' narrations and Sima Qian's elegy, for instance!), and the class size is ~7 people so you could get to know people in your class a lot better here. And the grading is rather lax! Most of all, though, your writing would end up pretty neat--succinct, direct, and attractive. It's your call.",
                "I would recommend this course. I think that this course allows students to explore a unique field (the history of history) in an interesting and accessible way. The classes themselves were engaging and the readings and assignments were all very interesting. This is also a great opportunity to learn about different regions of the world and their differences in terms of how they approach history.",
                "Yes, if a first-year student asked me which seminar to take, I would fully recommend them to take HIST 072. This course not only gives a global survey of history (something many students, including myself, lacked in our Euro-centric high school history education), but also builds the skills of writing and speaking, which are crucial for other classes at Yale.",
                "Yes definitely! A very fun, intellectual course.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who want to approach world history broadly, but from the unique perspective of historians.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. The experience was extremely discouraging. The comments on my writing did not include constructive criticism and were often incorrect. In addition, this course attempted to make me lose every writing skill I had previously learned."
