                "I gained an extensive understanding of politics and society in the Middle Ages. This course was also great in that it connected the themes of Medieval Europe to modern society.",
                "I learned a lot about medieval history from 1000-1500, and a little bit of the historical context of what came before. There was a good amount of practice analyzing primary sources, both in class, section and the papers. This course mostly focused on Western Europe and the domain of the Holy Roman Church. On that note, I learned A LOT about religion in this class, particularly the establishment of Catholicism as we understand it now, but also about Islam and Judaism during this time period. Professor Fancy did a great job of linking what we were learning to our reality today, so the class did not feel particularly removed from current history despite how long ago it was. We also did a lot of conceptual thinking about what Europe, \"the West\" and nation-states were and are. Great class."

                "Just listening to prof Fancy's lectures changed the way I think about argument construction. The best lecturing professor I've ever had. Plus, our class was pretty small, so he engaged the class directly which was so awesome.",
                "Professor Fancy is very engaging but there was little infrastructure to help students learn material from lectures they had to miss.",

                "It was awesome.",
                "Strengths: Professor Fancy's teaching and general knowledge. Our class was lucky that it was so small (possibly because it was Prof. Fancy's first year teaching at Yale) so we got a lot of interaction with him. But I'm sure it would be great as a large lecture too. The class was also well organized, not always chronologically but along certain themes (ex: the 12th century Renaissance, political history of the Middle Ages, the \"Other\"). Dates were not overly important in this class, so you didn't have to memorize a ton and Professor Fancy was very clear about what was actually important to remember or what you could just listen to in order to get the general gist. Also our TF Shahrouz was fantastic ! and section was well-run, with very interesting primary sources. Not a huge workload, and it was easy to stay engaged in class because Prof. Fancy made the material so interesting. \r\nAreas for Improvement: I wish we had learned a little more about what was happening in Eastern Europe at this time, and had more context on the Byzantine Empire and the Ottoman Empire. Also sometimes the important names (the ones in red) in the lecture felt a little random."

This is the perfect class for anyone interested in pre-Industrial history or the history of Europe, I highly recommend it to anyone interested in modern European history/politics as well.",
                "Absolutely. You need to take a class with prof Fancy while at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course due to its importance for understanding world history and for the energy Professor Fancy brought to every class.",

                "Yes, this has been my favorite course at Yale so undoubtedly.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, as it is fascinating and Professor Fancy as awesome.",
                "Absolutely! Great teaching team, interesting and (surprisingly) relevant material, not just for modern day Europe but for the world considering the widespread influence of many \"Western\" notionsalthough this class absolutely complicates that. If you are interested in medieval times, European history, the creation of modern religions, the nation-state, the conceptualization of the \"other\" in different contexts, or just want an interesting lecture to attend every week, I'd highly recommend this class."
