    "I learned a lot about myself.",
    "The class focused on reading Gaddis' soon-to-be-released book On Grand Strategy and reading some of the foundational works that went into the book. Overall, the class was phenomenal. The reading posed interesting historical juxtapositions, provided interesting basic concepts for characteristics of grand strategists, and just generally allowed for good thinking and discussion.",
    "I learned a lot about how different great leaders have approached problems and the assignments made me think a lot about how I approach the world.",
    "In terms of knowledge, a gained a broad understanding of \"grand strategy\" as a concept, \"foxes and hedgehogs\" as an idea, and a range of of other concepts, of varying originality and usefulness, that relate to how a state, group, or person should conduct its\/their\/her\/his life. That explanation applies equally, I think, to skills and insights, so  I believe I am done with this question."

   "comments": [
    "Weaknesses\r\n\r\n-I never did the reading besides Gaddis' book. I did not have the time, and we only ever discussed Gaddis' book anyway, so it does not matter if you read Sun Tzu or Machiavelli, or whatever. I bought those books, but never read them!\r\n\r\n-It was a little crowded around the table- I wish the class size was smaller by one or two people\r\n\r\nPros\r\n\r\n-John Gaddis- what a legend!\r\n\r\n-the 2nd essay topic\r\n\r\n- 4  5 page papers > 1 20 page papers\r\n\r\n- I think my writing actually got better this semester as a result of the writing checklist\r\n\r\n- the subject matter itself is so interesting and applicable, even to your own life",
    "Prof. Gaddis advertised this course as an opportunity for genuine feedback and constructive criticism of his manuscript, in reality Prof. Gaddis was not looking for substantial feedback and rather sought admiration and avoided answering any though questions.",
    "Obviously, the class can never be repeated, because the book will have been published. Nonetheless, I think all of the readings are worth doing. The difficulty is that the class is so dependent on how strong the discussion is and sometimes people seemed to have nothing to say (I'm not really sure what that was about, if it was a fear of embarrassing themselves in front of Gaddis or if they just hadn't done the reading), but perhaps a way to stimulate more discussion would be helpful.",
    "I'm extremely unsure that Professor Gaddis has much of an interest in teaching this course again, so I'm also not sure that this question has a ton of utility in this particular context. But with that being said: broadly, the strengths of this course were Professor Gaddis's selection of really interesting, fun, insightful readings, including primarily his own new book, and the originality of the writing assignments. I'm sure that some students will complain of the somewhat opaque essay instructions  and, were my own time-honed preferences in writing style not serendipitously very similar to Professor Gaddis's own, I might be complaining as well  but I learned a great deal in writing the papers, by applying the always interesting but sometimes somewhat nebulous concepts that we learned throughout the course to very specific case studies from history and my own life. I would say that the course's main weakness, on the other hand, was the often-unproductive in-class environment. Professor Gaddis sometimes would slap down the dull and annoying ideas presented by various members of the seminar, but given the comical arrogance and cloying banality of many of the students' contributions to our discussion, we would have all benefited from him doing this more often.",
    "More autobiography!"

    "*disclaimer: Gaddis WILL and DOES give C's on papers! Of course, A's are attainable, but if the thought of a C paralyzes you with fear, this is not the class for you. \r\n\r\nI loved taking Foxes and Hedgehogs this semester. The professor, the discussions, the reading material, and even the essays themselves were brilliant. \r\n\r\nTake this class if you are interested in:\r\n-learning from Prof. Gaddis\r\n-broad history (from Xerxes to FDR)\r\n-grand strategy\r\n-improving your writing\r\n-writing unorthodox essays",
    "It will be interesting to see if the course gets offered again, but if it is, I would recommend taking it.",
    "I would not recommend this course if Professor Gaddis teaches it again. With only one chapter a week of his book, the discussion was weak. Papers were the highlight -- interesting prompts and fun to write.",
    "100%.",
    "\"Would I recommend this course to another student?\" is an understandably but annoyingly broad question, because whether someone would enjoy \"Foxes and Hedgehogs\" will entirely depend on who they are. And, by the way, this question is probably mostly moot, because I don't think that Gaddis is going to teach this course again (it was designed entirely around the class reading a draft chapter of his new book each week, and offering suggestions for its improvement). With that being said: F&H was a weird, kind of bifurcated course. The class readings were actually pretty good, and I learned a lot. And while a ton of people will complain about the admittedly opaque essays, they were actually pretty original and I learned a lot doing them, and the complaints largely arise from a misunderstanding of how this course (and, I'm pretty sure, Gaddis's other classes) actually work. Despite the endless, insufferably arrogant, supremely annoying, brown-nosing, self-infatuated contributions to in-class discussion by a uniform parade of oxford-shirt-and-v-neck-sweater-wearing, masters-of-the-universe wannabes who would kneel down and kiss Gaddis's toes one by one if it even marginally increased their chances of being admitted to Grand Strategy, he doesn't actually care very much about how much or how well you speak in class. Your grade will be almost entirely determined by the quality of your writing, which he (admirably) evaluates independently of your in-class performance  and performance indeed it is.",
    "Course changed my life. I am a Grand Strategy reject, and I think I got that education (minus all the nice fancy perks of GS) from this class. Being able to talk with Gaddis about what matters in life (topics like philosophy, politics, literature) is the opportunity of a lifetime. TAKE THIS COURSE!!!!!!"
