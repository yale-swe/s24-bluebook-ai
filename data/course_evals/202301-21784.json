                "Essentially nothing. The first paper was so convoluted and experimental that senior English majors were getting the lowest grades they'd gotten in a decade. We were taught close reading in section months into the course. No meaningful analysis happened in lectures.",
                "This class did not develop much of my skills all that much. There was an analysis of gothic literature, but it was more so an overview of all things gothic and less focused on the explicit materials in class. The writing tasks in the class did not necessarily encourage growth instead they just seemed to be \"fun\" projects that had very skewed standards of grading across different Tasks. Expectations were hard to meet because of this and growth in the end felt stilted as a result.",
                "This course provided me a great example of all that the gothic genre has to offer in both literature and film. It dissected a lot of traditional gothic tropes while relating them modern day social issues.",
                "I learned how to deal with vampires and werewolves! I believe this is a crucial skill for any Yale student. My boy Tim once got attacked by a vampire on the street. Armed with the knowledge of this class, I will now be able to defend him!",

I learned how to think about emotional and aesthetic concepts such as horror and the sublime, and I became a stronger writer and literary analyst.",

                "I learned about the conventions of gothic literature and horror",

                "Writing assignments were helpful to approach texts from different lenses, but didnt contain much well-explained pedagogy that I could see other than the first essay. Exposure to Gothic literature and significant writers, and a chance to watch seminal films.",
                "I learned about the history of the gothic as a genre and set of tropes, beginning with Horace Walpole's novel The Castle of Otranto and going all the way to Jordan Peele's Get Out",
                "Ultimately, I felt I did not learn much during this course. This course was writing-heavy, with many busy-work assignments and mandatory reflections on each essay; but I cannot confidently say my writing improved, and there was no instruction given as to writing well. That said, I do appreciate the feedback that my TA took the time to give me.",

            "comments": [
                "Oh boy, this class felt like a wild ride, but a sharply downhill one. The beginning was amazingCastle of Otranto, Mexican Gothic, Get Out, Parasite. I felt engaged and provoked by thinking about the themes of Gothic fiction and different lens of analysis. After that, it felt like the class lost its way. We didn't really have great discussions in lecture or in section. I also dreaded the texts and second half of the syllabus. It was not nearly as engaging and very much ruined my experience in the course. I started cutting class because the author descriptions in lecture didn't really frame the syllabus well for me. Also, the assignments were really all over the place. There was supposedly a pedagogical partner involved, but it felt disorganized and incoherent. It was hard to figure out what exactly the professor wanted (and the instructions always changed). Also, the assignment due dates are WAY too tight. It's so hard to believe that a student was involved in making it.",
                "I did not like this course, which is such a shame because I think it could have been great. First off, half of the materials were films and not books, which didn't quite make sense to me as an English class. I didn't completely follow the arc of the course and also was frustrated by the assignments  because of how confusing the prompts were, because of how little they related to English (one assignment was making a film pitch deck on PowerPoint), and because  of the sheer number we were expected to do. There was a ton of busywork, and I do not feel like i at all became a better reader or writer because of it.",
                "Strengths: The class material (like the books, films, and short stories we read/watched) was incredibly interesting, and reflected many different genres and mediums. I loved completing the homework for this class. I also loved the sections, which gave us an opportunity to talk with other students about the material. Weaknesses: I felt that the lectures were a bit boring, and often found the analysis a bit out of left field. I also feel like the level of work was a lot. Lastly, there were barely any small assignments, which put a lot of pressure on the 3 bigger assignments we had.",
                "More Vampires and Werewolves, less Castles",
                "Weaknesses: Way too many small assignments, none of them substantive. Frankly terrible material most of the time except for some old classics. Over-conceptualized assignment prompts that created confusion and extra work. Meaningfully inconsistent grading between sections (probably because the rubrics are as lengthy, rambling, and confusing as the prompts for the assignments, which were sometimes actually just baffling). Basic lectures which consisted of long passages read out loud, Wikipedia-level history, or prompts to turn to our neighbors and discuss personal responses to things like paintings.",
                "I came in very excited about the material, but the first few lectures were a bit of a let down. The course lacks a true unraveling of the texts and uses them as branches to get to different themes in the genre. I struggled to get any tangible knowledge and meaning from the class because it just felt like a collective of scattered thoughts without all that much meaning. The grading scale between sections also felt very different and even the expectations on projects between TAs was not clear at all. The class felt disjointed and did not return what it promised.",
                "This is a wonderful course! The material was really engaging, lectures were fun, and all in all I felt like I learned a lot and grew as a reader and writer\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the films we watched in the course and am honestly surprised that it isn't cross-listed with film. It made for a great discussion in class and brought new elements to the stories we were exploring. The course definitely leans more towards English than WGSS. \r\n\r\nThis is a course to take if you enjoy more engaging assignments than the standard essay, like movies, and are interested in learning the general background information on these texts. Some classmates expressed frustration with the number of films we watched and that the lectures were a bit basic (all those classmates were seniors in the English major). I think the class was very well designed to be inclusive to students of all years and majors and the syllabus was always upfront about that  and who would complain about movies! \r\n\r\nSome of the essay prompts were a bit long but this was clearly out of an attempt to provide clarity more than anything else.",
                "Strengths: interesting course material, section was fun and engaging, lectures also tried to remain engaging; assignments were fun and relevant\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could be more about the texts themselves instead of history facts",
                "This course is now one of my favorite Yale courses. Professor Klemann did an excellent job organizing the material including books and films. Lecture could be a little confusing at times but I think that it shows how much we have gone through and how much there is left to learn about gothic texts and teh gothic genre.",
                "The syllabus for this course is incredibly well thought-through. I loved the films and literature we studied. I would have loved a greater focus on writing, as this is listed as an English course, but overall I did like the creativity of the more film-related assignments.",
                "I personally wished there was less of a focus on werewolves, and more on vampires. As a Twilight fan, it wouldve been more engaging. However, the course was absolutely excellent when we discussed vampires.",
                "I appreciate that this class seemed approachable for someone who is not used to English classes, by incorporating lots of projects and writing assignments that were more fun and creative than the traditional analytical essays. We also watched some movies. Con is that there were a lot of assignments.",
                "More modern texts !",
                "I think clearer understanding with how some of the assignments tied into the course as a whole wouldve been helpful.",
                "The syllabus was lovely!! I enjoyed how we read both from the traditional gothic and some modern adaptations. I think the downfall of this course was ultimately its format. English lectures never sit quite right with me, and the class often came across as a history lecture more than a literature course. Much of the course was also focused on things OTHER than literature: paintings, films, etc., which distracted from the novels at hand and were at best tangentially related.",
                "The lecture content and the integration of film.",
                "Strengths: Lectures were always fun to attend, and I appreciated the insights provided by Professor Klemann. The readings and movies were fun and engaging, and I feel like I was exposed to a lot of culture through this class. The assignments were reasonable and engaging. Weaknesses: This class attempted to cover a lot, and we briefly touched on many ideas and concepts before moving onward to the next. I wish this class provided more depth of understanding on a narrower range of concepts.",
                "Strengths were the discussion sections, as that is really where you get to analyze the texts and deep dive. A weakness was that some of the lecture classes felt more like a history lesson about the author/time period of a text rather than actually learning useful topics.",
                "The combination of novels and films on the syllabus was a strength. However, the lectures and topics covered felt disjointed at times and the second half of the course felt pretty different from the first half",
                "I enjoyed the readings and films that we were assigned this semester, and I found the discussions about them enlightening.\r\n\r\nOne thing could be improved is how the content is organized. Although I enjoyed the films, I feel like there were a lot for what was a gothic literature course. It would be good if a couple were removed so that more focus could be given to the texts. Additionally, I feel like the order of the texts/films could have been different: we started by watching Get Out and Parasite, reading Castle of Otranto, then reading a modern work of gothic fiction before exploring classic texts like Dracula or Frankenstein. However, myself and other students feel like it would have been better if we did a gradual progression, starting with Castle of Otranto which founded the gothic genre, moving forward into texts like Frankenstein, Dracula, and others which are the some of the center-piece texts of the genre, before moving forward into modern works like Get Out or Mexican Gothic (the modern gothic novel we read). This way, we could observe the history of the gothic genre and understand how precursor texts influenced the growth and development of the genre as a whole.",
                "The content was wonderful, but the lecture format makes it hard to interact with the material.",
                "Strengths: Great syllabus and fun content to discuss. Some great TFs, and generally helpful office hours. A few thought-provoking writing assignments.\r\nWeaknesses: There could be more WGSS texts in the course content rather than just discussions of WGSS themes in books that are not structured for this type of learning. The guest lecture was unhelpful, and lectures themselves became less and less attended as they didnt help students gain much insight into texts. Assignments could be tedious, frequently changed shortly before due dates, and grading was inconsistent. Cover letter word count requirements were unproductive after the first assignment.",
                "The strengths of this course were discussion section and some of the syllabus. I do not think this course should be a lecture with discussion sections. This is the only class at Yale in my three years of study that I skipped because the lectures just didn't feel worth it. Discussion section, however, was awesome. This is not because the professor was bad and my TF, Sam, was amazing (although he was); I just think lecture got stale as the semester went on. A smaller classroom, 16 people, rethink the syllabus to get rid of some duds like the novel Mexican Gothic, which I and so many of my classmates were sorry to say was the worst book we had read in our time at Yale, would turn this class into something amazing.",
                "This course had a good syllabus (although it was somewhat film-heavy for an English class), and Professor Klemann was kind and caringshe was very invested in the course as a whole. As for weaknesses, I would highlight the course's assignments. In particular, I was not a fan of the film deck project. Although it was, I think, meant to be fun and creative, it was a lot of busy work. Furthermore, a good portion of the project's grade was based on aesthetics and was thereby quite subjective, quite arbitrary. I put in a huge amount of effort, which in the end was not really recognized.",
                "Huge weakness of this course is that it's a lecture. It really should be a seminar. What we learn in lecture is usually 100% irrelevant and could be more fruitful if it were engage with like in a seminar. Another weakness is that this class should be a FILM class. It's barely an English class. The first three assignments are all based around movies or some reason and half the syllabus is watching films. It's also cross listed with WGSS but that always feels like it's just one last interpretation of the texts thrown in at the end. The assignments for this class are also extremely weak. The prompts are either extremely confusing or the exact opposite of the kinds of assignments you'd want to do for an English class.",
                "The assignments were always pretty interesting and were quite fun, albeit time consuming. The reading selections were phenomenal, and lectures were interesting, though maybe slightly harder to follow if you tend to depend on visual cues in slideshows, because the spoken content didn't always match the presentation. However, this is a minor nitpick, because on the whole, this was one of the most enjoyable courses I've taken at Yale.",
                "I loved engaging in conversations with Professor Klemann and my TF. However, I think the lectures were a little disorganized in content manner, and a lot of what we were asked to do in the class was separate from what we learned in the lectures. The conversations outside of class made the class more enjoyable that the class itself was.",
                "It wasnt super challenging and there was a lot of support, but the course was fairly unorganized and there was a lot of busy work.",
                "I loved the breadth and depth of the syllabus because it changed my perspective on gothic literature. I appreciated how we read both classic and modern takes on the gothic genre.",
                "The course was very engaging! A definition and example links sheet of the analytical lenses could be helpful in future years as some were mentioned only briefly but seemed very interesting to pursue further.",
                "I felt like the lectures could have been more student-oriented and more relevant to the actual texts we were readings. I really enjoyed the assignments, they were very creative and increased my level of engagement with the course.",
                "The lecture aspect of this course is very engaging and the way Professor Klemann presents material makes it very interesting. It is very difficult to not pay attention in class when the topics being discussed are so fun to learn. She points out very intersting insights and interpretations of texts that encourages students to engage with the material. The texts and films selected for the syllabus are also a big strength for this course. Instead of reading the same \"classic\" Victorian era gothic literature that most people are familiar with, the syllabus for this class introduced things such as 'Get Out', 'Parasite', and 'Mexican Gothic', and shows how the genre can be applied to various different types of texts. It also introduces racial and cultural diversity into the syllabus that makes it all the more relatable and engaging for different types of students. A weakness would be that this class does have a pretty high workload. I really liked how we were required to submit first drafts and receive feedback on them for our work; I think this really helped facilitate learning. However, there are a lot of assignments, so it is difficult to keep up with all the work. There are 3 assignments and 2 brief assignments, and I think if even one of the brief assignments were taken out the workload would feel more manageable. Since many of these are creative assignments they require a lot more work than a simple essay would.",
                "Strengths: Professor Klemann is an excellent lecturer! The course material is fascinating in and of itself, but Professor Klemann designed the lectures for this course to be incredibly engaging (as we had conversations with each other during lecture, sent in anonymous responses, answered her questions from the crowd, etc). The variety of ways to interact with our peers and the differentness of each assignment also helped to cover a broad range of material; I heavily enjoyed being able to create a graphic project for this class and develop a film vision for a novel in a way I had never imagined before! Delving into both literary and film genres also helped make this course more captivating, and I enjoyed how we explored the growth of the gothic across time and space.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the only way I would suggest improving this course is by perhaps changing the ordering of some of the items on the syllabus- for example, beginning with Castle of Otranto and then following with Parasite and Get Out, so we get a basic understanding of some of the roots of the gothic before we delve into the ways it's changed and evolved.",
                "Weaknesses: too many major assignment due dates back to back in the first half of the semester, with one pretty much every week in addition to the regular reading. Strengths: I did appreciate the explanations of academic terms and theory related to the texts we read, and the overall course material and texts were interesting.",
                "A strength is the very engaging and enjoyable syllabus, but a weakness is a felt lack of deep analysis of the texts in favor of putting them in conversation with other, often unexplored, works."

                "I am hesitant to recommend this course to other students because it is definitely not suited for the lecture format. If it were to move again to a seminar that would hopefully alleviate many problems with the class. Assignments were unclear between sections and grading was very mixed without much standard. Lectures ran like a series of scattered thoughts and would be much better suited as a discussion between a small crop of students. The material is itself pretty interesting, but I had little opportunity to really feel like I engaged with it.",
                "YES! This course was an absolute blast and Prof Klemann is a wonderful lecturer and instructor.",
                "yes",
                "This course is great for anyone who wants to take something interesting and learn about the importance of the gothic genre. It's not spiders, Hot Topic, and dark makeup, it's way more than that.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to other students. Vampires and werewolves are one of societys most pressing phenomena, and are often underdiscussed in todays cultural consciousness. I am glad that they are getting the representation they need.",
                "If you are interested in learning more about gothic literature then I definitely would! It was a good overlook at the genre.",
                "I might recommend this course if you want an interesting lecture without an intense reading load or an accessible writing credit. This course was too broad for me to recommend it unilaterally, as I feel like there are other english classes that might be more engaging with a deeper level of analysis.",
                "I would recommend this as long as you are interested in classic gothic texts.",
                "I would recommend this class if you are interested in learning more about gothic literature and horror and if you are willing to put in the time to read all of the novels",
                "I highly recommend this course. Beyond its academic value, it is just a fun class to take, and you should definitely consider adding it to your schedule if you have space.",
                "Yes",
                "Honestly, probably not. The syllabus for this class is pretty great  watching Get Out and Parasite is a fun start, and all of the books are fun reads. Lectures are poorly structured, though, and it feels like you spend 15 minutes circumnavigating a single point that could have been made in a simple sentence. The guest lecture we had was possibly even less helpful in actually gaining analytical skills and interpreting the Gothic. Also, some of the assignments for this course are more tedious than they should be (think of a film pitch deck where you spend an hour editing the graphic design of a single slide that needs to fit >200 words of a full-film summary). While cover letters to describe the writing process can be a helpful way to think through and more fully present your work, having to write 750 words on process for an assignment felt far beyond what was needed. I had a great TF, but had friends who had much less positive experiences, and grade distributions across sections seem to be almost entirely up to each TF. Multiple assignments changed in their content and focus after I had submitted them so I had to make not insignificant tweaks that I would have just built in the first time.",
                "I knew some people who hated this course. I did not hate it. I just didn't think it was that interesting by the end. But that first month was so great. I really enjoyed learning about the history of the gothic genre and then exploring how that history is recontextualized in modern texts like Get Out and Parasite. Overall, I would say, unless you really need the credit (which doesn't seem likely), find a different class FOR NOW. I can see this course turning into something great with some tweaking in the near future.",
                "No, I would not recommend this course. The syllabus is good, as are some of the lectures. But it is a lot of busy work, despite the fact that the syllabus explicitly eschews the notion of \"busy work.\"",
                "I would never recommend this course to another student. There are so many better ways of getting the 18th/19th century requirement for the English major. This class was just a nuisance in my schedule. The work was a pain and lecture felt like a waste of my time week after week. I wouldn't want to put someone through that.",
                "Definitely! The topics were extremely interesting and it was fun to link all the literature/media we consume by their gothic elements.",
                "Yes, 100%. If it's offered in the fall, I recommend it 120%, for the spooky vibes. It's simply so fun and the readings were always hits.",
                "I would recommend the class to other students if they are willing to put in the effort to make it an educational experience. If they aren't willing to do so, then the class will be a slightly more challenging gut.",
                "No, unless this student was a beginning writer or reader. It wasnt very challenging and the lectures were very basic. But the professor was very kind and supportive, so if you want to improve youre basic essay skills I might recommend this course but if you have written a good amount of essays before I wouldnt recommend it.",
                "Yes! The material for this course was super interesting! It gave me an opportunity to read classic pieces of literature like Dracula and discuss them! This course is suitable well for students who want to receive clear feedback on their writing.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they are looking for a nice introductory humanities or writing course. The lectures were pretty interesting and I thought section was super helpful to break down the more complex ideas and theories.",
                "Yes! It was a really interesting and enjoyable class. Anyone interested in critical analysis of popular fiction type genres should definitely take the course.",
                "Yes, it was an interesting subject and I thought it was pretty fun.",
                "I would definitley recommend this course to another student, regardless of what major you are. This course is a great way to get a writing credit and actually take a class you enjoy rather than just getting it out of the way. The syllabus is great and the class is structured very well. The creative assignments also make the work more fun. Overall, amazing class.",
                "Yes! One of the best classes Ive taken in my Yale career",
                "Absolutely yes. I rave about this course to all of my friends! This is such a fun, fascinating course that anyone can take and enjoy. Not only does it explore real-world issues and subjects on gender and sexuality, but students also get to read and watch classic novels/ films that allow students to understand the makeup of pop culture more readily.",
                "Yes; this course was thoroughly enjoyable and the syllabus was great"
