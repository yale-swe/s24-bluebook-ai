    "If you're interested in dance, definitely take this class! I loved getting to see live performances and also just generally break down a dance in seminar conversation. The course is, however, mostly writing\/workshopping the writing--so be prepared for that. I felt that this was a class where it was very easy to do pretty well, but not that easy to do very well. It's a very particular kind of writing (different from analytic essays, for instance) and Brian is THE expert in it. He gives tons of feedback, but if you're looking for a \"gut\" writing class this probably isn't it.",
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend this class. I feel like Professor Seibert is very good at what he does and that inspired me to try my hand at writing dance. While writing about dance is a huge challenge, I think Professor Seibert helped ease us into the new territory.",
    "I thought it was interesting!",
    "I would recommend that other students shop this course and really think hard about whether or not they would remain interested and engaged in the activities of the first class meeting for an entire semester (because it doesn't change). But, if a student is really into dance and has time to accommodate the trips to the city (they are long and tiring and often get back to New Haven very late), I would recommend they look into it."
