                "Strengths-- good support system with TAs. Really liked that there were a lot of office hours and an online forum to post questions. JDRS is an engaging lecturer, even online. Weaknesses-- lectures were often posted late.",
                "I love the weekly assignments and how they really do test what is being taught (with a week's gap, which is just enough time for my brain to forget and learn it again and remember it for longer). The spaced repetition in testing topics really helps keep things in my brain - i am not sure if this is deliberately designed this way, but I really do enjoy them because they really do make me remember things! Super manageable class too, if you are looking for that one other class to fill your schedule. Extremely rewarding.",
                "Only thing I'd say is that the pset grading was super obnoxious. If the course admin want nice grade distribution, they should simply make the psets harder, not take off points for stupid stuff when answers are correct. Other than that a really good course though.",
                "strengths: prerecorded format, JDRS is a funny guy, TFs are a huge help\r\n\r\nweaknesses: easy to fall behind in lecture, especially if you have other things going on\r\n\r\nif you need to take a fifth/sixth class, this is it chief. no need to keep scrolling through coursetable",
                "Strengths: The course structure is amazing at  really teaching R at a reasonable pace, while also focusing on statistical analyses. JDRS is also really nice, dedicated and a great teacher.\r\nWeaknesses: goes a little too deep into a few of the topics & too shallow in others",
                "The full-asynchronicity of this class is absolutely a highlight. You're able to largely complete it at your own pace. All of the office hours are also a huge plus.",

                "very chill, homeworks and exams actually based on what we learn in class. weaknesses: lectures weren't posted sometimes but this would just make homeworks easier so no real impact. basically no weaknesses",
                "The course was constructed so that it gives the least amount of stress to its students so I was able to focus on the learning.",
                "Strengths: material is straightforward, expectations are clear, workload is manageable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: more theoretical statistics than expected, JDRS does not respond to emails, fully virtual so somehow feels like a Coursera class",

The weaknesses are that the lectures would often be posted late by JDRS making it difficult to plan your schedule around but I imagine this problem will be fixed when lectures are synchronous. Furthermore, since it was very tempting to just copy class code, this did not lead to a super deep understanding of the material.",
                "I think this course was very strong in the way the homework assignments mirrored the things done in class closely. This really helped me get a great and in depth understanding of different types of statistical analyses, as well as how to perform them in R.",
                "I really enjoyed the relatively independent learning style of the course. However, the recorded lecture only propagates a lack of interaction amongst students in the class. I am fortunate enough to have found a few fellow first years to work and chat with, but I imagine it was quite hard for others.",
                "The expectations for the course were very clear and made it very easy to follow; I appreciated the thoroughness of the syllabus. A weakness of the course was the lack of live classes as well as the many points taken off for small errors on any of the assignments.",
                "The course was well-taught and covered important material. However, a weakness of the course was the organization of recorded lectures. There were many times where the lectures exceeded the original alloted time for the class. There were also issues with lectures being posted late. It would be helpful to work on this in the future.",

Also psets are an easy copy and paste.\r\nWeakness: would've loved to time the semester better so that we could learn and absorb the topics we didn't really cover at the end",
                "This is a really great course for people who arent super familiar with R. Strengths: you dont need any prior knowledge of R to do well in the class. Lectures walk you through everything\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not sure",
                "Strengths: The material covered in this course was extremely applicable, as it deals with real data and statistical analysis.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This may have been just because of COVID, but I found the recorded lectures very unengaging. In addition, a lot of the problem sets were structured in a way that you could just copy and paste from the lecture slides, so it was difficult to really retain the information.",
                "I liked how there were so many office hours, which were extremely helpful for homework assignments. It was a pretty straightforward class that had a clear intention of just teaching students the basics of R.",
                "It is really cool to have a class that can be taught entirely asynchronously--there was very low pressure in terms of attendance. I think that sometimes the grading can feel unfair: some problem sets are too easy and just involve slight modifications of the lecture notes, yet points were docked for things like a title is out of the graph box or the coefficients were not explicitly mentioned. It is a large class with varying levels of experience, but I feel like that form of grading does not reflect understanding of the materials.",
                "Strengths were so many office hours that was amazing. The Ed discussion posts could have been answered faster, most of the time it was fine but sometimes there were 2 days before a deadline and questions were not being answered. Right now there are questions about the final but the TAs are nowhere to be found. Lectures were often posted late.",
                "Strengths: recorded lectures, take-home exams\r\nWeaknesses: More time spent on statistical concepts might be helpful. Homework was also not graded promptly, so it was harder to see what I might have been doing wrong.",
                "Very good course for learning R and very good professor. Could be boring sometimes, but maybe that is just because I am a humanities major.",
                "This course is very fun and much of the homework doesnt even feel like work since its so interesting. Theres a high amount of support so this class never seemed that difficult. I cant think of very many weaknesses",
                "Great, accessible for everyone. Really appreciate JDRS",
                "Strengths: really well organized",
                "Strengths: Psets closely follow the lecture, JDRS teaches very well, and you will learn a lot\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not very engaging because lectures are prerecorded and asynchronous.",
                "The course is a great way to learn R, which is a pretty powerful tool for statistics. It's not so much a statistics course as it is an R course.",
                "I have no major complaints with the course. Sometimes JDRS would post lectures late, and at times I felt like communication could be improved.\r\n\r\nThe class is very transparent and honest about what it is and isn't. I feel like my knowledge of this class will dissipate very quickly because all of it was just adapting code/interpretation from class. In this sense, I wish we had been challenged more to understand things more deeply or face harder problems.",
                "Very picky on the grading but I think theyre like that since so many people take the course. Lots of office hours which is great.",
                "Strengths: Good content\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of the practice centers around simply copy pasting code that is given from class. This seems a bit reductive.",
                "Strengths  Professor JDRS is the best Professor I have had at Yale. He makes what might otherwise be dry and challenging material incredibly engaging and accessible to students by hosting multiple office hours each week and also lecturing in an upbeat and incredibly positive way.",
                "Really liked that you get to work with other students to collaborate, which makes learning a lot easier. The course is focused on teaching you R so it skims through a lot of stats knowledge though and expects you to self-study/self-review to get the concepts, so be sure to review before.",
                "Assignments were not always graded in a timely manner, and lectures were typically posted late, but that is my only significant critique of this course. It was otherwise a fantastic class that gives students a very impressive skill set in coding and data analysis. I am currently working on a quantitative senior thesis that involves original data collection and analysis, and this class has proved invaluable to that project. If students only take one statistics course during their time at Yale, this is a phenomenal one to take.",
                "Given the fully online, recorded format, I benefited from being able to watch lectures and do assignments at the times of my choosing.",
                "Great class! No complaints, other than the grading was a little slow, but that can't really be helped since TAs are busy too",
                "The Prof is super engaging even on the recorded lectures. The material moves fast, however, so its easy to get lost.",
                "Strengths: this course is very well organized and hands on as the professor encourages you to follow along with the R code. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: homeworks and exams have points that count towards very specific or minor things, I wish these things were made clear during the assignment and not after we are graded",
                "For better or worse, the material on the problem sets closely mirrored the lectures, making it easy to skim past the underlying knowledge and focus on implementations.",
                "I liked how the course did not assume any R or coding knowledge, that anyone with a statistics background could succeed in it. I guess sometimes important, time-sensitive questions on Ed were not answered promptly (or at all) but having the forum itself available was helpful.",
                "The lectures were engaging and relatively enjoyable. The homework and exams were very fair, and working on the project was a good experience. Overall, nothing major needs to be improved.",
                "the format of this course is really amazing",
                "strengths: JDRS and learning the material through the psets\r\nweaknesses: feel very disconnected from class because everything is pre-recorded",
                "All of the lectures are pre-recorded, and JDRS and the TAs/ULAs were easily accessible throughout the week",
                "Strengths: recorded lectures were a great way to study. JDRS did a great job ensuring we had ample resources (OH, PDF notes). \r\nWeaknesses: Not really any big ones. Submitting homework was a pain through gradescope. I also thought homework was sometimes too much like the lectures.",
                "Very flexible, tons of office hours. No weaknesses",
                "The lectures were always interesting and did a really good job of covering what we were expected to know on homeworks. The R code from classes was also really helpful to have!",
                "Strengths - live office hours helped a lot \r\nWeakness - none really",
                "Strengths. Amount, and quality of office hours. I enjoyed every experience I had in these hours and always got my question answered promptly.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: JDRS and the TAs and ULAs are all amazing, but you had to make a huge effort to get to know them at all.",
                "This course was good because the lectures were interesting and engaging. However, I think more deadlines should be put on watching lectures so that students dont get as behind.",
                "It was interesting how the survey we answered before the first class were used throughout the class. I think a lot of the homeworks were repeating code from what we did in class and I think I wouldve learned more if there was a bit more diversity. I did like that there was tons of office hours, which was very helpful. I also wished there was more time provided for the final project because the gap between the final homework and the final project.",
                "I thin there is a lot of support for this course. I would like to see more depth in the statistics concepts, but I understand that there is an assumption that these concepts are already well understood by those taking the course.",
                "Some of the assignments felt a bit pointless and like busy work.",
                "Great course",
                "Not sure how course could be improved because it is very self-directed, but that is certainly one of the bigger weaknesses of it for people who enjoy direction.",
                "Very interesting material and a solid introduction to R.",
                "The recorded lectures were very easy to follow and I was able to grasp all concepts fairly easily. There were a lot of helpful examples as well. Overall I thought the course was run very smoothly.",
                "All good",
                "I think the course was really informative and taught a concrete skill in a way that was very easy to grasp. I think the style of recorded lecture though was at times tedious.",
                "JDRS is an excellent lecturer. However, because of the large class size, individual engagement could be improved.",
                "Some more low-stakes quizzes/exams about R and statistics would be very helpful, especially drawing on problems where we would not just copy and paste JDRS's code",
                "JDRS is a great lecturer and engaging professor, even through recorded lectures. The PSETs are straightforward as long as you understand the code presented in class. There is a large emphasis on applying these techniques rather than understanding the statistics behind the code, which is what the class advertises and the PSETs encourage this. The material is very applicable to real-world projects.",
                "strengths: office hours were very helpful, lectures were well presented, there were lots of resources to help me\r\n\r\nweakness: only thing is that I'm pretty sure the main professor (JDRS) only tended to be available pretty early in the morning (9-10:15 AM)",
                "JDRS is the biggest strength of this course.",
                "Virtual format was great.",
                "Strengths - very flexible class structure, a lot of support with the daily office hours\r\nWeaknesses - no synchronous portion of the class, sometimes grading was kind of arbitrary",
                "Recorded lectures were so convenient! JDRS is an amazing lecturer, and the class adapted very well to the constraints of COVID-19 learning. However, I did not get to know the other people in my course as well, so there was definitely a lack of community.",
                "JDRS is already well versed in the online format, which is great. The office hours are also very accessible, which is nice. Only thing was that lectures were sometimes posted late (we had a week long delay once).",
                "Strengths: The homework, exams, and final project are straightforward applications of material learned in class.\r\nWeaknesses: Most of the statistical concepts have already been covered in the 10x S&DS courses, which can make some of the lectures seem repetitive.",
                "Strengths - the teaching was very clear and lots of office hours to help\r\nWeaknesses - I felt that the hw was often just copying code rather than writing my own",
                "I loved this course, the psets were definitely conducive to learning and helped me solidify my skills in R",
                "this course is really well structured, but the online recorded lectures were sometimes disengaging",
                "Professor would wait so long to post lectures sometimes and it was very frustrating.",
                "Recorded lectures were easy to refer back to but hard to keep on schedule with.",
                "Honestly I really liked how this class was set up. Strengths are definitely JDRS and the resources available were so plentiful that there was never a moment that I felt I was beyond help.",
                "Strengths: JDRS and office hours",
                "strengths - a lot of TA support\r\nweaknesses - too easy, not very engaging",
                "JRDS is a great lecture who explained the theoretical foundations of topics without detracting from the overall focus on application. This course was well-structured, but the TA office hours were cancelled at a frequency high enough to render their regular weekly scheduling unreliable.",
                "Strengths: gives you a strong foundation of statistical analysis and its different methods, weaknesses: very fast pace, never a break, modules often posted late which made it stressful to get the psets in on time, the TAs would often not grade my psets correctly and I had to ask for regrades almost each time (which I was awarded)",
                "Pretty good depth-wise but it was a little fast.",
                "Strengths are great organization, incredible teaching, and a huge support network. Weaknesses are it moves too quickly over some key areas, and doesnt teach you why or how youre coding, it just teaches you the code.",
                "theres a lot of support and office hours which is great, and the lectures are good and the homework reasonable",
                "I thought it was a really excellent course!",
                "I felt that this course was very well organized and I have few critiques to add--I love JDRS's sense of humor and his genuine excitement for teaching, whether recorded or during office hours. I will note that the psets, while in general graded quite fairly, could benefit from more specificity in what is being asked of students, as all of my missed points came from being asked to summarize a problem and then missing, say, one out of four of the arbitrary subjects I was supposed to include. Besides that, the prof is a funny guy and very entertaining, even during recordings.",
                "Great: As a lecturer, JDRS is fun and entertaining and also explains things well. He does a great job at flagging when things might be too confusing or going over your head, and noting when that is okay/not something to worry about. Weakness: The final project being peer graded wasnt great as there were a bunch of technical difficulties where people couldnt fix their marking after accidentally submitting a half finished grade.",
                "It was very good at teaching a variety of R skills.  Towards the end of the course, however, it felt like homework assignments were more like copy-pasting from lectures and not building a foundation of how to build the code from scratch.",
                "The material that we covered in lecture prepared us very well for the homework and exams, and R is a very interesting and useful programming language to learn, but I felt like overall engagement in the class was very low. All of the lectures were prerecorded with no interaction with the professor, so it became a bit difficult to stay engaged and interested in the class or the material as the semester went on. However, the class overall wasn't too difficult, and lectures weren't difficult to sit through, since the pace of the class was decent and the lectures weren't very dry.",
                "Lectures are clear and very easy to follow. I think the recorded format really helped because I could replay them and code is much easier to understand when explained."

                "I think this course adapted really well to covid. The prerecorded lectures with copious notes files to accompany them really helped me learn and follow the material. The recording of the class allowed me to be flexible in when I viewed the lectures, but also gave me the opportunity to go back whenever I got stuck on homework assignments. This was vital in my success in the course. There were many opportunities for office hours which was really great for my busy schedule. I always found a time that worked to make it to office hours. My only gripe was that the lectures were posted a little late towards the end of the semester, but I'm not sure if that was JDRS's fault as our Canvas for the course crashed and he had to recompile it which took his attention away from recording lectures. Regardless, JDRS managed to get everything done and was very reasonable/understanding.",
                "I liked the psets and the office hours. The take-home exams were nice as well. I do wish that there was a bit more consistency in the grading though since for some parts that some TAs took points off for, others did not.",
                "Recorded lectures were great as they allowed students in all time zones to participate. Inter-student interaction could be improved.",
                "I think having the live Ed discussion page for questions helped a lot, especially because we didn't have the opportunity to ask questions during lecture. I think the course could be improved by having some more live components.",

                "The recorded lectures were very unengaging, and I believe this course could have been improved immensely by having live lectures. Often with recorded lectures, there is an incentive to delay watching the lectures, since the student knows they could watch them anytime.",

The class was technically scheduled for Tuesday and Thursday mornings, and I know that many students (myself included) preferred to watch the recorded lectures on those days to ensure that we were keeping up with material.

                "Yes!!!! R is so useful to all fields and JDRS is a great teacher. The workload is not too much & there is so much support. I also think its a great way to go into coding for those who know nothing about it like me.",
                "This class with JDRS should be a Yale requirement. If I could pick between this class or the collective knowledge of my three foreign language classes, I would easily pick this class.",
                "Yeah, the course was pretty useful and a good intro into the stats behind a lot of major multivariate statistics which didn't require any heavy math or stats background",
                "Yes! Great introductory stats course in R",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed it, and JDRS is engaging and fun.",
                "Yes! practical R skills and super fun",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone that wants to learn R and gain a deeper understanding of how to apply statistics to R.",
                "Would recommend if you're looking for a thorough introduction to statistics or to R. It is more applied and coding-heavy than most other statistics classes, but there is still a decent amount of theory.",
                "I would recommend this to a student with some basic knowledge of data science and statistics, as this basis is very helpful.  It is not required, but there will be a lot more notes to be taken if you're coming into this class with little to no knowledge of the subject matter.",
                "I would if you're looking for a low-stress environment to pick up R and learn how to analyze data sets, yes! This is interesting stuff and a practical skill. However, know that the focus of this class is coding and not statistics. JDRS will review the basics of statistics and explain them, but will mostly focus on showing how to use R for them and examples. So if you're looking for a more math and statistics heavy class, turn to S&DS 238, 240, or 241 and 242.",
                "Yes! This course was very interesting, informative, and truly lots of fun. You will learn a lot over the course of the semester, however, it is really not a lot of pressure. The course is oddly easy going but rigorous at the same time. You learn in depth statistical concepts that jump off of material studied in introductory statistics. One of the best parts of this course is that you get to learn how to apply statistics to practical world applications: US Census data, Trump vs. Obama Tweet data, Environmental data, etc. This made the concepts very enjoyable to learn and made me that much more motivated. Last but not least, TAKE THIS COURSE WITH JDRS!!!! He is one of the best professors I've had at Yale. JDRS is super intelligent, very dedicated to his students, and incredibly funny. Learning from such an amazing professor is reason alone to take the class. Professors aside, the material is very interesting and anyone interested in data analysis in practical applications such as politics, environmental studies, other sciences, linguistics, etc. will find this course interesting and super beneficial for their future.",
                "Yes, it's a great course if you want to learn R and how to analyze data!",
                "Yes, it's a great course!",
                "Yes, I think this course is a good fit for any student looking to get a basic introduction to statistics and programming.",
                "Yes, especially to any student hoping to start learning R!",
                "Definitely! If you want to learn about how to code in R and manipulate data with some knowledge of stats, this will be a great class for you!",
                "I would 100% recommend this class to any student who wants to gain basic proficiency in R! You learn a lot through the PSETs without even realizing how much youve learned. Its also never a stressful class, tons of office hours to help with PSETs",
                "Yes, in a normal year, I suspect the lectures would be more engaging. The material itself is extremely applicable, whether or not you are a Stat major. You also learn R coding, which is an important tool for statistical analyses.",
                "Maybe? It's not super interesting, but it's definitely one of the easier coding classes. It would be a great intro class for someone beginning to learn code.",
                "Yes, I think that it is not a significantly hard class that does provide knowledge on statistical analysis. I would like to see a lot more differentiation from an intro-level Stats class.",
                "Yes! The teaching was clear, just make sure you try to stay a little bit ahead to ask your questions since this is a big course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! It's very practical and really focuses on teaching students how to code.",
                "The course is pretty easy, but you do have to put in a decent amount of work. This class is not a complete gut in the idea that you can coast and get an A. If you put in the work, you'll be fine, but do not just take the course thinking you can slack off.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student as it teaches many interesting and basic data analysis concepts, and is a nice introduction to R",
                "Yes! If you want to have some basic statistical knowledge and try out R",
                "Yes, it is a great introductory class to statistics that is also fun",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if he/she is interested in learning R and already has a good understanding of statistics.",
                "YES! Very manageable class, even for a 5.5 credit semester and a great first class to take for stats at Yale. I learned so much this semester and it made me fall in love with stats!",
                "Good for getting some practice with R",
                "Yes. It's a pretty easy class and a great way to learn R. Homework assignments are straightforward but interesting. Intro stats is a requirement, but you focus so much on R that knowing stats doesn't really actually help that much.",
                "I would - JDRS is an extremely great teacher. His lectures were ones that I did not mind watching!",
                "It depends on your background. If you have any prior experience with R or analyzing data in another language, it might be too dry.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they want to learn about statistical programming. However, the grading is picky so make sure to go to office hours & check over your answers (especially the ones that ask you to comment on things you observe in the data).",
                "Yes, it's definitely a great way to get acquainted with R. But it's also something you could do on your own time without a class if you have the motivation.",
                "Yes, everyone who is interested in statistics, programming, or gaining skills that are translatable to the workforce post-graduation should take this class. I would also highly recommend this class to students interested in any type of research, but in particular public health research.",
                "yes, if you don't already know R! technically you're supposed to have some prior knowledge of stats, but I was able to manage:)",
                "YES! Such a great class to get you into Stats and R especially bc so many other Yalies take it, you will meet people and end up finding out you're both in 230.",
                "Only if they're willing to watch the lectures and try and understand the material. Like many of the people in this class I became quickly quite passive and stopped paying a lot of attention, and it was really detrimental to my learning. Don't just tack on this class to the end of a busy course schedule because it's \"easy\" and the lectures are recorded (even post-Covid), take it if you actually care and will try to put in some effort.",
                "Yes! I very, very strongly believe that every student should take statistics (at least one class) while you are at Yale, and if you're only going to take one, this should be it. This course is extremely effective at combining coding skills (R is the language used here) and introductory content in statistics/data analysis. You learn so much from this course that is applicable, even immediately, to other projects/courses of your choosing.",
                "Yes, good introduction to very practical statistics.",
                "Absolutely",
                "If you need to learn R, yes",
                "Yes this is a great course if you would like to learn R and have some knowledge already of statistics.",
                "Good course for learning R, exposure to some statistical methods",
                "I would recommend this course if you have zero experience with R and need to learn it for research. Basically everything you need to know for basic statistical analysis is covered.",
                "Yes! You will learn very useful skills. I do think there is much less of an emphasis on theory and motivation behind certain tests/applications. You might need to have some background knowledge in order to truly understand the 2nd half of the course.",
                "Yes, if you're looking for a low-stress course in which to learn basic data cleaning and analysis, this one is great. It's very low workload, and lectures were quite enjoyable since JDRS has a priceless sense of humor.",
                "Absolutely, this course is extremely accessible and anyone would benefit from learning how to code in R",
                "Yes! Its great to get some background in R and JDRS is the best",
                "Yes, if you want to learn R. You should have already taken S&DS 10#, or did really well in AP Stat in high school",
                "Yes if you want basic stats + R knowledge!",
                "Absolutely. Not a super heavy workload, tons of support, and the material is actually useful.",
                "Absolutely, it gives a good introduction to R and gives you skills you will actually use in your discipline.",
                "Yes!! Was a very manageable and well-organized introduction to R and advanced statistical concepts for someone with very limited background.",
                "yes, if interest in statistical learning or data science",
                "Yes! Great to get a very solid foundation in stats using R",
                "Yes!",
                "I would recommend this class. It's very accessible and not stressful, but I still think you learn a lot.",
                "yes!",
                "I would recommend. Stats is important for many different majors and careers and the professor makes this course both interesting and informative.",
                "yes, very useful and skills are applicable to other fields",
                "I think it is a good courseif you only had AP Stats from high school, this class allows you to go a little bit more in depth than that which is good. You get to also learn about how to use R and implement some of the statistical techniques. I think it was harder this year because though class was held on Tuesdays and Thursdays, this is an asynchronous course, and sometimes its harder to plan lectures ahead of time because they wouldnt always be posted in time. A lot of what you do on homeworks are things youve done in class, which can be good to reinforce topics.",
                "Yes I would, it's a very engaging course.",
                "Yes. It's a good fifth class. You learn, but it won't stress you out. Don't expect it to be amazing, but JDRS does a great job!",
                "Yes very good course that is engaging",
                "I'd recommend this course to another student interested in learning the fundamentals of R.",
                "Yes, this is a great course for anyone looking to learn statistics and R coding. You come out with practical skills for data analysis.",
                "Yes. It was a very fun and engaging course that helps improve coding skills.",
                "It's a good beginner stat class. As a non-major, I learned a lot.",
                "Absolutely! Would highly recommend to anyone who wants to learn how to use R.",
                "Yes. This course provides a good introduction to R.",
                "Yes! Was a nice course low stress way to learn stats.",
                "Yes, practice basic R and very safe for your grade and GPA. Some more low-stakes quizzes/exams about R and statistics would be very helpful, especially drawing on problems where we would not just copy and paste JDRS's code.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, absolutely! Great way to learn R and practical skills you will need in any future data analysis work.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class because it teaches you a lot of applicable skills, especially if you aren't familiar with R. I think that it helps to come into the class with some coding background, but this definitely isn't a prerequisite.",
                "Yes! It gave me both a general background in basic stats and coding with R and presented the information well. I would definitely recommend it if you are looking to go further into data science and/or coding.",
                "Yes! JDRS is a great professor!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they need it for a pre-requisite or major requirement, or if they are looking for a course that goes over the basics in some statistical tests and the programming language R.",
                "Yes! Especially if you already have knowledge of statistics (which is a prerequisite), S&DS 230 gives you practical skills to put it into context.",
                "Sure. It's not too hard and a good way to learn some statistics that you can use in any field. To learn, though, you have to avoid the temptation to just copy-paste class code and tweak it in your homework (or at the least, read over it to really understand what's going on.)",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! I did intro stats in high school and honestly didn't like it that much, but this course changed my view of statistics. I really enjoyed learning how to apply the statistical methods I'd learnt about and use R to actually do analysis on real data sets. It was taught well and it made statistics feel much more useful to me.",
                "It depends. If you are seeking rigor in learning R, I suggest taking a different course. However, this is an easy QR credit and a good low stakes fifth class.",
                "Easy QR, learn quite a bit",
                "Yes!!! So important to learn the basics of R",
                "Yes!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, the skills learned are very practical",
                "Yes -- a good course to take",
                "This is a great course for anyone who wants to enhance their understanding of basic statistics and coding in R.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course. Formed an excellent basis on the R language, and the Psets allowed me to work at my own pace for the class. Exams were given as take-home, but I feel overly confident with my R skills by the end of the course.",
                "Yes especially if you want to learn how to code in R",
                "Yes for statistics",
                "Yes, if you want to learn to use R to explore and analyze data.",
                "Yes, it is a very thorough intro to the R coding language",
                "There is a lot more work than you think. People told me this course was easy/doable for non stats majors/people with only a little bit of stats background. it is a LOT of work and the TAs are extremely nitpicky on the psets",
                "Yes! But only if you have not tried any data science class before.",
                "Yes!! Take it!! Best stats course at Yale.",
                "yeah, good stats class overall!",
                "Absolutely! Learned a lot, very clear instruction, great professors, SO MANY office hours and super helpful TAs and ULAs.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student with a basic knowledge of stats and a desire to learn coding. I would especially recommend it to an E&EB student, as I have found the R skills I have gained a wonderful addition to what is expected of me in such a major. It may not be the best course for students with a profound background in either stats or coding however, as well as students moderately capable in both.",
                "Yes!",
                "Recommend, as a humanities/history student this was a doable intro data science class with applicable and transferable skills.",
                "Interesting course and great professor. Limited feedback and grade deflation.",
                "If you want to learn R, take the course.  If you're looking to learn statistical analysis, there are probably better options.",
                "Depends. The class isn't too difficult and you learn quite a bit of R, which is a useful programming language to learn for conducting statistical analysis. However, if you want to learn and understand statistics concepts, then I feel like this class doesn't quite cover them. The professor goes over the theory behind some of the statistics tests that we're running, but it's never really followed up on and is easily lost when trying to learn the R to conduct those tests. Engagement with the class was pretty low since everything was prerecorded, although that will probably not be the case next year. If you want to learn R, go for it. If you want to learn theory, then maybe take another stat class.",
                "Yes, it is a great introduction to R and I learned a lot of fundamentals.",
                "Yes"
