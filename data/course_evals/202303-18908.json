The class covers typical college mechanics topics ranging from kinematics to dynamics, but Steinacker also throws in a lot of applicable examples in her lectures for the engineers and physics majors in the class.",

With good time management and using office hours, the problem sets will get done easier.",

                "Very math focused so it's a great course to practice applying calculus. Prof. Steinacker is an engaging lecturer and surprisingly very endearing. This would be a challenging course for people with no prior experience with physics, as it is not a conceptual course. Even as someone with 3 prior years of physics, a bit more conceptual explanation would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: Well taught, a lot of content covered \r\nweakness: the homework is so so difficult and often involves a lot of algebra/calculus that would otherwise be difficult to complete on your own (i.e. knowing the identity of the sin of a triple angle to solve a problem). I wish the problems given in the homework were more conceptual rather than testing our math abilities.",
                "Steinacker is incredibly funny and makes the class engaging",
                "It is fast-paced but in the end the numerous office hours through the week make it better.",
                "Strengths: teaching style, interesting and applicable PSETs, cool demos in class\r\nWeaknesses: cant think of any!",
                "This class pretty much only has strengths---I can't think of any weaknesses, most likely due to the fact that Steinacker has been teaching for a while and seems to be the type of professor that really listens to the feedback she gets. Grading in the class is more than fair and I would go as far as to say generous, especially with the 50% back on doing your exam regrade policy. PSETs definitely take a while and are a lot harder than anything you would see on the exams, but they're good practice and incentive you to work with others or go to study hall/office hours.",
                "A strength were the psets as they were very helpful in preparing for the exams. I do not have any complaints",
                "The professor is incredible. The time commitment is hefty. Showing up to office hours to solve the questions is a necessity since the problems have some interesting quirks to them.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Steinacker is a fantastic lecturer and educator. One of the best I've had. Lectures are engaging. You both cover content and do problems in class, which is a great combination to develop a complete understanding. The exams never felt unfair; they were difficult, but perfectly doable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I spent ~5-6 hours in office hours each week and about ~1 hour outside of office hours each week to complete each pset. The psets are much more difficult than both the lecture content and the exam content. This makes it a great way for Prof. Steinacker to illustrate all the cool things you can do with the basic skills developed in PHYS180, but it also makes them nearly impossible to correctly complete alone. The course is designed for you to attend office hours every week. Be prepared to spend lots of time outside of class if you want to succeed on the psets.",
                "This course has a well-thought-out curriculum and a fair grading structure which encourages students to work hard while simultaneously being forgiving. As rumored, the homework is challenging and sometimes long, but being motivated and going to office hours/study hall (which are pretty much every day) will get you through it.",
                "Great grading system. Encourages and rewards doing the PSETS and takes less emphasis on the exams. Gives the student ample room to mess up and try again without too much penalty. Encourages student to learn.",
                "Its very fast paced and difficult for inexperienced people in math and physics",
                "Steinacker is the goat. She truly makes this class. Its really hard though.",
                "I really liked the way the lectures were structured and Steinacker's passion for the subject. The office hours were also very helpful for completing the problem sets. For improvement, I think there could be more TAs at office hours.",
                "Strengths - Great teacher, perfectly suited class for those who have a high school physics background.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Weekly problem sets are far too difficult. You are essentially bullied into going to office hours if you want a good grade on the homework. Adriane hosts office hours Monday - Thursday, so she will take note if you're putting forth effort to succeed. She'll get sussed out if you manage to get a near perfect homework grade yet never attend her office hours. Have afternoon events, aka research, practices, hangouts, photoshoots, rehearsals, etc? Kiss all that goodbye UNLESS you come well-equipped with a physics foundation from high school. This leads me to my next point. Adriane does not cater towards students who have zero physics background. She explains things in a more complicated way where the knowledgable physics student is able to understand but the zero physics background student does not. I unfortunately was the latter. Every second of every day I experienced a sense of impending doom where I felt hopeless and utterly lost in physics. I would have to play catch-up for hours on end to learn the material I should have already learned. During every single lecture in the semester, I would be staring at the board, no idea what was happening. If I could do it again, I would read the textbook or watch YouTube videos on the topic BEFORE class, that way I knew the basics before class. If you take one thing away from this message, please do not go into lecture with no idea what's coming.",
                "Strengths - good lectures, lot of student support available\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - homework takes lot of time, lectures not recorded",
                "I enjoyed the curriculum of the course!",
                "Strengths: the passion of Professor Steinacker was palpable in every lecture and her investment in her students' success was apparent in her grading strategies. The Problems Sets were more difficult than the exams, which allowed me to feel more prepared for the exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this class felt more like a math class than a physics class. It was advertised as a class able to be taken concurrently with MATH 115, but there were multiple calculus concepts that I had never heard of and therefore had to teach myself to even begin the problem sets. While this is largely an issue with my high school's lack of mathematics classes, it was still an issue that I had hoped would lessen throughout the semester. There should be a recommended list of math concepts that the students have learned or the syllabus could include expectations regarding the math skills held by the students.",
                "The office hours are the meat of the course and where the material really sunk in.",
                "My weakness was my engagement in the course and my strength was finding time to study and apply the concepts from the course to other classes.",
                "Lots of office hours to get help with TAs and the instructor. Instructor was very helpful and responsive to student questions/comments. All course material (course notes, study guide, etc) was published along with the textbook chapters that correspond to each lecture so it was very easy to know what to study outside of class and prepare for tests. Exam problems were easier than homework problems so if you knew how to do the homework problems you would be well prepared for the exams. Not really a strength nor weakness but it's worth pointing out that participation is a grade so you can't really skip lecture like you can for other large lecture classes.",
                "I felt pretty strong in a lot of the parts of this course, the things I struggled with mostly came from when I had to miss a lecture.",
                "Lots of content very quickly, but it was still interesting and I enjoyed it.",
                "A strength of this course was the professor's involvement and the amount of tutoring time for people who have less background in the subject.",
                "This course does an amazing job in developing complexity in skills related to mechanics. Professor Steinacker does a phenomenal job introducing and developing skills in physics.",
                "One strength is that the problem sets and exam reviews offer lots of practice material that is actually relevant to the problems found on the midterms and finals, however the course is very fast paced and taxing which makes it hard to keep up, as well as catch up, if you fall behind.",
                "Strengths - The number of office hours hosted were numerous. They were basically offered each day, and then were study halls offered too, which helped. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I wish there was more of way to assess how much youre learning as youre progressing because Professor Steinackers questions she asks in the homework cant really be found anywhere online, so really the only material you can reference against is hers. This is not very helpful if youre already confused by how shes presenting the material. \r\n\r\nIn the middle - The problem sets are impossible to solve if you do not go to office hours, which is helpful in theory, but if you have a hard week, tough cookies."

                "I would definitely recommend this. Prof Steinacker is someone who has a lot to offer to her students- she's engaging, witty, and incredibly smart. The material is well structured albeit a little less conceptually-focused than I'd like. HOWEVER: To take this course, you must have time for office hours in your schedule. The PSETS are not impossible, but guidance in office hours is necessary to do them properly. Generally each week, I spent ~6hrs on the pset, with nearly all of that time in office hours. This semester, office hours were generally 3-5pm MT, 3-6pm WT, and study hall was 7-9pm SunMT, 7-10WT. There are plenty of times, but you must prioritize them as the homework is the best resource for preparing for exams.",
                "Yes, but only if you're prepared to spent at least 4 hours a week in office hours for psets.",
                "YES!! Prof. Steinacker is awesome and you will really learn to love physics, even if your calc is poor she makes it super understandable for everyone",
                "Yes! If they desire general physics knowledge, it is the course to take!",
                "If you have to take this course for your major, it's super enjoyable. However, the PSETs do take a decent amounts of time to solve.",
                "Yes. This class is a great option for those who do not need the advanced preparation of 200 and 206. Take this class just so you can learn from Prof. Steinacker. She is such a refreshing STEM teacher who understands the struggle of learning something difficult from scratch and is capable of helping you succeed. She wants you to succeed and will give you the help and resources you need to succeed. You do not need MATH120 for this class. If you can perform basic derivatives and integrals, you have all the math you need.",
                "Absolutely. The class is difficult and sometimes frustrating, but as long as you are engaged and try your best, you will be okay.",
                "Yes. Although it's considered the more difficult physics (compared to 171), I am very glad I took this class with Steinacker.",
                "If you love physics and math, yes. If you are not as experienced or skilled, dont take it.",
                "Yes but know thats its going to require a lot of time and effort",
                "Yes, I would although it was the most difficult course I took this semester. I really think the subject was interesting, and Steinacker really cares about the learning of her students.",
                "Only if you're an engineering major. If you're MCDB, MB&B, or even chemistry, consider taking PHYS 170 unless you're really interested in physics. Taking 170 would give you more time to devote towards your extracurriculars in the afternoons. If you have zero physics background and are NOT an engineering major, 170 is for sure the way to go.",
                "Yes. Being able to quantify natural phenomena is interesting to me, and I enjoyed the problem solving that the course challenged me to. You definitely should attend office hours to obtain full understanding of the problem sets.",
                "Yes, if you are truly passionate about physics and enjoy calculus. I learned very few new physics concepts but had to teach myself a great number of mathematical concepts. My high school only offered math classes up to Calc I, so all of vector and multivariable calculus was completely foreign to me, which proved to be a larger detriment than expected. If you are confident in your calculus skills and have learned the material of Calc I, II, and potentially III, this class should be much more attainable for you than it was for me. This class, at times, felt more like a math class than a physics one (especially since I was teaching myself more difficult calculus than I was learning in my actual calculus class just to keep up with the lectures). This class, at least, helped me to figure out that Physics is not the major for me. Professor Steinacker is extremely passionate and her love of physics is palpable in every lecture, I just felt largely unprepared for this class and struggled with catching up to my peers who had had access to higher level math courses.",
                "This class is a solid choice for any student interested in an introduction to physics.",
                "Yes, especially with Professor Steinacker. The grading is lenient and prioritizes student learning instead of grades.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student looking to engage in some STEM-based class. It is a creat introduction to practical computations and concepts.",
                "Yes, this course is designed with engineering majors in mind but is accessible to anyone. There is some basic calculus so I would recommend taking calc 3 before or concurrently. Good course to take if you're interested in physics or want to satisfy the distributional requirement. However, if you're a physics major or major that's physics heavy, I would recommend 200 or 260 instead since those courses are more rigorous and cover more content.",
                "It is a very interesting course for anybody that has an interest in the science side of things, but I would not recommend it to somebody who is looking for a light fun class.",
                "A student who is interested in physics and is willing to put in the work would really enjoy this class.",
                "Yes, Steinacker is very helpful and I would recommend this course to anyone considering STEM/Physics/Engineering without a strong background. As someone who came into this course with no physics background pursuing an engineering degree, this course helped bring me up to speed and learn a lot. I improved significantly and there are many resources and people to help.",
                "Yes, I definitely would! As a pre-med student, many take PHYS 170, though my experience with PHYS 180 was phenomenal. Though the content may be a bit harder, Professor Steinacker makes the course in a way to support students in every manner. I gained so many new Physics skills through this course.",
                "Yes, I took it as pre-med despite PHYS 170/171 being touted as the easier option, and I think it was the best choice because Professor Steinacker genuinely cares for her students, and even though the class is a lecture size, it felt like a mini community."
