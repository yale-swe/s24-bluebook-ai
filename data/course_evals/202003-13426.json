                "I learned a lot about fascism in the 1930s and 40s as well as the current threats to democracy.",
                "As the title of the course implies, I learned plenty about the history and politics of fascism. I now feel I have a deeper upreciation and understanding of how political systems can develolve into fascism, and what role the people and leaders play in making this happen. Not only did the course give me new perspective on the past, it also gave me a new paradigm to view the present.",
                "I was able to clearly draw comparisons where needed between the interwar period ross of fascism to the rise in populism today in the world. Its a great way to learn about history in a more meaningful and impactful way as it relates to today",
                "I've learned a ton from taking this course! Fascism is a word that gets thrown around a lot, but analyzing its history in the 1930s (i.e. rise of Hitler and the Nazis) is so much more informative than I could have imagined. In past classes, I have often learned about World War 2, but I have never had a chance to study in-depth the root issues that led to the rise of fascism and the war. Dr. Young makes sure that connections between past and present challenges of democracy are not lost on students. It is unfortunate to see all of the parallels between fascist politics in the 1930s and the political trends on the rise today. But it is also empowering.By learning more about what it takes to uphold democracy  and the terrible alternatives when it fails  students come away with a greater sense of responsibility and knowledge for preserving our nation's democratic future.",
                "I feel so proud of the writing skills I have acquired through this course that Dr. Young has allowed me to explore. I entered the course having never taken a polisci class, and although I was certainly unprepared, I feel as though I learned how to write a persuasive and argumentative political essay and how to be confident in my arguments in these essays. I also learned so much about different elements of fascism during WWII that I never knew about, such as the rise of Fascism in France and England.",
                "This course offered me insight into how fascist states develop and the various connections between fascism and other elements of how states develop. The first part of the course focused on Nazi Germany, Vichy France, and Italian fascism while the rest focused on more contemporary discussions of fascism, globalization, security, etc."

                "The course was really fantastic. The syllabus was really well designed and Dr. Young puts a lot of effort into it.  Seminar was also something to look forward to as we talked about the readings but also how they apply to the real world and current issues.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Professor was extremely engaged with the students \r\n- Professor's perspective and knowledge was extremely helpful in helping me understand and appreciate the subject at hand\r\n- Readings were well selected and highly informative\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- We sometimes got sidetracked on long conversations whose subject matter was not very relevant to the subject we were studying. I feel a stronger focus on the material we read and the themes it encompasses would be more helpful.",
                "Professor Young was definitely a strength. She cares so much for her students and always goes the extra mile. I think the course could be improved by focusing more on the first half of the course and expanding that to include more countries from the interwar period that could be studied and less of the second part of the course.",
                "The greatest strength is having Professor Young as a professor. In addition to selecting great readings and leading productive class discussions, she  perhaps more than any professor I have known truly cares about her students and invests her time and energy in shaping them to be better students, citizens, and humans. I would take any class taught by Dr. Young, regardless of subject matter. The subject matter of this class is very interesting and informative, but that is definitely largely due to having such a talented professor.",
                "For a virtual course, I really liked the seminar format, I think it keeps students engaged and present. I also think the presentations are a great way to recap the readings, as there are a lot of them and the readings are often dense! The only thing that wouldve been helpful in the virtual format is maybe taking a quick break halfway through the 2 hour seminar. I found that once the first hour was done, I was trying very hard to focus, and a short break wouldve been beneficial for me.",
                "Strengths: Professor Young cares deeply about the subject and her students and works to make sure everyone knows they can get aid from her. She is knowledgeable on the subjects and class discussions were generally fairly engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The reading was a lot (100+ pages a week of dense material) as I'm only somewhat interested in the topic. I was also frustrated because the class discussions rarely brought up the readings so there was little incentive to do them but I guess that makes it more manageable. Professor Young has her biases (think very mainstream, elite, wealthy Democrat), but she cares deeply about both the students and subject. Professor Young spent a majority of the class talking which is different than most years I think (using zoom definitely changes dynamics which can make it hard to have a fluid conversation). \r\n\r\nI think the course might be better with slightly more targeted readings, but I think part of the issue was the online format. All that being said, Professor Young is kind and understanding and it's a solid course."

                "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone. You learn a lot but even more so you get to have great conversations with the professor and the other students in the class. It doesn't even feel like class sometimes, rather it feels like a really important conversation about relevant issues.",
                "Yes. Course materiel is compelling and interesting, and the Professor does an excellent job of facilitating learning.",
                "Yes, you learn a lot about history in how it applies and relates to today. You take topics like Hitler, Stalin, Vichy France, and more and really dive into it much more than in high school or other courses and you get to relate them to today (when necessary). You also get to see why todays rise in populism across the world is so troubling. Also, Professor Young is amazing!",
                "Take this course! Take any course with Dr. Young. This is one of those classes that you are actively excited about attending each week. The students and professor are all super committed to working together to make sure the experience is meaningful.",
                "Absolutely. Dr. Young is one of the best professors I have had the chance to witness  she is so kind and open to allowing her students to actually learn. The conversations were intellectually compelling every time, and I never felt there was one seminar that was a waste. The variety of perspectives in the readings led to diverse discussions too.",
                "I would recommend this course if you're interested in the topic. I took it thinking I was interested in global affairs and then found the very specific and intense readings to be boring and un-motivating. However, the readings are picked out well and if this is your wheelhouse you'll probably enjoy them. I also found Professor Young to care about the world but be in an elite bubble that affected her teaching. I tended to agree big picture with her, but her level of privilege was evident. However, she cares about her students and is kind and thoughtful. She holds office hours and is always willing to help students."
