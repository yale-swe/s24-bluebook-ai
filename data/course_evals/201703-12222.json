    "I became familiar with the Civil Rights Movement, Womens Movement, and various others (most of the others I learned  from fellow classmates comments in class). I also gained a better understand of how to apply sociological theory to movements.",
    "This course explores the fundamentals of social movements as well as numerous case studies. In this course, you can expect to develop your seminar skills, discussion abilities, and research techniques.",
    "A really strong understanding of how social movements rise, what allows them to succeed, and an ability to effectively analyze them. I also greatly improved my writing skills and knowledge of specific social movements in history.",
    "I developed the vocabulary to speak about social movements from an academic perspective."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The discussions were usually pretty lively, made better by. ontrobutions from students who are directly involved in organizing\/activism. The textbook is very boring, and not too enlightening. It was fun to be able to research a movement for the final paper!",
    "This was a really interesting class, and the discussions were super lively\/engaging. However, the readings could be a bit dry at times.",
    "I loved this class.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Very well organized, excellent teaching, and great discussions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish more attention was given to the history of social movements and an analysis of the context in which they arose.",
    "The readings were fascinating and the assignments ideal for reducing stress while also fostering learning, but the class discussions sometimes felt as though we were attempting to speak in an exacting way about matters that were subjective. This course could be improved if it included more information on how to practically foster or extinguish a social movement."

   "comments": [
    "I recommend this class to people who are either involved with a movement or want to research\/learn more about particular movements. As a survey course, its pretty broad, so I think you could get more out of it if you go into it with a specific goal in mind. Its a good introduction to sociological theory for those who have not taken sociology before.",
    "definitely! i learned a lot and was able to make connections to other fields.",
    "Absolutely! This was an excellent class.",
    "Yes. It's a very engaging and important class to take, especially in our current political climate.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. The workload is ideal to help you process the material and demonstrate the analytical skills you have developed in the seminar without causing unnecessary work or stress. The readings are interesting, and class discussion is often redirected to what the class finds most interesting. It's a great foundational course for further study in social movements."
