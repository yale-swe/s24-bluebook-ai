If there was some way to individualize it even further that would be best, but I'm not sure that's possible.",

I only disliked that the format of each class meeting was largely the same, which grew a bit tiresome toward the end of the semester. I would say the course could improve by shaking up the pattern of whole group discussion - break out rooms - whole group discussion."
