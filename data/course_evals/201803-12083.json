    "I learned how to communicate, engage, and talk in Polish.",
    "I learned a great deal about the polish language, especially because I started at the beginning of the semester not knowing any Polish at all. I also learned how to use peer collaboration as a tool to better improve my language skills.",
    "Fun language and low workload. Genuinely kind and passionate instructor.",
    "learned how to read, write and speak the Polish language",
    "I learned a lot about how to speak, read and understand polish",
    "I learned a lot of basic, conversational Polish and grammar. This course really focuses on teaching you how to speak Polish and hold a real-life conversation which I appreciated. In addition, through music, film clips and a trip to the Polish store, I learned a lot about Polish culture.",
    "I learned lots of Polish, how to introduce myself and hold introductory conversations, learned a lot about the different forms of the language that occur depending on the context of the conversation, which is something I was never really cognizant of with English. I learned quite a few translations of common English slang phrases too, so that was fun.",
    "We learned the basics of Polish language, including vocab and grammar. In the process, we learned a lot about Polish culture."

    "Strengths: Krystyna is an incredible teacher. She's very flexible and patient. Polish is a tough language but she made it enjoyable to learn. Class was really engaging and worthwhile to have every day. This was the only class I was always excited to go to this semester. There's always polish candy awaiting.  \r\n\r\nWeakness: Polish is a really tough language, however, this class makes it accessible for everyone.",
    "This course is extremely fun and loosely structured, which is often really refreshing since most of my other classes tend to be much more structured and high-intensity. However, I sometimes felt that the pace of the class was too slow. I would have loved to have covered a few more units this semester.",
    "Fun language and low workload. Genuinely kind and passionate instructor.",
    "i liked the small class size.",
    "This is a low-stress and well taught introductory language class. Professor Illakowicz is so kind and willing to stay after class to answer any questions you might have. I think it could be improved by moving slightly faster. However, it was my favorite class this semester and there is very little I would change about it.",
    "The small class size was definitely a strength, I always felt engaged with the class and with the language for all 50 minutes of each class. Daily meetings are also enormously helpful, and we have plenty of time to devote to any material students might be struggling with.",
    "The course is taught at a very reasonable pace and the workload is fair and informative. At times, however, I felt like the class could have moved a little faster."

    "ABSOLUTELY. It's a wonderful introduction to the language with a small class size and high engagement. If you're looking for a language credit that truly understands your pace of learning, this is the one for you. It's flexible and excellent. Polish is challenging but this class makes it accessible. The workload is incredibly manageable yet still enough to keep you engaged in class.",
    "YES. Krystyna is so nice and she's amazing. Polish is a beautiful (but difficult) language, and it's really rewarding to feel yourself improving and getting better. I will say that sometimes the class is too lax (there were days in which one student would ask \"how do you say poop in polish?\" or something like that and we'd talk about it for twenty minutes).",
    "Fun language and low workload. Genuinely kind and passionate instructor.",
    "Yes very interesting class.",
    "Yes, the professor is excellent and I really enjoyed the class!",
    "If you're considering taking Polish, you should definitely do it! Professor Illakowicz truly cares about her students and makes Polish approachable. I have really enjoyed being in this small class, where you get the opportunity to ask any questions you have. Polish is a complicated language but that also makes it an interesting challenge.",
    "I highly recommend Polish as a foreign language course, the language is fun and interesting, and you'll get to learn a few cool bits of Polish history along the way.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about Polish language and culture."
