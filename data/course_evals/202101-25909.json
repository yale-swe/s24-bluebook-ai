I did not have much background in the history of Christianity, nor art history, but I felt welcomed in every discussion and it was not intimidating to participate.

The final paper gave us an opportunity to explore some of these questions in more depth and practice making use of secondary scholarship to develop our own analysis.",

                "I really liked the rhythm of the class, but I do think it would function better in an in-person environment. Sometimes it was difficult to follow which part of a piece we were discussing because we couldn't point like in person.",
                "There are no weaknesses I can think of. Professor Jung's insights and enthusiasm are an obvious strength. I also appreciated all of our live seminar discussions. The final project was a great opportunity to synthesize what I learned.",
                "This class had many strengths. All of the readings, both primary and secondary, were very interesting and engaging. The balance between primary/secondary and visual/textual sources was also well-designed. It was great to scroll through the Beinecke digital archives and speak with one of the authors of an article we had read in class. The discussion board posts were also productive, ging us a chance to reflect in depth on the week's readings before discussing them together. My only suggestion is very minor: I think I would have preferred the class to meet twice weekly for shorter periods of time instead of only once a week, so that we could discuss more regularly throughout the week.",
                "Strengths: multiple modes of engagement with material (creative and academic), varied readings, open-ended final project",
                "This course was amazing! It was so great to learn from Professor Jung's expertise, especially in the class on St Maurice, since she has done so much cool scholarship on that topic. I wish we could have had more back and forth discussion between students during class, but that was very hard due to zoom.",
                "Strengths: Professor Jung is a captivating teacher and her knowledge of the topic is incredible. The texts, though complex, are highly engaging and sparked a high level of discussion in the classroom. \r\nWeaknesses: I would have preferred to have two medium-sized assignments spread out throughout the semester than have one assignment due at the end of the semester be worth 50% of my grade."

The classroom environment was supportive and welcoming to students of all backgrounds and perspectives. The objects under investigation are truly breathtaking and tell such important stories about the early Christian world that students come to understand and articulate for themselves over the course of the semester.",

The course gave me a lot of practice with visual analysis and working through different kinds of readings. Professor Jung is so enthusiastic about medieval art that it's infectious.",
