                "This course is highly self-directed, and it requires a lot of discipline and organization to not fall behind. I personally did not enjoy how the teaching style was flipped classroom, because I think there is value to learning concepts together with a group and having someone to ask questions to as you're learning the content.",
                "I feel like since this was just like a basic class that is useful for a lot of classes, it felt more like a pre-req where the strengths lied in the concepts I learned. Also, the feedback we received on our exams and problem sets were very comprehensive, so it was very easy to learn from our mistakes and apply those changes to our future assignments/exams. The weakness of this course was that it was taught by first-year grad students, so not only were we learning this concept for the first time, the grad students were teaching it for the first time, so it was really hard to learn.",
                "The structure (learning the material before class and then relearning it in class) seems kind of silly. There is no explanation of the motivation for anything; you're just given a bunch of formulas. If you just want to learn the techniques of multivariable calculus, this course is ok, but it makes no effort to do anything beyond that (and you'll be learning those techniques on your own from the videos).",
                "The course itself has very few strengths and many weaknesses. Perhaps the only strength is that the teaching fellows are not needed to learn the course  the entirety of the course could essentially be learned through the textbook and psets. The teaching fellows are perhaps the biggest weakness of the course - varying greatly in quality (usually ending up on the lower end of the quality spectrum) and often helping very little in engagement or understanding.",
                "more guided practice problems could have helped",
                "The problem sets are considerably harder than the tests and there needs to be more office and peer tutor hours.",
                "The strength is that it covers the basics of multivariable calculus. It teaches what it is suppose to teach. A huge weakness is that graduate students are instructors, and some are not as experienced nor motivated. My instructor was not very engaging, and many students stopped attending lectures. I found the motivation very low, and thus did not enjoy the learning. I wish I had a more motivating class environment.",
                "This class does not facilitate student learning in any way whatsoever.",
                "Strengths: There are a lot of resources to help you learn the material.\r\nWeaknesses: The pre-class quizzes did not help with anything. I don't think there was a point in doing them.",
                "The accessibility of resources to help with your understanding outside of class for this course is incredibly strong, between office hours and exceptional peer tutors. They also provide so many online resources such as practice problems through Ximena and pre-class videos which help when reveiwing the material. However, this course was not great at maintaining student engagement -- for reference, my 25 person class had a solid 5-person average attendance per class. The majority of classes, at least in my section, covered theory, while the PSets and the tests mainly covered computational problems. You could easily have simply taught yourself the material from the textbook and by going to peer tutoring sessions where the computational material was covered better (albeit about 20 people in my class did). I found myself learning the most from the problem sets and the textbook rather than in class itself.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Well-organized and good course in multivariable calculus (reasonable content and problem sets)\r\n- A lot of support for learning from peers and tutors\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- A lot of variance in teaching quality between sections\r\n- Seems to be less focus upon proofs and explanations of why rather than use of theorems\r\nHow to improve:\r\n- Understand that some instructors are good at learning math but not necessarily teaching it, so maybe emphasize teaching a bit more as well\r\n- Extend more beyond just using theorems, add more optional proofs (e.g. point to parts in the textbook where the proofs are done)",
                "Sri is not a good teacher. He is slow and makes mistakes when working out problems on the board. His explanations are roundabout. Students would benefit from having more experienced grad students teach, if not full professors (which is, after all, what most of them are actually paying for)."
