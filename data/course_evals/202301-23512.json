This was the first in-depth philosophy class I took at Yale, and I am so grateful that it was with Smith. I was surrounded by brilliant peers, felt excited to the readings, and came to class each week eager to discuss.",

Themes include liberal pluralism and its discontents, foundations of modern conservatism, the theologico-political problem, the relationship between the city and the philosopher, critiques of historicism and positivism, esotericism, and the craft of statesmanship.",

                "The readings and professor were definitely the strength. I do wish that we had the opportunity to get peer feedback on our essays, or something like that, just because this was fairly new to me. But truly this was one of the best courses, if not the best, I have taken; I learned quite a bit about the philosophical questions and ideas that are behind many modern ideologies and dispositions (esp. Marxism and Conservatism).",
                "The content was interesting but a bit amorphous. Hard to discern exactly what I took away from this class but that might just be the nature of modern political philosophy. Note that all of the authors are mainly reactionary and are writing about philosophers before them, so theyre very different from the political philosophy that you read in DS.",
                "Strengths: encourages students to engage deeply with material by creating discussion-leading questions, good array of philosophical thought to study, prof smith!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: amount of reading led to some topics being rushed",
                "Strengths: this seminar was particularly strong because of the other students -- a lot of smart undergraduates and graduate students. The authors on the syllabus are strong, but to be honest, I don't necessarily think the readings chosen were all their most interesting works. Also, in spite of how impressive the group was, discussion felt too expositional and not focused enough on philosophy.",
                "The syllabus was certainly a strength, and the in-class discussion was engaging. I enjoyed the setup of the course and the seminar atmosphere. No weaknesses come to mind immediately.",
                "Strengths: excellent reading list, knowledgable professor, manageable workload. Weaknesses: poorly led seminars dominated by a few students and often boring."

                "Maybe. Great readings, but seminars were not the best. May be more inclined to recommend if the class were either taught as a lecture or had less people in the seminar. Grading seemed a bit arbitrary."
