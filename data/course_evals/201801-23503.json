    "I developed a great amount of knowledge in regards to the process of state formation and the elements that make this process smoother.",
    "This class was amazing!! This class provided a chance to connect complex readings on more complex topics.",
    "Skills: The ability to critique political science papers by finding ways to improve theories, data methodology, etc. \r\nKnowledge: A broad understanding of taxation, representation, warfare, and states from a political perspective",
    "I learned an incredible amount from this class, mostly, as the name would suggest, about state formation.  This course also involved reading a lot of academic papers, so I learned how to parse through academic language and read regression tables as well",
    "A wide-ranging but relatively in-depth understanding of the forces which shaped early and modern state formation. The readings are very worthwhile (although often challenging) and Professor Queralt provides good feedback on the responses which means that the responses also felt useful. This class really changed the way I thought about the state. Professor Queralt is very good at making sure discussion is inclusive and interesting - I really felt like I learned from my peers in this class."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professor Queralt is a great guy with lots of knowledge on the topic, very wide range of topics that focuses on many parts of the world\r\nWeaknesses: could have more seminars on different parts of the world based on students' interests",
    "This class was an in-depth survey of the history of states from the past 5,000 years, so naturally it was fast-paced. That being said, I feel like the course adequately covered a lot of different lenses and regions of state building-- definitely a strength of the course.",
    "I would suggest providing a couple \"reading questions\" with the set of papers each week so that all students can be prepared to answer a couple questions during seminar (I think it would encourage class participation to do so).",
    "This course was very very good at delivering a lot of information very quickly and in a particularly engaging way.  I The only weakness might be a slight lack of connection between the material covered each week; more time could have been spent drawing connections",
    "Strengths: really excellent professor thus strong discussion and unique insights, great readings. Weaknesses: none, really."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely. It's a great course, in which individuals can learn a variety of topics, ranging from taxation, economics, game theory, reading regressions and applying all of this to current situations, like Catalonia.",
    "Absolutely take this class! It is a challenge in every respect (especially with the weekly reading response papers), but the discussions and readings wove together to present  a thorough and comprehensible narrative of the history of states. I'm not sure where else at Yale this could be done or found if not under the leadership of Professor Queralt.",
    "Yes, it provided an interdisciplinary and fairly in-depth perspective on a variety of time periods and regions. There are weekly reading responses which force you to really digest and think about the information.",
    "Absolutely recommend this class. Professor Queralt has structured the course very well. The first few sessions provide important foundational frameworks for the rest of the course, and the final weeks really help to clarify how and why state building has differed across different countries.",
    "If you're interested in state formation, how states or governments develop, or why some states succeed while others fail, take this course.  If not, don't",
    "100%. It is one of those unique courses that you'll find yourself relating all your other (seemingly disparate) coursework to."
