Jake made the classs fun and exciting with activitises that got us thinking, but i feel like twhen it comes to writing, you have to take some of that journey on your own and your classmates and jake are there to support you but you have to find your own voice and story, you have to know what you're willing to sacrifice, kill your darlings, but also know what you're not willing to yield on. i learned that writing is hard. but also exciting. jake taught a lot more abotu the publishing end of things in little tid bits, about using alumni connections. i learned that i can write a book but also that's a much longer process than one semester.",

I also learned about the publishing world, how to query agents, and how to begin a career in writing."

                "Strengths: amazing, caring professor with so much wisdom to share! We need more creative writing classes focused on novel writing and more classes in general on Young Adult literature!\r\nWeaknesses: it was a little frustrating having to rewrite and rewrite the same chapters  it felt inconducive to true novel writing and I was losing zeal for my story by getting bogged down on chapters 1 and 2. I would have preferred a greater emphasis on quantity as opposed to quality (being expected to write maybe 5-10 chapters but being allowed to just put in notes that I'd change things later, rather than actually having to change them). I think I'd be more likely to finish my novel after taking the course if I had written more, rather than having a polished first 3 chapters.",
                "strengths: jake has an infectious positivity and encouragement you don't often get. i think sometimes his advice skews more middle grade and more fantasy and he's obviously not a young adult of today, but i think he does try to give good advice and sometimes hearing what you don't want to do pushes you to figure out what you do want to do. fellow student feedback shined and was v helpful. sometimes tho you get to the point where you just have to do the work. you can't let the negative feedback stop you from continuing, but you also can grow from it. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: idk but i think maybe a few tidbit writing assignments to get some juices flowing during class would be helpful to make it feel like were not so alone in the writing. i think also with covid and stuff hard to keep up house meetings. i think that jakes positionality as a conceivably straight white man also made it a little hard for him to understand or connect on certain things. i think he's an amazing professor and person but perhaps there are limits to introspection and awareness of race. i think that it was hard when some ppl in class had stories very distant from themselves and stories very close to themselves and so sometimes that created dissonance. like some stories are not just stories.",
                "This course is a great introduction to YA novel writing! Professor Halpern is an experienced YA writer and offers a lot of really good advice, and the workshops offer a lot of opportunity for peer feedback.",
                "Strengths -- The course is very tight-knit and you get very detailed feedback from Professor Halpern and your classmates. Prof. Halpern line-edits your work (super rare feedback) and gives you brilliant ideas to think about when writing. You unlock this other way of thinking\/creativity that helps with young adult writing.\r\nNo weaknesses.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it is so much. I cannot stress enough how much this class has been. Going every week and writing was never a chore. Instead, I was excited to work, discuss my ideas, and learn from other people. It was such a great collaborative space to talk with people about stories that we were interested in, and how we could take elements of these stories to make ourselves better writers. As for weaknesses, at times it could be a little much reading everybody's work before class (especially once everyone was turning in more chapters) but it was still reasonable.",
                "Weakness: only working on one project for the whole semester... my interest dwindled",
                "I wouldve loved a little more clarity on what would have been due when however the overall structure of working on our own novels and getting very useful feedback was amazing",
                "I think the biggest strength of this course is it gives you the infrastructure that forces you to put words on the page and actually creatively write. This was incredibly helpful; without this class forcing me to write, I'm not sure I would've ever started. That said, the class doesn't provide a lot of instruction on ~how~ to write. I think the biggest strength of this course is just helping people get started.",
                "This course was designed entirely to put all of us in a position to write and get our stories onto paper. The biggest strength was definitely the amazing environment this class fostered. The only weakness was that it only meets once a week. Fair warning, sometimes a lot of work can be due at once, but as long as you pace yourself and write consistently it is very manageable.",
                "Strengths: the seminar-based class size allowed for close collaboration with peers and lively discussion. Professor Jake was great at creating a relaxed and vibrantly creative space for students to grow their writing skills. The House Meeting were a fabulous addition to the class and allowed us to form extra close bonds with classmates. I loved the discussion and workshop-based format of the class. It was always fun to hear and receive feedback on our writing. I also enjoyed the fact that students were responsible for choosing readings, letting us pick books that related to our own writing. Weaknesses: no huge weaknesses, but I think that the presenting schedule was a bit confusing at times and could be streamlined. I also wish the class was organized more into units talking about major writing themes, voice, characters, worldbuilding ext. It was sort of there but could be more clear. Overall, though, this was one of the best Yale classes I have ever taken.",
                "Strengths: the people you meet and the professor's feedback!"

                "YES!! There are so few opportunities at Yale to take a course that engages with novel writing Young Adult novel writing at that! It was an incredibly supportive environment a true privilege to learn from Jake!",
                "if you want to write even if you have no experience, yeaaaaahhh take this course. it's fun and you learn so much through doing and the class provides such an amazng eneergy and support and jake is like a goofy paternal figure cheering you on, the dumbledore of our class. he also has immense knowledge and experience and even tho his life path might feel foreign to your own, i did appreciate the way he was hoenst and shared about it adn brought us into his life in a professional way because it's hard imaging the future sometiems. WRITE YOUR BOOK!!! YOU GOT THIS!! i will say tho the key thing tho is this class is a launchpad not a like one and done nanowrimo kinda deal. trust in the process, put your heart into it and hopefully you'll end up with a few chapters that will help you write a book and a lot of random memories about playing jenga or going to the cemetery that you can look back on :)",
                "Yes, but only if you have a genuine interest in writing the start of a YA novel over the course of the semester. That's not to say you need to have a whole world in your head ready to burst out, I definitely didn't. But you do need the drive to sustain you through producing quite a substantial amount of material!",
                "I'd definitely recommend this course to another student, regardless of their year or major.",
                "Yes! If you have any interest in creative writing but are not sure if you are capable of doing it or just want to try it--this is the course for you. Everyone is so supportive of one another, and Jake is an absolutely amazing professor who really cares about his students.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone looking for a strong group with which to gain feedback. They should be serious about writing a book however.",
                "Yes! This is the perfect class for someone who is either a) interested in Young Adult fiction or b) need help getting started with a creative project. I had never written before this class, and Professor Halpern created an extremely supportive infrastructure and classroom environment that helped me get started. He is so accessible and genuinely wants to see and help you succeed. That said, the class was a surprising amount of work.",
                "YES! This course has been hands down my favorite class I've taken yet. It is exactly what it is advertised as, a class where you will be give total creative control over writing the story you have in your head. I have taken other creative writing classes here where my ideas have been shot down because the prof preferred to read a different story, but Jake constantly encouraged me to explore every aspect of my own creativity and this allowed me to finally put a story I've been wanting to write for years onto paper.",
                "Yes. Take this class if you can get in. It is well worth your time and you will learn how to be a better writer.",
                "Yes! Great way to explore writing with a community of writers who care about you and your stories."
