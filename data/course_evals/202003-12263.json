                "I enjoyed the variety of films we watched with our discussions, as well as learning the history of dance on film before delving into the various components of dance on film and how they impact the art form. We watched things from Beyonc videos to old Hollywood musicals to more modern experimental films. I will say that some films were more interesting and had more to unpack than others, especially when it came to experimental pieces. I think the reflections required for each class were very helpful not only in allowing me to grow as a writer and become more familiar with describing pieces but also to organize my thoughts and digest the films and readings before discussion sections. Some of the readings were very interesting and pertinent to our study, others seemed a little dry and repetitive. Overall, though, this class was interesting and moved at a great pace.",
                "The weekly discussion posts give students valuable practice in both viewing and writing. Also, the small, very involved class made discussions very insightful and informative.",
                "This course was very fun and engaging. We did simple choreographic exercises at the beginning of every class! The first part of the course is more about the history of dance on film and it's more challenging than the final half. The final half was more fun, you get to learn about film techniques and watch films for homework. You will have to talk a lot in the class and give out your opinion because it is a small seminar, which was difficult for me."

You also learn a lot about composition and movement, which makes you view film and art in a new way.",
