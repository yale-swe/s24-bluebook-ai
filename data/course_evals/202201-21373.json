                "Without a doubt, I can say that I developed the skills necessary to write academic papers. Peter Conroy's feedback on my essays helped me to see the ways how I can improve my arguments and the style of writing. Moreover, this was probably my favorite class this semester because the content of this course is extremely interesting. We read everything from Political science to philosophy to history, and a biography. I really enjoyed our morning discussions, which made it totally worth it to wake up for a 9 a.m class like this.",

                "How to read and analyze texts , and dissect the meaning, as well as write about challenging concepts",
                "I became a better writer in that I was able to hone my research skills, practice \"showing not telling,\" practice forming a strong argument while presenting s possible counter argument, and my editing skills improved.",
                "As a result of ENG 114, I began a more confident writer. We had to write 4 papers this semester and Peter Conroy really encourages us to use a wide variety of approaches to our introductions, arguments, and counterarguments.  He was very accessible and always gave great feedback.",
                "I learned how to improve my argumentative skills as well as learn how to write better academic papers. Also, I learned more about the concept of The End of History and what that entitles. It brought a somewhat new perspective as it showed how pervasive capitalism can be.",
                "I became a much more competent writer in this English 114 class. I became more comfortable taking risks and being more stylized in my writing. I learned a lot about philosophy, too, and particularly how it has impacted and continues to shape the modern political climate. I became a more argumentative writer, being able to synthesize other works and form my own argument engaging with them. This class was super helpful in also making me a better, more efficient, more confident writer and researcher."

            "comments": [
                "The strength of this course is how broad and narrow it is at the same time. On the one hand, we have been reading about the single concept of \"The End of History\" the entire semester, which certainly helped me dive deep into the topic and study it from the inside out. On the other hand, it is very broad in the sense that we focused on so many great writers, philosophers, and historians, whom I enjoyed reading a lot.",
                "I enjoyed a lot of the readings and felt they were very relevant. The course was flexible and accommodating, I really enjoyed it. The only weakness I can think of was the memoir at the end, it would've been helpful to have a little more time to read it and enjoy it.",
                "The professor was a strength unfortunately I was not interested in the content",
                "I honestly just didnt love the topic",
                "All the material in this course is fairly interesting and the topics for the papers throughout the semester are easy to engage with. The main two weaknesses of this course are the large amount of weakly readings and the sheer amount of material covered over the semester.",
                "The strength of this course is clearly Peter Conroy. I can't think of a more engaging and kind teacher for this course.  He clearly knew the material and had always had some interesting angle to discuss.  At the same time, he was very understanding when the students were having a particularly difficult week and would adapt the course load if needed.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course is that the reading was very dense and hard to get through sometimes.  Many times I wanted to participate but was lost either due to the reading or the depth of the subject matter.",
                "The strengths of the course is that the material seems to flow well from section to section. Another strength is that not only do you learn more about political theory, you also learn more about how to craft a stronger, academic essay. This skill is taught throughout the course, which I really appreciated. An area of improvement could potentially be just a little more explanation for some of the harder-to-read texts. Other than that, the class was extremely great!",
                "I thought this class was great! All of the assignments seemed relevant and useful, and I appreciated having benchmarks for the larger assignments. Though the reading was sometimes a lot, it was manageable and all relevant. Class conversations could have been a bit more structured, especially given a seminar mostly of underclassmen, but overall, I think they were all very insightful and caused me to think critically."

                "I would definitely recommend the course to another student with the caveat that the reading is going to be dense and difficult. That being said, the course \"end of history\" was really time and especially fascinating because of current world events.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it 100%! The class is set up in a great way for learning about the concept of The End of History. Although at times it may feel very text heavy or confusing, it makes more sense in the actual discussion. I honestly enjoyed the class.",
                "Yes, absolutely! The topic is very interesting and the amount of growth in writing is huge. It definitely requires an investment of time and thought, but it was very thought-provoking. My writing was improved greatly."
