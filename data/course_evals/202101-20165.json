Such a difference from the old white guys we're used to reading as English majors. Even better if the peers in your seminar are engaging, makes for a better discussion. Only 3 papers too!",
                "The course is fantastic. The readings are diverse yet fit together seamlessly with the larger narrative of the course and are all really interesting. The assignments ramp up in length as the semester goes on which provides a very natural progression to learn the ropes of essay writing at the college level. No weaknesses!",
                "Such a strong class. I felt like the syllabus was balanced well and never felt too overwhelming. I was in a relatively small class (7 people), which I think was a huge strength. In a larger group the discussion might not have been so exciting and engaging.",
                "Not a lot of feedback on writing, but interesting text and Prof. Richards fostered interesting discussions",
                "Strengths was the amazing selection of works, particularly The God of Small Things and Waiting for the Barbarians, as well as Professor Richards who was probably the most understanding, sympathetic, and empathetic professor I have yet had. She didn't overload us with work though we still got much done and engaged with a dozen or so works in just a semester.",

World literatures in English are so important, and it's terrible how English majors and other students can go their entire college careers without taking anything except the white western canon and ignore all of these, to be completely frank, superior works of written English that come from non-American or European-native authors.",
