                "The class is a great opportunity to hone my composition skills on whatever project interests me, as well as to get to meet other student composers and amazing guests, such as Jay Wadley this semester!",
                "I learnt to deepen my composition and apply it to my own style. I got personal composition lessons every week with an incredible grad student, and I got fantastic opportunities to have my works performed and write directly for cool concerts as part of the course."

            "comments": [
                "The class is a great low-key way to continue composing as part of your schoolwork, which is a strength in and of itself. Another big strength of the course is access to the private lessons, which are really helpful and valuable. One weakness is that the course could feel disorganized at times. Sometimes there were guest lectures so many weeks in a row that I didn't really know what we were supposed to be doing in the course. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing -- it was nice to just sort of show up and hear some cool music!",
                "More structured lectures would be great. The individual feedback is the biggest strength.",
                "For the classes on electronic music and DAWs, I wish the instruction had been a little more specific and directed and hands-on. The smaller-group tutorial on sampling was helpful for me, but I wish there had been more coverage of specific topics such as mixing, audio effects, vocal recording techniques, pitch-shifting, time-shifting, etc. I think a live demo/tutorial of putting a piece together, demonstrating recording and sampling and mixing, would have been helpful. The teaching felt a little scattered and too general.",
                "Class lectures and assignments are really interesting, and the five deadlines throughout the semester to ensure we're making progress on our projects is really helpful. The one-hour weekly lessons are the biggest attraction from the course for me and I think they're incredibly helpful at keeping myself working and being challenged and inspired with a different perspective every week.\r\n\r\nI think it could be really valuable to do more workshopping of our work in class -- especially in focused small groups for an entire class session so that we could really hone in on each other's work with a lot more detail , rather than moving through each person's work fairly quickly like we usually have to.",
                "This course has many strengths. Getting personal composition lessons every week is absolutely fantastic - all the TAs are incredible, and it's a really great way to be motivated to compose regularly. The instructors, Konrad and Dr. A, are universally beloved they are very skilled at a wide range of musical style, very generous with their help and appreciation of students' ideas, and overall fantastic professors. \r\n\r\nThe main thing to improve would be the seminars. It is fantastic that we have such distinguished guests, but the talks are sometimes a little monotonous, and I've heard this from other people in the class too. I think they don't go into enough musical detail often we just listen to the guest's work and then hear a high-level overview of their process or thoughts while composing. At the end of the semester I do not feel that I have learnt many new musical techniques. I know it's difficult to coordinate since the people in composition seminar have such a wide range of backgrounds, but I would appreciate sort of being thrown into a style of composition every class, being able to have more of a mix of high-level details as well as more specific musical close-reading. Not everyone would understand everything - maybe I wouldn't understand the 15-min discussion of a certain chord progression and its origins, for example  but I think this would be a great class format because it would expose everyone to a wider range of compositional techniques, and give people a chance to make up for the background they feel they are missing. Overall I feel that much of the talks is taken up by listening to music, which is of course very enjoyable, but also something I could do in my spare time. I think if the talks had a more specific topic (\"Today's talk is about the influence of Mahler in X's music), I would have a chance to learn more specific techniques. Some weeks would be more difficult for me to understand than others, of course, but I think I would learn much more overall."
