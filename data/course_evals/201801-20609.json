   "comments": [
    "A variety of skills that allowed me to experience the breath of the field of computer music.",
    "- Music Production skills in Ardour\r\n- Music Synthesis skills in SC3\r\n- Knowledge regarding the production, transmission, and recording of sound",
    "Through this class I learned about the history and origins of computer music, pioneers in the field, and present-day computer music advancements. I learned about music creation techniques and details, such as how to use different microphones, keeping their advantages and disadvantages in mind. I learned a lot about synthesizing sound electronically, how to alter different parameters to shape the sound as you want, and how to create a music project in a Digital Audio Workstation. I also learned how to create music by writing computer code, and using Arduino as an interactive form of music creation.",
    "Learned how to record and program music in various ways",
    "I learned how abstract musical concepts and descriptions can be represented digitally. For example, how to create \"bright\" sounds, \"far-away\" sounds, and \"crunchy\" sounds. The Ardour DAW (digital audio workstation) lessons taught me how to create my own music, departing from the sheet music approach I'd been used to. The SuperCollider lessons showed me how audio can be represented as compositions of functions, variables, and number sequences.",
    "This is an amazing introduction to digital music\/sound.  I had a little background in the material, but I have a much more conceptual understanding. In addition, I feel I am a better composer."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very engaging material and projects.\r\nThe lecture format in a freshman seminar is slightly disengaging.",
    "Room for Improvement: some sort of first project on the effects of musical plugins (compressors, EQs, etc.)",
    "The course was always very interesting -- lectures were applicable, class activities and homework assignments were direct extensions of the lectures. The guest lecturer was a great addition too, providing an example of someone very talented at what we were learning to do in class. Professor Petersen was amazing. The course schedule was great too, as we had weekly readings for the first half or so of the semester as well as homework projects, and then the focus shifted towards us implementing our knowledge more in the second half after we'd established a strong foundation in the material. This course could be improved by giving slightly more time to the actual creation of computer music in the DAW with a slightly smaller emphasis on the material from the first few weeks, including history and reading about different elements of music that didn't relate as directly to our creation of computer music.",
    "Fun class. The class tries to cover a lot of material in a short amount of time, so some skills are purely introductory. Nonetheless, the class taught me a lot about making music. The class also provides a lot of really helpful resources, like access to the music lab, which are super useful if you're making your own music.",
    "The main strengths of the course are Prof. Petersen's expertise and willingness to give detailed feedback. He constructively critiques each assignment we submit (often paragraphs of technical and nontechnical suggestions), and he is always open to answering questions.\r\n\r\nI would've liked a more predictable schedule in terms of assignments. Many weeks we would have no homework, while other weeks we would receive a time-consuming assignment to be due in a week. It was all sort of hand-wavy.",
    "This class is a lot of fun.  The work is interesting and the class community is great.  It's a great, relaxed environment to learn more about music and digital media.  However, the organization of the class could use some work.",
    "While slightly disorganised at times, we covered a lot of very cool and interesting material, ranging from how to make your own electronic music tracks on Ardour to live coding of music on SuperCollider. I feel like I got a great understanding of the possibilities of computers in music, what is the current state of the two and where the two can go in the future. Definitely an inspiring and eye-opening class."

   "comments": [
    "Depends if you are interested in music and computer science. If so, you'll greatly enjoy all the assignments and working in the music studio.",
    "Yes - it was very fun, and I learned a lot during my time spent on the projects.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who has an interest in learning about creating computer music. One of the most valuable takeaways from this class is the experience that I now have in creating music, as we were able to create several projects in Ardour to implement the knowledge and skills we'd learned in lecture. The coding section of the class was more intellectually challenging, but extremely interesting. Learning to create and write music just from coding is fascinating, and Professor Petersen set us up with a great foundation to be able to navigate coding, even if you have little experience in the field. The class is very collaborative, and Professor Petersen encourages that as well. Take this class!",
    "Yes if you have a strong background in music and especially computer science. Professor assumes you have decent prior knowledge. (The class is composed of mostly prospective computer science majors, plus a few engineering kids.) You will learn a lot and finish with the ability to create dope tracks using various programs, and the mean grade is pretty high (92%, or A-). But be prepared to put a good amount of time into every assignment. Not a gut!",
    "If anybody is interested in learning about music and how it works, along with the basics of producing, this is a must take class.  Although at times it was quite dense, I learned a great deal about music and my appreciation for it has increased immensely.",
    "Yes.  You need some (very limited) background in music, but if you have that, this class is great.  The lectures are interesting and the homework is fun.",
    "Take this class! Not only do you meet one of the best Yale professors, get access to a dope music studio and learn how to use Ardour, SuperCollider, Arduino, but you obtain entirely new perspectives on the intersection between computers and music. It's the class you can always speak to your friends about with pride, because you're always doing the coolest and most relevant stuff."
