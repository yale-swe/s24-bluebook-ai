                "Strengths: great teacher, engaging class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the homework doesn't exactly match up with what we are taught in class. Kind of seems like they are forcing Dawn Sign Press on us when I genuinely think that there are much better alternatives to homework assignments. I also thing we need to review content more often in class. Julia would review the same new signs for practically a week, but Francis tended to teach us a sign and then not return to it later in the week. Also, please make quizzes by the professor for the students they have. I had Francis, but when I would have to answer questions that Andrew signed, I felt so lost.",
                "Engaging teaching style with a lot of flexibility and variation.\r\n\r\nThe games are fun but I would say it is enough with 1-2 games per week, not every day. More practice in pairs to make sure vocabulary etc sticks.",
                "Strengths: curriculum, format of the course, community-building, service project\r\nWeaknesses: communication about exams",
                "The course is structured pretty well, but we played too many games in class. I felt like our time would have been better used with repetitive practice of vocabulary and ASL conversations between students.",
                "Frances is an incredible teacher. I can't say enough good things about her. She was in a good mood for every class, and you could tell she was super enthusiastic to be teaching us. She was encouraging, and didn't ever make you feel bad about being lost or confused. She was incredibly kind and understanding. One time I submitted a quiz late because I had a lot going on, and she totally understood and didn't take points away because of it. I was excited to go to class every day, and every day felt like a game and never like work. She is exactly what you want a Yale teacher to be.",
                "I wish there was maybe more service project guidance.",
                "Probably the most fun and useful language offered at Yale. I loved that we not only got to practice ASL but also engage with Deaf studies. One weakness was that feedback on expressive assignments came a bit late."
