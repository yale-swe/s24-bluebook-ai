                "Writing in a concise and powerful way. By improving your prose, you also improve your process of thinking. I was able to experiment with my sentences and essay structure while writing about anything I wanted to write. You also develop a close bond with your classmates as writers.",
                "I became an undeniably better writer (and reader of writing). Many classes emphasize structure, so it was nice to look at more granular parts of essays. It may seem like nitpicking at first, but Verlyn's attention to each word helps you develop your own appreciation for great sentences.",
                "This is the only writing class that focuses on sentence-level craft. I learned so much just by training my ear to sentence structures, word choice etc.",
                "Write with precision and clarity.",
                "My writing improved drastically in this class. I learned to write more clearly and concisely. And also how to craft a sentence for the beauty of it! We learned always what you write but how you write it  that was a unique lesson that was so important for me to learn."

                "The strengths of this course are the access it provides to Verlyn's amazing mind and editorial brain. He is just such an incredible editor and will teach you how to be one too. There are no weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: supportive environment, diverse set of writers (from different backgrounds, majors, interests, etc), weekly feedback from Verlyn and good office hours / Weakness: meets only once a week, so there are only about 11 classes a semester. Sometimes the freedom to choose whatever you want to write about might actually be limiting because I found myself frequently writing about the same general topic. But that's up to you.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- better, focused writing\r\n- getting to read everyone's work\r\n- super available professor\r\n- freedom to explore whatever topics you'd like\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- at times, it felt like there was a greater emphasis on copyediting than what an essay was saying or doing. I get that one informs the other, but I would have appreciated more feedback on content.",
                "Strengths  Prof Klinkenborg is a great writer and editor. Hes a great asset to train your writing skills. \r\nWeakness  wish we did more writing (only 2 double-spaced pages a week,) or a greater variety of assignments.",
                "Strengths: the structure of the class; I really loved how consistent it was in terms of the workload and expectations. It felt like Daily Themes, except weekly. I was a little frustrated at first because it felt like my writing wasn't improving, but as Verlyn always says, progress is non-linear. Verlyn's comments were very encouraging and helpful, and I started to see writing more as an opportunity to explore the world through language. Weaknesses: I wish that Verlyn could've given us more concrete feedback on how our sentences mediated the content of our writing, since we focused so specifically on sentences (though this makes sense, given that the class is called the Genre of the Sentence.)",
                "This course is amazing. It has substantially improved my ability to write with precision and clarity. My academic and creative writing have improved. Even my emails are clearer! I loved reading people's pieces each work. Honestly, I only wish that the course was year-long and that we got to read more work from students in the class.",
                "The best tool for improving your writing is just to keep writing, and thats exactly what we did.  Each week my writing improved. It allowed me to try different things and see what worked for me. Verlyns feedback was so helpful. The relaxed nature of the course allowed me to grow without straining myself, without a creative block. This course is designed so well to teach us how to write  by valuing simplicity."

                "I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in prose writing. As a stem major I didn't have a lot of opportunities to take writing classes and I was very thankful that I was admitted to this course. I had to postpone taking my major requirement to take this class but I knew it was the right choice to make. Verlyn has a lot of solid advice to give, and I found most of his readings very engaging. I grew so much as a writer and it was nice to force myself to write once a week instead of just doing psets and coding. It is nice to see yourself grow alongside all of your classmates. Everyone is genuinely enthusiastic about writing in their own way.",
                "Totally. You get to write in a low-pressure environment. You read lots of great writing. No reason not to.",
                "I would recommend! Very good at helping you refine your writing craft.",
                "Yes, I definitely would if you love writing but haven't paid close attention to the way each of your sentences sound and feel.",
                "Yes. Absolutely. This course is a great opportunity to write creatively while honing your sensibilities.",
                "Yes, absolutely. This course was just a joy throughout my week. I always looked forward to class. Everyone whos read my writing has said its improved from this course."
