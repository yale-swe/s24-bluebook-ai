   "comments": [
    "By taking this course, my eyes were truly opened to the severity of disinformation that exists within our democracy. Before this course, I was vaguely aware of the concept of \"fake news,\" but after studying and analyzing specific effects of Russian disinformation campaigns and the ways in which biases affect our perceptions of what we see online, I will probably forever be skeptical of what I come across on social media and in the news. I feel empowered to lead a knowledgeable discussion about disinformation in the world today and how social media has such an expansive reach on consumers, especially in terms of impacting political relationships. I will apply what I have learned to current events and future political events.",
    "In just five weeks I was able to learn so much about Russian Active Measures, disinformation tactics, the ways in which social media exacerbates the issue, and the threat posed to society at large. The readings, documentaries, and videos assigned for the course never got boring and I have been using the information I learned in conversations outside of class and even in my other summer session course. If you fully engage with the course, it won't just help you learn about disinformation, Russia, or the 2016 election but will really get you thinking about the bigger picture. The content relates to so many different fields including politics, psychology, technology, and so much more. It will open your eyes to things you may have never thought about before (at least it did for me).",
    "Understanding about the state of disinformation. Lot of discussion as it relates to current events and the media\/social media",
    "Through taking this course I was better able to pick out true information from fake information in news. I feel I am more knowledgeable when it comes to active measures being taken against the United States by other countries.",
    "Better media literacy, understanding of Russian active measures, and ways to strengthen skills that combat these relevant issues",
    "I learned so much about psychology, history and politics involved in (Russian) disinformation. I went into this course not really even sure of the facts about Russian interference, and came out of it with a great understanding of the background and reality of what happened in 2016. I developed the skills to critically read news articles and sources and judge how biased and vulnerable to disinformation they were, and well as think about policy that could address these problems.",
    "This was an excellent course from a really knowledgable instructor about disinformation - an extremely timely topic. Before this course I was vaguely aware that Russia did something in the 2016 election and it was politically contentious. This course gave me a firm grasp of the exact tactics the Russian government uses to destabilize American society, and the specific mechanisms of how it work. I thought I was a savvy news consumer before taking this course, but realized how blind to biases I can be. This course has given me skills that I've put into daily use to critique the news I am seeing and to have a better understanding of how propaganda can be insidious.",
    "Evaluating disinformation",
    "Gave a generalized understanding of how social media and politics intersect in a demcoracy",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of how social media controls our world, and how its inherent flaws can be exploited by malicious actors both at home and abroad.",
    "This was a great class that I can apply to my everyday life.",
    "In depth look at the 2016 Election and the Soviet Unions Active Measures towards America since the Cold War. This course made me rethink everything that I see on social media, especially during an election year. Also, gave an interesting look at society and our decreasing social capital towards each other."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - very well organized, interesting, draws on real-world and modern examples, very easy to contact the professor and TF with questions or concerns, facilitated strong discussions \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - besides readings and lecture videos, there were not a lot of notes provided that organized all of the information that would be discussed in each class meeting.",
    "The strengths are that the content is very relevant to the world we are living in and it is very interesting. The conversations held in class are also extremely thought-provoking. The only thing that I think some people would consider is a weakness is that some of the content about Russia and the 2016 election was repetitive.",
    "Strengths: Engaging. Clear. Easy-to-follow. Not difficult if you organize your readings. Plus, she is a former FBI agent focused on counterintelligence!\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes readings are long, but the content definitely makes up for it.",
    "Strengths - Professor and TF were awesome. The media bubble analysis assignments were great.\r\nWeakness - the \"seminar\" had 26 people. the syllabus was pretty dense for a 5 week course.",
    "I feel that being online course greatly affected the course, but it was very informative and I looked forward to every class.",
    "Strengths: the media bubbles were very insightful, helped me be aware of trends and vulnerabilities that Russian disinformation tactics often exploit, and practice learned media literacy skills. I appreciated all the additional documentaries and videos we watched!! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Just a lot of readings! While some were very interesting (esp. Mistakes were Made but Not By Me) but others felt really repetitive. However, this might've felt like a lot just because of the short time frame.",
    "This course was extremely well organized. The readings were all great and very interesting. The pre-lecture videos were a good way to prepare for class, and the live discussions themselves were generally very engaging. I thought the structure of the assignments were good as well - the media bubbles allowed for \"easier\" weeks in which to engage further with the readings and also think about the big paper at the end. Though the policy paper in the last week felt like a bit of a crunch, it was actually pretty easy to write given all that I had learned and read.",
    "The course was good in its entirety. Be it the content, the assignment or peoples contributions. However, I feel that the discussion could have flown better if there were break rooms and activities on zoom since it was a large class of 25 people.",
    "This was a very strong course with great guest speakers, useful Zoom conversations and a thoughtfully curated reading list. It was well designed and focused, and I really enjoyed it. This was the best online course I've taken, and Prof. Rangappa's guidance was a large part of that - Yale should consult with her on how to run an effective online seminar now that online courses are the norm. If I had to identify a weakness it would be the global critique I have of Yale courses that have a final paper - while we had very detailed constructive feedback throughout the course, there was no feedback on the final paper. I know this calls for extra work on the instructor's part, but I always find feedback extremely helpful and would have appreciated it on the final paper.",
    "Strengths: great professor and TF, brought in guests, did their best with online format\r\n\r\nWeakness: online format doesn't really work",
    "Strengths -  Highly relevant topic, so so crucial to understanding the changing landscape of politics of the world. The TA and students were thoughtful.\r\n\r\nWeakness - This course should be called \"Russian disinformation & American democracy\" since it was obsessed with Russian active measures in the US and did not spend time acknowledging or discussing threats to democracy from other sources. Moreover Professor Rangappa did not encourage disagreement with the material or with her own beliefs. It was a very singular way of analyzing a global phenomenon.",
    "I thought that the class and the professor had mostly strengths, with very few weaknesses. Professor Rangappa was extremely engaged with the class, she always did her best to answer questions and facilitate discussions. I think that like the other classes I have taken, there are certain limitations imposed by the Zoom platform, and the learning curve thereof, but overall it was a highly informative course, and I very much enjoyed learning from Professor Rangappa. The TA, Juan Carlos Salamanca, was also very engaged with the class, and frequently contributed with his own knowledge, and was very helpful visa vis questions about assignments and general course information.",
    "The strengths are discussing these issues with an expert who is passionate in the topic."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it was not only very interesting and applicable to modern events, but it was also very well organized and truly facilitated students' learning and intellectual growth. The workload was manageable, even under the time constraints of Yale Summer Session, and the overall takeaway was that students were left with the message that they should be aware of how social media, especially in today's age, can affect human interactions and social capital.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, especially to those who plan to do policy work in the future but also to anyone interested in information warfare, Russia, social media, or anyone for that matter... there is plenty of great things to be learned from the course and everyone should have a chance to experience the enlightening journey that it is.",
    "Definitely recommend. A very eye-opening course. If you are into intelligence, war, fake news, social media, social control, politics, and spies, you will love this course. Be aware: it's more practical than philosophical.",
    "Yes - important topic, cool professor",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, I found it extremely interesting, informative, and thorough. I would recommend it to anyone regardless of their major.",
    "Definitely! Professor Rangappa is amazing and the material is extremely eye-opening!! All the new knowledge is worth all the work! Our TA was also very helpful and offered very thoughtful comments that always pushed the discussion forward.",
    "Yes! This class is extremely topical. We're approaching the 2020 election right now, and the heavily politicized nature of Russian interference has led to the US being pretty underprepared in dealing with it again. I think as media and technology continues to evolve (and not always in ways conducive to better human interaction) this class is extremely important in understanding how we may hope to restore some civility and unity to American society. I enjoyed this class a ton and would definitely recommend it.",
    "Absolutely! This course was well organized, timely, and had a phenomenal instructor. I am especially eager in recommending it in the current online format. If this course is offered in some form during AY 2020-2021 I would strongly recommend it as the online component does not detract from the quality of the course.",
    "Absolutely, I would. The assignments for the class were very enjoyable, and the overall learning environment created by the professor was very positive. I enjoyed discussing the subject with the other students in the class, and Professor Rangappa brought in guest speakers who greatly enriched my understanding of the material. I find myself using what we learned in the course every day as I use social media, and Im interested in going deeper into the subject. Overall, it was a fantastic class that I felt challenged by, and I loved taking it.",
    "Yes! You need to learn about how foreign influences are getting involved in our American democracy.",
    "Yes. Great section and Professor Rangappa knows her stuff, as she was a member of the FBI for years. Some fascinating guest lecturers."
