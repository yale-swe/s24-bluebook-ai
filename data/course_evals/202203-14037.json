                "I expanded my understanding of borders from a line dividing zones of sovereignty to a set of practices used to control the flow of people, with a particular focus on how the rhetoric and treatment around migrants is used as a bordering practice. I learned to apply abstract concepts (e.g., Foucault's biopolitics) to real practices of bordering. We took a comparative approach in the course which gave me the opportunity to learn about regions of the world about which I was previously poorly informed, like the Middle East.",
                "This course really pushed my critical thinking in terms of the construct or borders and caused me to recognize and question my preconceived notions. I also learned a lot about the broader philosophical theories involved with border studies.",
                "In this course, I learned to look at borders critically and question why they are so widely accepted in today's society. I learned to look at them as more than a mere physical boundary, but instead a series of processes with numerous connections to public health, criminalization, climate change, and more. In taking this course, I improved my writing skills through the numerous assignments we had throughout the semester. I also learned to work better with my classmates through the in-class projects we had, as well as the final project."

                "The structure of the course is a major strength. Each class session, we would have at least 15 minutes (sometimes much more) to break into groups of two or three to discuss the readings or a topic of the professor's choice. This gave me the opportunity to really meet everyone in the class and it gave the class a sense of community unusual even for a humanities seminar. The class also included several guest speakers who were experts on various topics from climate migration to refugee resettlement. The final project was very flexible and let me explore a really interesting topic in depth.",
                "This course has a realistic amount of readings that always felt relevant to what we learned in class. Moreover, each week's topics felt distinct, but still flowed from one another to create a coherent semester studying borders and migration. Leslie also broke up the 2 hours of class time very well, so it never felt like we were doing one thing too long, nor did it feel like we did the same thing every class. Some weeks readings were longer, but Leslie was understanding of our time and was willing to shorten readings or extend assignment deadlines accordingly. There were no big weaknesses of this course, as it was overall very well-structured and engaging."

The professor is amazing, the subject is interesting, and if your class is anything like mine, you will find yourself in a supportive community of awesome peers.",
                "Yes! I think especially for students who are on tracks other than ERandM such as Global or Poli Sci this course provides important view points and theoretical thinking frameworks that are not provided otherwise.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone (not just Anthropology majors), as borders and migration can be applied to so many disciplines outside of the ones this course is registered under. It really broadened my perspectives concerning this topic and made me consider it from a point of view I had never previously considered. This course also changed how I look at current narratives surrounding borders, and I will definitely continue to carry this with me throughout my time at Yale. I think this course was extremely engaging and Leslie took great care to make it this way. Therefore, I would recommend this class to anyone (even if you have never studied something in this field), as it is so widely applicable and fascinating that I think anyone would enjoy it."
