                "Analyzed the relationship between words and visual art (specifically with comics, zines, etc.). Made our own weekly projects.",
                "I learned about different ways that words and pictures could be linked, as well as how it has evolved and can be perceived by outsiders (through particular areas like comics and news). I also got to practice critiquing others' work in a constructive manner and recognizing thematic similarities across works within their portfolio. Through the diverse, open-ended assignment prompts, I was encouraged to experiment with different materials and ways of presenting an idea.",
                "I feel like I tried a lot of new formats and techniques for making art, since all the assignments required a different way to interpret the prompt. The readings also introduced me to new ways of thinking about art and comics.",

                "The three-hour-long class can definitely becoming tiring, but if this class was an hour shorter it would be perfect. Our discussions were interesting and I loved the content and artists I consumed and learned about over the semester.",
                "Strengths: Great professor who did a good job at guiding discussion. Readings were great and very interesting. Loved the trips to the art museum and Beinecke. Assignments were fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had more feedback on our projects and a better idea of what our grade was throughout the course. Also there were a few classes where we didn't have enough time for discussion\/lecture.",
                "This course was organized in a way that truly encouraged creative expression and emphasized the value of ideas rather letting craftsmanship and skills be the be all end all, which made it approachable for people who are not as experienced with art. The open-ended nature of the assignments allow for a diverse range of media, from typical sketches and paintings to photography, videography, and sculpture\/model making. The link to writing also fosters storytelling abilities. Halsey always creates a very relaxed, accepting atmosphere in class; the way he dedicates time towards critiquing each piece of art shows his genuine interest in each person's work. The museum visits are a great opportunity to appreciate the resources that are available on campus (which I would not have checked out had I not had a set time to do so). The only weakness is the length of the class - 3 hours on a Thursday afternoon, near the end of the week, is quite long to sit through, and it is easy to lose focus during discussions of the reading in the second half of class.",
                "I loved the assignments and lectures, but I feel like our reading discussions could have been a little more structured or maybe shorter. It was sometimes hard to stay focused after long stretches of talking about the same thing, and some prompts or a more guided discussion might have helped. Though I appreciated all the feedback on my work, I would have liked some more advice on how to improve, even if it might have been harder to hear in the moment.",
                "Strengths: we met once a week so we had really long discussions and time to really delve into everything. The professor and TA were fantastic- very understanding, supportive, and kind individuals. We took field trips around campus as a class and explored different forms of art\r\nWeaknesses: can't think of any+",
                "One of the strengths of this course is the seminar style discussions. I looked forward to each class because of the intimate and deep conversations that the class had about different words and pictures topics that also relates to real life.",
                "Strengths: a lot of freedom to explore interests in the weekly projects, lots of chances to engage with different art styles and materials in the art building at Yale\r\nWeaknesses: extremely long classes once a week, lack of critical feedback from instructors, short projects meant not enough time to develop and improve based on feedback from peers"

                "I would highly recommend this class! Through the weekly projects (which truly are as much work as you wish to put into them), you'll glean a lot of insight into the ideas you find important - even things you haven't realized about yourself previously, thanks to connections that the professor, TA, and your classmates pick up. You'll be able to appreciate the relation between words and pictures that surrounds you, as well as the way it subconsciously affects you, from multiple interesting perspectives. Best of all, you'll get to make art every week and call it work!",
                "Yes! I would recommend it to any non-art major who wants to take an art class. It didn't require much technical skill, just dedication and creativity.",
                "Yes! Really chill class where you learn a lot but also get to make a lot of cool art",
                "Yes I would recommend this class to another student, even if you are a STEM major!! You get to learn a lot about the things that we see everyday and work on really fun and engaging projects. Also the professor is so amazing and excited about any work you turn in.",
                "Yes, if you are self directed and willing to take time out of the class to develop visual thinking skills on your own. Projects are as meaningful as the work you put in, which you must be extremely dedicated to, or else it may get lost amidst other coursework."
