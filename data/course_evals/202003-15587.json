The strengths of the class were definitely the speaking tests, I think preparing for those really improved my Spanish."

While the class wasnt especially difficult, it did require discipline to complete the daily online assignments which would take anywhere from 25mins to an hour per day depending on the difficulty of the work that particular day. In addition there is usually either a test, a speaking recording, or a partner project due once a week, with some weeks having combinations of the three. Planning ahead will make this very manageable but worth noting. Being genuinely interested in learning Spanish will make the class much more enjoyable and much easier."
