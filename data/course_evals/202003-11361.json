Further, I learned how to replicate data in other studies that I see, by downloading and creating a set of code for myself to test the results. I also honed skills in listening to presentations and being able to best respond to tough questions as well.",

I became more comfortable reading and understanding economic papers on a wide variety of topics. The opportunity to present a paper of choice as well as our own senior essay progress was extremely valuable. I really developed my presentation skills.",

                "It was tough not being in person, it definitely would have added a lot to the presentations. That said, the course had very great strengths with minimal weaknesses. No busy work (light week to week), but the work that was given was engaging and enlightening. Prof Noguera is really good at engaging with students, providing ample time to receive help, and explaining concepts in pretty easy to reach ways. It does assume a pretty rigorous memory from Metrics, so I would brush up on that material. The student presentations were engaging and a good way to keep the material intersting. FWIW, I think the students should have to sign up for a presentation date earlier in the semester, as its tougher on the people in the beginning.",
                "Strengths: presentations very helpful\r\nWeakness: you have to figure out the psets on your own",

                "Strengths: the professor, the interactive presentation format\r\nWeakness: I think the virtual format made it sometimes difficult for everyone to participate effectively.",
                "There's some interesting content in this course, and it's relatively low work load most of the time, but it is sometimes stressful. For example, we had a problem set and midterm within a week of each other, and many students also had presentations in those two weeks, which meant that up to 80% of our grade was dependent on two weeks worth of material -- which can be a challenge around midterms. Professor Noguera is very helpful and available.",
                "The strength of this course was being able to read papers, break them down, and discuss how effective they were.\r\n\r\nFor improvements, perhaps, having sample presentations could be a resource to some?"

It doesn't involve you doing any original research, but does give a strong foundation for understanding research that sets you up for the future. Great seminar in that its not too work heavy, but still enough to be engaging, and could be taken as a fifth class. The presentations were also valuable for students going into any field. It wasn't the most riveting course I've ever taken, but it was rewarding and taught me a lot and was more interesting than you would think as generally the students pick interesting topics.",
