                "This class was incredibly frustrating. Our instructor gave completely unclear expectations and then would try to make us feel bad for not prioritizing this class over everything else in our lives. The false sense of care was one of the most infuriating things about this class. It's one thing to have a professor who is rude or condescending, but to have them pretend to care so much while trying to make everyone in class feel bad about their effort is beyond frustrating.",
                "This class was fairly disorganized, and I didn't feel that there was much support for many of the students in the class. Both instructors could be quite rude at times. I wish all advisors were present at least twice during the semester.",
                "Strengths -- having the ability to workshop with peers. Weaknesses -- the course was incredibly unstructured. For a class that was an hour and 50 minutes long, it often felt like we did things that could have been accomplished on our own time or via email. There were several instances where we had \"free work time\" for class, which felt like a waste of having to physically go to the classroom. The structure of feedback was also never super clear. The grading at the end of the day came down to the professor, but the professor would often defer the responsibility of delivering feedback to primary mentors. So, a student and their primary mentor could be on the same page, but if the professor disagreed, the grading would reflect that.",
                "Strengths: There's a lot of built in support from mentors and peers which is super helpful. We got enough time to figure out and personalize projects, but also enough a push to not just be indecisive all semester. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the process felt so structured that it was harder to find what my specific process preferences are. But a lot of the suggestions we got seem to be tried and true, so this wasn't a huge problem.",
                "I think the strength is the instructor, I always felt like we had a structured but not strict class with individual and group work. You could tell people cared about their projects and TZB is amazing!",
                "Weaknesses: TZB. She made this course a really stressful environment rather than a comfortable one. She acted like she was supportive throughout the semester but really wasn't (it showed at the end of the semester when she was suddenly strict and imposed a bunch of consequences on things she said were fine throughout the semester). It is SO obvious that she picks favorites in the class and in the Ed Studies Program, and she doesn't really want to get to know you if you're not one of her favorites. (Ex. she'll smile and joke around with students who are her favorites and change her demeanor and not do that for non-favorites.) She also called our TA\/TF Erica \"bossy,\" which I felt like was rude and uncalled for. She also pressured multiple people OUT of the Ed Studies Scholars Program...why, I have no idea. I didn't get feedback on my assignments and grades until literally the last 3 weeks of the semester.\r\n\r\nTZB honestly sucked out all of the enjoyment from this class and the Education Studies Program for me. This is supposed to be a supportive community but the admin\/faculty leadership in the program (Debs and TZB) are so passive aggressive and unsupportive that it's hypocritical. I know many other people feel this way...I really hope things change for future generations of Scholars!"

                "Absolutely not. I love the education studies program at Yale and am so disappointed by this class. It caused so much stress and confusion among me and my peers. There were no clear expectations and we were always made to feel like anything we did was simply not enough. We were constantly compared to students from other years who had done better or longer versions of their assignments.",
                "No -- only required for completion of EDST Scholars program",
                "Yes! It's a challenging and different opportunity to do a capstone and work with great EDST faculty and peers and do a project that is personally meaningful.",
                "No!!! Not unless you come into the course with a set idea of what you want your capstone to be about! Otherwise TZB will bully you into dropping the program. Again, this was an extremely stressful environment created by TZB.",
                "DEFINITELY recommend doing the capstone. The pace of deadlines is so structured and rigorous that it actually gives you a great scaffold for your thesis in your major, if you're doing a year-long one as well. This class gives you so much more guidance and support than most other majors, but you can transfer the timeline onto your own to keep yourself accountable. And this class teaches you how to do IRB, which is another good skill to have."
