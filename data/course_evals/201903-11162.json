    "The introductory knowledge of Italian was introduced well throughout this course. By the end of the course, I was able to have a basic conversation using multiple tenses.",
    "I learned so much (all the grammar and vocab)",
    "Basic Italian.",
    "This class was an incredible introduction to Italian. By the end of the semester I was pretty good with the fundamentals of the language. More than anything, this class teaches a serious amount of grammar.",
    "I learned a lot of vocab and grammar. My comprehension skills were improved by looking over material bit by bit.",
    "I learned basic italian",
    "This class allowed me to grasp the basics of Italian. I'm able to comfortably hold a conversation in Italian.",
    "Having no previous knowledge of Italian coming into the class, I gained a significant level of proficiency throughout the semester. I learned all the basic grammatical concepts, tenses, etc. in addition to a large amount of useful vocabulary. As a result, I feel like I can quite competently read and write basic Italian. Additionally, due to the daily discussions and presentations, I gained some level of ability to converse in the language. This is definitely the least focused-upon element in the course, but it comes naturally if slowly from all the other work."

   "comments": [
    "Lots of daily work assigned which could be limited. The structure of the course works well, reviewing and discussing the textbook in each class. More practice worksheets would be beneficial.",
    "There was a bunch of vocab which was hard especially because we went through it fast but the textbook we use is really helpful to keep track of everything",
    "Not that much workload. Somewhat annoying exams.",
    "This is overall a great class. I cant think of any weaknesses.",
    "The strength was the productivity and amount of material we were covering in such little time. Weaknesses were having homework, tests, and essays very frequently.",
    "A strength of the course is that it effectively allows students to speak and understand Italian by the end of the semester. However, it is extremely intensive. The sheer amount of vocabulary and grammar that needs to be learned every day can be overwhelming. It would help if we covered less throughout the semester and were instead allowed to dedicate more time to each specific concept in order to grasp it better.",
    "The main strengths of this course were the overall curriculum, the great instruction, and \r\nthe general atmosphere of fun. I thought the curriculum was very well organized for \r\nlearning, with a strong textbook choice and good reinforcement in class. While the pace seemed slightly frenetic at first, with several tenses\/parts of speech each week, I got used to it and really learned a lot. Additionally, Deborah was an outstanding professor who explained everything well (in Italian!) and made class very fun. Overall, the relaxed atmosphere allowed for conversation without fear, and open-ended essays and presentations kept it interesting and fun. The main weaknesses of this course were the WileyPlus online platform and a slightly lower focus on speaking. The WileyPlus was more of a nuisance due to its technical fallibility, and we kind of got used to it by the end, though Im not sure I gained anything additional from it. In terms of speaking, I might take a slightly slower pace grammar\/vocabulary wise to build in specific speaking\/conversation days, almost like the Italian Tables. While I feel competent with Italian after one semester, speaking is definitely the weakest point coming out of this class."

   "comments": [
    "If interested in the language, yes, but be prepared for a decent amount of work.",
    "Yes, it was fun and interesting",
    "Yes, if interested in learning italian.",
    "Yes, the Italian department is great and very helpful. Italian is also a very interesting\/ entertaining language to learn.",
    "I would because Italian is a beautiful language and Pellegrino was a great teacher.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who wants a fun and manageable language course to fulfill the language requirement, especially if they are interested in some portion of Italian culture (like my obsession with Italian cars). Italian is a very easy language to learn, and the Yale Italian department is excellent and a lot of fun. However, the class is not a complete gut as many people would say; it does require determination and daily practice to learn the language at this pace (about 5-7 hours per week for me in addition to class time)."
