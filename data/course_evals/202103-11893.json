                "I think the strength is really the peer tutoring. The peer tutors are very available, helpful, and easy to ask questions to. I also think the assignments and exam structures were good. I would say the main weakness is the variance in quality of teachers. I think it is just super important to shop different sections because it seemed to me that the quality varied a lot among teachers. I think the teachers could also do a better job at publicizing office hours, as well as giving handouts with problems during class that students could refer to later potentially.",
                "Very well structured and organized I think.",
                "Strengths: very well-taught, classes are organized, it's very clear what is expected of the student.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The online videos were excellently organized, clear, and concise. I found them to be extremely helpful in understanding, oftentimes more than the in-person sections.",
                "This course does a great job of explaining the theory behind multivariable calculus. The P Sets are hard and require a strong understanding of the material. However, a lot of your grade is based of complex integration techniques that are taught in previous calc classes and not reviewed. This makes for a steep learning curve, especially at the beginning of the semester. As the semester wore on, I got more comfortable with these techniques, but they remained difficult throughout the class.",
                "Strengths: good curriculum, good problem sets\r\nWeaknesses: okay teachers, weird work requirements\r\n\r\nI'd say the biggest change I would make would be to make the pre-class videos due after the class, not before. Almost always, the pre-class videos would cover exactly the same material as the class itself, so I don't see why they're needed unless you have trouble with the class. Most of the time I didn't need to watch the pre-class videos, because the same material would be covered in class the next day.",
                "The pre-lecture videos were a strength and a weakness. We basically had to watch the lecture content for each week in pre-lecture videos. They were a big burden to watch every single week. They usually took several hours. But I also could not have done the course without them. Whenever, I didn't watch them, I was completely lost in class. Perhaps there is a way to make the videos shorter while covering the same content. I didn't find the video geometric explanations of curl and divergence as good (KhanAcademy had good ones, I think).\r\nThe first week was rough because I didn't realize we had to watch the videos before class.\r\nMost of the sections will be taught be a grad student, so it's really hit or miss with your teacher. This is disappointing.\r\nThe video solutions to the practice exams were super helpful. Also, there was a good amount of review material for each exam.\r\nThe final problem sets after Thanksgiving break were waaaay too long. They took upwards of ten hours and were just a huge jump from previous problem sets.\r\nI did poorly on the first midterm, so I had the option of going to additional tutoring. The additional tutoring was not very helpful. I was able to improve more through spending more time on problem sets and using the class's resources and online resources (Khan Academy and Lamar's notes) to ensure I understood material."

Even if you have taken multivariable before, this class uses difficult problem sets to teach a lot of foundational concepts, so I think it will help you solidify what you know. Even though I had not taken multi, I found it interesting and not too hard.",

I ended up learning a ton this semester and the workload was not unreasonable.",

I liked math going into this course, but now I don't see myself taking many (or any) future math courses. This course is really about the math itself, not any applications.
