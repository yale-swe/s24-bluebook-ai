                "I think the strength is really the peer tutoring. The peer tutors are very available, helpful, and easy to ask questions to. I also think the assignments and exam structures were good. I would say the main weakness is the variance in quality of teachers. I think it is just super important to shop different sections because it seemed to me that the quality varied a lot among teachers. I think the teachers could also do a better job at publicizing office hours, as well as giving handouts with problems during class that students could refer to later potentially.",
                "Very well structured and organized I think.",
                "Strengths: very well-taught, classes are organized, it's very clear what is expected of the student.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The online videos were excellently organized, clear, and concise. I found them to be extremely helpful in understanding, oftentimes more than the in-person sections.",
                "This course does a great job of explaining the theory behind multivariable calculus. The P Sets are hard and require a strong understanding of the material. However, a lot of your grade is based of complex integration techniques that are taught in previous calc classes and not reviewed. This makes for a steep learning curve, especially at the beginning of the semester. As the semester wore on, I got more comfortable with these techniques, but they remained difficult throughout the class.",
                "Strengths: good curriculum, good problem sets\r\nWeaknesses: okay teachers, weird work requirements\r\n\r\nI'd say the biggest change I would make would be to make the pre-class videos due after the class, not before. Almost always, the pre-class videos would cover exactly the same material as the class itself, so I don't see why they're needed unless you have trouble with the class. Most of the time I didn't need to watch the pre-class videos, because the same material would be covered in class the next day.",
                "The pre-lecture videos were a strength and a weakness. We basically had to watch the lecture content for each week in pre-lecture videos. They were a big burden to watch every single week. They usually took several hours. But I also could not have done the course without them. Whenever, I didn't watch them, I was completely lost in class. Perhaps there is a way to make the videos shorter while covering the same content. I didn't find the video geometric explanations of curl and divergence as good (KhanAcademy had good ones, I think).\r\nThe first week was rough because I didn't realize we had to watch the videos before class.\r\nMost of the sections will be taught be a grad student, so it's really hit or miss with your teacher. This is disappointing.\r\nThe video solutions to the practice exams were super helpful. Also, there was a good amount of review material for each exam.\r\nThe final problem sets after Thanksgiving break were waaaay too long. They took upwards of ten hours and were just a huge jump from previous problem sets.\r\nI did poorly on the first midterm, so I had the option of going to additional tutoring. The additional tutoring was not very helpful. I was able to improve more through spending more time on problem sets and using the class's resources and online resources (Khan Academy and Lamar's notes) to ensure I understood material."

                "Yes. Math 120 is really a foundational course. While I am not sure I will keep taking math, I know this class set me up for the future if I wanted to take further math classes. Even if you have taken multivariable before, this class uses difficult problem sets to teach a lot of foundational concepts, so I think it will help you solidify what you know. Even though I had not taken multi, I found it interesting and not too hard.",

There is a lot of talk about how difficult this course is, but once I learned to attend office\/help hours and work with other on the p sets, I was never really struggling. I ended up learning a ton this semester and the workload was not unreasonable.",

I liked math going into this course, but now I don't see myself taking many (or any) future math courses. This course is really about the math itself, not any applications. That said, it was still interesting and there were good resources (I also recommend using Lamar's notes and Khan Academy).",
