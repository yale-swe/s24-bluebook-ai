   "comments": [
    "We learned about various ways politics influenced economic decisions and vice versa. We also learned methods for studying issues in this discipline. The course covered both recent topics and some history in IPE.",
    "I learned about how institutions are organized, and concrete theory and practice that explains why internationally cooperation, foreign aid donation, and more is difficult. I feel like I understand the purpose of international institutions, the cultural and economic roots of anxiety regarding migration and trade, and other really important and relevant issues very well. I think I generally understand a lot more about the world after taking this course.",
    "This class covers topics like cooperation, coordination, trade, immigration, and climate change. It helps put ideas like trade decisions into a more calculated context. Questions that this class can try to answer are: Why is international climate change policy hard to achieve? Who benefits from trade? What is the economic reason for populism? Who ACTUALLY benefits from foreign aid? Why are companies investing overseas? Overall, cool material!",
    "Dynamics in deal making and voter preference aggregation. Relevant to current issues and challenges.",
    "I gained a new set of analytic tools for dealing with international politics and economic situations.",
    "This course prepared me to analyze the political motivations behind international organizations, trade flows, foreign direct investment, and foreign aid. We looked at trade politics and international agreements through the lens of preference aggregation and came to analyze the impact of institutions on policy outcomes on the international stage. Whether learning in the abstract through trade theory and models, analyzing current events, or seeing differences in the application of the ideas we learned about through current and sometimes conflicting research, this class provided a strong framework for thinking about the political influences that affect the international economy.",
    "I developed a better understanding of international political economy, and the way in which economic outcomes affect political preferences .",
    "This course provided us with an understanding of the international political economy framework of analysis, in addition to an introduction into several of the major topics dominating the IPE field today.",
    "A comprehensive look into topics in IPE",
    "This class has provided me a good foundation for understanding IPE and how it relates contemporary politics. It has a good mix of political theory and analysis that can be applied to better understand International politics today. I really enjoyed this class and look forward to taking more classes like it.",
    "You can really use this course as an intro to basic economy principles. I walked in with no economy background, and feel I got a lot out of the course. However, the main objective of the course is to show how economic principles are used in politics to help with policy making, elections, or bureaucratic processes.",
    "I learned how to think about international issues using a political economy approach and how to analyze data in this course; we covered a variety of topics ranging from Climate Change to Engel's Law."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This was a great course. The 10 point grading system was confusing and stressful, but that is just my opinion.",
    "The strengths of this course are that the knowledge covered is really interesting and valuable -- I come out of this feeling like I understand a lot more of the world. The lectures are definitely interesting, the few games we played as a class were definitely engaging, and I overall enjoyed and looked forward to coming to this class. I think there was clear feedback and time to ask questions from the Professor if you wanted it as well. The class was very well-organized, which made learning very easy and straightforward. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I think assignments could sometimes make a little more clear what they want in answers. Sometimes, an assignment would ask \"why is there ____ international phenomenon?\" And if I state, for example, 3 reasons why, there may be a 4th from the reading that I did not identify that I will lose credit for not including. It feels like assignments and answers need to be exhaustingly complete, which creates anxiety that there are many obscure answers everywhere that I would need to find. I think if the instructors were just a little more clear, that would help. Otherwise, finding a way to make lectures a bit more engaging would be fun, because there is definitely room in this material for a bit more discussion and opinion-sharing. This is a very personal opinion, but I also think there could sometimes be some ethical judgments made about material. Sometimes the course points out some really noticeably messed up things about the world without saying \"these things are bad,\" and I do not trust Yale students to have a sound code of ethics so I think students would benefit from hearing some more judgments about it.",
    "Strengths: cool material! this is a very neat field with a lot of interesting research being done!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The assignments are not structured to be easy to answer sometimes. The questions are open-ended, but the answers are based on a rubric--this makes it really easy to lose a lot of points on some of the assignments.",
    "Material is clearly presented and very interesting. The slides are thorough.",
    "The content and syllabus were well-curated and -developed, Professor Queralt was a strong lecturer.\r\n\r\nI'd have liked to see a different model for class participation--days with \"games\" felt like too much of the time was taken up, and otherwise it was easy to never speak. Perhaps integrating small group discussion moments or other less-traditional forms of looking for input from lecture attendees could help.",
    "I think this course is quite strong overall, but due to the fact that so many topics are covered it can be a bit cursory at times. Although the professor does provide additional reading materials and research for each topic, I feel like the course could benefit maybe from going into slightly fewer topics but in more depth.",
    "I think sometimes the economic details were glossed over, but then again it is not an economics course.",
    "The lectures made the course material very approachable, and the professor and TA's always provided clear feedback to facilitate student learning.",
    "All the cause\/effect relationships were taught very well for each topic, however some assignments seemed to cover content we did not directly cover in lecture (required extra research which wasn't too difficult though).",
    "I think having a section for this class would really help with understanding some of the material. The instructors sort of expected us to know certain information even though it wasn't fully talked about in lecture.",
    "The lecture for this course was interesting and engaging. The assignments, however, were not easy to do well on, since the rubrics for accepted answers were quite limited. This could be improved by writing what is expected for the assignment within the prompt or perhaps telling students in class."

    "Yes I would recommend this course. The material is very interesting",
    "Yes!",
    "Absolutely! It taught some really really interesting concepts and had a great instructor! I think people coming out of this class will really benefit from learning this material. This course has a lot of interesting applications and made understanding international policy a lot easier\/more clear for me!",
    "Material-wise, it is very interesting! Grade-wise, it is a standard distribution around a B? Overall, not a bad course! If you're interested in the material, you should take this.",
    "This course is very interesting and I learned much about the inner-working behind trade deals, international organizations, and their theories.",
    "Yes. The content is worth knowing, the material is well-presented, and the assignments are not too heavy. A class unlikely to change your life but worth taking.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students because it had a very good balance between learning theory and real world application of the ideas we learned. The course exposes you to a broad range of research and provides a solid foundation for approaching the international political economy.",
    "I would, if you want to lay the groundwork for political economy, this the perfect class.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student majoring in Political Science at Yale.  The IPE framework is extremely relevant to many topics currently dominating Political Science, and this course provides an excellent survey of many influential works in IPE and Political Science as a whole.",
    "Yes it will help one determine whether or not they are interested in IPE, and make it engaging to all",
    "Yes! If you want to learn more about international relations, this is a must.",
    "This is a particularly great class for any student interested in politics, economic history, and international relations. Even still, the IPE approach is quite interesting and useful for understanding the politics around us, so I think all students could get something out of the course."
