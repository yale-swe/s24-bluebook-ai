Jane's meticulous grammar lessons (using curated textbook resources, authentic text samples, and, most importantly, her own thoughtfully organized charts and note handouts) helped me gain a deeper understanding of the Persian language in a very short period of time. I now have the confidence to approach Classical Persian texts on my own based on the practical reading and research skills we learned and applied in this class."

                "Strengths: Jane's expertise and her ability to teach in an accessible way for all levels; systematic approach to grammar; reading from classical text samples from the beginning; pacing was carefully measured (smooth progression into reading full poems, then a prose piece by the end of the semester); the pace was slower than expected (also perhaps due to student's varying levels of prior knowledge) but in my experience, having the time and space to carefully work through the texts as a class helped me develop a solid foundation;  in just one semester, my grammar and reading comprehension improved more than it did in three years of modern Persian.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The biggest challenge was the early morning meeting time, but it was completely worth it. Also, I think this class could potentially be improved in the future if there was a pre-requisite of some modern Persian, or maybe a basic self-study component before the semester begins (in addition to the script requirement)."
