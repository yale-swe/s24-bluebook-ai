                "I learned an incredible amount about film and video that I did not know before. The course also allowed me to view US history through the different perspective of film, which gave unique insights into historical events that I had not considered.",
                "U.S. history through the lens of film; film types; film styles; Iranian and French films; Barbenheimer misrepresentation / contemporary connections",
                "I know so much more about American history and film analysis.",
                "I learned something about Hollywood and American history or Global history. It's very interesting to combine history with movies. And I realized that almost every movie has related to politics factors, which is one of the stereotypes I learned in this course. And I also know something about cinematography, which is the most attractive part for me.",
                "I learned how the time of when a movie was made deeply affects what is presented in a work of art. The two will always be intertwined, and this course helped me understand the context.",
                "american history through film",
                "Writing skills (this was my first college-level research paper; I'm a high school student)",
                "I loved taking this unorthodox course not offered elsewhere. This course was the most enjoyable, as I have connected with fellow classmates, and shared my interests for films with them. I was planning to take a more traditional course, but the broad liberal arts curriculum of American colleges allowed me to take courses in any disciplines that I might hold interests in. An array of skills developed, including an essay writing skill, thesis writing skills, and note taking skills while watching films, making sure all the little details are captured. These skills are very essential for college, no matter the disciplines, from doing research in Chemistry to proposing a thesis for the final research paper. These skills are invaluable, and are immensely purposeful, and will most definitely give me an edge in my first year of college, knowing briefly what college academic consists of. Coming from Thailand, I found it intriguing to be exposed to American history, not in the traditional sense of scrolling through textbooks and reading Wikipedia, but through the lens of films. The films depicted the cultures and societal norms of the United States at a time it was made. Imitation of Life (1959) was based on the 1950s society, where strict dress codes are still required in most places; men are seen in suits and overcoat with a top hat in many places, and even more so strict on the dress codes in the early 20th century as depicted in Ruggles of the Red Gap film which holds my top 1 favorite film that I have seen until date. The 1960s film such as Woodstock depicted the liberal counter-culture movement, including an array of rebellious teenagers who are willing to go against the societal norms and set their own standards for the future which is present until date such as the ripped jeans, t shirts, and sneakers. Learning about the United States history gave me both moments of uplifts and moments of despair, the end of racial segregation and the end of WWII was by all means great joy, whilst on the other hand, counter-culture movement in the 1960s gave me a sense of despair, and I learned that not all changes in society are all great, as in not all changes promote intellectual growth and innovations such as the invention of TikTok platform observed today.",
                "I learned a lot about film directing, how to analyze films, and the history going on while certain films were created. It was super interesting to watch all different kinds of films from different time periods.",
                "I gain a new hobby which i enjoy to analyze movies that i watch. It is really an introduction of how american history is and i believe people who are outside america can engage with american friends more!",
                "Historicizing movies.",
                "This class greatly differs from my other cinema class because it teaches me something beyond analysing a movie but rather how to appreciate it. I think the phrase life imitates art and art imitates life is greatly applied in this class. This class helped me perceive movies not only as a form of entertainment but also how it represents the society and how it affects them.",
                "Writing and seeing film! For writing, we learn about how to write film reviews, film journals/diaries and research paper about film and history. While seeing films, we also learn about the deeper meaning behind them and escape to those meanings.",
                "This class has taught me how to think critically about the media I consume, namely films, and how they connect with various societal issues. I've learned that every media produced beholds a political stance and is influenced by historical context. This class has also helped my writing and public speaking skills.",
                "I have learned about the growth of Hollywood, from the classical era like Imitation of Life and His Girl Friday to the Blockbuster era like Just do the Right Thing and Hey Mom. From these movies I can grasp the historical relevance to the scenes portrayed in these films.",
                "This course had changed the way I consume media in every form. I have learned to look further than the explicit and ask questions about more than just the story or plot of any text/film. My analytic skills have greatly improved thanks to this course as well."

                "strength: very fun and enlightening. Carlos and TAs are super responsible and nice.\r\nweakness: the workload is too much. When I chose this course the syllabus didn't say we should write about 10 film journals. It's driving me crazy.",
                "The discussion aspect of the course was great, I believe I learned a lot more about my peers and their insights than in any other class Ive taken.",
                "Strengths: Carlos and the TAs for sure... they make film/history so exciting and engaging! Weaknesses: none?",
                "Carlos and all the TAs were all fully devoted to this course. Good lectures, smooth communication, and insightful additional screening. There is little to be improved.",
                "Carlos's teaching style is very good. I also have learnt a lot from the compulsory screening.",
                "The class capacity is too large that someone cannot speak out or express themselves bravely. But that's none of the business of professors and TAs because they always encouraged someone who hadn't spoken to speak at first. And I really appreciate this course gave students a chance to have the Monday Screenings.",
                "The movies being shown were very interesting and thought provoking, and the discussions we had were really engaging. Since a lot of us have never been exposed to U.S. history, it was a little difficult to form a clear chronology in our minds about what we were learning. Perhaps the historical aspect of the course could be condensed more.",
                "i really enjoyed how engaged my professor was because it made me even more engaged",
                "Strengths: Good communication from the instructor, who was willing to adapt as the course progressed.\r\nWeaknesses: The instructor required so much writing and outside work for this course that it wound up taking far more hours per week than anticipated (so much that he reduced the workload by the course's end, which made planning difficult.)",
                "Carlos Valladares's humorous nature, and his willingness to let the students lead the discussions facilitate growth mindset, and made the class all-the-more enjoyable.\r\nPerhaps more academic support regarding writing thesis and research paper in class, as I didn't have the opportunity to access the office hours.",
                "The writing portion was a little overwhelming but otherwise i loved the class.",
                "This film course is different with the other film course I took, World Cinema, in a way that this pushed on a historical direction more, rather than an interpretive approach. The mandatory screening I think was fun, and it allows us to really dig deep and dive into the movies. The big number of class participants might hinder a bit with my ability to ask questions and dive into the historical aspect more.",
                "I think this class is interesting because it really focuses on discussions rather than theories. Thus, this class allows its students to gain unique insights from their peers.",
                "The most notable strength of this course is how there are movie screenings on a separate time from class!",
                "Strengths:\r\n1. All class materials were organized well and easily accessible on Canvas.\r\n2. The professor provided a separate time outside of class for a collective class film screening of the film that will be discussed in the next meeting. This strategy helped class participation and engagement and enhanced my liking of film watching because the screenings were fun.\r\n3. The professor and TAs were kind and compassionate throughout the whole session. They were passionate about sharing their knowledge and helping students improve their work in class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. In my opinion, the classroom in Watson Center was unsuitable for this class due to its small size and large number of students. Additionally, viewing the projector screen from the back rows was difficult as the table inclination was not high enough.",
                "The course helps me so much to understand historipy and politics in a deliberate manner. I have no concerns regarding the course.",
                "This course balances entertainment with intellectual curiosity, creating an environment suitable for discussion and debate. I found the course to be highly engaging, yet I found most of the assigned reading irrelevant in comparative terms with class discussion."
