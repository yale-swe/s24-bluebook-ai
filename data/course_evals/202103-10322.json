                "I was opened up to a whole new world throughout this course and it was absolutely amazing. I discovered writers and artists that I really liked and theories and ideologies that I'll probably be thinking about for the rest of my life. I also improved my writing skills and the way that I thought about writing as a whole through the papers we wrote and the writing guides we used. Listening to my classmates speak and having guest speakers really just made me think about so much. I think I probably did the most thinking in this class compared to any other class I took."

                "The main strength of this course is that it fostered positive class rapport. I felt connected to my peers and comfortable with sharing my insights each class. I also appreciated how we interpreted a wide range of materials, from texts to music to art. One weakness might be that the course structure was at times repetitive. As someone who enjoys structure, I personally enjoyed how we consistently had reading responses for homework and discussions in class. However, I also would've enjoyed classes with different agendas.",
                "A strength may include the inclusive nature of the class itself and the interactive course material. A weakness may be the redundancy in discussions.",
                "The readings were really hard to understand at times and the first few writing prompts were really confusing. It was hard to get clarity on what we were supposed to be writing or how to go about that. Feedback on our writing was really good (and helpful!!!)  and class discussions were especially interesting and engaging.",
                "This course was extremely engaging and I valued every assignment, reading and discussion for various reasons. However, the deadlines were too close for comfort at times and were sometimes difficult to juggle on top of other responsibilities.",
                "Strengths: good selection of paper types to build writing skills, loved the incorporation of music and games into the readings (media selection overall was fantastic), loved that students could make optional presentations about their interests, professor was kind and empathetic\r\nWeaknesses: felt like we didn't have enough time to write each paper",
                "One of the strengths was that we evaluated futurisms through many different mediums, such as pop culture, video games, and art. The course also allowed students a lot of creative liberty in choosing what they wanted to write about/perform. The only weakness was that sometimes the timeline to complete some assignments felt a bit rushed.",
                "The peer reviewing sessions were EXTREMELY helpful when it came to improving my writing.\r\n\r\nOne weakness I would say would be the lack of detail given on the writing techniques themselves, but towards the end of the semester they became more clear.",
                "The course's subject matter was extremely engaging, and I feel as though my writing skills greatly improved. My only qualm was that there was too much material to cover in one semester; as a result, some of the papers and materials felt rushed through when we could've spent more time on them.",
                "I really can't think of how this course could be improved. Possibly more guidance on the essays would be helpful? But the point seemed to be to drop us in the deep end, and that was definitely what happened. We all eventually got the hang of it, and office hours were also helpful in that regard.",
                "I really liked how we discussed each reading pretty well most class sessions. I think at times the readings were a bit dense and I was spending more time reading these articles but getting diminishing returns as far as my understanding. But I think the classes biggest strength was the variety of sources we \"read\". We watched music videos, listened to podcasts, watched some tv show trailers, and obviously read academic texts."

                "I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. This course challenges each student to expand their own concept of the future in order to see that the future is a work in progress; reality can be preprogrammed, and alternative realities/futures can exist. This class taught me to look at the world differently, and for that I am extremely grateful.",
                "I would recommend this class if they were interested in the course topic.",
                "Yes! It's a great writing credit and a very interesting topic. The professor is very supportive and understanding.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. Although it had a lot of work as to be expected with an ENGL 114 course, the content was interesting enough and the constraints of the writing prompts loose enough that I genuinely enjoyed the process of writing each paper. The final project was a lower stress, more freeform assignment that made the end of the semester/class memorable. David was also a wonderful instructor who is highly responsive to students' feedback.",
                "Yes, especially with Professor David de Leon",
                "I definitely recommend this course to students who are interested in pop culture, passionate about exploring social issues, and interested in what the future has to offer.",
                "I would recommend this course. The topics we discussed in class were very eye opening and the writing feedback was extremely helpful. We also has some amazing guest come and join our sessions and we became very close as a class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, as I think it provides an effective foundation for approaching academic writing for students of all skill levels.",
                "This is absolutely my favorite course I've ever taken! The topic material of Other Futures is fascinating, but I will warn you that it gets a little esoteric (I loved that, but not everyone might). The class discussions offer so much space to draw from personal experience, and that lead to them being really engaging for (from what I could tell) everyone in the class. The reading was also very well paced. We covered a lot of ground and moved quick enough, so if you didn't enjoy one unit you wouldn't have it wait too long. It was also a great diversity of materials for readings (music videos, artwork, video games, fiction, poetry, nonfiction, manifestos etc.). The essays for this class (3 essays, two critical analysis of class readings and 1 research paper) were definitely challenging at times. Almost everyone was worried about not having any idea what to write about, at one point or another, but once you knew what to do it was an engaging process. The research paper, most of all, was a great opportunity to really dive in on a single topic that you were interested in. You got to do really indepth research and writing over the course of a month, and you have an end product that you're really proud of afterwards. The freedom afforded to topic selection, for both the research paper and the creative project, was also amazing. I saw papers and projects on topics ranging from Chinese-American food to art repatriation to Lauryn Hill. Take this class if you have the chance!!!!",
                "I would 12/10 recommend this course because the professor is absolutely amazing and every single class session you learn something new. We even went to a virtual reality lab and played video games from the 90s. This is a great class that's not necessarily easy but definitely engaging and worth the work."
