                "Strengths: wonderful professor, fascinating syllabus, light workload, highly engaged class, great feedback on writing.",
                "At its core, this is a literature class, so it is important to keep that in mind. You are reading and analyzing literature, and the assignments (other than the final) are structured in that way. I loved the field trips and the dedication and attention of prof. cadieu. I also really appreciated the flexibility the format assignments could take. Instead of more typical analytical papers, you could do creative writing pictures or glossaries. Also, the field trips at the end of the class to the YUAG and Beinecke were great.",
                "This is a great class. It is interesting, engaging, and fun. Building a train at the end is a great time, though there is minimal structure so you have to organize yourself if you want to make the most of it. \r\n\r\nMy minor complaint would be that the philosophical question of the evil of rail and the responsibility of the engineer is not covered methodically. Pointing such a banality out tends to end discussion and it is not expanded on or challenged. \r\n\r\nAlso, requiring a final paper after working very hard on a final project is challenging. \r\n\r\nBut these are personal points. If you like trains, this might be the best class you take at Yale.",
                "Strengths: interdisciplinary, sharp class that lets you explore a lot of topics in a lot of different ways\r\nWeaknesses: not a weakness but more this class has strict rules regarding lateness",
                "The balance of reading was a bit skewed sometimes, but overall manageable! Also, the professor's policy on make-up work was a bit tough. In general though, this course had really no significant weaknesses! Professor Cadieu had fantastic organization, gave detailed feedback, was a fair grader, and was very accessible for support. The course was also SUPER interdisciplinary, and genuinely has material to offer to any Yale student! 10/10 class!!!",
                "Strengths: fascinating, interdisciplinary. Well organized and received some of the best feedback on my writing from any instructor in college. \r\nImprovements: Zola (the beginning) and the CEID/YUAG part is really fun, but I felt we spent too long (for my taste) on the cultural anthropology of the subways. Also, close reading was fine but it would be nice to focus more on the writers big picture philosophy.",
                "Strengths: The class discussions were really well-guided and the topics of discussion were super interesting. Fun examinations of texts beyond the classroom.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some text discussion felt abrupt and out of place, especially those we spent just a day on.",
                "Professor Cadieu did an incredible job structuring this course. She didn't make the reading assignments too intense, encouraged each member of the class to contribute, and helped us form a community around nothing other than French trains. These seminars never felt like they were 75 minutes, and the questions she asked us to discuss were always super insightful and encouraged us not just to discuss the literature but our own experiences interacting with the various subjects. I never felt that we rushed through the material, which was the first time I had ever felt like that in a Yale class. Each essay we received was marked up in its entirety and with a paragraph of comments at the end, which was terrifying at first, but it was so clear how much she loved this subject and wanted to develop students' writing skills. The only weakness that I could think of is that the reading assignments became a lot longer towards the second half of the class, which didn't give us as much time to dive into the text as the first half, but still great.",
                "Strengths: Most of the readings were interesting, Professor Cadieu is kind and very knowledgeable, and the final project where we make a train was fun! For the final paper, I appreciated that there were many prompts to choose from. I needed this flexibility as having a final paper in addition to the final project was a lot, especially amid my other finals. I also liked Professor Cadieus system of using Calendly to schedule office hours. \r\n2 Minor Weaknesses: The syllabus states that all students should get the same edition for the required course texts. However, I would have appreciated more flexibility in this rule as this would have allowed me, as a low-income student, to get the books for free through Borrow Direct. Borrow Direct had all the required books, but in different editions, so I ended up renting them from the bookstore. I did notice that some students ended up not getting the required editions, and they did not seem to encounter any issues as a result. In the future, it would be great if the rule about getting the same editions could be relaxed to a recommendation. I also thought it was unrealistic that we had readings assigned on the days we were presenting our final projects. We wanted to spend the whole class presenting the hard work we had put into our projects, and all of our time for homework that week was devoted to finishing the projects. We ended up not discussing the readings, so I think it would have been better to distribute these readings to earlier weeks."

                "TAKE THIS COURSE. I am a senior and I can say without a doubt this is the best or the second-best course I have taken at Yale. Prof Cadieu is fantastic - so dedicated, knowledgeable, and kind. This is one of the very few WR credits I have taken at Yale that actually improved my writing, as Prof Cadieu really cares about everyone becoming better readers and writers throughout the course of the semester. The syllabus is amazing and the workload is light, so everyone comes to class having done the readings and ready to engage. We learned to analyze very different types of media and genres, and to make use of all the resources Yale has to offer through classes at the YUAG, Beinecke, and CEID. I had never taken a course in the French Department before, and I found this course was very accessible to non-majors. I even want to learn French now. Choo choo!",
                "Yes! Especially if you like literature, and literature about trains. I usually don't like taking 75 min classes, but the time always seemed to fly by. Like any literature class, there were a lot of readings, and everyone definitely did them and came to class prepared, so be ready to be fully engaged in the class to get the most out of it.",
                "Absolutely. This is one of my favorite classes at Yale. The subject is so niche and so fascinating. The books and films are selected so thoughtfully to explore a wide variety of themes tied to French trains. I loved everything we read and watched and this class changed the way I think about trains and transportation more generally. I also appreciated the excellent field trips to the Beinecke and the Art Gallery.",
                "Yes, it was a lot of fun and very interesting.",
                "Yes! Professor Cadieu is so smart and very dedicated to her classes, and the class taught me a lot about the world!",
                "This course is PHENOMENAL! If you can take the class, I highly recommend it! Absolutely no regrets. The CEID project was SO fun, and all the readings/movies were unique and interesting. I never felt like I was doing busy work, everything fit well into the themes of the syllabus.",
                "Yes, you get to enjoy a literature course/french course by taking one subject (trains) and examining it on many levels. There are fun projects and Professor Cadieu is passionate and a great seminar leader  she asks thought provoking questions and is great and honing your train of thought. The midpoint drags a bit if you (like me) are less interested in ethnology, but the interdisciplinary nature of the projects and latter subject matter very much make up for this. You receive writing feedback thats very helpful and the other classmates (at least for me) were an eclectic and genuinely passionate bunch.",
                "Yes! Professor Cadieu is an amazing professor whose enthusiasm for the topic and for teaching shines through this course.",
                "I absolutely loved this course. Professor Cadieu did an incredible job of structuring the course to improve students' writing, analytical, and close reading skills, and chose really rich texts to explore trains as literary symbols and political tools in France and its former colonial territories. I loved the community that this class formed, and that she specifically selected students who would be able to complement each others' skillsets and interests. We always had fantastic discussions in class, and Professor Cadieu was very thoughtful and helpful throughout the writing process for each assignment. Could not recommend this more.",
                "Yes! It was a fun, interesting, and rigorous course. I especially enjoyed the final project as I love making things with my hands, and this provided a great break from writing. I do feel that the final project could have been much more stressful had the majority of my group not been as responsible as they were and dedicated to ensuring that we contributed equally to the final product. It was honestly the first positive group project experience Ive ever had, but I can imagine that with different people the experience could have been unpleasant. However, I believe that Professor Cadieu is very diligent in picking students for her seminar and assigning students to groups so that they each contribute unique skills to the final project.\r\nOverall, I definitely do recommend this course, but please beware that the reading load is not light. This is also not an easy writing credit, but you will certainly improve as a writer."
