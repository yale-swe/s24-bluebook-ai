It was a very small lecture, which was a great opportunity for the professor to get to know us each individually and cultivate a great classroom atmosphere, but that didnt happen. But, this class was certainly a good one, and Dr. Moyer is a thoughtful, good-natured professor whose interest in the field makes him a great teacher; his desire to be a helpful mentor and make connections with students is obvious and makes the class great.",
                "The course went above and beyond what it promised in terms of the material taught. It partnered perfectly with the lab. My one suggestion is that the assignments, while certainly valuable and pertinent, weren't really connected to specific points in the curriculum (as the prompts were very broad in nature). I would have enjoyed them a little more if they tied in specifically with material that we learned in a certain portion of the class that was taught around when they're due."

                "I do recommend the course. It isnt a gut, and you will learn.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. Of course, the caveat would be the information that was clearly explained by the instructor on day 1: this is not a course on Shark Week, but a complex study of shark biology. If the student is interested and has the background knowledge to understand that, then the course would have my strong recommendation.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. You learn so much about chondrichthyan physiology and evolution, and the class is so fascinating. I took this course concurrently with a human physiology course, and it actually made my other physiology course so much more interesting since you can draw connections between human and shark anatomy/physio. If you have even the slightest interest in sharks, you should take this course because you'll learn so much that will stay with you well after the course."
