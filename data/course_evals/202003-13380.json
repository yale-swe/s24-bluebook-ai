                "I learned a lot about how to conduct political science research and develop hypotheses and research questions, conduct a literature review, and more. Moreover, we analyzed different aspects of women's representation, their interests and issues, and why there are so few women in politics.",
                "Through this course I've gained exposure to research on women in politics and the influence of gender in politics. I learned about the meaning of representation (descriptive vs. substantive), the differences between women's issues and interests, whether gender stereotypes affect voters and women running for office, and the effect of different voting system on the representation of women, to name a few. The greatest skill I've gained from this course was learning how to read and dissect political science researches.",
                "The current state of women's underrepresentation in the U.S. and European governments (especially in the context of the 2020 election), the effect of gender quotas, the obstacles that women face on their path to candidacy. I also learned to effectively read and extract information from empirical polisci research.",
                "I now know a lot about the way the government is run and womens history\/future in politics.",
                "Learned about empirical studies on women's descriptive and substantive representation in government, e.g. the effect of different electoral systems, quotas, and stereotypes on women's electability. I also learned how to structure a political science research paper.",
                "I learned a lot about women's representation and pathways to political office, particularly the barriers to entry that exist for women. I also learned how to critically read and analyze political science papers and how to develop a research design of my own.",
                "I gained an excellent perspective on all angles of women in politics and governance, at all stages of the political process from political engagement to effectiveness in office. Also, I feel like this class gave me a great understanding of how political science research is done, more than any other PLSC class I've taken at Yale (and I've taken a lot!). Prof Aldrich taught us how to use a citation manager like Zotero (which honestly I'm surprised nobody had taught me before), which has revolutionized my research strategies in other classes too."

                "I cannot think of a single weakness. Amazing content, amazing format, amazing assignments! It was a stress-free learning environment where you truly learned so much!",
                "The course is very doable and Aldrich is a very nice grader and very kind in terms of giving us extensions if we need one. She is very understanding as a teacher. The course overall makes you feel like you learn a lot by going through a process of analyzing what are women's interests, different stances on women's issues, then reasons why so few women are in politics. The discussions were nice even though I would've loved to have them in person. However, I think a weakness was that we mainly focused on political science research and were assigned a lot of reading each week that we didn't really end up discussing completely. I wish we had more diversity in the types of reading, and not such a focus on research.",
                "Strength: The discussion-based format is very engaging and the Professor Aldrich is absolutely amazing. She is super welcoming and decimated to her students. \r\nWeaknesses: While the readings were interesting, they were also repetitive and sometimes dry due to the heavy quantitative focus which we at times never got to discussed in detail during the seminar.",
                "Strengths: the readings were always relevant to our weekly topics, and we typically had enough time to discuss the readings in class. The reading & research journals provided a low-stress way to connect the readings with our own experiences and current affairs. Prof Aldrich cares so much about her students and was super understanding throughout the semester. The class research project on the 2020 election (a group project) was actually more fun than I expected. Weaknesses: the course doesn't really have major weaknesses. I would've liked to learn more about designing polisci research, but I understand that we're short on time and this isn't a stats course. The course could also go deeper into comparative politics and focus less on the U.S.",
                "I adored everything this course had to offer. I wouldnt change a thing.",
                "Strengths: Discussion in the seminar was free-flowing and insightful. Professor Aldrich is kind and helpful and she grades generously. I like how she often put our small class in breakout rooms at the beginning of each class so that we could chat with new people. I also appreciated that she had us complete the components of the research paper piece-wise throughout the semester so that we didn't have to stress about a final paper at the end.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: All of the weekly readings were 20+ page political science research papers. This didn't bother me too much but I definitely think they could've been more varied (perhaps mixing in some news articles or videos would've been more interesting). Also, I sparsely received feedback on my reading responses (on most weeks, the professor made no comments), and I would've appreciated getting more feedback. I also think a Piazza forum could've helped the class facilitate communication among the professor and students.",
                "Professor Aldrich is very kind and attentive to students. She is very quick to respond to emails and always willing to meet with you outside of class. I would have appreciated more help reading the tables in political science papers because I don't think I really understand how to analyze them and I rely on the written explanations.",
                "The seminar format that Professor Aldrich was really great and encouraged participation while also ensuring that everyone understood the readings and concepts. The class was accessible to students without much prior political science experience but was still enlightening and challenging (in a good way) for everyone."

                "The course did a good job of encouraging virtual engagement, including 2-minute chats at the beginning of each seminar, small breakout rooms, collaborative discussion notes, group research project and presentation, and peer review. In particular, the group research project provided the opportunity to work closely with classmates without taking up too much time (coordinating between time zones \/ separate meetings, etc.).",

                "Professor Aldrich was really kind and gave us a break on the reading during midterms season which really saved me and gave me some time to think about what we had learned in the course. She also set up a peer review process which I found helpful for our final paper.",
                "Professor Aldrich did a great job of adapting this class to online learning. The use of regular check-ins, breakout rooms (in moderation), peer review, and small group assignments all helped students get to know one another and also made the class more accessible.",
                "Professor Aldrich did an incredible job translating this class to an online format. Seriously--all the other professors should take lessons from her on how to conduct seminars over zoom. On the first day of class, she had us create our own community guidelines for how our seminar would work over zoom, and was very receptive to our ideas. Professor Aldrich started class every day by sending us into breakout rooms with one or two other people just to check in with each other. This was really great, and I felt like it allowed me to actually get to know some of my classmates. When we would have discussions in breakout rooms, we used a class google doc to jot down ideas so that we could highlight what we talked about in all-class discussions later without restating our entire conversations. Since this was a 2-hour seminar, Professor Aldrich also gave us a 5 minute break halfway through, which was much needed and allowed us to better focus for the rest of class. Honestly all professors should be required to do that in zoom classes that are 2 hours long. \r\n\r\nWhile I enjoyed the content of all my classes this fall, this was the only online class that I enjoyed the experience of attending, because Professor Aldrich was very thoughtful about creating a classroom community and structure that worked over zoom."

The course has a reasonable workload with little busy work, the readings are fascinating, and the research design assignment is a great opportunity to start thinking about what makes good research.
