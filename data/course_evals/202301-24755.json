Prof still uses some outdated terminology, though, and the course lacks organization and good communication",

                "nothing- an awesome course that went above and beyond with so many guest lecturers",
                "Strengths - field placements; allowed to pick what interests you for a final paper \r\nWeaknesses - sometimes due dates were unclear \/ paper guidelines",
                "Strengths: excellent range of guest speakers, minimal amount of readings, very open to class questions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Unclear assignment details\r\n\r\nImprovements: Perhaps more on the neurodiversity movement\/debate, more perspectives from individuals with ASD on how they would prefer we address their condition and what changes they want to see",
                "I feel it could be improved by organizing the canvas page, but other than that the format was good.",
                "There was minimal engagement (just a powerpoint lecture) and the lessons didn't connect well.",
                "Enjoyed the structure of the course and the different guest speakers.",
                "Dr. Volkmar is incredible. This class very quickly became my favorite class ever taken at Yale and beyond. He is a genius and has made significant strides in this field of research. He is humble, kind, passionate about the topic, and engaging. I am really going to miss this class, and I am so sad I won't be able to take another class from Dr. Volkmar. Well deserved retirement for him, though! I know he will still continue on to do more incredible things."

You can do as much or as little work for the course as you want according to your level of engagement with the topic. Guest speakers who you would likely not encounter otherwise.",
