Prof still uses some outdated terminology, though, and the course lacks organization and good communication",

                "Strengths: excellent range of guest speakers, minimal amount of readings, very open to class questions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Unclear assignment details\r\n\r\nImprovements: Perhaps more on the neurodiversity movement/debate, more perspectives from individuals with ASD on how they would prefer we address their condition and what changes they want to see",
                "I feel it could be improved by organizing the canvas page, but other than that the format was good.",
                "There was minimal engagement (just a powerpoint lecture) and the lessons didn't connect well.",

He is humble, kind, passionate about the topic, and engaging. I am really going to miss this class, and I am so sad I won't be able to take another class from Dr. Volkmar. Well deserved retirement for him, though! I know he will still continue on to do more incredible things."

You can do as much or as little work for the course as you want according to your level of engagement with the topic. Guest speakers who you would likely not encounter otherwise.",
