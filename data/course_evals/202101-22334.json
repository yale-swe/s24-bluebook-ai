The instructor also did a wonderful job of teaching specific aspects of early modern Japanese society through the documents, especially the social life of Kyoto and its neighborhoods."

I really liked that I wasn't afraid of not knowing things or asking questions which I typically face in other Yale classes. I also appreciated how the course gradually got more difficult, it flowed very well.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in Japanese history and want to continue with language practice. You don't need to be an expert in the Japanese language to take this class. In addition to learning how to read sorobun, you also get a detailed history with personal accounts. There is also an opportunity to pursue your own research interests with the final project. It was a small class and there was so much support.",
                "Certainly! The skills taught in this class are very specific but also incredibly valuable for anyone doing research on Japan from a historical perspective. Prof. Botsman also has a very engaging and animated attitude toward the material, which made the learn all the more affective."
