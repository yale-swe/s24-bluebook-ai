                "This is the only course in the physics major where you really get to develop the skills of being a good experimental physicist. It's not quite like doing actual research, since everything is on a strict timeline and you don't really choose what to investigate, but the basic idea is the same. I learned how to keep a lab book, how to plan out an experiment, and most importantly, how to really sit down and understand everything you're doing. So many times in other physics classes, there isn't enough time to fully understand things and let them sit with you, but in this class a solid understanding of the physics behind the experiment is absolutely essential.",
                "Knowledge about laboratory work",
                "I learned about different modern physics experiments, as well as how to write scientific papers and give oral presentations.",
                "General experimental skills such as keeping an updated lab notebook, performing and conducting experiments, etc. There was an emphasis on writing which is very useful for anyone who plans to continue doing physics research.",
                "A large emphasis on learning scientific writing was emphasized in this course. Relative to earlier lab courses in the physics sequence, this course had less of an emphasis on laboratory or experimental techniques. There was a heavy focus on data analysis and scientific writing.",
                "I learned experimental physics techniques, especially how to check results and not take results for granted. I also learned how to write a report in a coherent and pedagogical manner.",
                "I acquired hands-on experience working in a physics laboratory setting as well as practice writing research style reports."

            "comments": [
                "I think that a lot of the lab manuals are either incomplete or entirely misleading on certain topics. The labs are fun and there is a lot of time to understand what is going on but sometimes the support feels lacking. On assignments there is no clear rubric on how things are graded and everything seems very arbitrary. Even when we tried to make our lab drafts and reports for the later labs better, we would get back a grade that did not seem to correlate to anything. The feedback for formatting style was also not consistent between different members of the teaching staff and that further complicated grading.",
                "It's a really, really good course. You get a lot of individual attention from professors, who are there to guide you through it and encourage you to really understand what's going on.",
                "Very good course. More instruction on data analysis would be helpful though",
                "I think the course lacked a good process for feedback and grading decisions were often unclear. It was difficult to get a sense of what should be done in order to get a decent grade on assignments, and there was no real teaching component beyond a couple mini lectures here and there. This seems fine in a lab course, but this in combination with seemingly incredibly arbitrary grading became increasingly frustrating throughout the duration of the course. Certain labs had much more oversight and assistance than others creating a sort of lack of consistency between them. I think a clear description of the grading scheme in this course would improve it quite a bit.",
                "The only way I think this course could be improved is if we had more time for each experiment and report. Otherwise, this course was amazing. The experiments were really cool, the feedback from the professors on our writing was thorough and helpful and it was overall a great experience.",
                "The course is a lot of work, but there is a lot you can get out of it. The experiments that are available for students to perform cover a wide range of fields of physics and they are all very interesting. I do believe the grading can seem a bit rough at times, but as long as you take criticism well and use it to improve your work this class can be very good.",
                "There is very little actual instruction in the course. You are expected to know how to do lots of things on your own and graded harshly when you cannot meet a certain standard.",
                "One strength of this course was that you get to apply what you learn from various different physics subjects to the same lab, which can be very interesting and a great learning experience. There could be better guidelines conveyed concerning what is expected for assignments, although feedback after they are submitted is pretty helpful.",
                "This course is a lot of work. That is good sometimes because it requires engagement. The professor (Nir Navon) reminded us how fascinating the physics was, which is a great strength of the course. However, one weakness of the course is that if you are sick for some reason, there is basically no way to catch up without dumping work on your lab partner. The partner system is helpful because there is no way to complete all the work on one's own, but the deadlines come so fast that \"making up\" work is falling behind. There is almost no breathing room. Also, the TAs are really hit-or-miss. Some are knowledgeable, engaged, and helpful, and others do not know how the experiment works and really detract from the overall experience. Unfortunately, we had to ask professors and lecturers from outside the course to help us do the experiments because sometimes the TAs did not know what was going on. If not for the outside professors\/lecturers, the course would have totally fallen apart, which is a shame because they have their own work to do and I felt like we were burdening them. That is part of why the TAs not being up to standard really hurt the course.",
                "All of the lab staff were very approachable and willing to work with you to get to the bottom of whatever technical issue you'd be encountering."

It's super useful and directly applicable if you're trying to become an experimentalist (like me), and for theorists, it's an interesting look into what the lives of experimentalists are like. If you like thinking about physics and thinking on your feet, this is a great class for you.",
                "Yes, if you need it for the major",
                "I'm not sure I would, but given that it's a requirement for the intensive physics major it doesn't seem like I would have much of a choice anyway.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This was probably the most valuable course to me in the physics majorwhat I learned in this class I know for sure I'll use in the future. It is essential to learn how to communicate with other scientists, and this course taught me how to do that.",

                "I would recommend it if you have a specific lab topic that is one of the options that you are very interested in. Also if you are required to take it for the physics sequence. However, it is an extremely heavy workload for something that you would choose to take without a strong reason for.",
                "If you are really into physics, I would recommend it. I know a lot of students have to take it for the major. The best thing to do is to get the professor to get you excited about it, and then you will have a good time, even if the work is a lot. It does become kind of dry, but you have to power through it. I don't know how to recommend \"getting a good TA,\" but we definitely had to call in reinforcements (Professor Lamoreaux, who had taught the class previously) from outside the class, which was kind of miserable because the course should have been self-contained. These are just things to be aware of before you take the course.",
