Overall, though, I felt that the class did not teach me anything applicable to modern day business ethics as we spent almost all of the class covering cases that were at least 20-30 years old and did not have any relevant analogies in the present day."

                "The readings are very interesting and an important survey in the world of business law and ethics, however many of them were significantly outdated. Given how much has changed in the recent decade of business, it would be prudent to update the readings to accurately reflect what has been happening."

                "It's not a great class to actually learn about business ethics, but if you want a really chill class where you can talk about it with other students, then the class will be mildly engaging. It's a really chill class and you don't really have to do the readings before class (there are over 100 pages assigned each class) and your final essay is about whatever you want. So it's a good class to take if you want something light.",
                "I would only take this course if you are looking for an easy A. The material is sometimes interesting, but not consistently.",
                "Not really. Prof Landis, while very kind, didn't engage with the students often, gave unclear feedback about the pros and cons of our work, and often repeated questions in the seminar discussion. It was incredibly student-led, and while I'm happy I had engaged peers in the course, it was not enough for me to feel as I learned very much."
