                "I felt like the problem sets were fair but somewhat repetitive towards the beginning of the course. I also thought that the exams were a little bit too short and computational so making a few silly mistakes made a big difference in exam scores. I did feel like office hours and the outside of class support was very strong. Another weakness was the lack of a main text to follow, it would have been very helpful if there were lecture notes made or recorded lectures since there was no central book.",
                "good professor, good content",
                "Its a hard course. Miki does a good job with it, not sure what else can be done to make it easier.",
                "The strengths are Miki's attention to teaching and detail. Her pre-class exercises helped me practice the material; the lectures were clear, engaging, and cogent; and the homework assignments were well-crafted to be good practice without being tedious. One of the best courses from one of the best instructors at Yale.",
                "Strengths: Miki is an incredible lecturer (though a little speedy for 9am). Weaknesses: The exams were vastly different from the problem sets, making it quite difficult to prepare for them. The workload wasn't too bad, but it was deceptive since doing the problem sets was nowhere near enough to learn the content well. It's easy to neglect the class and fall behind.",
                "Miki is a fantastic professor, and the content is really satisfying.",
                "Strengths: So many! Miki goes above and beyond in so many ways to make this course fun and manageable, and you'll learn and grow a lot when you take it. Weaknesses: none.",
                "Miki is a good lecturer, and the course is very well structured.",
                "Strengths: very well taught, interesting and useful homework, accessible course staff\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: built up to one main result (the Galois correspondence), then the rest of the course felt like \"oh and also x y and z,\" never staying on one topic for longer than about a class",
                "Strengths: Miki is a great professor, and classes are quite engaging with a lot of student participation. it also does feel like we come full circle at the end when we cover how to create arbitrary galois groups and do all the casework for intermediate subfields.",
                "It's a Miki class so you know it's going to be taught super well, with a very caring professor. Honestly, take any class you can with Miki, she's one of the, if not the, best prof at Yale.",
                "Lectures were very clear and engaging and the homework was quite interesting.",
                "This class was well organized and there were plenty office hours and review sessions. However, the pre-class component sometimes felt to not be very helpful.",
                "Miki's 370 is well-organized and things are taught one step after the other. The important theorems and results are well-presented in class and reiterated many times during the semester so that students will not feel lost. There are also a few occasions where Miki gives refreshers about results in 350 to help students understand what part of 350 might be the most involved results in 370.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting and fun course material which uses the tools from abstract algebra to prove stuff about cool things like which n-gons are constructible! Also I would argue that it gives better intuition about what groups are/what they are used for, which motivates a lot of the stuff you probably learned in 350. Miki is also an incredible professor and makes the whole class fun.\r\nWeaknesses: none.",
                "I think the course was very organized, and there was a lot of support. I think it would be helpful if you could post your lecture notes, especially because some of them aren't in the textbook. I tried my hardest to take good notes, but sometimes I wouldn't understand things and so I would write things down that were wrong, or fail to notice things that were important. \r\n\r\nSome minor things: A lot of people took 305 and 370 at the same time. The 370 office hours conflicted with 305 class time, which meant a lot of people couldn't come. Also, the only people who are taking this course are math majors who feel that it is important to them. So long as it doesn't conflict with another important math course, we will take it whenever it is offered. I would have much preferred to take it at a different time.",
                "The primary strength of this course is the professor. Miki's lectures are very engaging, and she responds to students questions very precisely and with concrete examples.  The course is also very well-structured, to the point that students understand exactly where each lecture fits into the larger picture of the curriculum. Also, there is ample support for students in the form of office hours and review sessions for exams. \r\n\r\nFinally, a major strength of this course was the problem sets. They were very challenging, but not impossibly so. In general, it was possible to work through at least part of a given problem before having to attend office hours to clear up confusion. The difficulty level of the problem sets was ideal for growth in students' problem solving abilities.",
                "Strengths: wonderful professor, extremely well organized, fascinating content, beautiful math\r\nWeaknesses: can be a bit fast-paced at times, 9AM exams are ROUGH, lectures are very fast, and the class overall can be very time-consuming (depending on mathematical background and general speed with learning new math)\r\nImprovements: don't schedule it at 9AM? or at least make the midterms in the evening?",
                "The structure of lectures was great, with interactive participation included. Also, there was a lot of support from the professor and peer tutor, who were fantastic! The material was very well organized and the progression of ideas made a lot of sense.",
                "Strengths: Super cool topic. Miki is an amazing professor, and you should take any class she teaches. (Also, go to her office hours if you can.) She also chose a fantastic ULA who was an absolute pleasure to work with. There were plenty of review sessions and resources available to at once practice this new material, prepare for exams (you know *exactly* what to study for each exam, unlike in some other classes...), and brush up on stuff from Math 350 as needed. Grading was very fast and comprehensive (no one-sentence comments). Weaknesses: Miki's office hours were all held either right after class or during Math 305, which was frustrating considering I had a daily language class right after this class. As far as the course topics went, they seemed a little out-of-order/arbitrarily arranged, at least while you were going through the class, though it isn't like that made it difficult to learn or anything. Be aware there is quite a lot of work, but definitely not as much as in Math 350 (assuming you took it with Miki)."

                "Its brutal, but if you want to understand the material you will need to put in the work in general. Only would recommend to math majors.",
                "Yes, absolutely. The course requires commitment to be sure; you have to review a lot of Math 350 material during the course if you had forgotten it. It is, however, extremely rewarding. It is a beautiful area of math that answers a lot of questions about polynomials that I had since high school. Also, Miki is a fantastic instructor. Highly recommend.",
                "Yes, if you have the time to put into it and are able/willing to be awake for the 9am. The content is pretty cool. I'm a big Eisenstein fan idk.",
                "If youre considering it, absolutely take it. Truly one of if not the best math courses Ive taken.",
                "In a heartbeat! I have friends who thought they didn't like algebra, but even they had to admit that it was a really cool class! Plus, it's a kind of standard bearer for how abstract math can connect back to more elementary problems, like why there's no quintic formula, or what regular n-gons you can construct with a compass and straightedge---these examples come up in a lot of popular math sources and it's nice to explore them rigorously.",
                "Yes, esp. for math majors.",
                "If it's with Miki, take it.",
                "Yes! It's a very pretty bit of math, and is deeply satisfying, especially once you've taken 350.",
                "YES, it's quite rewarding after having taken abstract algebra and it's a fun and chill class.",
                "Yes!! Take all the Miki classes that you can! She really makes it clear why we are doing what we are doing, as well as the motivations for solving certain things which otherwise can be pretty obscure in mathematics.",
                "Yes, this class is a great introduction to Galois theory.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in polynomials and field theory. This class also opens up some other algebra related classes.",
                "Definitely to anyone who has taken 350, even if they didn't take it with Miki. I did 350 three semesters before 370, yet I find Miki's 370 still very accessible because Miki will tell you what theorems from 350 are most likely to be used and you will not be too pressured to go back and review everything from 350. Also, 370 is less abstract and tedious than 350 in that everything is very natural -- once you understand the theorem you will be able to get the answer within a few lines without too much calculation, and field extensions are something easier to visualize than group structures. I think many things from 370 are cool and interesting to learn (for example, why some quintic equations have no radical solutions while all quartic ones do).",
                "Definitely! If you've taken 350, take this class. I thought it was really fun and more intuitive than many other math classes, and it was cool to see how techniques/knowledge from 350 actually came in handy! Also, the workload is manageable -- psets are not too bad, and the tests were very fair (with Miki at least -- take any class with Miki).",
                "Yes, if you feel like you have a very strong group theory (350) background. I struggled sometimes because I missed things from group theory that were important.",
                "Yes, particularly if the course is taught by Miki. The course is an excellent sequel to MATH 350, to understand some of the more interesting and concrete applications of abstract algebra.",
                "Yes, it is a wonderful course covering interesting material. It is taught excellently with great student support.",
                "Absolutely! Miki is WONDERFUL, the math is quite beautiful, and the class is extremely well organized. I found the lectures to be very fast, but I'm also a slower thinker than most. This is definitely where all the grinding of 350 pays off.",
                "Definitely, especially if Miki is teaching it! Like MATH 350, it is a lot of work, but it is really rewarding and the support from Miki is super helpful. The material is really interesting and fun to work with.",
                "YES. Galois theory is really fun, and applying all the group theory and ring theory you learned in 350 to it really helps you bolster your understanding of all three of these things. Also, you should take any course Miki teaches. I might not recommend it if you wouldn't have much time to devote to this course; while it's less work than Math 350 with Miki was, it's still quite a lot."
