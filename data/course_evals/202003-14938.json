                "Throughout the course, I developed a working knowledge of South Asian diasporic history, mostly within the context of the United States, although the South Asian diaspora within a few other nations was briefly discussed as well. Throughout the first half of the class, we learned about the processes of racialization as they pertain to South Asians within the United States and the ways in which the racial definition of South Asian Americans has changed significantly throughout the history of the United States. We also explored the different ideologies and thinking processes that had travelled with South Asians to the United States, such as the Indian nationalism and the theme of antiblack racism within the South Asian diasporic community. Towards the latter half of the semester, our discussions became centered around predominantly cultural aspects of the South Asian American diaspora, although the ideas of class and caste within the South Asian American diaspora were also major discussion points. I personally learned how to read and digest information and dense theoretical frameworks from academic journal articles within the context of racial and diasporic theory. Since this was the first seminar I had ever taken, I also personally learned how a seminar works, and I developed the skills and comfort level necessary to participate in a seminar discussion.",

                "Strengths: well-organized; diverse set of topics and types of text; interesting and important content, taught in a logical order; relevance to today\r\nWeakness: the course could be improved by providing a bit more guidance for the more dense academic readings, perhaps highlighting specific quotes or passages to direct our attention to and guide our reading\/ understanding of the paper.",
                "The readings were exciting and engaging, and Sasha did not assume prior knowledge, so all of the class content was super accessible!",
                "Sasha gave detailed feedback for all assignments in the course (including response papers!) and thoughtfully engaged with our thought processes, personal and academic backgrounds, what we hoped to gain from the class, and our journeys within the class. I felt that the grading system ensured that I  was challenged enough to always strive to produce my best work and go out of my comfort zone (class presentations, workshopping final paper, incisive grading comments which challenged me to go beyond superficial thought) while having the scaffolding and support I needed in order to not feel overwhelmed. \r\n\r\nI thought that the organization and structure of the syllabus was great; we were exposed to so many abstract social theory frameworks that were grounded  in tangible concepts that we were studying. We also had discussions about ways to add to the syllabus (ex: by covering diaspora in the Caribbean), which I thought was really interesting. Sasha also did a great job of referencing previous class material and reiterating broader themes of the class throughout the semester. The environment of the class was also conducive to creating a friendly, connected class environment despite the challenges of this virtual semester.",
                "Strengths: Each seminar delved deeply into the topic designated to that week, whether it was due to insights from the instructor or from a fellow classmate. As such, discussion was usually rich and engaging without much bland conversation in-between. At some points, it truly felt like we were \"making\" knowledge. To me, the material was captivating and actually interesting to read and engage with. The instructor also assigned relatively short reading responses that I believed were helpful; we were able to choose which weeks' readings to respond to, and they only constituted a small portion of our overall grade. They essentially acted as a low-stakes means for us to improve our writing skills.\r\nWeaknesses: If you have no prior experience with racial and diasporic theory, the introduction to the class is quite jarring. While the instructor did provide support in analyzing the assigned academic readings, there is definitely still a large adjustment period when it comes to digesting academic journal articles pertaining to the class and its inclusive themes. I also found that the class did not cover (or brushed over) some parts of South Asian diasporic history that pertain to the United States, but it seems to me that this was the trade-off in electing to explore other aspects of South Asian American diasporic history in-depth."

Discussions do not flow as well, and there were times that we would have long silences during seminar as people tried to form coherent comments and responses, especially if our readings for the week were dense. That said, Sasha did a good job of leading discussions and helping to keep the conversation moving with questions, context, and references to quotes from our readings. Overall, the course was well organized for a virtual environment, as we had a good mix of whole-class discussions, small-group breakout rooms and activities, and student-led presentations, which worked well over Zoom.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I am an American of South Asian descent, yet I knew so little about the history covered in this class. The course was well-organized to facilitate learning and understanding, and it also felt personally relevant and relevant to current events. The topics of the course built on each other but were very diverse, so even if someone was not particularly interested in one week's topic, the next was sure to be more interesting to them. Even for non-South Asian students, this course provides such important content to expand a student's understanding of American history, immigration, and experience, beyond what is taught in general \"American\" [colonizer] history courses.",

I am seeing my own South Asian community at home in such a different light know that I know our specific history and have the language to talk about South Asian migration. The class is also very accessible, so prior ER&M or AMST experience did not seem to be required!",
                "Yes! To anyone who is interested in South Asian American Studies\/Asian American Studies\/ER&M\/social theory\/a lot of other things! I think that the class really served as an excellent intro to more abstract social theory or cultural\/transnational feminist analysis to me because so much of the more abstract theory we did was grounded in tangible events\/concepts relating to the diaspora. Class environment\/feedback was great and it was challenging but also supportive!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who has a vested interest in the material or is themselves a product of the South Asian diaspora. With regards to the vested interest, I believe that if you are not interested in the South Asian diaspora or diasporic theory in general, then you really won't have the best time going through the readings and engaging in discussion with the class. I think a class of this sorts is important for South Asian diasporic subjects to take because of the important societal themes that are contained within the syllabus (e.g. race, antiblackness, cultural ideology, caste through the diaspora). Taking a class like this provides a means of conversing with others who are of similar nature or have a vested interest in the field when it comes to the role that South Asians have to play in the future of the United States, and the West in general.",
