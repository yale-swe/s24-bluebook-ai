                "This course taught me so much about evolutionary perspectives on a lot of subjects in biology and medicine. It provided a different lens, which I found to be extremely useful. Professor Stearns also teaches you to look at the bigger questions, like why diseases exist.",

                "I developed an understanding of what the field of evolutionary medicine entails by grasping applied concepts from evolutionary biology and learning about new problems and solutions in medicine. This pushed me to draw interdisciplinary connections and think of creative ways (and sometimes creative experiments) to answer outstanding questions in the field, especially with Professor Stearns's tough lukewarm call questions during class. In addition, the course trained my data analysis skills. Because each seminar had a required scientific paper to read, I learned to parse dense data figures and discussion sections, thinking about the merit of the experimental design even if a paper were written for a field I may not know much about. In addition, the course also trained me to become a more independent scientific thinker, since Professor Stearns set up the class so that we each researched a topic of interest for certain reading responses and a much larger cluster of topics of interest for the term paper.",
                "The class focuses on the role of evolutionary forces on various fields in medicine (cancer, aging, immunity, among other topics). They are very fascinating and the readings chosen are truly outstanding and worth reading. I learned a lot in this course that will certainly shape how I think about medicine moving forward."

                "Watching the lecture before seminar was really important to have a productive discussion and to be able to ask questions on material we didn't understand. It is also the one of the only science seminars at Yale (it may be the only one), which provide a unique opportunity for learning, and to become acquainted with the professor and other students in the class. I think in science classes especially, this is hard to come by. The only weakness was the time it takes to answer all the responses, but I think it is important to take time to think about what we've just watched\/read so I don't see a way around that. I honestly don't think this course could be improved.",
                "The strength of the class was that it was already formatted in a way that made the shift to online learning much easier. The class meetings were live and every student participated in every single class. Because there were 2-3 short responses due for each class, everyone was always well prepared for discussions in class. This course covers a lot of topics that are extremely relevant today and are incredibly interesting. The only thing that could help more would be having more instruction for the semester paper.",
                "The discussions that we had during class were a strongpoint of this course. These discussions pushed students to think differently or defend their points, and students got to hear from each other regarding the ways we thought about different topics. It was really fun.",
                "The strength of the course was, hands down, Professor Stearns, our TA Maddie, and the people in the class.  Professor Stearns and Maddie were great conversation facilitators and encouraged us to talk about questions that interested us, which I really appreciated. My classmates were always optimistic, ready to talk about science while taking time to care about how we were doing, and interesting, with helpful contributions and extensions during discussions. The course had a high workload, but it was approachable especially considering that Professor Stearns had cut down the number of reading response prompts and also made accommodations during elections week. The only \"weakness\" I could see from the course wasn't even really a weakness: I wish we had longer seminar sessions because our conversations always lasted up to the end of class and were cut short. Although I started off the semester a bit confused about the necessity of discussion section given the seminar format of the class, it proved to be a blessing when term paper deadlines rolled around.",
                "Strengths: One of the best professors I have ever had at yale; very clear outline of the class format; thought-provoking discussion. Everybody in the class cared about the material and nobody came unprepared because of the flipped classroom style. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: quite a bit of work to prepare, but I didn't mind because it was definitely worth it"

                "In other courses, lectures over zoom can be very boring and often repeat the info in the textbook. This course already moved the lectures online and had them as part of the homework for each class, allowing for synchronous class time to be used for discussion. Breakout rooms were used every class to allow small groups to discuss a question to then later share with the group. Over zoom, it was also easy for students to share articles they found related to the topic and share figures from papers that were relevant.",
                "Prof. Stearns worked hard and early to ensure that this class was adaptable to online learning. His hard work paid off because I didn't feel at all phased by our learning environment during the pandemic. I particularly appreciate the flipped classroom and use of FunRetro to answer questions.",
                "Professor Stearns had already started the flipped classroom format prior to our year, which came in handy this year too. I of course wish I had taken the seminar in person, but at the same time, I don't think that Zoom compromised quality of discussion. The seminar utilized breakout rooms of 3-4 people to encourage small group discussion on complex questions, as well as full seminar discussions in which representatives from each group were asked to summarize the discussion; I felt this was very well executed on Zoom, and Professor Stearns moderated the conversation in a way that engaged everyone even for the people who weren't representatives.",
                "Enjoyed: Teaching was fantastic and very well organized; Liked the breakout rooms because each person had something insightful to bring to the discussion.\r\n\r\nRoom for Improvement: I liked the 'what was difficult' and 'what was interesting' columns that everybody would add to during class, but I did feel like this might have been more effective in-person because I thought sometimes it was a bit awkward and nobody spoke during that time. But once we started going through the questions, it was really interesting and opened up the discussion a lot."

While the workload was high, I found that the work done in this course was very worthwhile and I learned quite a lot. There wasn't any busywork.",

Unfortunately, this is the last time that Prof. Stearns is teaching this class, but I will still be raving about it to anyone who will listen. Hopefully another E&EB professor can teach a similar class in the future.",
                "I would, if only Professor Stearns were teaching the class again... THE best course I have taken at Yale. No question.",
                "Yes 1000% yes. There are only a handful of classes that really leave that lasting imprint and this is one of them. It opened up my eyes to a whole new perspective in medicine. Addresses a lot of the questions I feel like I had about medicine as well -- what is are possible long-term solutions to antibiotic resistance; why do we have allergies?; are humans still evolving and how does that shape medicine; why are genes that have negative effects (esp in old age) still selected for? etc. Really interesting stuff.\r\n\r\nI know it will be taught by a different professor in future years, but from what I've heard the professors in evomed are all outstanding. Plus the material in itself is so rewarding and the field really is at the cutting edge of medicine. I think the class will be just as great."
