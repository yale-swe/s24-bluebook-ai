It is really good that in this course you must and get to speak a lot because it helps develop your fluency a lot. A weakness is the reading workload because there can be anywhere from 10-60 pages of reading (of various difficulties), but the amount is so high that it can be hard to get it all done.",

I feel fluent in a way I didn't before taking this class, and my vocabulary has expanded a lot, not just from what we learned in quizzes but also passively from readings. You get out of the class what you put into it. The workload is very reasonable, especially in proportion to how much it teaches."

Most of the class time is spent on group discussions. If you usually like to sit back and let other students answer questions, you're going to find yourself put on the spot a lot. At first I found this to be pretty nerve-racking, but it really does help with fluency."
