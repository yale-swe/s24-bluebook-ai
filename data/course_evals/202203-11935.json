I also learned a lot about AI and robots from this course oddly enough, but most importantly I walked away with a deeper understanding of how the world and our mind works.

                "Discussion aspect of the course was great, as were the presentations. It would have been nice to have more formal presentations on final papers (where students could take turn presenting without being interrupted)",

                "Yes! if you want a really compelling class take it! But I will say you do have to put in some work into understanding and really doing the readings and you have to put in a lot of editing work in your reading responses because they have to be 200 words which for me was always a challenge as the readings gave me lots to write about.",
