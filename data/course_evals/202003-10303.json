I gained a lot of new insights into comedy studies, and I feel like I'm going to be even more well equipped to analyze culture. I learned theoretical approaches to comedy and some relevant histories of US comedy.",

                "strengths: variety of content each week (readings usually paired with a video\/movie\/etc), Prof. Laguna's support and help throughout the semester, fun content; weaknesses: none",
                "I really enjoyed the flow, the consistency of the work, and the vibe.",
                "Strengths: This class used a variety of media, which was really helpful in an all-virtual semester. The readings were never overwhelming; they were always very doable and interesting. The assignments were doable and interesting. Prof Laguna did a good job of creating a comfortable class environment, where we could feel comfortable just chatting or coming to him whenever we had a problem.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was rarely time for the entire class to engage the material. The bulk of the class was spent in small groups, and there was never enough time to regroup after. I think a break in the middle of the class would have been quite helpful as well. It became very hard for me to stay engaged by the end of the two-hour class, just sitting at my computer. A three-minute bathroom\/stretch break would have been really nice. The grading was also not super transparent; we never received discussion grades, participation grades, or grades on our presentations, so it was hard to know exactly where we stood.",
                "Professor Laguna is a really kind and caring professor, which is great during covid especially. Although he did start out the year with hefty assignments (like weekly responses) he toned these down over the semester as he saw how engaged we were even though the class was virtual.",
                "No weaknesses. The class is organized fantastically for student learning and class engagement. 10\/10 class.",
                "The range of course material and readings was a strength: we read theoretical texts and novels, watched films and standup specials, and also saw a live performance.",
                "Like a lot of ethnic studies classes, Race and Comedy has some weeks for different minorities (e.g. Asian Am comedy week, Latinx comedy). I would have liked to learn about Indigenous comedy. The biggest strength of the course is that it's just interesting--pop culture is just interesting and it's therefore super interesting to academically study pop culture. This is huge for me too--the syllabus is really well-weighted, meaning there aren't two assignments that constitute 85% of the grade like a lot of seminar classes have (e.g. final paper will be worth 50% of the grade). It gives you a lot of room throughout the semester to do well. Laguna is very accommodating and it's obvious that he knew how hard the semester was for basically everybody because he modified our final assignment in our interests. He also did a good job picking people for the class (I think it's fairly selective since the topic is clickbait-y not in a bad way). People had thoughtful takes and were willing to participate over Zoom. As for weaknesses, I think it was unclear how we were doing in the class at any given point. But then again you could just go to office hours and ask him, I guess.",
                "It was refreshing to have a good reading load with films to balance out other reading courses I was taking.",
                "Strengths \r\n- Appreciated the weekly response post to readings. because they were due the night before class, they helped me gather my thoughts in preparation for discussion and develop my understanding of whatever element of the homework that I was most personally struck by. \r\n\r\n- Class discussions were always enriching, largely because the material itself was so fascinating. We covered a large amount of material, but i never felt that we rushed through anything. \r\n\r\n-Guest lectures were amazing, even given the Zoom constraints. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-Sometimes felt that the professor couldve connected the various weeks better, tying together topics that were not on their face interrelated, in order to develop a more coherent narrative.",

Don't be afraid to disagree with others in the class, including Prof Laguna, and don't be afraid to assert yourself. I think that's the most important thing I could say. If we think of our classes as providing useful frameworks and tools for the way we approach the world, then we don't need to agree with the class or professor 100% in order to get something out of it. (this goes for all classes)",

There is a place for everyone in the class, whether you come in knowing very much about one of these topics and little about the others or just being curious about all of them with no prior background knowledge.",
