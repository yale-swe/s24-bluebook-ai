                "The content was interesting and the sections were great. However, the psets varied tremendously in length and difficulty. One of them took maybe three hours, while there was another pset that took easily 40 hours and came out of nowhere (both across 2 weeks). Additionally, lectures were taught at a level that felt well above that of the course. By the middle of the semester, I would get more confused going to lecture than just trying to read the content in the textbook/lecture slides. One final critique was the lack of instruction in R/Phython - the psets expected us to use them without any instructions whatsoever, and learning how to do so alone was very time consuming and inefficient.",
                "lecture notes are wonderful, yusuke is well rounded and the ta bennie is superb\r\nthe lectures could be a lot more engaging though.",
                "The course serves its purpose well as a survey of probability and statistics for economics. The lecture notes are clear and well-organized. To improve the course, I think it would be helpful to have weekly problem sets that cover two lectures of material each rather than problem sets due every 2-3 weeks.",
                "Strenghts: lecture slides are great, thorough enough to be helpful, and short enough to not feel like a textbook; the professor is organized and often does quick breaks for questions; TA Bennie is excellent, especially his review slides; the material is a good mix of theory and applications; I enjoy the (extremely) long psets about once a month, make sure to start early\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it can be fast-paced if you have no prior knowledge of the material, so beware",
                "Strengths: Clear bounds on what the material is with relevant application, lots of instructor support\r\nWeakness: it's challenging, you're going to have to do some work on your own, namely reading the textbook",
                "Strength: the textbook is very good, TA is super helpful, problems in the Psets are very helpful to gain better understanding, midterms and finals are set to reasonable difficulty levels, coding section in problem sets are very useful and helpful.\r\nWeakness: the pace of lectures are quite uneven, lectures could be more engaging, variables in the lecture slides can be labeled better. I dont understand a lot of things from the lectures, I study most of the content by reading through the textbooks by myself.",
                "I think the material covers a lot of ground and ultimately gives a mathematical foundation of statistics. As such, I felt like I had a solid understanding of fundamental concepts by the end of the course. I think a more standardized/thorough walkthrough of necessary coding techniques would have been helpful.  The course was also sometimes so grounded in the math that it felt hard to naturally apply the concepts.",
                "Strengths are that the course is well structured and the problem sets weight much more compared to other classes. Weaknesses are that Yusuke is a really nice professor but could be more engaging in his lectures. The pace of this class is also incredibly fast.",
                "I may have preferred longer problem sets, as I felt I could have used more practice with some concepts especially the applications using R.",
                "The theory was not explained that I felt was super conducive to learning all the information. And the coding felt like separate part of",
                "Strengths: the content is clear and friendly to various studying styles: if you go to every lecture, you'll do well; if you just learn from the textbook and notes, you'll also do well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the material can feel a bit overwhelming for students who haven't had stats exposure before. For example there was a spike in difficulty after the first pset, and we had to put in a lot of effort to overcome that."

I now feel more confident taking future s&ds classes, having worked through the basics with this class. For econ & math majors, I think it's really worth it to pay attention in 135 and learn the material well."
