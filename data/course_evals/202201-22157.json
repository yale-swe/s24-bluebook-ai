                "Gained knowledge about past life on Earth! Cool stuff. Skills were maybe a bit more general skills that you might gain in any lecture class - when to ask questions in lecture vs. when to save them for later. Also extrapolating lessons from the past to the present, like a history class, but expanding lessons to not just ones from human history. I like that this class was more holistic in its scope and not so anthropocentric like most of learning and the world is.",
                "I learned about the history of Earth's life, key species, evolutionary patterns, the geological timescale and what defines each period, and trilobites.",

                "I came out of this course feel not that I learned more about subjects I have known for a while, but that I have entire new types of knowledge and ideas. You learn everything from cambrian fauna to ecological statistics to whale evolution. This course has changed how I think about the world and will stay with me for a long long time.",
                "The whole history of life. Fossil analysis. All sorts of disciplines in paleontology that I never would have known about otherwise.",
                "I gained an understanding of the incredible scale of time and life our earth has undergone.  What a wonderful perspective for any person dealing with the silly realities of our present.  I learned about the qualities and processes of fossilization, the vast knowledge remaining to be discovered, and the even greater history which might never be understood.  Life is perfectly imperfect.",
                "History of life and how certain organisms developed and evolved.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the lecturers (Celli and Derek) were pretty good at lecturing and explaining concepts compared to other lecturers I've had. A lot of the figures were quite informative; I really liked that a lot of the slides were figures and pictures of cool stuff like fossils. Another strength: the subject matter.\r\nWeaknesses: the audience was a bit dead lol. Also, there were some concepts that weren't explained super well (and that I'm still not sure I totally get), like facies and the different types of fossilization. Oh if you don't take the lab that goes with this class, the first half of the course will be considerably more challenging; I didn't take the lab and often felt like I was missing info about fossilization, ancient clades, etc. that others had gotten during lab.\r\n\r\nImprovements: having a lecture hall with windows would be nice",
                "This course was amazing!!! Lectures were really clear and interesting and \"lab\" days where we saw collections were incredible. I learned so much and it's so interesting learning about species and processes that existed before us. Strengths were definitely the professors and weaknesses were the office hour\/section situation. There were no real office hours, only sections where we could ask OH questions, so in practice there were no OHs.",
                "This course is good in that it follows a clear and concise curriculum. Lectures, however, are not always super engaging. I did appreciate getting to see the Peabody collections!",
                "The exams are grueling and arduous - I did more writing during my HoL exams than I did for the entirety of my ENGL 114 course! Aside from that, there really aren't any complaints that I have. The course is well structured and enjoyable, not very stressful, and fascinating.",
                "I think the course was largely perfect. I learned so much in a largely stress-free environment, I can't ask for much more. My one improvement would be final exam length. The final was three hours long and my hand didn't stop moving once in those three hours. You come out shaking your arm and are afraid your wrist might fall off. I know something has to distinguish the final from the midterms, but maybe designing it to take 30-45 minutes less would test just as much and not give instant carpal tunnel to every student in the class.",
                "Love the bisected teaching. Assignments were grate. TFs were great. I do wish that Hull had assigned more literature reviews instead of textbook chapters.",
                "I liked the split professorship.  It provided a neat rhythm to the semester and it was so wonderful to get to know two kind experts in the field.",
                "The lab days were very engaging and provided a hands on learning opportunity to apply what we learn through lectures. They were very well thought out and executed. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
                "I thought that the lecture material could be a little dry at times, particularly in the first half, but overall enjoyed the lectures. It would have been helpful to have the slides available before all the lectures instead of just some of them.",
                "Great!",
                "The course was well taught and the lectures were very engaging. I thought that the level of work was great as well. I thought it could be improved with more structured sections. As it was, we showed up and completed labs but otherwise there was not a lot of support.",
                "I think a strength is the depth of knowledge presented in this course. However, I think the course sections could be more structured to review material. Often, I feel like section was not a well-thought out time period.",
                "Strengths:  interesting lectures, good feedback from TAs, and interesting labs.\r\nWeaknesses: needs better communication.",
                "It's just dreadfully boring. The grading structure is unclear and the TA's were not always helpful - mine gave me incorrect info during a review session which she stood by and then shrugged it off when I provided the answer on the exam and got the question wrong.",
                "Strengths: Celli and Derek are both strong lecturers. \r\nWeaknesses: It was hard to know how to prepare for examslectures were sometimes so full of content and new organisms\/names\/ideas that it was difficult to know which were relevant for upcoming assessments. Derek particularly emphasized names and facts, so I'm not sure I'll end up retaining the information he taught me just because there was so much content and I wasn't always clear on the important themes to know. Celli, on the other hand, emphasized themes through the history of life that helped me organize the facts I learned both chronologically and thematically. I almost never received real feedback. Also the essay was incredibly frustratingI wrote one about the Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert, and read the entire book for the essay, but then the prompt had almost NOTHING to do with the book so I had to conduct a ton of my own research on top of reading the book. The professors should absolutely put more thought into how they are assessing their students.",
                "This course covers a wide range of topics and is extremely interesting, the lab days also offer an amazing opportunity for us to see the specimen we are learning about. One thing this course could work on is better organization for what we are expected to know for the midterm.",
                "Strengths: awesome professors who were both incredibly kind and also great at teaching! I felt like they explained things really well and their lectures were cohesive and informative, with great PowerPoint slides that enhanced the lectures, but didnt have a ton of text so that they were just stating word-for-word what was on the slide. Instead, it was shorter, paraphrased text, or a title and pictures, which I really appreciated. The information was very interesting, and I liked having the two halves of the course, which were connected but also different (paleontology focus and paleoecology focus). And like I said, the professors were super duper nice. Sections were also great because they didnt feel extraneous at all! We did meaningful activities in each one that actually advanced my learning, rather than feeling like they were assigning work just to fill up the time. The labs were also awesome, even though I was only able to do one in person. Really cool to see specimens up close and to apply what we were learning to these great finds from the museum. Also very accommodating with online versus in-person if people were sick, as all lectures were recorded, and the labs were digitized as much as possible. Really helpful as someone with a chronic illness!!!\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it was a bit confusing which readings we were supposed to do for which class, since they werent on the original syllabus. There was a document posted for each couple of weeks for what readings to do, but sometimes I got mixed up about which was due for which class. The only other thing I can think of is that the exams seemed pretty long Lots of questions that had a ton of information that needed to be written for each. I had extra time and didnt finish the midterm or the final, but then again, that might just be me!! But one positive is that they looked at your exam sheet too, not just the blue book, so any notes you made might get partial credit even if you werent able to finish. I really appreciated this because some professors will only count it if its written in your blue book, which doesnt make sense to me because if you noted it on the exam sheet, then you clearly know the info, you just didnt have time to write a full answer. But these profs factored in your exam sheet too, which I think is amazing!! Helps you demonstrate that you learned something, which is the point of school, rather than just that you can write quickly.",
                "I enjoyed the lectures. I think there could have been more clarity about assignments and more consistent assignments as I often felt that I wasn't exactly sure about what was required of me."

            "comments": [
                "ABSOLUTELY NOT. This is the worst class I've taken at Yale and that's coming from an EVST major. I regret taking this class and wish I would've taken the bio sequence instead. This class is not organized well, it's not set up to help you learn, and there is no extra help if you have learning disabilities. I emailed the professor to meet about the material and heard no response. I had also emailed the professor at the beginning of the year about section vs. office hours and they made a comment in class that \"the people who ask that probably aren't even in class.\" They didn't have section organized until far into the semester and placed us in one without telling us the time of the other ones. The way that the professor teaches makes it hard to understand what you're supposed to be getting out of class. They gave \"advantages\" to the people that go to section and you're not supposed to help out your friends if they don't go. It felt like a situation where the professor(s) assumed that if you don't understand the material, it's because you're not trying hard enough. If you're really really into paleontology, then sure, take it. Anyone other than that, absolutely not.",
                "Yes!! But only if you like this sort of stuff I guess. But I think it's cool, so highly recommend! Also a pretty easy class!",
                "Yes!!!! It's so interesting. I'm a major, so I'm definitely biased in this, but I think learning the history of life is such a neat opportunity and the professors engage with the content and with students in a way that makes this course so much fun.",
                "Yes, I would still recommend this course to another student because it is much better than a more strict biology as the prerequisites for environmental studies.",
                "This course is much better if you take the accompanying lab with it. The lab helps delve deeper into the ideas discussed in the lecture and it in turn makes it much easier to follow along and understand the course work.",
                "Yes. The class is a great introduction to the history of life and concepts in biology and ecology. Having even a vague understanding of how all of life is related makes the world a much more fascinating place in my opinion. This course helped me see a lot of interrelations between life that I had never seen or appreciated before, and just for that it was worth taking.",
                "I can not recommend this course enough. I can without a doubt name this as one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale so far. You learn so much. Derek and Celli are simply two of the coolest people ever. You will not regret taking this class.",
                "One of the funniest thing Ive ever seen on course table was a review for this class that said No, no, no. Not unless you love fossils and fantasize about bones all day \r\nObviously do not take this class if the subject doesnt interest you, but this is a spectacular class. Our educational privilege as Yale students really hits you in the face when you take this class. We got to tour the Peabody museum three whole times. We have the best grad students in the country as our TAs. Briggs is cited in every history of life textbook on the market. \r\nFor EVST majors, this is the better prerequisite to go with. \r\nFor people looking for a science gut, this is a low work class and a novel experience. \r\nFor EPS majors even if you arent in paleontology this gives you a good perspective on biology in the discipline that you might not get if you dont take it. \r\nCredit D the lab if you can!",
                "Nope, it was so long, every lecture, with random sections that didnt significantly count for anything. There was no feedback after the exam, just a numberlike how is anyone going to learn from that. Derek Briggs is shocking.",
                "Absolutely.  It was a joy, if a bit long of a lecture.",
                "I would recommend it as it is easy to follow for non science majors despite the heavy workload and high level of content",
                "Yes! It is very interesting if you are interested in the topics. Dont take it if youre looking for an easy credit and not actually remotely interested in it.",
                "Yes! To all who are interested",
                "Yes, I believe that it is a course that is just generally cool to know about it as it surrounds the entire Earth. The only thing that might be better for next time is more feedback on the essay or exam.",
                "Yeah, for those interested in animals or earth and planetary science it was pretty fun.",
                "Yep!",
                "I would recommend this course, especially to non-STEM majors. It was accessible but still challenging.",
                "Only if it is a requirement for your major. There are more interesting science credits at Yale.",
                "Yes I would if they are really interested in the horror of life. It was a very interesting and wholistic way to learn about earths trends.",
                "Don't take this, even as a gut, in all honesty.",
                "I would definitely recommend it to someone who's remotely interested about the history of life. If the student doesn't have that interest, they will find this course boring and, at times, frustrating. I will be thinking about it for a long time, though. I loved learning all this stuff.",
                "If you are an EPS major, this course is required, but it is very worth it and is a great way to get to know your DUS. I would also recommend it to anyone looking to get a broad overview of the history of life. Personally, I love dinosaurs, so even though that is only a small section of the class, if you want to take a dino class this is the class for you.",
                "Yes! Even if its not your area of expertise, this class is awesome. Its a perfect mix between an intro to the subject and a more intermediate course. Its pretty easy to understand, accessible for all, and super interesting! There were also several labs where we looked at specimens from the Peabody, which really allowed us to apply what we had learned! Definitely not a gut in terms of the info and workloadbe prepared to do the work and engage with the materialbut was enjoyable and interesting. So whether you need a science credit or youre interested in the subject, or just want to try out something new, Id recommend this class!"
