                "Covers a lot of content, so it is difficult and almost unnecessary to keep everything in mind, which is sad because much information just gets lost because there is too much content that never gets asked about again.\r\nThe final paper was just a re-iteration of a topic that I had already studied for for the final exam, so not sure how writing the paper helped my learning and understanding of the topics.\r\nInstructor is very organized and committed to getting across the societal challenges that we are facing / the big picture.",
                "The course is very straightforward: the information in lectures and expectations for exams are clear. I appreciated that all the lectures were recorded to help with studying for exams and making up missed classes. Lectures weren't exactly riveting but personally I think that's fine for this type of class.",
                "This course was taught very well. It is a survey of clinical neuroscience, which makes the topics we cover broad, but I felt lectures were very dense with information, which made test taking difficult. The content itself was very well taught and logically easy to follow for such an important class.",
                "The lecturing styles are a bit dry, but it is both a pro and a con when professors more or less read off slides because all the content you need to know is all up there on the screen, even if it's a bit less interesting to listen to.",
                "I think we could have benefitted from three midterms instead of two, or maybe doing smaller quizzes instead. It was definitely a lot of information to know for each exam. I wish we had more practice questions for the midterms. The end of term paper also seemed like a weird choice, although I did enjoy being able to draw parallels between multiple disorders and putting all the information that I learned together. I went to one of the TF-led review sessions and the whole time it seemed like the TFs didn't know the answers to our questions, so I didn't even bother going to the other review session.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- very clear lectures, easy to follow along with, the lecturer is good in breaking down complicated material into something that's easy to understand \r\n- the exams are very straightforward and fair, if you study what's on the lecture slides you will be more than fine  \r\n- interesting material!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- most of the lectures are just spoken directly from the slides, so it would nice if they were a bit more interactive or different than the slides so there was some extra incentive to come to lectures",
                "A lot of content was expected from us considering that it was an open introductory course to all majors.",
                "I liked the structure of the course and the content was interesting. Having a practice test before the exam would be helpful.",
                "strengths: well structured and easy to follow, great professor\r\nweaknesses: none",
                "The course content is intriguing, but I would have preferred more time looking at the social aspect of the disorders to provide context as to the barriers those with disorders face.",
                "lectures were great, a discussion section could be helpful",
                "Strengths was the interesting content and I cant really think of a weakness",

                "The main strength of this course is the way Professor Cannon explains concepts in a nuanced and sophisticated way, and where it would probably be tempting to oversimplify, he doesn't. This is at times also a weakness if, like me, you took this course without taking the Human Brain or other recommended introductory courses beforehand, and everything just seems really, really complicated. Personally, I overcame this by taking the course Credit/D, and I still really enjoyed the fact that Professor Cannon explained things in all their complexity and trusted us to follow along.",
                "more engaging lecture and could be more organized. also the test material didnt feel like it matched up to the content material in a lot of ways. also the TFs were unhelpful at review sessions",
                "The course was extremely well-organized which made it easier for me to access and learn the reading materials as well as lectures. I really appreciated it being recorded throughout the semester because I could review the lectures before exams. A weakness of this course is the essay did not have a set rubric and I think having one would have better my writing.",
                "Strengths is the range of information touched upon. Weaknesses include long lectures that it becomes difficult to know what topics are important to know for the exam.",
                "This course was very interesting but not the most engaging. Personally I think it would benefit from being a smaller seminar - I get the sense that Dr. Cannon would love to engage more with students as well but feels a bit let down as many people do not attend lecture.",
                "Strengths: fascinating material and relatively low workload; Weaknesses: lots to memorize for the exams and not a lot of feedback given",
                "This course explores clinical neuroscience with both breadth and depth. The lecture material was rigorous and intriguing, the papers were well-selected and relevant, and Professor Cannon was an excellent instructor.",
                "This class had incredibly interesting material but oftentimes was too in depth on the slides on certain specifics that didnt add to overall relevance of the coursework.",
                "easy to take notes off lecvtures not easy to understand",
                "Lectures are not very interesting, so it's hard to stay engaged during class, but the workload is light. You have to stay accountable for learning the material",
                "Strengths of this course: the course material was really interesting and was presented by Prof. Cannon in a cool way that required attention, but ultimately was fairly easy to understand. I think it could be improved by having slides at the end of presentations that have the clear takeaways from each day, or a class forum where people could ask and answer questions of each other.",
                "strength: the lecture structure and assignments are really clear and Prof. C is a really great lecturer\r\nweaknesses: the lectures are a little boring and could have more engagement",
                "Lectures were concise and well-contained i.e. each class went into a different psychiatric disease which made the class interestingg",
                "Honestly love the course and Professor Cannons teaching. I think the review sessions for exams can be run better by the TAs.",
                "A strength of this course is that it is very thorough in what it teaches and there is a consistent structure to it. Another strength is that there are very interesting guest speakers. Also, that it is recorded is a big strength. \r\n\r\nA weakness of the course is that there isn't much engagement and the material can be really confusing and difficult. This could be improved by offering more resources and assistance, maybe having discussion sections or something. \r\nAnother weakness is that the final essay was not discussed at all, which I feel could have helped with preparation and planning and any questions.",
                "This course did a good job at balancing psychology and neuroscience by delving into both the clinical applications and the underlying mechanisms of psychiatric disorders. Key slides were repeated across multiple lectures, which helped facilitate student learning by placing an emphasis on greater concepts. However, 75 minutes often felt too long to keep students engaged, and I think this lecture could benefit from a more interactive approach if possible.",
                "The lecture slides and the lectures were very clear and easy to follow.",
                "Professor Cannon was not a very engaging lecturer. He spoke in a very monotone voice for 1h15min and did not vary up his speech pattern or mode of instruction. I would have benefitted from a more engaging lecturer.",
                "The course material was very interesting and the assigned readings were always referred to in lectures which helped connect everything in the syllabus and broaden our understanding of disorders."

                "I would really only recommend if you are already interested in the topic. The course itself is a typical lecture course: straightforward but not the most engaging. The lectures are clear but aren't doing anything to sell the course/topic, however if you like clinical neuroscience it'll definitely be informative. The non-exam courseload is very manageable, and the exams are fair. You can definitely take this course without previous neuroscience coursework but some details can be confusing without rewatching lectures or doing additional learning.",
                "Yes! Amazing class!",
                "Yes absolutely! It would definitely be helpful to have clinical psychology and/or neuroscience background before taking this class (in my opinion, it could be one or both), but it's a great course that teaches really fundamental clinical neuro concepts.",
                "For the neuroscience major, I think it was definitely one of the better systems-circuit-behavior courses. However, it was not the best neuroscience class that could have existed. It may be better if a different professor was teaching it.",
                "Yes!! It's a really chill way to get an introduction to so many interesting and important theories that are adjacent to medicine/psychiatry and also neuroscience/neurobiology. This is one of the only classes that I've walked away feeling like I've actually learned the material and will be able to remember and apply it to my life in the future. Also the assessments are very fair and straightforward, if you just study the lecture slides, you'll be good.",

                "I would absolutely recommend - I struggled with neuroscience in other courses but this one was so well taught that it completely changed how I feel about neuroscience as a subject",
                "It was an interesting class and was fun to learn more deeply about these disorders, but the exams could be tricky and require you to know a lot of small random details. There also was very little exam prep (like practice questions) and no mention of the final paper.",
                "Yes but credit d the class. A lot of the grade comes from the exams and if youre not a good exam taker than its difficult to get a good grade. I loved learning about the topics and was easy to understand.",
                "I would recommend this course to those who need it, but wouldn't recommend as a science credit. Most of the kids in the class are neuroscience premeds, and the course was easy for them, but as a non-stem major it was a pretty steep learning curve and required a lot of learning outside of class.",

I think this class really shifted my view and brought to light many of the flaws in our current system of treatment for different mental disorders, but there wasn't really time to go in depth into any class of disorders due to the wide range of topics, which I was fully expecting when I chose this course.",
                "Yes, if you are a neuroscience major or interested in the neural mechanisms of mental illnesses. This is definitely one of the better courses I've taken within the neuroscience major. It is helpful to have already some background in neuroscience because the class does go relatively in depth into neural pathways.",

The readings were not too difficult or long, there is little homework, and all the information you need to study for the exam is online and in the slides for review. Aside from that, the lectures are a little dry.",
                "Yes!! The lectures can get a bet slow but the material is fascinating! Definitely worth your time",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student with an interest in mental disorders and at least a preliminary background in neuroscience. The material in this course is complex and challenging, and it is helpful to have taken other neuroscience courses beforehand (e.g., NSCI 160). That being said, the material is still accessible to those without a neuroscience background, and Professor Cannon provides additional resources for anyone looking to brush up on foundational neuroscience topics. Overall, this course was absolutely fascinating, and I walk away from it with an even deeper appreciation for the complexities of mental health diagnostics and treatment. This was one of the best courses I have taken in my three years at Yale.",

                "it was hard, no",
                "Yes! A good survey of psychiatric disorders",
                "Yes!!! This was an awesome course. The material was naturally super interesting. Prof Cannon lectures can be somewhat straightforward/dry at times, but because the material is so relevant to the lives of students and their families, that was totally fine. I took this course as an English major and without having taken the prerequisites, and found it to be challenging, but doable.",
                "yes if you are interested in neurosciences related to mental disorders, it's a great opportunity to dig in, but there will are a lot to memorize for exams and they weigh heavily",
                "Yes, if you would like to learn about psychiatric diseases, especially if you plan on entering clinical psychology post-graduation!",
                "Yes good gut",
                "Take it but its not a gut! The workload may be listed as low, but the tests are no joke and you have to study for them for quite some time. I would still highly recommend though.",
                "Yes, it was very interesting, it was well taught, the professor has the lectures recorded so you can go back and learn what was said in lecture.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students if they are really interested in psychological disorders and in science because this course captures both of those topics. You learn a lot about disorders and how they compare or differ.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The pace of learning is approachable, and the course covers a fairly broad span of psychiatric disorders. However, students with no prior experience taking a biology or neuroscience course may struggle to keep up with the mechanistic details of some of these disorders.",
                "Yes I would! It was a great course and I learned so much. Professor Cannon was a very clear lecturer and I thought the lectures were super interesting.",
                "yes definitely! Dr. Cannon is amazing.",
                "I would recommend if they are interested in the material but not just as an interesting class to take.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in learning clinical psychology, since learning about a neuroscience and biological lens for understanding disorders is highly important for achieving a comprehensive understanding of disorders."
