                "This was the class that truly helped me find my writing process and break through the anxieties that I had with reviewing/modifying my own words. before I had extreme difficulty even revising a 2nd or third draft for many of my previous papers and assignments, mostly due to my own self-doubt and the expectations that I put on myself for every word needing to be perfect, even though it was oftentimes anything but that. The only way that I can describe the first few weeks of this class is intense...After the first few weeks, I felt a breakthrough in myself when it came to releasing the fear that settled within me. This class felt like such a presence in my life that was truly needed and ended up being a bright spot in an otherwise personally dark and difficult semester mentally. I was able to focus on not just how to write, but what to write and what was important to me during that journey."

                "I loved the assignments as well as class discussions---they were often really engaging and got me to think in new ways. At the same time, I think the quantity/pacing of assignments made me sometimes focus more on quantity/speed than quality. There are obviously pros to this approach though so I don't know if that's necessarily a weakness.",
                "Strengths: the weekly submissions were brutal but necessary. Getting feedback and critique to that degree(quite extensive) and also at that rate was incredibly transformative. I soon developed a groove for observing art/drafting theses/writing passages in a way that established a pattern of reflection needed for an English course of this caliber. I also found it incredible that the class was able to use the YCBA/YUAG's resources not just by paying the exhibitions a visit as a class, but through meeting the curators and having private viewings of some of the art not on view within the collection. It felt insane to read about an artist/the work in class and then see their work in Duffey the next day. Also getting to meet with artists and visionaries making waves in the art world today stunned me at times but also made me see the value in showing up and being open to the opportunities presented to us."

                "Yes!! I loved the variety of things we looked at, guest speakers that came in, as well as the discussions we had. Everyone was super engaged and excited for class. Professor Spillane is incredibly passionate as well, she's awesome!",
                "Yes absolutely! The level of growth I was able to achieve after personally reflecting on my time within the class feels astronomical. Even if you aren't a HSAR/ENGL major, this class felt based on the art of observing if anything -- a skill that I think is necessary in moving forward when writing about topics within most majors. Additionally, the level of exposure I was able to receive last semester regarding Yale's connections and opportunities in the art world was staggering. I feel like along with being a writing course, this class also helped me cosplay as an art historian/art student, which in small doses, ended up being incredibly transformative as a History of Science and Medicine Major.",
                "Yes you will get incredible writing feedback. you will also get to see some amazing art. This is NOT an art history class, its an art journalism class. You will learn to write New Yorker style articles without any art history jargon. In that sense, its a very practical class especially if youre looking to go into journalism. Professor Spillane is phenomenal she really deeply cares about her students. \r\nThe class is a LOT of work, so if youre ready to put the time into actually watching the videos and reading the articles she assigns, then take it!"
