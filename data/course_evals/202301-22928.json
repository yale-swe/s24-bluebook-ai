                "SOO SOO MUCH! Came in with no knowledge of Remote Sensing or Spacial Environmental knowledge and you learn soo much that is applicable to all. Really opens your mind to a different perspective of geospatial thinking in addressing problems and a ton of computer tools",
                "Everything about satellite remote sensing, from the theoretical to practical to applications. The labs and the final project were big commitments but especially helpful in getting hands on experience.",
                "I learned a ton from this course -- how to procure, preprocess, process, and analyze remote sensing imagery. Great projects in the lab to teach students how to apply what was taught in lecture.",
                "Knowledge: better understanding of how satellite data is collected, what it actually physically represents, and how it is commonly processed and used.\r\nSkills: finding/downloading, analyzing, and visualizing satellite data. Also, coming up with a scientific question and working toward answering it.\r\nInsights: satellite data is very versatile and cool but also can't do everything and should be understood in the context of its limitations.",
                "Learned about the physics of satellites (radiation, orbits), the vast number of satellites collecting different types of data, and how to use satellite data for scientific analysis (land use change, vegetation analysis, urban sprawl, biodiversity, etc.). Guest lectures covered applications of remote sensing in multiple fields. Learned to use ENVI software to analyze remote sensing data.",
                "I learned how to use the ENVI software to analyze multi-band satellite images. I learned about orbits, the radiation spectrum, different kinds of reflectance and light dynamics, unsupervised and supervised pixel classification algorithms, common publicly available remote sensing products, band math and vegetation health indices like NDVI, histogram stretches, false color images, and many different applications of remote sensing in the fields of biodiversity and ecological analysis. Also learned how to use Google Earth engine. Learned about different coordinate systems and how to reproject satellite images."

                "overall a good course! a bit easy to disengage at times during the lectures, but definitely worthwhile if you'll use satellite information for a thesis or post-grad opportunity! not too high of a workload and you do learn a lot",
                "I thought the course was really well organized, having labs relate directly to lectures and helping to practically apply what we learned in class. I also found the faculty and TAs involved in the course to be incredibly helpful. No real weakness, except perhaps the lectures in the second half of the course being a bit drier.",
                "It is not very good for people who need a lot of structure to learn. Most of the course was self directed and could have been done on your own away from Yale.",
                "All strengths. Only drawback is to prepare for a lot of work to put into your individual project, and to be passionate about it.",
                "I loved every part of this course, and I wasnt expecting to! No weaknesses as far as I can see",
                "Strengths: well organized, well taught, and very relevant/engaging content\r\nWeaknesses: labs graded on a rubric/inflexibily and grading often felt arbitrary; work load/time in class high for a 1 credit class",
                "Strengths: the lectures were thorough and well-explained and simply great. Also the project was super cool and made me feel empowered. \r\nWeaknesses: used a weird GIS program called ENVI rather than more common ones like ArcGIS Pro or QGIS.\r\nTo improve: honestly not much!!! Awesome class! Maybe use ArcGIS Pro more.",
                "The first half of the semester was very theory/technique-focused, and I found it fascinating. The second half of the course was mostly guest lectures, which I thought were less interesting -- it was mostly hour-long presentations that felt like they could have been 15 minutes because they rehashed a lot of the content we had already learned (although there were a couple -- e.g. about forests in Maine and urbanization -- that were really fascinating). Perhaps the professor could work with guest lecturers to eliminate redundant content? This also felt more like a 1.5 credit course because of the weekly lab, although the lab is definitely necessary to get a handle on the software.",
                "The lectures are great, and the labs are even better. The labs are carefully designed and presented so that they're very easy to follow for those who haven't used ENVI before. You also learn a ton from doing the labs, and they'll help you to be successful with your final project. I also loved how open-ended the final project was, allowing students to research whatever is interesting to them and find their own suitable images. The amount of teaching resources/people available to help students was great."

                "Not really, it is useful knowledge of remote sensing but the course was quite difficult, and it was taught in ENVI, which many do not like. Taking a GIS class would be more useful. All of the teaching staff was great though!",
                "Absolutely.",

                "yes!! It was so interesting and cool and well-taught! Maybe my favorite class at Yale so far.",
                "Definitely! Gives you a broad overview of a lot of different physics concepts and teaches you very clear and useful applications (satellite data is relevant in so many fields). A fantastic blend of theory/practice. Definitely accessible to non-STEM people like me just looking for an interesting science credit, although it is in general a good amount of work.",
                "Yes, I'd strongly recommend this course if you're at all interested in remote sensing, satellite imagery, or using space technology to monitor ecological phenomena on earth. It's a very hands-on course, with just two problem sets and a weekly lab. You'll learn a ton of hands-on image analysis techniques from the labs, and the entire last month of the course you can just focus on diving into your final project of choice."
