                "This course is a fantastic practice in critical thinking. Professor Gentner teaches the essentials of Air Pollution in an engaging manner, which requires you to think actively about the material. A lot of the class was based around small breakout groups, in which we usually discussed case studies, before regrouping with the entire class and having a larger  group discussion. The course also focuses on some of the essentials of research, by going over experimental design and effective ways to present information through graphs and figures.",
                "A lot of very useful methods for approaching air quality problems, both qualitative and quantitative. Lots of case studies too.",

Prof Gentner made us think about the right questions to ask in solving a wide-range of challenges, and how to guide a thorough investigation into problem-solving in these contexts.",
                "I gained skills in identifying pollutant types, developing mitigation and reactive plans for different pollutants, and gained insight as to combustion processes and corresponding pollutants.",
                "I gained an understanding of different air quality mitigation strategies, atmospheric chemistry, and the sources and transport of chemical pollutants.",
                "A great course that taught me how to evaluate air quality problems on a macro level while understanding their underlying physics and chemistry. One of those courses that changes the way you look at the world, in this case, acquiring an appreciation for the complexity of our atmosphere and our interactions with it."

                "This course was an excellent overview, the lectures were engaging and fun. The semester-long research project could be improved by making the expectations clearer.",
                "One strength of this class was the holistic approach of the material. Quantitative and qualitative analysis are utilized, some policy and lots of chemistry is addressed. As a non-environmental engineering major, I came into the class without a strong foundation, but left with a strong grasp of the many aspects of atmospheric pollution. \r\n\r\nVery few weaknesses to address. One small thing is the final research project, and the lack of guidance on the assignment. Professor Gentner intentionally left the assignment very open-ended to encourage a wide breadth of topics and approaches, but with such vague guidelines it was difficult to really understand what the expectations were for the final deliverables. Despite this, the project is still a great aspect of the class, and I learned a lot while listening to everyone else's presentations!",
                "The whole active learning schtick of the class might not be for everyone, and in Zoom times it might not have been the most effective thing, since students can always zone out during breakout times, and then spending a majority of the time for most lectures going over the breakout sessions felt like a really good time to check my phone and not pay attention. Despite this, I still felt like I learned a lot--maybe that's the power of active learning??? \r\n\r\nAlso, the idea of the final project seemed daunting at first, but it turned out to be quite fun, actually--not a word that I'd throw around to describe an engineering course.",
                "Some strengths of the course were that professor Gentner is a fun lecturer even with the online format and made each class engaging. One weakness is that sometimes I felt we didn't get much guidance on the final project.",
                "This course was among the best in facilitating student engagement in a virtual setting with frequent breakout rooms and activities to brainstorm solving air quality problems together. For me, the essential component of the course - teaching engineering students systems thinking in air quality - was achieved. However, some of the math and physics aspects could be deepened further, as problems on the homework often involved calculations we didn't explicitly cover in class. I think the class also missed opportunities to discuss topics of current relevance, like microplastics, electric cars, and geoengineering, and could use some updates. Overall, very useful content and context.",
                "The strengths of this course were in the content and instruction. The content was interesting and very engaging and the professor encouraged participation and group discussion. The weakness lies in the lack explicit units within the course content. I found myself unsure as to exactly what lectures exams would cover.",
                "The course gave a broad overview of air quality problems and impacts, and the lectures were interactive and involved lots of in-class discussions, which were usually helpful (but sometimes the breakout sessions dragged). I would have liked to spend more time on the math\/quantitative side, as these problems typically showed up in the homework without much context. Prof. Gentner was also very accommodating with assignments.",
                "The greatest strength of this course is the interactive lectures. Even with the online class, I think we were still able to collaborate and engage with the group problems in lecture to deepen our understanding."

I engaged with other students in this class much more than other virtual classes. I think the timing of our final presentations, really fun projects with lots of flexibility, during reading period were challenging on my end. There could also be opportunities for future classes to do more experimental work, for example by visiting air quality monitoring stations, measuring pollutant concentrations at the entrance and exits of tunnels, or simply coming outside to observe and discuss atmospheric activity.",

Additionally, the material is relevant to everyone, as air pollution is a serious problem in almost all urban and rural areas, so everyone should take the time to learn about its causes and effects!",
