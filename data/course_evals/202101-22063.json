I really enjoyed learning about them because there were some I was unfamiliar with and some I was familiar with, but I learned a ton of new information about (ex. Christianity). You will learn a ton and read some very interesting readings, the best readings I've had at Yale so far. It really makes you think. I loved the class because of the wild stuff I learned and how I could apply it to my life.",

You ask yourself the BIG question, which is, \"what do I want do with my life?\" The answer, you'll probably find, is \"definitely not what I'm doing now.\" You'll confront death every day, which is wild, but worth confronting."

Actually tries to help students improve their life -- which is not something that many (if any) other classes at Yale do. Readings are manageable and almost always interesting. Papers are short and pleasant to write.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none really!",

                "Strengths: Unbelievably good readings! I usually hate readings but I actually did them for this class because I loved them so much. We had really cool conversations in a really safe space. Most importantly, Joanna was a strength. A wonderful professor who put so much time into making the class tick. Trust me, you want her as a professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None?",
                "The course is more or less one belief system per week. Some are weird: why did we go so hard for Nietzsche? Even though it's a survey, it could cover a bit more ground. Like, why don't we cover any of the Global South? Or any Indigenous belief systems? Definitely a Euro-centric course, and people outside of the West live lives worth living."

You will learn about traditions and religions that you might know very much about, and this will help you understand the world and the people around you better. It might also help you figure out the meaning of your own life (that in and of itself should be reason enough to convince you!).",

Really commit yourself to the class and it will be worth it. The readings are excellent and you'll get a lot out of the class if you read them and participate. Totally recommend this. A good example of a gut that is worth your time.",
