It was unlike any other english class that I've taken thus far in that we didn't just read and analyze, we deconstructed, with great great respect not only for the author and the text, but also for the lived experiences of the individuals in the classroom. I improved my analytical skills, was lucky enough to be exposed to a few books by authors I wouldn't have read as deeply, and grew a lot as a reader and as a learner."

The course itself had no weaknesses."
