   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot of skills related to french grammar",
    "I increased my French reading comprehension with the stories and novels we had to read. I also grew my French vocabulary and grammar skills, going over the uses for the subjunctive vs. the indicative, literary tenses, the causative \"faire\", and other important grammatical topics. I also improved my writing through the small essays we had to write.",
    "Over the course of this semester, I really learned a lot of different grammar points that will actually be useful in speaking and writing in French, rather than random grammar points that I will never use when I actually try to speak or write in French in real life. I also think that my speaking abilities have really improved over the course of the semester, partially because we had class everyday so I would practice my speaking every single day, but also because Imane did a great job of integrating class discussion with the material and giving us tips and corrections to always improve our speaking. I think this course really helped me improve my French in every way; I never thought that I would be able to read a novel in French or watch a French movie without English subtitles, but I succeeded in both of those tasks because of this class.",
    "This course facilitated improving my french reading, writing, and speaking having included a variety of difficult texts to read and movies to watch."

   "comments": [
    "A lot of the vocab we learn in class is specific to the books we are reading and I don't think will ever be useful in real life applications of the french language.",
    "I think one of the strengths of this course is the fact that it meets every day and that there is always homework for the class. While it can be annoying at times, I think it was actually really helpful in reinforcing the material that we covered both in class and in the homework. The course packet itself was also really helpful for me because there were a lot of summaries of the grammar rules and exercises to practice the rules and to make sure that we understood the information. I also liked the fact that we read a variety of short stories, a short book, a novel, and watched a few movies because it made the class more interesting instead of just covering grammar and vocabulary. I thought that all of the stories were very interesting and we had some great discussions in class about the stories. However, I wish that we had more discussions about the themes presented in the stories, like the depiction of women or alienation or general mistreatment, rather than mostly talking about the plot of the stories. I also think that parts of the course weren't organized in the best way possible, and I think that the audio exercises weren't always helpful and, frankly, were sometimes a waste of time. This course definitely had a lot of work all the time, and sometimes it would have been nice to have a little bit of a break. There also wasn't a lot of freedom sometimes with what we could discuss in class with regard to the stories and movies, or what we could do our final presentations on at the end of the course. Overall, though, I enjoyed this course!"

    "I would only recommend this class to another student if they are truly passionate about the french language.",
    "It was an enjoyable class, and it helped me remember the French I had learned in high school. The workload for the class was not too much, and do-able within the time constraints. I would recommend the course to any student taking French.",
    "Yes! I mean if you're interested in learning more french, go for it. It's pretty in line with the rest of the french sequence (same amount of work, same structure) and you'll get more practice.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student! I think this course really helped me improve my French, and I feel more comfortable with reading, writing, and speaking French as a result of this course! However, I think a good portion of my good experience with this course was attributed to having Imane as my professor! I talked to a few friends who had different professors for French 140 and they didn't have as good of an experience with the course, so I would recommend this course if you can have Imane as your professor.",
    "Despite a difficult french program overall, Imane truly made this class a joy to attend. I felt my french improving by the day. Take this class with Imane if you have the chance!"
