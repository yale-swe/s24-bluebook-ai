I would not recommend taking this class. Professor Sindelar used EXTREMELY stigmatizing language to describe individuals with alcohol misuse issues and individuals who are overweight. She also used statistics from the early-2000s---extremely outdated and not helpful. Classes were always lecture, so there was no point in doing the readings, because she never let students talk. Jingyuan also never gave feedback on the weekly assignments, so we never knew how to improve/get a higher grade. This was a pretty useless class, which is sad because so many students are interested in these topics and this class is hosted at YSPH."
