                "Well taught, Beth is one of the better profs for the class. Some of the midterms were pretty difficult though.",

                "Everything was very flexible because the lectures were recorded which was nice. The psets were fairly long though.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bennett is an exceptional lecturer who makes the content easily understandable. She works on a chalk board and rewrites her notes so it is easy to keep up with your note taking. The supplemental typed notes and informational handouts are great study tools and help solidify what you learned in lecture.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the psets were quite lengthy and difficult, especially the last one which was VERY challenging.",
                "Great course. Well organized canvas page, clear notes, and great lectures.",
                "Overall this class was by far the best math based course I have taken yet. It is set up well, lectures were clear and easy to follow, and expectations were always very clear in terms of psets and exams.",
                "This class was incredibly organized and clear in all of its communication. The professor and teaching staff set the students up for success and were a pleasure to work with. I would recommend perhaps going over the solutions with the TA's before the weekly help sessions (or at least if there are a few that are particularly challenging).",
                "I really liked how Beth adapted the course to the online format. Overall the math stuff is fine and what one would expect of a math class, but the way Beth presented it was amazing and she is a fabulous teacher who I could not recommend more. The format of the course was great and I felt like I could really learn the material and understand the problems. Maybe a better set up as to why we have to take the course would be useful but the course was fine and the teacher was great.",
                "Strengths - the lectures, notes and general teaching of the course is very organized and clear by Professor Bennett, which was very helpful given there are many formats of differential equation categorization\r\nWeakness - doing the psets may take some time!",
                "I learned a lot of great skills from this course. It was incredibly well taught and Professor Bennett was great at sending additional information and answers to student questions to the class. I just would have liked to interact with Professor Bennett while she was teaching and heard other student questions during class. I think my learning took a great hit from not being able to ask questions right as they come up. The lectures were awesome but if I had questions, I couldn't get them answered immediately. There were office hours and such but it's a very different situation when you have small questions in class that are relevant and understood at the time. Those sorts of things are often forgotten by the time office hours roll around or might be hard to explain. But that's almost entirely covid's fault.",
                "S: Professor Bennett, undoubtedly. She consistently has been the best math professor I have ever had. Lectures, with her accompanying lecture notes, were straightforward and clear. The course is extremely well-organized, and there is every opportunity to be successful.\r\n\r\nW: I think the only weaknesses have to do with the exams this year. Some would be super straightforward and others would be crushingly difficult and impossible to do in the time allotted. I think Prof. Bennett would be the first to admit that this was due to the unconventional nature of this year, and thus the exams were always curved fairly.",
                "Strengths: lectures are amazingly well-organized, should be the standard for all STEM-oriented classes of: teaching a topic then doing examples with questions that we will actually encounter in the psets and exams. Concepts and problems were done thoroughly and clearly in the lectures. \r\nWeaknesses: exam difficulty and length were big problems for a large majority of the class, though this is understandable due to COVID.",
                "The professor is the greatest strength. Beth Bennett is so meticulous, it made learning in this class really effortless. The class was structured in such a way that it was really easy to buy in and keep up throughout the semester. Expectations were very clear, and feedback was delivered in a timely manner. I actually liked the asynchronous lecture format, but it was necessary for me to couple that with the office hours that were offered because otherwise it would seem like I was taking the course all alone. The lecture recaps were helpful, but perhaps in the future there should be more of a balance between reviewing lecture material and doing interactive problems. The problems, introduced for the latter half of the course, were really helpful, but sometimes in the later lectures (particularly on Fourier series) I got lost in the sauce during lecture and would have liked a more general recap. (Again, the problems were super helpful, so I don't know how to balance that out.)",
                "Nothing to improve.",
                "This course has a LOT of difficult material over the length of the course, so if differential equations don't come naturally to you, you're in for a tough, work-filled semester. However, Beth is incredibly organized and committed to providing all materials for students to succeed, so as long as you take advantage of her resources and actually dedicate time to this course, you can do well. The exams are definitely a struggle, especially now that the course is online and exams are open-note, which means Beth often puts more obscure or complicated problems on the exam so it's not just a matter of copying solutions from your notes. However, this means you really need to study your butt off for each exam, and sometimes you'll just encounter a problem you have no idea how to address. That can be pretty frustrating and discouraging, especially if math doesn't come as naturally to you as your classmates, as these questions on the exam can feel less like they're testing your understanding of the material and more like they're testing your ability to find patterns or draw on concepts you learned (and probably forgot), or possibly never learned, years ago. However, this seems to be a problem that will go away upon the course returning to an in-person format, but if the course will be taught again online, it probably should be addressed.",

This class was such a great experience with her and I could not recommend her more.",

                "Strengths: Very organized, good feedback on exams, good setup for virtual learning\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not really a weakness, but the course is a lot of work!",
                "Beth Anne Bennett is the best teacher I have ever had. Given the medium, Beth did as good a job as is humanly possible. There is no better way to learn differential equations online. The course was supremely organized, there were ample resources to ensure student success, feedback was always clear and timely, grades were fair, and the path to success was always clear. Differential Equations is not very easy, and I could have done a better job, but given that the course was online, nothing about its contents or how it was taught is responsible for any lack of success.",
                "The course was fun and well put together, I liked the tag sessions that helped us get to know our classmates.",
                "This course is extremely well taught. The content is interesting and the instruction is incredible. The weaknesses of the course lie mostly in the virtual format. I have found that virtual, recorded lectures are not compatible with my learning style. Another weakness was in the length of the exams, each exam I found myself rushing to complete each question, leading to a lot of mistakes.",
                "Although each lecture was pre-recorded, Beth made sure that questions could be asked during the Q&A session. She also held exam review sessions before each exam as well.",
                "The recorded lecture set up worked well to allow students to take the course at the time that worked best for them and by allowing students to pace themselves how they liked while the weekly homework prevented students from falling too far behind. That being said, I think a more consistent homework schedule would be beneficial, as would short multiple choice quizzes to help with conceptual understanding more since the homework is entirely computationally focused.  Something like a 10 minute quiz once a week or a short quiz at the end of each chapter with the potential caveat of needing fewer exams in that case since some exams do not cover 2 full chapters.",
                "The strength is Dr. Bennett. She organizes this class very well and is one of the classes where I've learned the most from. We do not focus too much on the theory behind certain methods but rather work on learning how to apply it. This is especially beneficial for people who may have struggled on the proof portion of math (like largely what we had to do in Calc 1-3). A weakness of this course is the pace. The content is crammed into a semester and there are holes in our learning. For example, since the exams were noncumulative, many of us focused too much on just applying the most recent methods we learned in the content leading up to the 3rd exam that we forgot to consider that what we learned from the past lectures still played a role in our answers.",
                "Much of the material is very straight forward, and I think the topics themselves are well organized and the order we learn them is clear and makes sense.",
                "very well organized",
                "I thought this was a really great course. Lectures were always very clear and easy to understand. I felt the psets were sometimes more complicated than the examples done in lectures and very tedious with the math, but overall they were very helpful for practicing methods learned. I think the exams could be improved. They were always much harder than the psets. I felt they didn't do a good job of testing whether or not you knew how to do something  I would know the methods and had no problem doing problems from the book, but the exam would always throw a twist in there and I never ended up doing well.",
                "The course was very well prepared. The recorded lectures were structured properly and the course material was taught in an excellent format that held comprehension as its primary intended goal.",
                "Strengths of this course include the organization of the material and the classes. The lecture notes alongside the recorded lectures were very helpful along with the review slides for tests. Solutions to the psets were posted so that we could review what we missed even though the psets had comments on them.  One weakness of this course were the tests. The way they were formatted over zoom I understand prevents cheating and looking things up but it was very stressful and I felt that I ran out of time on some rather than not understanding the material. I think it can be improved by adding an extra 2-5 minutes to the test time so that we can wrap up the last questions and maybe review our answers before submitting.",
                "Everything was perfect except for exams. The professor admitted when exams were too hard or too easy and made the appropriate responses. I found this recovery from this weakness to fill the hole (even though a perfect set of four exams without adjustments would technically be the ideal case).",
                "This class was really good with lectures. they were in depth, and made alot of sense, as well as the extra handouts\/lecture notes posted to canvas. The psets we're challenging, but useful and helped when studying for the exam."

                "Recorded lecture format worked and I thought the set up for the exams was solid too.",
                "The tests were given at three different times to accommodate time zones. Professor Bennett went above and beyond to accommodate students with learning differences in tests. Very organized class! Professor Bennett also organized meet-ups for sunsets and tried to set up student groups to allow for student interactions.",
                "I appreciated the pre-recorded lectures which allowed me to view on my own time. This was very useful since I had a very demanding course load which sometimes required me to push off a lecture for a day or two.",
                "All lectures were prerecorded, much better than live lectures in my opinion. Professor Bennet also went above and beyond to engage with students 1on1, perhaps more so than previous semesters. Great class.",
                "The way this class was set up was really good. The recorded lectures allowed for some freedom in terms of when they could be completed and the additional meetings for Q&A was always very helpful to clarify material.",
                "I really enjoyed the live Zoom review sessions.",
                "I think the course was adapted to online learning really well and facilitated student learning well. It was very easy to get help and the lecture format, with recorded lectures, well-written and organized notes for the lectures, and inperson review sessions was perfect.",
                "The recorded lectures were very good and useful\r\nDiscussion sections worked out okay, though not many people showed up",
                "The recorded lectures were a must. My only complaint is that there was almost no interaction with other students or with Professor Bennett.",
                "The virtual meet and greets and \"tag-team\" chats were a welcome addition. Prof. Bennett genuinely cares about meeting and learning about her students.",
                "There isn't much that I would say needed changing due to COVID but due to COVID, there were difficulties with the exam type, length, and difficulty.",
                "The asynchronous lectures were actually really good for me. They ended up making me focus more time on the course, which was helpful to my learning, but if all my classes did that, I would have been totally swamped. The format of lecturing as usual on a chalkboard was really nice because I saw a lot of professors struggle with tablets and stuff. Plus, the lecture notes and handouts all posted in a clear location on Canvas made it easy to follow along. The exams seemed successful to me. The format was open-note, live in a Zoom room, but they were still at a good level of difficulty (i.e. ended up with a nice distribution, I think). I think the way Professor Bennett did the exams is the way to go, honestly.",
                "I think the professor's combination of synchronous and asynchronous activities was effective for learning.",
                "The instructor overcame the limitations of virtual learning by organizing one on one meetings as well as group discussions of a friendly nature to simply \"chat\".",
                "I think the in-person sessions that Beth held during class were very helpful, but I wish they were held later in the day, because it was often difficult to find time to watch the full lectures before the allotted class time, as that time normally would be when we would be watching the lectures live when in-person. If that isn't possible, it might also be helpful to review the previous lecture during those sessions and not the lecture from the same day, as that way we would have more time to watch the lecture and actually get use out of attending the live session. Either way, those live sessions were very helpful, especially when group work was used, but I think attendance could be improved and more students could be helped if the schedule was slightly adjusted.",
                "Professor Bennett did a great job holding regular office hours that were scheduled ahead of time (before the semester began). This made it easy to come to office hours and helped me understand the content much better.",
                "The recorded lectures worked well.",
                "I'd say all of it succeeded. I liked the flipped classroom format a lot, where we watched the lectures outside of class time and then came into class ready to ask questions. It also helped to go to the lecture recaps to summarize what happened and reinforce the concepts. Sometimes recaps were a little long-winded but overall they were very helpful. I think their length was likely a result of how much material we covered in each lecture.",
                "I think the course was extremely well-done, given the circumstances.",
                "Prof. Bennett was amazing at keeping students connected, engaged (during office hours\/ review sessions) during live class, and scheduled times when we could talk to her personally. It was the most accommodating STEM class I had this semester!",

                "Ample TA sessions were very helpful. Instructors were extremely responsive to emails at nearly every time of day and in multiple time zones. Communication was a strong suit of the instructors, and this made it very easy to stay on top of work and be aware of what needed to be done. I wouldnt change a thing, given this medium.",
                "The professor did an incredible job with the virtual lectures, they are clear and led to a deeper understanding of the content. I have found that recorded lectures are difficult for me to keep up with as I am likely to push off watching them in order to complete more immediate coursework.",
                "Although it was difficult to facilitate the creation of study groups because of the class being completely online, Beth tried her best in finding everyone a chance to meet others by holding zoom-tag group calls as well as having one on one zoom calls with her. She is truly the best!",
                "I appreciated the high quality pre-recorded lectures and I enjoyed the encouraged informal discussions, as it allowed me to feel connected with the class without attending. I do think some additional ways of checking understanding such as quizzes or short form homework would help students to get a better grasp of what they do and do not understand in order to have more effective questions during office hours.",
                "I loved the recorded lectures but they were a blessing and a curse. I loved being able to speed up or slow down certain parts of the lecture. I was able to re-watch parts I didn't understand and sped through the parts that I found were already clear after I read the lecture notes pdf. I think these recorded lectures should be provided even after covid is over because it is hard to keep up with understanding lecture while also taking notes. The lectures were a curse because I was not incentivized to watch it on time before the live Q&A. I liked the open book format but it did make the exams a little harder. I really like how Dr. Bennet wanted to get to know her students outside of class.",
                "I enjoyed the 15 minute chat sessions that Professor Bennett hosted. It was hard not being in a real classroom with peers, but these times allowed me to see and talk to other students.",
                "I thought the pre-recorded format was fine. I never had trouble understanding the lectures and never felt the need to go to the Q&A sessions.",
                "Tests could be improved because they felt very stressful. I think the recorded lectures combined with the Q&A worked well. I think the best example of it working well was the Linear Algebra review provided. I had never taken linear algebra before and by going to the review session before watching the next lecture I understood the material much better and the next lecture I understood really well. Also, the tag team chats and one-on-one discussions were fantastic and I enjoyed them.",
                "This was the greatest class I have taken in the last two COVID19 semesters.",
                "the BIGGEST new practice was the exam study slides and review sessions! I found this really helpful to focus my studying, and to gain new study habits that helped me with the course."

                "The course itself is fine. The material is at points very interesting, but being what it is the course focuses more on the computational side and not the math proof based side (even though Beth does show the proofs and they are very interesting \/ beautiful it is not the focus of the class so you only glimpse them out the window as the class drives by them). I would highly recommend taking a course with Beth and taking this course with Beth, but without her the course is just ok and with a bad professor could be a slog.",
                "Yes, very helpful for further STEM studies as a lot of science and engineering problems boil down to solving differential equations (admittedly not always analytically)\r\nProf Bennett teaches this course very well too",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially to science people who don't need to get into all the technicalities of proofs. I got a really good concept of how to deal with differential equations, especially in physically meaningful settings. Someone in the previous semesters' course reviews said if Beth Bennett is teaching it, then take it, and I heartily agree with this statement. The way she structures the class makes it easy to learn, and she offers a ton of resources and support. If you like to go it alone, I suppose you could lower your level of engagement in the office hours and such, but going to those and study sessions really helped me learn diff. eq. well.",
                "I would recommend this class to students interested in applying mathematical concepts to real world examples.",
                "Yes, it has applications that span many disciplines.",
                "If Beth is teaching, yes. More than likely you're taking this course as an engineer who needs this class for a prerequisite, but if you aren't or if you drop engineering while you're taking ENAS 194, Beth makes it bearable to press on. If you aren't really a math lover, differential equations are dry and complicated, so maybe don't take it if you're just looking for an easy QR, but if you actually want to learn differential equations or need to for your field, try to take it with Beth, because she's a phenomenal lecturer and incredibly helpful and compassionate person.",
                "I would recommend any class taught by Professor Bennett",
                "Yes it was well taught.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, if it's with Dr. Bennett. She is an amazing professor, and really wants all her students to do well and understand the material. It's a lot of information to learn in one semester, so it can feel a little hectic at times, but there are countless opportunities to get help and ask questions.",
                "I would recommend this course. It's a really good class for people who like math but aren't into proofs. The questions require some thinking but are certainly not impossible.",

                "Beth is the best teacher I have ever had. Differential equations can be a bit dry, but Beth made them bearable and fun when possible. If you need to take Differential Equations, take it with Beth! I probably wouldnt recommend this course to a student who is exclusively interested in rigorous, proof-based math, simply because the amount of material that we had to cover meant that we had to forgo formal proofs.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I would however suggest keeping in mind what types of virtual learning are best for them.",
                "It's a very enjoyable math class (if you can even find math enjoyable) in my opinion. A lot of solving problems, good terminology to learn about differential equations and some of their applications, and it's very well taught by Professor Bennet. Unfortunately there is also a section on series so do with that what you choose.",
                "Yes, Professor Bennett is one of the best professors in the department and the class is set up very well.",
                "I would take this course over any other Diff Eq. option if it is required for a major. Dr. Bennett is the key to this course because she is a passionate teacher who really cares about her students and their experience in this course.",
                "I would recommend this course. I do not think the work is incredibly challenging, but it is an interesting topic that is different from all the other math classes I've taken. The class is well organized, and Professor Bennet is engaging and thorough.",
                "This course was taught extremely well. You will definitely know how to solve differential equations by the end of it. Workload isn't bad either  one weekly pset. The only thing was the exams were always made quite difficult so it was hard to get a good grade.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student even if it is not a requirement. I feel like the professor does a good job of explaining the material and it did not feel as hard to pick it up compared to some other math classes. The math class that was required to take this class felt more difficult than this class because this class generally feels more concrete and there is less graphing involved. There is also multiple avenues to ask questions at the review sessions or the Q&A sections twice a week that take the place of the recorded lectures.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Bennett has been the greatest professor I have had at Yale. Her level of performance could almost convince me that I will never have a professor as good as her.",
                "I would recommend the course! the professor (Beth Bennett) teaches this course soooo well so I would reccomend taking it with her. The class is engaging, and although the lectures are long they do help you for the pset problems and to study later on. There are many resources, like extra handouts and lecture notes that also are available, and helpful."
