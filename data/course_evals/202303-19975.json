                "In this course, I learned the definition of what the idea of a \"modern essay\" was, involving myself in the creative writing process and journalism. From this, I learned how to write and develop essays based off of personal/true events, writing in a more conversational tone. Along with that, this course allowed me to further my conciseness on essays, and overall gave me the ability to dabble in other types of essays besides a normal argumentative one.",
                "I read so many beautiful and thought provoking essays, and learned that I love reading and writing creative non-fiction, a medium that was totally new to me . This class made me excited write personally for the first time in a long time, and changed my perspective about what good writing is and can be. We also got a sense of the the publishing industry, which was super interesting and fun.",
                "I learned how to write creative non-fiction essays through reading various types of texts. I really enjoyed what I learned in this class because it really developed my understanding of writing. I never really wrote these types of papers before and taking this class allowed me to delve into my creative side.",

Also the essays and most of the readings are engaging. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None really. Some readings suck, but thats supposed to happen. Youre not going to like everything you read.",
                "Strengths include being the workshops that are provided for each essay to allow students to revise and comment on each other's works, along with the amount of readings to provide an vast amount of different writing styles and perspectives. One way this course could be approved is with adding any types of activities or group work to allow for further participation in class.",
                "We read so much beautiful writing, and the workshopping format created a really nice space for us all to make our writing better. I found all of the units engaging, and they built on each other really well.",
                "Strengths: You will learn how to craft strong essays. You will also learn structure and how to write in different contexts.",
                "Strengths: Reading a variety of essays from different authors and genres across time periods and subject matter.\r\nWeaknesses: None that I can think of at the moment. However, I think it may have been helpful to include more workshopping sessions."

                "If it is with Kate Bolick, absolutely positively YES. She carries what-would-be a mundane English 120 section on her shoulders, making it into an incredibly engaging experience rather than a class, per se. I never once felt that I was going to English class, rather that it was an intellectual hangout. Her grading is great, I never once worried while writing oh my god is this going to get me an A? B+? C?? which is INCREDIBLE because I felt that I was actually writing BETTER without me focusing on what potential grade my paper could get. Im so glad I took this class. Everything about it is great.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Just out of this course alone, I was able to learn a whole different style of essay-writing that not only expands on my knowledge of essays, but also improves and helps me define my own style of writing in general. The prompts that were presented were very open-ended and creative, allowing you to basically express what you wish, making these essays feel almost like a source of winding-down and relaxing rather than a burden to complete.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Not only did my writing improve, but my perspective on what good writing means shifted. I developed a sense of my own taste and voice, and learned how to respond to deep edits. I also got to read writing that I loved that I would probably not have read otherwise.",
                "I would recommend this class without any doubt. This class was taught very well and any student who takes it will leave the class with a better understanding of creative writing.",
                "YES!",
                "If you want to improve your ability to write creatively, then definitely.\r\nIf you're more interested in analysis and exploring works of literature, I'd opt for a different English class."
