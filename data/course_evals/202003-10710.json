                "relevant and challenging psets, good lecturing",
                "Strengths: 1) Professor is funny and writes funny pset problems. 2) Excellent practice problems and exams posted before all 3 exams, with clear solutions. Practice is representative of actual exams. Clear solutions for every pset as well. 3) Content itself is interesting and useful, particularly for the second half about Markov chains and R simulations.  4) Professor is responsive over Piazza.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) The learning curve is steep. There is supposedly no probability, calculus, or computational background assumed. If that is indeed the case for you, you are going to struggle with writing up proofs in Latex and running simulations in R and learning so many varied new things at once. 2) The psets take upwards of 15 hours. They are very difficult to understand conceptually, and the wording itself is confusing. Going to office hours doesnt help much. The content is just so different than whats covered in class. They caused me to break down weekly. 3) You cant plan around the amount of time psets take because they are not posted on a consistent date or due on a consistent date. 4) Lecture is not very engaging. Most people end up reading the course notes instead of attending. Also, lecture is not very structured. Its hard to tell why things are taught in the order that they are and how everything fits together. Theres a lot of jumping around.",
                "The strengths of this course lie primarily with Professor Chang and his lectures\/textbook.  The material you cover in this course is incredibly interesting, and the Bayesian approach taken by Professor Chang truly shifts your perspective (particularly if you've only ever been exposed to frequentist statistics).  Further, Professor Chang's lectures and textbook do a great job of thoroughly explaining difficult\/intimidating concepts (like Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs Sampling, and MCMC writ-large).  The only real weakness of the course is how much work there is--in fact, even after completing the midterm and 10 rather challenging problem sets, you still have to face a take-home computational exam (25%) and a difficult final exam (30%) in the last two weeks of the semester.",
                "The course does a great job of demystifying things in probability and statistics. Prof Chang builds up the material so you leave with the sense that you can tackle many problems with the toolbox he equips you with. I never though I would be able to learn about MCMC in an intro class, I did. That's pretty cool, eh?",
                "I would not qualify this course as \"easy or exciting\", but I think that's a reflection of the subject, rather than the teaching. Prof Chang did a really good job of making complicated topics more tangible and understandable, which was greatly appreciated. Psets and exams were also very difficult, but the TAs and ULAs were incredibly helpful each week, and were a strong support system for learning the material.",
                "Strengths: Well organized class. Psets were based on the content from the week before, and all the slides and notes were on Canvas.\r\nWeaknesses: Psets were graded pretty slowly. Faster feedback would have been nice.",
                "Strengths: very rigorous, concrete (theoretical) introduction to Bayesian statistics \r\nWeaknesses: If you're already a stats- or mathematically-inclined person, the following likely won't be relevant. For everyone else, the problem sets were often at a much higher level conceptually and practically compared to the in-class lecture material. This was a problem for a lot of students (including me), who found the disconnect so great that the psets would take many, many hours (much longer than in other STEM classes), and would require serious help from the TFs\/ULAs. The psets were a serious weakness for me because they felt more like I was being dragged through something incredibly difficult rather than truly applying the material we immediately learned in class to real-world statistical analysis; in other words, I felt like I was being taught what to statistically think on the psets for each specific question instead of (more powerfully) how to statistically think in general. If the material presented in class more closely resembled the difficulty of the psets, or if the psets were overhauled to better reflect\/reinforce the material immediately learned in class via the psets not requiring application\/extension leaps and bounds above the basic material in class, this course would be really good. Otherwise, the class will again likely fall short of expectations of those like me seeking a better understanding and (conceptual, but also practical) framework of Bayesian statistical analysis applied to the real world and STEM fields.",
                "Structure was good. Lessons were interesting. Sometimes spent too much time on R code or drawing out simple stuff that got boring",

                "The problem sets were very challenging and sometimes the lectures could be a little hard to follow. Many problems also depend on intuition and may be hard for someone new to this kind of math. However, the office hours are very helpful and Professor Chang provides course notes that are helpful as well.",
                "Very hard problem sets for someone not mathematically inclined. Really interesting course material and incredibly useful! Highly recommend.",
                "Strengths: Recorded lectures, saved lecture notes, practice exams\r\nWeakness:  Problem sets were abnormally difficult and required a lot of brainpower; the first few lectures were not indicative of the difficulty of the class",
                "Strengths: Very organized, systematic, and rigorous presentation of statistics. Loved the proofs and mathematical intuitions behind the code we were writing\r\nWeaknesses: Very high weighting of work due on the last week of class (take-home and final). Not really a weakness, but something people should be aware of before taking the course",
                "A very good class, however, exams were super rushed so they caused a lot of stress and left little time to prepare and study.",
                "Strengths: The slides that Prof Chang posted and the course notes, as well as the office hours which I really couldnt have done the psets without.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt the lectures themselves were really fast-paced and I often got lost, it didnt help that Prof Chang usually went overtime and had to go really quickly towards the end. There is not a lot of time to ask lecture questions for those of us that cant stay after lecture, since OH are primarily for pset questions.",

Otherwise, the pain may be too much. Go take S&DS 100 and S&DS 230 and come back. You will benefit from the knowledge in this classthe Bayesian approach is interesting, and you get some practical practice with simulations in R. But I thought about dropping this course almost every week. The first 6 psets were horrendous for me and took upwards of 15 hours, even with office hours and Piazza. They were conceptually difficult with confusing wording (very different from the content covered in class) and required Latexing hundreds of lines. To make matters worse, the psets were not consistently posted at a certain date or time, and the deadline also fluctuated, so I couldnt plan ahead for the huge amount of time that they took. Just when I was ready to give up, though, the class changed to computation. The teaching got a lot better, and the psets were more similar to what we did in class. So, if you can stick it out, I promise it will get better. (Warning that the final is theoretical and not computational though.)",
                "Yes!  It is a fantastic course that takes you from the very basics of probability and statistics to the modern computational techniques used in Bayesian inference today.  However, be prepared for a challenge--this class involves quite a bit of work (2 exams, 1 take-home exam, and 10 reasonably difficult problem sets).",

How small are Donald Trumps hands exactly? Who is the best player in the Martian Basketball League?\r\n\r\nIn all seriousness, I really enjoyed this course. Prof Chang is super funny and his problem sets have a whimsical humor about them. I was very impressed with the kinds of problems and scenarios that we could use our knowledge from the course to examine.",
                "Yes, but I will say I struggled with the course material. Im a CS major but in college math is tuff and I would advise non mathy people to try the psets early, and go to office hours. I didnt prioritize that and lost out as much of the learning is through doing problems as is often the case with learning math well",

If you're looking for a statistics course to better understand Bayesian statistical analysis and the conceptual framework as an end to itself, this course is for you, although I can't guarantee it will be fun. If you're looking for a statistics course to better understand statistical analysis for your major\/academic field (social sciences but mostly\/especially STEM), I would seriously encourage you to consider another course\/think hard before you take this course. I was this person; I read previous reviews of this class, and took the chance; and now I am mostly regretting the choice I made, not only for my GPA but more importantly for my understanding of statistics both as a means (for my major requirement and future research) and as an end (to understand statistical analysis for the sake of it). Unless this course (psets especially) is changed compared to fall 2020, you'll likely be in for a lot of work (probably too much\/more than what you're budgeting for\/comfortable with) both for the difficult\/long psets and in understanding the material at the level of the psets and required for the exams, and it won't give you a ton of practical insight useful for your major\/field of study. You'll likely fall behind little by little, with major setbacks\/realizations after the midterm, be more comfortable when the modeling portion of the class comes around in the latter third of the semester, and then get absolutely rocked on the final when you realize all the time spent completing the psets did not address the fundamental gaps in your statistical foundation started early on and were present deep down all semester.",

                "Yes, definitely! It's interesting to see the Bayesian approach to statistics, and to be able to understand and implement powerful computational methods for statistics. It's great to be able to actually understand what you're doing, and there's enough probability theory included so that the course prepares one for S&DS 242.",
                "Yes! I found so many concepts of statistics in all my other classes. Statistics is everywhere and something that is important no matter which field you go into.",
                "Yes",
                "It really solidifies your R skills but you should not take this class without prior R experience.",
                "If someone is interested in gaining a solid understanding of the actual foundations of statistics, it would be great to take this as a first statistics course! If someone wants only an overview of common statistical tests used in ordinary science, this is probably not the course for them, but with the intuitions from this course + an easy Google search, you'd be set for frequentist statistics too.",
                "Absolutely, I went from knowing nothing about probability and statistics to knowing a bit about both. And now I know R which is very useful",
                "Not really, I was very unhappy with how grading was structured. They nickel-and-dimed you on silly things. I once got 5% off on a homework just because my graphs were not large enough. For a course that is encouraged for non-S&DS majors, you'd think they would be a little less strict in giving out good grades. Additionally, the staff was very unresponsive to emails. The final exam was also way too long and hard. It was practically immoral how misleading the practice exams wereI was able to complete both of the practice exams in the allotted time, getting very good scores on both, but I did not come even close to finishing the actual exam in the time period. Why not prepare students for the pacing of the actual exam? Why lull them into a false sense of security? One last complaint, the balance of what assignments count for what in the course is bonkers. Up until the last week, you have only completed 40% of your grade. I hope you will seriously reconsider taking this course.",
                "Yes, it is a very useful class for someone interest in S&DS, especially that it kind of beautifully combines two classes in one.",
                "Yes."
