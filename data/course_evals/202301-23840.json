It does have a moderately high workload because you are still learning how Latin works and how to translate sentences and texts. Still, the instruction and translation work is very engaging, and doing the translation exercises never feels like a burden. \r\n\r\nBoth in this course and Latin 120, I was taught by graduate students from the Classics department. Both instructors I had are amazing and they care very much both about you as a person and how you feel learning the course material, going above and beyond in their teaching both inside and outside of class time. In Latin 120, once we moved on from the textbook to translating a Latin text, which for my class was Petronius's Satyricon, my instructor continued to provide the same level of support both inside and outside of class. She also allowed us to submit recommendations for which primary texts we wanted to translate and gave us samples of three texts so we could translate the samples before deciding as a class which text we wanted to continue with. This course was probably my favorite of all of the courses I took this semester. Every graduate student and Professor I have interacted with in the Classics department has been amazing. If you have the chance to take any courses in this department, I highly recommend it.",

                "100% I love Latin and this class was fundamental in further skill development",
                "Yes, if someone wants to learn Latin or more about grammar in general they should take this course.",
                "Yes! Loved it."
