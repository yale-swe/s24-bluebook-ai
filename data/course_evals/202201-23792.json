                "During this course, I learned how to engage critically with primary sources, including art, poems, and pre-modern writings. I also learned about the historiography of queerness, the importance of how we tell stories, and the various parallels between modern and pre-modern societies.",
                "I learned about the history of queerness & how it has been shaped by different eras, religions, schools of thought. I thought a lot about how power gaps in queer relationships has evolved throughout history and how it still applies today",
                "I learned a valuable amount of information about the history of sexual practices before sexuality as we think of it today became a concept. I learned that so much relating to sexual identity and history cannot be taken for granted and most societies do not fall along a neat linear progression from oppressive to tolerant over time.",

                "It was great! Wouldn't change a thing. Loved the art analyses!",
                "The course, and Igor's teaching, was strong in that there were no limitations on what we could talk about -- our discussions were super open, which encouraged us all to connect with conversation and information in our own personal ways (connecting it to other classes, our own experiences, and TikTok). This was really important, and it made the class consistently interesting and engaging. Our class papers were also very open and people could write about anything. Depending on the person, perhaps this could be a weakness. If someone prefers a highly structured and formulaic class, then this one might not be perfect! But, for myself and the majority of students, the ability to engage with content in unique ways was a component that made the class a favorite.",
                "Strengths: engaging discussion, Igor asks very thoughtful questions, interesting readings, very detailed feedback on papers \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "I especially enjoyed the weeks on the Abrahamic religions because they allowed me to learn about how religions have conceived of sexual deviance in a nuanced, complex way. Strengths include the expertise of the instructor, the variety of perspectives brought by the students, the relatively low workload, and the organization of the syllabus. Weaknesses include the sometimes ambiguous hybrid of lecture and discussion. While I learned a lot from Prof. de Souza's lecturing, I felt like our best meetings were more interactive and discussion-based, connecting the material to our experiences today.",
                "The course is strong in its theoretical framework but I didn't feel that our discussions yielded any new insight beyond the readings.",
                "Strengths: Professor De Souza is a fantastic professor - charismatic, kind, funny, and engaging. If he ever made a podcast, I'd listen to it. None of the readings feel extraneous, and all the material is very interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, my only gripe is that the class is called \"Sexual Minorities,\" and the title is sort of inaccurate. The class focuses on men who had sex with men between Plato and the Enlightenment, and for a good chunk that time period, men who had sex with men were not considered a minority (though I'm generalizing a lot here) - it was thought that many, if not most, men could sexually desire other men. I'm pretty sure the class used to be called The History of Sodomy, and I think the class should be called that again, since it's a little more correct.\r\n\r\nNote that my only \"issue\" isn't even related to the content of the class itself! And that's because this class is awesome!",
                "The course is really well taught and the course load is very reasonable. Igor is an amazing professor who is passionate about the course."

The content is fascinating, and I learned so much about religion, amorphous sexual practices, ancient societies, and the connections between the pre-modern world and the modern world. I knew very little going in, but the content was digestable and Igor fostered a welcoming and collaborative class environment. If you're thinking about taking it, you absolutely should.",
                "YES!!! Esp if you dont have much background on ancient queer history (like me), its an incredible introduction to it. Thought provoking, fun, creative",
                "Absolutely. However, I saw that it's being changed to a combination lecture/discussion section meeting more than once a week next year, which I'm suspicious of. I thought it was really nice to have the class as a discussion to look forward to once a week, and probably would not have been able to do it if it met more often.",
                "I'd only recommend this if they had a strong interest in WGSS history-related issues.",
                "Yes! It was an amazing course and the energy in the room was always friendly! Igor is an amazing professor! I would 100% recommend taking a class with him!"
