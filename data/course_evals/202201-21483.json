                "I developed insight into how different authors have come to understand the future at different times in history.",
                "I learned about past and current conceptions of futurity and temporality by engaging primarily with the literature-based discourse surrounding these ideas from the time of Plato/Herodotus to the present. Moreover, I learned about the connection of these ideas with those related to philosophy and phenomenology more specifically, science and technology, extra-terrestrial life, and more. I also gained a lot of knowledge through the writing assignments throughout the semester, I think, and became a lot more comfortable in particular with a kind of writing that I'd never really done beforewriting that is academic in some sense but which feels freer and can manifest in more creative ways.",
                "School of thoughts and its relationship to class readings. You get to learn philosophy, history, and literature.",
                "I gained a deeper perspective on how to approach futurological thinking and the concept of temporality from scientific, philosophical, and literary points of view. I was able to analyze the portrayal of time and the future in a diverse array of texts including sci-fi novels, documentaries, philosophical writings, and movies and create my own final project discussing futurity in a text of my choice.",

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course are the texts. All of the novels we read for class are genuinely very interesting. Unfortunately, so much of the class was spent in discussing philosophy and how it relates to science fiction and the texts that we usually ran out of time to talk about the books. Which was frustrating considering the amount of time it takes to read each book every week. In class discussion, we generally focused on science and the perception of time. I wished that we could have discussed social aspects a bit more -- such as race and gender -- since many of these texts are old and not always very PC (looking at you, Demolished Man).",
                "Strengths: super interesting readings and manageable assignments. Weaknesses: the seminar had over 20 people so for the last third of the course, we spent all our time listening to student presentations which meant the later readings were never discussed",
                "A strength is that the course gives us access to some very exciting texts. The downside, is that the course wasn't as geared towards discussion as I would have liked. Many of the classes were us being lectured at with little class participation possible. It could be frustrating reading a full book and not having the time to really say anything about it.",
                "too much reading and ridiculously difficult assignments",
                "The strengths of this course are numerous, but to put it briefly I think that the curriculum (the books we read, particularly those towards the end of the semester which I found myself enjoying more), Professor Williams, and the in-class discussions that we had were the greatest strengths of this course. Its only weakness, I'd say, is that there was so much more we could have discussed in class than we did, and my classmates all had really fascinating things to say which I would've loved to hear more of. This weakness, I think, arises naturally from the fact that 1:50 minutes a week isn't really all that much time, when you think about it, and the texts we read were so nuanced and each could have warranted hours of discussion and analysis, I think.",
                "A strength is a super engaging professor where two hours would fly by",
                "Strengths: Professor Williams is a win. He is one of the most kind, compassionate, and knowledgeable professors I've met at Yale and truly cares about the actual content of our discussions and projects rather than the busywork that comes along with them. I absolutely loved the texts that he curated for us and his kind, open demeanor in classes that encouraged us to discuss deeper philosophy topics in a low-stakes environment. Although the class was a lot of reading, the assignments every week were very reasonable, especially if you plan ahead for several weeks.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We spent a bit too much time on final project presentations. I wish that we had more time for in-class discussions on the texts we read in the last few weeks.",
                "Great readings + discussions that connected well across weeks, well-structured assignments (first assignment was the project proposal, second was an annotated bib, third was the project)\r\n\r\nBeginning of the course felt a bit slow compared to once we got into the more sci-fi readings (The Time Machine onward) - the information gained from these weeks were definitely helpful in discussing some of the later readings though",
                "While the assignments were few and far between, they were often long and required a decent amount of preparation beforehand. Otherwise, I thought the readings each week were very interesting, and the in-class discussions were equally fascinating. This class was wonderful -- the only thing that could have made it better is if it met more than once a week.",
                "Professor Williams made this class. He's so nice and encouraging, and his lectures were really interesting. The only weakness is that the student presentation part of the semester took up a lot of class time. Perhaps it would be more effective if the presentation time was expected to be shorter.",
                "The texts we read were interesting, and Professor Williams led engaging discussions on the material. I enjoyed the final paper, and the annotated bibliography, while long (~6000 words) and a bit tedious, definitely helped my research and analysis. I sometimes wished we spent more time discussing the reading itself, instead of the context and history of the text and some of its references. Presentations from all the students brought a lot of really interesting perspectives about the course content, but they did take up a lot of class time and we didn't really get to talk about the last few weeks of reading."

                "I would recommend this course to a student only if they are a big fan of philosophy. I did not realize philosophy was going to be as large a component of this class as it was and I absolutely cannot tell my Kant from my Hume. But the workload is light, and Professor Williams is very likable.",
                "Definitely! This class is a surprisingly great introduction to philosophy which I wasn't expecting but was really cool. The readings were quite interesting, with a mix of straight philosophical texts and awesome science fiction works",
                "I think this course was not very difficult. The entire class was geared towards a final paper that was only around seven pages, and the first two papers consisted of a paper proposal for that paper and an annotate bibliography. Weekly discussions weren't the best, as many periods were taken up by presentations in the end and there was little room for class participation. There thus wasn't a huge incentive to always do the reading, knowing that there wouldn't be time to talk about it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, whether or not they're interested in ideas of futurity or the genre of science fiction or really even literature at all. You get to read very interesting books, the workload really isn't onerous but you still come away from the class feeling like you've learned a lot, and Professor Williams is a wonderful teacherI'd urge anyone presented with it to take the opportunity to learn with him.",
                "Absolutely! This is one of my favorite courses at Yale and you get to express your interest in a very-open final project.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in the content. As a STEM major, I found this course the perfect intersection of STEM topics such as time travel/futurity and more philosophical/literary aspects without shortcutting any writing or analysis. Especially if you're looking for a WR/Hum course with compelling and interesting content with a simpler workload (only 1 or 2 reading assignments a week) this course is perfect for you.",
                "Absolutely. Definitely changed how I think about temporality. For those looking for a writing credit, this is a great course to get it!",
                "Yes! Absolutely! If you are at all interested in science fiction or how literature talks about the future, this class is for you. Professor Williams is one of the best professors I have had so far, and each class is interesting and instructive in its own way.",
                "Yes we read great texts and it was overall a pretty chill class. Also Professor Williams is great.",
                "Yes! It's a great and engaging class, and the readings are a lot of fun.",
