The introduction to a 'warrior culture' is interesting.",

Throughout the course, students will view and discuss war films chronologically dating from 1930 (All Quiet on the Western Front) to 2006 (Letters from Iwo Jima) alongside supplementary readings and video clips shown in class."

They will also develop a lens for detecting pro-war / anti-war cinematic strategies.\r\n\r\nWeakness: At times, the assigned material exceeds what is focused on during discussion. Students may adapt the approach they take toward reading/watching the assigned material throughout the semester."
