                "I learned so much in this course, from how to engage with philosophical texts to the history of reproduction policy to modern reproductive justice\/feminist frameworks.",
                "I have gotten better at analyzing and evaluating complex philosophical arguments about issues of real-world import and urgency, at listening to others' interpretations of and responses to those arguments and formulating my own thoughts in response, and at sharing my thoughts with others. I have also had the opportunity to spend a semester engaging with a number of perspectives very different from my own lived experience, in a way that was extraordinarily helpful for me. And I became familiar with the outstanding issues and debates at the heart of the field of reproductive ethics, and got to read some philosophical back-and-forth by a number of super smart people.",
                "I learned so much across philosophical topics related to reproduction including procreative harm, the ethics of contraception, the ethics of abortion and more. This class was really helpful in learning how to craft philosophical arguments and analyze philosophical arguments, but the biggest take away was the engagement with relevant and interesting readings, media and discussions about the ethics of reproduction. Additionally, I learned a lot about working through and articulating difficult philosophical ideas surrounding sometimes sensitive subject matter.",
                "Content-wise, I learned so much about philosophical issues surrounding reproduction. For instance, the course covered the ethics of reproductive technologies, overpopulation, and biological\/adoptive parenting. Very comprehensive and well-taught course. \r\nSkills-wise, I learned how to do Philosophy in non-traditional ways. As a Philosophy major, I've never taken a course before this one where philosophical thinking and argumentation were encouraged in forms beyond paper writing. Because students were encouraged to choose a final project format that was not a paper, it pushed me to think about how argumentation can occur in art, music, storytelling, etc.",
                "An overview of the concerns of reproduction associated with bringing life into the world, assisted reproductive technology, abortion, etc",

                "I learned a lot about how to read and write philosophy. I loved this class!!",
                "I developed many skills taking this course including philosophical\/ethical argumentation structure and analysis. I gained a wide variety of new perspectives and had excellent discussions with my classmates.",
                "This was a great exploration of a wide variety of topics related to reproductive ethics. I got the opportunity to deepen my own understanding and opinions on these topics, while learning from both the readings and the great discussions with my classmates.",
                "Analysis and comparison between diverse and conflicting arguments on multiple issues related to reproduction (abortion, contraception, environmental anti-natalism, moral reasons for\/against having children). The course allowed us to engage in profound contemplation on the issues that are highly politically contentious, that we tend to avoid discussing, or that we tend to too easily embrace or reject."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The readings were super interesting and accessible. When some readings were a little trickier to understand, Max provided lots of clarification and support to ensure that everyone understood exactly what was going on before discussion. Discussion was always super well facilitated and I really liked how we had time to gather our thoughts alone or in a small group before whole group discussion. The assignments never felt like filler work and Max provided SO MUCH constructive feedback. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none! In fact, I wish I could take this class for 2 semesters because all of the information we covered was so interesting I would've easily spent double the time on each unit.",
                "The strengths of this course were the fascinating works on its syllabus, the excellent instruction, and the quality of discussion and community with peers. The course could be improved, I think, with a little more frequent opportunities for practice and feedback in producing philosophical work (e.g., short reading responses, or summative activites at the end of each syllabus unit to review and consolidate everything we've covered, especially to recontextualize the earlier works in the unit after having engaged with the later works).",
                "I really like how this course supplemented readings with other types of media. I also like how the class was organized, Professor DuBoff, had very clear and thoughtful agendas for each class that guided small group discussions and then engaged the entire class. I cannot think of any weakness for this course.",
                "Max as a professor was the highlight! They cared so much about our success in the course and made it a joy to be in, even at 9am",
                "Strengths included the instruction & organization of the syllabus. Classes were well-structured and perfectly moderated by Max. I cant think of any weaknesses.",
                "The format of this course was great. Max gave us a manageable amount of reading and we spend most of class talking about it. He set great class standards to encourage lots of sharing and we always had great conversations. \r\n\r\nThe way Max had grading set up was also very thoughtful and they gave ample feedback.",
                "While I enjoy discussion based classes for some of the more complicated readings I would have benefitted from slightly more lecture type content.",
                "The course was structured very well and the discussions were always incredibly insightful and well led by Max.",
                "I appreciate how this course interwove philosophical discussions with the issues in the real world, which are affecting so many people, particularly women and sexual minorities. The course gave us good skills to organise debates over such contentious issues, which will allow us to facilitate public discussion in more productive ways. I also appreciate how this course allowed us to discuss how we can apply philosophy to real-world issues, pondering how philosophy can contribute to creating a better society."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if Max is teaching it. This course covers material that is so relevant to everyone's lives because as we discuss in class, reproducing or not reproducing are situations that everyone must deal with. Throughout the entire course, Max was absolutely incredible. He organized each section of the course so well and his handouts were so helpful. Every day when I walked into class, I knew exactly what to expect based on the agenda, and I got to really engage with my classmates in some super interesting discussions. Max was so open to meeting with students and so accommodating. I felt like he really wanted me to succeed and that he was ready to give me the tools and support I needed to do so. The readings are interesting and totally manageable as far as length goes so I really recommend doing all of them to get the most out of this course. I wish more courses here at Yale were like this.",
                "I would recommend this course! Max is an extraordinarily kind instructor who is also great at facilitating learning, collaborative grappling with ideas, and personal engagement in the course material. You will gain a lot of perspective and be pushed to think deeply about one of the most important and underreasoned choices in human life.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. While it is a seminar (with readings assigned) twice a week, it is such engaging, relevant and thoughtful material. It will really make you think differently not only around the topic of reproduction but also about the world. Also, the freedom you have with your final project is such a lovely way to really creatively engage with the material and create something meaningful to you as a reflection of all you have learned.",
                "YES! Anyone who has a stake in reproduction (i.e. everyone) should take this course.",
                "Absolutely! If youve ever thought about what it means to have children, make children, bring children into an environmentally unstable world, think about abortion, ART, etc, this course has something for everyone",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Yes definitely. The material is really interesting and Max is great.",
                "Yes! This course helped broaden my perspectives on reproduction",
                "100%. This is one of those unique courses where the content is directly applicable to almost every bodies lives. These are questions we should all be thinking deeply about, and Max does a great job of facilitating that.",
                "Yes! Max is a wonderful instructor who cares deeply about the material, students learning, and students wellbeing. The course workload is manageable and produces in depth knowledge on the  different subjects underlying the umbrella of reproductive ethics. The makeup of the class was unusual for an upper level philosophy course, with mostly students from other disciplines (WGSS\/psych\/health policy), so we did small introductions to methods of philosophical thinking, but we thankfully didnt spend a huge amount of time on them.",
                "Yes definitely, this course is commendable even to people who are not majoring in philosophy. Reproduction will be an increasingly important and contentious issue in the era of climate crisis and population decline. After taking this course, students will be able to realise how philosophy is not isolated\/abstracted from real-world issues, as well as how philosophy can enable us to make prudent decisions on life-changing issues."
