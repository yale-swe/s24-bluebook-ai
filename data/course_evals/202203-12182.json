It would also be nice if grades were posted onto Canvas.",
                "strengths: I think the professor was very good! she never went into too much detail, and kept a fairly difficult subject simple to us. she's also very funny and seems like she enjoys what she does.\r\nweaknesses: I think the pacing was a bit confusing sometimes? sometimes we would spend way too much time on something that seemed pretty obvious and then spent very little time on things that were not obvious.",
                "The class is so great for anyone interested in language, formal logic, or philosophy. I learned a ton, the workload was very manageable, the lectures were engaging and fun. The textbook is a nice aid, but if you pay attention in class you won't need to read the whole textbook front to back. \r\nThe only weakness I would say is that the readings for the psets were sometimes unrelated to what we were discussing in class and doing in the rest of the homework. However, they were usually pretty interesting, which made up for it.",
                "psets and readings are great and nicely facilitate learning and practices done in class. I think class could be improved by making better use of in-person time as it felt boring in class at times.",
                "Strengths: by far the most intriguing course I've taken at Yale. I was excited to attend every lecture because the more I learned, the more I wanted to learn. The homework was consistently challenging but never felt unfairly hard, although there are some times where problems are approached at completely new angles on the homework, which might require a few hours of thought to think of how to solve them. The assignments are given biweekly and, while you might be able to manage to finish the assignment in the last few days before it's due, I would strongly recommend that even serial procrastinators (like myself) block out at least a week to do each PSET.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I did feel like I taught myself a lot of the semantics concepts throughout the semester, and the textbook was unhelpful. I don't think this is a failing of the course or of any of the instructors, but the subject matter itself is very opaque unless you understand it intuitively (which I did not).",
                "I personally believe this course was over populated. In a course like this where often students are expected to participate and engage with the professor directly, it is intimidating to do so in such a large room with so many people. I would have liked a more intimate environment.",
                "strengths: veneeta & ushasi! both so willing to meet to go over material. generally a pretty low workload, since its only 6 psets. the course wont consume your time (until the last few days before psets are due). the handouts were very extensive and provided a great roadmap during lectures. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: the material itself is honestly kind of dry at times. i wish there were more connections made between the readings and the PSETs, as sometimes it felt like we were reading about these key semantic/pragmatic concepts but not using them anywhere besides to answer a reading response.",
                "Strength: very beginner-friendly lecturing style.\r\nWeakness: may be a little bit too slow for students with math and cs background.",

You also learn a lot in just one semester and get the opportunity to read lot of interesting papers. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I found the textbook a bit difficult to follow at times, but this was fine as most of my questions were answered in lecture."

                "No, I would not recommend this course. This course explores several mathematical tools/systems to represent language semantics (Propositional Logic, Quantifier Raising, Logical Forms, etc.) but does not use these mathematical tools to draw interesting conclusions about language. Class time was used to go slowly, but not rigorously, through examples of using these mathematical tools, and a student with a background in math will be frustrated with the imprecise use of mathematical systems, the lack of definitions in the textbook, and the absence of the logical process.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dayal failed to move the course at a fast enough pace, searching for frequent reassurance that everybody was engaged, and then counterproductively slowing down on concepts that people were not confused about but in fact were abundantly clear and had tuned out for. This caused an uncomfortable positive feedback loop of low engagement and a disconnect between the students and the professor, and Professor Dayal often put students on the spot to try to increase engagement, and these contributions did not end up being meaningful.\r\n\r\nCourse material often moved sideways, with each of the mathematical systems we learned tackling the similar language phenomena (scope of \"every\", felicity conditions of \"the\") but not drawing novel conclusions. I would appreciate if the professor focused more on critical evaluations of the semantic tools we used, exploring motivations for each one, and what semantic problems they can and can't solve, and I wish the professor trusted students more to operate on our own within the mechanics of the semantic tools we learned.\r\n\r\nMany of the course readings are about the definition of word \"the\", some of which were interesting but they were never once mentioned in class. If literature in semantics interests you, unfortunately you will not be able to discuss it in this course. \r\n\r\nI think this course is probably good preparation for Semantics II, because you get a lot of exposure to semantic tools and an introduction to semantic literature. However, this class will probably not change your perspective on language and is definitely not worth taking on its own.",
                "It's not a linguistics major requirement, but I sort of think it should be. But you do have to keep in mind that it's a math class. Obviously not as intensely math as some other courses, but it's not going to be an easy QR or an easy social science. I think the things I learned in that class were incredibly important, but I'm not sure that someone who isn't interested in linguistics/cognitive science would think the same way.",
                "Absolutely! Especially if you can take it with Veneeta. This is a really cool class, and I honestly think everyone should take a class with Veneeta before graduating. She is wonderful!",
                "Yes! it's a very specific set of information but if you are interested in semantics, or think you might be, try it out!",
                "I took this course as a linguistics student interested in learning more about meaning, after having taken pragmatics. After this class, I decided I wanted to focus on semantics and pragmatics more in depth for my major. It's truly fascinating--and also very challenging. I found that some students (especially computer science majors) understood semantics more intuitively than others. If logic comes easily to you, this course probably won't be very hard. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in a more mathematical understanding of language, what makes things true or false. It's fascinating!",
                "yes, but only if you have taken/are taking syntax. i cannot emphasize enough how important it is that you at least have some understanding of syntax before you take the class, or you will not have a good time. the material is pretty niche, and this is by no means a gut QR, but its still an interesting perspective on how many operates and how we can map our intuitions into something more formal.",
                "Yes, very good introductory course for students interested in formal approaches to language meaning.",
                "Yes, but only if you have already taken a class in linguistics or logic. I feel like there was a steep learning curve for people without previous coursework in either field."
