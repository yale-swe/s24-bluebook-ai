From how a film camera works to developing film to printing in the darkroom to archival washing, there is so much that goes into the process. This led to a greater appreciation for printing in the darkroom and a true understanding of what goes into film photography.",

I also learned quite a bit about the history and conceptual/theoretical considerations of photography.  Because this course gave us so much freedom in our assignments, I also learned a lot about myself as a photographer and an artist more generally. I discovered what I was interested in and developed some ideas that I'm very excited to continue working with in the future. I even had the chance to experiment with some unconventional techniques in the darkroom."

                "Strengths of the course are how fun and interactive it is. Its all hands on and practice but we also got to learn about other photographers which wa s great. I would say I couldve used a little more technical support like what contrast is and how to use the filters when printing.",
                "Strengths: Everything! Ted is an excellent professor who makes class a comfortable and welcoming environment. It feels completely safe for all the vulnerable moments that arise in art class. Our visits to museums and libraries are also amazing. I honestly can't think of any weaknesses. Ted was so helpful when it came to finding cameras, using paper, and printing in the darkroom. It's a fantastic classI highly recommend!",
                "both a strength and a weakness is that Teds teaching style is very laid back. this gives you the freedom to explore and create in the way you want to but theres the uncertainty and occasional confusion that comes with large amounts of freedom.",
                "It's such a cool skill to know how to develop film photos. I think the class extending into reading week would allow more class time to work and develop photos.",
                "was a very strong class. no changes other than I think that people should show less photos in the final critique. no showing the same photo twice. it decreased the quality of what was on the wall.",
                "The strengths are the teaching staff, Ted, and the main weakness was that I had to buy a lot of my own materials.",
                "Strengths: resources, instruction, structure\r\nWeaknesses: timing/pacing",
                "Each student was given ample room to experiment with their own style, but I feel that students new to photography might get lost in the amount of independence.",
                "The course took too long to really get started. It was only by the third week that we were finally in the darkroom. I believe camera basics should be discussed during the very first class and then we can make more photos in our free time and learn darkroom skills earlier.",
                "This is my favorite class I have taken at Yale. It teaches both the techniques and theory involved in photography very well. But I thought it's biggest strength was the energy that the professor, the TA, and the students all brought to class. Everyone grew a remarkable amount as photographers from the beginning of the semester to the end, and everyone was excited about each other's work. As in any art class, a couple of the crits went a little bit off track, but for the most part, I found the crits to be fulfilling and helpful. The class felt relaxed and open; people seemed to trust each other. The one weakness of the class was that it got to a slow start because people had trouble getting cameras in order, and I think the enrollment was a little bit too large. Our swipe access to the darkroom was also unreliable; sometimes we could get in during open hours, and sometimes we'd have to wait for someone to open or prop the door. I think if these resource access issues were smoothed out, we would have had more time to develop our ideas further before the end of the semester."

                "Absolutely! It's a wonderful course to learn about film photography. Seize the opportunity to use a great darkroom and learn from a great professor! This class may feel like a greater workload because you can't do your work from home or a train or somewhere else. You have to be in the darkroom and there are limited hours. There is no shortcut, you have to put in the work, but it's so worth it. If you are trying to hone your photography skills or learn about photography for the first time, I recommend taking a digital photo class first. This class is 10% photography, 20% developing film, and 70% printing in the darkrooma wonderful opportunity to photo enthusiasts though! I highly recommend!",

I would advise that you take this course in a semester when you have a lot of time to dedicate to it, because it's a lot of work no matter how you approach it, and the more you put into it, the more you'll get out of it. It's an incredibly fun class."
