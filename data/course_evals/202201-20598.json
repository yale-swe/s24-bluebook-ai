However, I wish there was more guidance from the lectures (because lectures are all about concepts and all the hands-on stuff come from spending way too much time to figure it out yourself with the psets). Its also way too hard for someone like me who has only completed the necessary prerequisites",
                "I felt like I learned a lot by doing the notebooks rather than by listening to lectures and taking exams",
                "The course caters well to everyone's different levels of background and experience. Nick makes an active effort to meet with every student one-on-one to provide advice and insight."

                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in learning more about fMRI neuroanalysis, but keep in mind this course does require a bit of coding background/Python and stats familiarity in order to make the psets more approachable. I personally didn't have as strong of a background in these subjects, and I wish there could've been more help on the basics/getting started and more office hours in general.",
                "If youve only completed the necessary prerequisites (cs50, intro stats, and human brain) like me and dont plan on doing neuro research, I would not recommend this. It is way too difficult and I was struggling the entire semester. However, you do learn a lot from the course and the exercises, and the teaching team is very friendly and helpful - I feel like some of my peers with a stronger relevant background definitely enjoyed it more than me.",
                "Yes! Professor Turk-Browne is a fantastic professor who evidently strives for engagement-based pedagogy. Both the content and overall organization of the course were well above my expectations.",
                "Yes! This is my favorite class I've taken at Yale because I learned so much",
                "Absolutely! With one big caveat. This course has a one-and-a-half day pset turnaround timeline (psets released Tuesday and due Wednesday) that you will either love or hate - or both. It's great to not have to think about the class the rest of the week, but you NEED to have a significant amount of time to work on these psets because they are not easy. If you expect to have busy Tuesdays and Wednesdays, do NOT take this class.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if you're interested in learning more about fMRI analysis and gaining some level of proficiency in it, as well as in reading scientific papers and greatly improving (or further practicing) your python skills, take the class! It's hard, but it's also very rewarding. I've learned more from this class than just about any other course I've taken at Yale."
