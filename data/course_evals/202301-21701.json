            "comments": [
                "I think the quiz evaluation system was great and helped me learn without being impossible and the lectures were all very interesting! I will say that discussion section was relatively unhelpful in terms of preparing for the quiz and stuff.",
                "This class is great! The lectures were super clear, and the expectations for quizzes and the final were well communicated. The content is super interesting, and the open-note/study guide format allowed me to engage with the material without having to drown in memorization.",
                "-would like to see a little more engagement like small homeworks. Was very hard to keep everything including small details that werent in the review or packet in my head especially by the finals",
                "It's actually so much less stressful to have to take a quiz every week and have the studying spread out throughout the semester instead of having many psets and most of the grade concentrated in a few exams. I really enjoyed the organization of this class :) It was also very helpful to have the recordings of lectures posted for the final.",
                "I liked how the course was open note for exams which emphasized understanding of the material rather than simply memorizing names of proteins.",
                "strengths: \r\n- lectures were interesting (although sometimes a bit overwhelming) \r\n- lecture handouts and slides were well constructed and helpful \r\n\r\nweaknesses: \r\n- sometimes I felt like I was being bombarded with so much information that it was really hard to keep track of the big picture. Especially for the signal transduction pathways, I feel like it might have been helpful to go over fewer pathways and emphasize the general principles instead of going over the intricacies of so many pathways. \r\n- on a similar note, sometimes this class felt relentless in a way that impeded my information processing. For example, diving into lecture right after an intense quiz with no break prevented me from taking the necessary few minutes to decompress and relax my brain and prepare to receive more information. If possible, I think implementing a short five-minute break after the quizzes would improve the flow of this class and would actually serve to improve student retention and understanding.",
                "The course is highly organized, and so you do feel like you have more than enough time to prepare in advance for all of the quizzes and material that might be assessed each week. However, because of this it did become easy to immediately forget everything the week after it was tested.",
                "Strengths: Being able to use our notes/packets on the quizzes and exams is a life-saver, especially with so many details packed into each lecture, and doing the review questions during discussion section helped to solidify the key parts of each chapter. Weaknesses were the lecture slides, which sometimes seemed quite long and not as engaging compared to lectures with interactive questions or group thinking Qs posed.",
                "I really love that this course is quiz based. As a student with horrible testing anxiety, having a weekly quiz of relatively low stakes was much more manageable for me than quarterly exams. It forced me to keep up with the content and ensured I didn't fall behind, but also made me feel reassured about making mistakes because I had so many chances with other quizzes. I wish more courses used this format instead of exams.\r\n\r\nI do wish that the quizzes were based on the previous week's Tuesday and Thursday lectures rather than the Thursday from two weeks prior and then the previous Tuesday. It made it hard to keep track of which lectures were being quizzes and also forced the students to backtrack quite a bit to study. \r\n\r\nThis course takes on a massive amount of information. There were very few lectures where we actually finished everything the professor had intended and this often put us a lecture or two behind schedule so that they could catch back up. It's just so much content. Most of it is interesting but it's hard to keep up at times.",
                "I appreciate how all the teaching staff seem to really have students' best interests at heart. I think the course itself is well-structured and I appreciated how learning was emphasized over grades. I feel like a lot of MCDB courses are really one-dimensional, given that professors generally just tend to test on memorization ability, and I think this class is unique from other MCDB courses, in actually explaining and rationalizing the knowledge presented.",
                "Overall, I enjoyed the course and feel like I learned alot. The weekly sections were worth going to and really helped cement the material for me.",
                "On the whole, the lectures were decently engaging, and the material was interesting. \r\n\r\nIt felt like some lectures were very rushed, and it would require a lot of processing of information outside of class. It would also often be difficult to make it to professor office hours.",
                "A LOT of content to be honest  but very interesting content and lecturers were great!",
                "Sometimes the lectures were too long and the quizzed material didnt line up with lectures, which was confusing. Everything else was ideal",
                "Strength: weekly quizzes kept me engaged and up to speed.\r\nWeakness: some lectures may have benefitted from engagement activities (thinking questions to discuss with peers). This would have helped ease the dryness.",
                "Strengths: good course structure, interesting lectures, weekly quizzes that encourage you to review material as you go along in the semester \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the lectures are really rushed  might be better to reduce quantity of content and focus on quality of lectures and material being delivered",
                "I liked the design of this course with the weekly quizzes. I felt like this model required students to keep up with the material and think about it critically. I also enjoyed how this course had three different professors that lectured on topics that they are experts in. I think that discussion sections could be better spent going over particularly difficult concepts in the lectures rather than the sample questions at the end of the review packets.",
                "The class was interesting, although sometimes it was difficult to keep up with lectures. The quizzes weren't terribly difficult, but it was certainly pretty tough to keep up during the more intense parts of the semester; the three drops came in very clutch. I do wish there were more of the little discussion bits where we talked about experimental results during lectures since these helped break up the long streams of lecturing, but I do understand there was a monstrous amount of content to cover in a rather limited timeframe.",
                "Strengths: Weekly quizzes were sometimes torture to study for every week but were deeply essential in learning and retaining the fire-hose of information that was taught. The course was also well-organized and incredibly well-taught. I loved that the emphasis was on synthesizing and understanding information rather than memorizing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Having a separate packet for each lecture would be great (instead of stapling and combining multiple together), and more clarity over which concepts to focus on for quizzes would be great.",
                "- Weekly quizzes were great for consolidating information! Also, the class is definitely set up for you to succeed as much as possible - its clear the professors want you to succeed! The teaching team is fantastic. The final exam is slightly overbearing though.",
                "The strengths of this class is that it is a really good introduction to biology and that the materials provided are very detailed. The weaknesses is that there is so much material and sometimes youre not sure what is really important to study.",
                "Strengths: course/lecture organization... the topics discussed in class followed a very logical progression that helped in connecting topics from the beginning to the end of the semester. Also, the regular review questions were helpful in gauging material comprehension after every lecture.\r\nWeaknesses: students' grades are entirely dependent on performance on the quizzes and the final exam. I think that participation points for attending the weekly discussion sections would be well-received."

                "yes, especially if you are interested in getting a broad overview of cell bio topics. Lectures go fairly in depth about various pathways which can be cool, but most isnt essential info.",
                "Yes, it gives good exposure to a wide range of cell bio topics.",
                "yes (especially if it counts towards your major), but I would recommend taking class before biochem before this if possible as it assumes some biochem knowledge. It's definitely not impossible to learn the necessary biochem/chem principles through this class (that's what I had to do), but I think it's a lot easier if you had some previous biochem knowledge. This class is very interesting, but it's easy to lose track of the big picture due to all of the details and you should be prepared to put in consistent, sustained effort to understand the material of this class (don't be lulled into a sense of false security by the fact that handouts are allowed on the quizzes!).",
                "Yes: If you can organize your time to study at least one day a week to prep for the quizzes. This course is special in that the amount of work that you do is really reflected in what you get out of it. Don't get me wrong, if you don't do the work you aren't going to get an A. However, going to the Peer Tutor Review Sessions, attending Discussion Section, and studying the review material is likely to help you get an A.",
                "Absolutely. If you're an MCDB major and need another core course, this is a great choice. The quiz-based style forces you to keep up with content but also makes the workload relatively low (it's literally only weekly quizzes and the final) and lets you avoid stressful exams. The professors are great and are very excited to answer your questions if you go to their office hours or ask after class. They also tried to make the class interactive even though it was a lecture. I found most of the content to be interesting and well taught. I was worried that I wasn't going to be able to handle the challenge of this course but it ended up being really good and I'm glad I chose to stay in it. Definitely consider it if you're MCDB",
                "Yes, especially for pre-med students taking their MCATs. This class is really well-structured to benefit these students.",
                "I would recommend for anyone who enjoyed the cell bio semester of the introduction bio sequence and anyone who is a MCDB major.",
                "I probably would not recommend this class to someone without pre-existing interest in STEM or more specifically biology. Although the class is more in-depth than the previous experience I had with a cell biology course (something I appreciated about this course), I think that I would only recommend this course to someone that already had a pre-existing interest in the subject.",
                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely I loved this class",
                "Yes, absolutely. You will learn a lot. Its not easy per se, and the weekly quizzes can be challenging. But you wont have to worry about falling behind because the quizzes force you to stay up to date with the content. Its nice taking a science class without psets, and the grading seemed fair throughout.",
                "Yes, this was a very interesting and well tought foundational MCDB course",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I found the material to be quite interesting. If you are an MCDB major, I feel like this course is one of the better foundational courses offered by the department. Be prepared to spend time thoroughly going over the lecture material and packets each week.",
                "Sure! It's a great and very useful core class, and I think people from other majors would also find the content interesting. Certainly a really cool class to credit/d if you're not too concerned about it for your future major path/career.",
                "yes",
                "If you are any kind of bio major (BME, MCDB) or pre-med student, this course is an absolute must! It's a great way to learn cell bio for the MCAT and is also deeply informative.",
                "Yes! Dont be afraid of the workload on coursetable - this course is fantastic for growing as a researcher and student. The teaching team is there to support you completely and it is a great course to learn all about cell biology!",
                "I would recommend this course only if youre in the major or if you are interested in this field. The workload is heavy even thought there are only weekly quizzes.",
                "It's a challenging course, but I would recommend any student who is interested in cell biology to take it. It is an excellent foundational course for other biology classes. So long as you establish a routine from the very beginning of the semester, you will find that the coursework remains relatively the same every week."
