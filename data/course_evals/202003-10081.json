This course also helped me to improve my research skills and my ability to synthesize large amounts and variety of information. Learning from my classmates was also a very interesting and valuable part of this course.",

I learned so much both about the specific challenges facing south Asia (India in particular) as well as about the broader conditions of how colonialism, governance, wealth, power, and local history interact with environmental problems to translate them into social problems. Absolutely my biggest take-away from this class was that environmental justice is social justice, and in fact, to think of them as distinct is to do a real disservice to the complexity of the world at hand.",
                "Coming into this course I was very nervous as I knew nothing about South Asia. However, the professor made it extremely accessible and no prior knowledge was assumed. I learned so much about environmental issues in the region and how they impact local, often marginalised communities",
                "I have learned so much about environmental justice in this course!! (The fact that we learned so much I think allowed us to also realize that we still have so much more to learn!). This class pushed me to question and unlearn various environmental narratives, such as complicating the work of conservation organizations. It was truly eye opening at many times. We also learned how to engage deeply with a specific EJ case through a case study of our choosing.",

                "Great introductory course. For those with some understanding of South Asia, expect some repetition and general ignorance. The readings are fantastic and very usual for anyone considering advanced study on the subject.",
                "I appreciated the variety of resources we were given, having both readings and videos to watch made it easier to consume the material. I liked how specific students were given readings to cover and present on each class because it refreshed our memory on what we've read and started the discussion by presenting how other students interpreted the material. We were given a lot of assistance throughout both the midterm and final essays.",
                "Zoom seminars are hard. Often times class did not feel like a discussion. The first half of class was on the passive side, so professor Shivi would give a lecture, and then two students would present about the reading. I wish more of the class were active, but its hard given that discussions are often very weak due to the nature of zoom exhaustion. Overall the class material was very interesting. My only big critique is that class always ended much later than was promised on the syllabus. For example, the syllabus would say that class would run from 3:30-4:30 or 3:30-4:45 but it would always run til 5:20 or sometime even later. Please either update the syllabus or follow the syllabus better",
                "I thought the readings were great, but the discussions were sometimes not great. Definitely Zoom played a role, but I also felt we spent too much time on student presentations, and the following discussions felt quite disjointed. I think the professor could play a more prominent role in framing seminar discussions.",
                "The breadth and variety of the reading assignments and the discussions by Professor Shivi were definitely strengths of the course. I think that it could be improved by encouraging more discussion of the readings by the whole class, instead of centering so much on the discussants and respondents.",
                "I loved this class. I wish that we could have met in person. I don't really have any criticisms, other than perhaps it would have been helpful to get more detailed feedback on the papers.",
                "I often got confused whenever we went over geography in the course. I think the zoom setting led to a bit of a disconnect when it came to studying maps and understanding regions. It may be more helpful to see the maps in a lecture setting more as it would be in a physical class.",
                "Only strengths. I loved every aspect of the course",
                "I think the readings and class discussions provided insight into very important topics that are usually understudied (at least at Yale\/within the EVST major). The in-class lectures were helpful introductions to the topic but I think the more organic conversation that happened as we asked questions and Shivi provided great insight was the most valuable part of the course (as well as learning from my peers' comments and online discussion posts). With that being said, I think some of the readings were kind of dense and kind of difficult to unpack--the class discussions helped a lot though. I also think the amount of reading was a lot. Thankfully, after we voiced our concerns Professor Shivi adjusted the reading load, and while it definitely became more manageable, it was still the class with most amount of weekly reading I've taken. Despite the workload, I think this was a wonderful class that has really helped me better understand EJ issues and how to think about them.",
                "while the material for the class was interesting, there was genuinely too many videos and required readings assigned each week, which made it difficult to feel excited about going into lecture. furthermore, maybe it was just because of the zoom setting but having nearly two hours of continuous class time felt unnecessary."

Other than that, I think our professor was very nice and understanding of zoom fatigue and always tried to encourage us to talk to each other.",

I also appreciated the professor's independent work opportunities, a group project would have helped to improve engagement. The variety of materials used for the course (media, films, readings, websites, etc) was also helpful. The professor also lessened the workload and responded well to students. In these ways, this class was fun and informativel",

Prof. Shivi, Meenakshi, and Amy's engagement and willingness to help and meet with us outside of class was also very helpful. I think the seminar could be improved by opening it to discussion by the class more.",

                "Yes! Very strong writing and reading course, helps you understand environmental injustices through an anthropological lens. I think this class is great because in high school everything had a very Western perspective and introduced that perspective as fact, but this class acknowledged HOW having that perspective may change our interpretations of certain practices and talked about how we as anthropologists should look at issues in other countries",
                "Yes! Shivi assigns great readings and you can learn a lot from engaging with him outside of class. I also thought the course did a good job of illuminating less considered aspects of environmental justice. It definitely opened my eyes to nuances I had not considered before.",
                "YES absolutely. The professor is fantastic and engaging, the coursework is relevant and interesting. The structure of the course is good.",
                "Yes! I learned so much and took it at the same time as I was taking a conservation biology course. It made it so much clearer how there are political hierarchies in the ways in which environmental science and conservation efforts are carried out.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course has been wonderful and very interesting. It has challenged me to consider issues of both social justice and environmental justice in more nuanced ways and from different perspectives than I had previously approached these issues from. The readings and class lectures were all very interesting, and covered a wonderful variety of issues and approaches.",
                "Absolutely! I loved this class so much. The readings were so fascinating and the classes were really engaging. Although if you have not taken environmental or social justice classes before, you might feel a little bit left out of the conversation.",
                "Yes! I think that the class is a bit fatiguing in the sense that you are covering a lot of information in a short amount of time. The reading is dense and the material is emotionally taxing. I do think it is the kind of class that you need to take a break from after and recharge. Sometimes it feels like the injustices pile up and we are somehow responsible for fixing the problems while also being entirely powerless. I also think if the subject is not of interest to you not to take the class. It does require a deep examination of environmentalism in a specific region.",
                "100%. My favourite course at Yale so far",
                "Yes! I would first think about the workload you can manage, especially if you're taking other seminars\/high workload classes in the same semester. I would also recommend looking at the list of class readings to get a better feel for the course. The class was engaging and at many times, eye-opening and I highly recommend for any student to take this class in order to become more acquainted with and think more critically about EJ issues.",
