The workload was definitely manageable and I enjoyed working on the final project. There are a lot of opportunities to practice speaking Portuguese, and the class was interactive. Weaknesses: some of the activities seemed forced, especially in-class with the group exercises. Giseli's political views would spill into class discussion, making some days uncomfortable when people disagreed with her. Engagement got lower throughout the semester.",
                "strengths: We were encouraged to always speak!\r\n\r\nweaknesses: I felt that we did not have as much time to dive into some works because there was so many."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I love that the Portuguese department at Yale encourages students to enjoy the language learning process and gain a deep appreciation and love for Brazilian culture. The material of this class was fascinating and the readings always led to engaging discussions."
