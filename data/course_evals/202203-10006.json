There was something incredibly refreshing about a space of learning that acknowledged the merit and importance of black studies both when in service to a particular project and when not.",
                "During my time in this class, I learned different ways to synthesize and organize information I've collected through research. Furthermore, working with classmates who had related interests, I was able to collaborate with them to use strategies that they employed, and build my work from their critiques. Lastly, though being encouraged to present my work, I was able to gain a greater understanding of my own topic through having to articulate it to others."

                "I felt, by the end of the semester, that our AFAM 480 class had developed into a genuinely communal space, and the feedback and suggestions I received from both Prof. Hinton and my peers were often very helpful. That said, there came a point where I did feel that both I and my peers had gotten so deep into our individual projects that it was difficult for us to give full-bodied feedback to each other. In other words, it was hard to speak to others projects when not immersed in the same research that they were doing. As such, I think I wouldve appreciated maybe one or two more class sessions in which to either work independently or to meet with Prof. Hinton one-on-one."

Ive been so pleased and excited by the AFAM Department during my time at Yale, both for its faculty/admin and for its courses. Its a department doing vital work and a department filled with some of the most generous people Ive met during my undergraduate years."
