While much of the translation is done from transliterated texts, drawings of cuneiform inscriptions are introduced towards the end of the semester.

            "comments": [
                "This course is incredibly demanding and heavily reliant on student participation. Its strength lies in the commitment of faculty and students to the language, as well as the easy access to the Yale Babylonian Collection. Its very availability is a strength---the information learned in this course cannot be found by Googling or using a translator app. Students are given the opportunity to learn a truly unique skill and work with real tablets.\r\n\r\nHowever, the course could likely be improved by shifting the emphasis in class. This is partially reliant on the students' own willingness to participate. While I hesitate to argue for a greater workload for this course---it is, really, very demanding---I think it could benefit from some further \"checkpoints,\" as it were. I appreciated the review of homework in class, but it sometimes became tedious, feeling like we spent more time writing on the board than talking. I would recommend that the review of exercises become briefer (less exercises could be assigned if necessary to fit this time constraint, though the homework was not unreasonable, in my opinion) and that keys to the exercises be sent out after class. This would relieve the professor of the pressure to adequately explain all answers during class time and let students reach out on any points of confusion. Then, class time could be dedicated to more in-depth lecturing, historical context, linguistics, and group practice. Towards the end of the course, the homework became complex enough that it was impossible to review it all in class, leaving students unsure of if their answers were correct or not. This would also be solved by posting the homework answers after the class.",
                "We learned a lot of vocabulary and basic grammar, as well as enough cuneiform signs to read some of Hammurabi's Laws in their original form. All of this material was presented in a very clear and organized way. The pace of the course was very fast though, and the homework took a long time to complete."

                "yes!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student if they were interested in archaeology, comparative linguistics, or the Akkadian civilization. However, this is not a course anyone should take /just/ to fulfill their language requirement. It offers a set of skills that are incredibly valuable in a very small academic niche. Because of the incredible effort necessary to keep up with all the material, any prospective student should be prepared to dedicate a not insignificant amount of their time to outside work. \r\nThat being said, I had a very fun time taking this course. It was incredibly indulgent as it is not deeply related to my other studies, but I couldn't make myself drop it---the work was way too much fun! I highly recommend Akkadian 110 to any student whose neuroses favor ancient civilizations, esoteric knowledge, or puzzle games.",
                "Yes! Learning Akkadian is such an amazing opportunity, especially since not many places offer it. While it was challenging, it was really fun, and I would recommend it especially if you like ancient languages. We were right next to the Yale Babylonian Collection and got to hold real tablets!"
