   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned how to build arguments in my writing and write papers that didn't follow a the boring 5-paragraph style. It was great to learn how to create a paper that transitioned\/flowed from one idea to the next, and to do it elegantly. Read some really really good books and short stories that will stay with me.",
    "We discussed a wide variety of literature, which has broadened my knowledge and understanding of different types of texts and stories. We also wrote 4 essays over the course of the semester, as it is an English 115 course, so I think my ability to craft an argument and develop it has improved.",
    "Taking this course made me better able to organize papers, develop theses, and smoothly incorporate outside research into papers. Generally, I think this made me a more capable college-level writer, and it translated to my other courses involving writing. This course also exposed me to all different types of literature.",
    "I learned to be a better reader through this course. By that I mean I learned to better analyze complex symbolism as well as to better appreciate beautiful stylistic elements of good writing. I also became a better writer through this course. With four papers and lots of feedback on all them, it was impossible not to improve.",
    "I developed many fundamental skills in academic writing that I didn't previously have. These skills include, but are not limited to, the development of a strong claim and argument and the structure of a good paper. I feel that my writing has improved tremendously throughout the course of this semester, and I owe a great deal of it to this class and to this professor.",
    "I learn to better craft my arguments to be more effective and convincing, and I learned to be less formulaic with my writing. I had to unlearn many of the habits I had relied upon in high school, instead being pushed in this course to actually write effectively, rather than just for a grade.",
    "This course was incredible useful in helping me improve my writing. I really saw progress throughout my four essays and saw my writing improve immensely. The in class discussions and writing work really helped me improve how I think about problems.",
    "I gained many skills in analyzing text and constructing essays. I learned how to read critically, and became better at discussing readings and ideas with a group of people. My ability to develop and write an essay was immensely improved. I learned how to chose and build an argument, and gained more technical skills in prose and style. I also gained insight into the discussion of Good Literature and what qualifies a work as \"good\". Overall this class made me write and think in new and exciting ways."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Ryan is just an amazing professor and friend. The class is extremely engaging and I thoroughly enjoyed all the discussions we had in class. Also,  meeting with him about papers is extremely helpful. His insights are great and his criticism on papers is really meant to help us grow and learn. \r\nWeakness: none, I absolutely loved Ryan!!",
    "Strengths include the volume and variety of texts we read, the amount of writing we produced, in-class discussions, reading annotations through Hypothesis (so we could see each other's comments), and the feedback we received. For me, a major issue throughout the year was figuring out what to write about in my essays, or what my main \"question\" was, so I think more guidance in the beginning of the year on that front would have been helpful. I also liked the discussions that Professor Wepler led, because they seemed more on-track, cohesive, and illuminating, so I think fewer peer-led discussions would have been nice.",
    "The strengths of the course are the way it helps you learn through doing, most of the writing skills I developed came from writing and revising my own papers as well as revising those of my peers. \r\nAs far as weaknesses go I think class can sometimes drag on if the discussions are slow or if the reading from the night before was really dense.",
    "Good Literature was an amazing course. Ryan was always so open with his time and gave us feedback on all of our papers. More than this however, being the head of the writing center, Ryan was committed to teaching us the tools of how to write, giving us handouts and excerpts from Style on the elements of good writing. He was always clear for his criteria for good writing and showed us many samples of student writing, critiquing them as well as applauding them. Discussions in this class were also very good. In having a different student lead each class, Ryan handed over control of each discussion to the students. He also did a great job popping in with insightful comments and pointing he discussion in a different direction.",
    "There are many strengths to this course, and in my opinion, little to no weaknesses. I think this course was very engaging and really helped me to improve. I believe that the strength of this course lies in its very essential question and the way that the professor structured the class around this question but was also able to teach the class more general things about writing as a whole through the analysis and close reading of literature.",
    "I did not think there were many weaknesses in this course to be honest. The strongest part of this course was the feedback I received on my writing.",
    "This class had many strengths. For one, I loved the readings that were assigned throughout the semester. They covered such a wide breadth of genres and authors, I feel like I was exposed to literature I never would have seen otherwise. The books we read were also interesting and engaging, but the short stories from the beginning of the semester were my personal favorite. I also loved the discussion style set-up of the class. In high school, very few people ever contributed to English class. So coming to this class every week and having my classmates constantly engaged and excited about the material was so wonderful to be around. Ryan was great at letting us get our ideas out, while also advancing and illuminating the discussion whenever we got stuck. \r\nAs for weaknesses, I really don't think there were any. We could have spent more time working on the essays in class, discussing things like style etc, but I think the meetings with Ryan served as a way to do that while saving class time for more interesting discussions."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!! Take this class. The course readings are very engaging. I normally don't read a lot on my own, but I found myself breezing right through the books. Super engaging!! And, Ryan is overall just an amazing professor. Absolutely loved him.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I really loved all the texts we read (that we were supposed to love, anyway), and it was definitely helpful in preparing me for college writing. I also think Professor Wepler is a very good professor.",
    "Yes definitely, I think it's a really good way to prepare yourself for college writing without entirely focusing on the mechanics of writing. I think this is a good course for people that want to improve writing but also want to read good books, the literature and the discussions about the literature was one of my favorite parts of the course.",
    "Highly. Good Literature was one of the best literature courses I have ever taken. Ryan is a fantastic teacher and it is clear that he cares about every one of his students. He is always willing to talk about ideas for a paper or to go over proposed edits. The workload is challenging but definitely manageable. There are four papers in total as well as annotation assignments for each reading. It is expected that you put in effort into the class but it was so rewarding. I feel as though I am a much more confident and better writer as a result of this course. Ryan's love for good literature and good writing is infectious and is something I take with me for the rest of my life.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I think that it was intellectually stimulating and that the class offers a close-group environment that fosters academic success and general wellbeing. The professor gave strong advice that really improved my writing, and the literature read was extremely fascinating. The entire course made me a better writer.",
    "I would. This course was not only very interesting and engaging, it also taught me the best way to write with regards to college papers. Had I not taken this course, I would have thought that I was a good writer and that my writing was well-suited for college, but this course showed me the shortcomings of my writing and pushed me to find the best version of my writing. My writing throughout the rest of college will be greatly improved because of this course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! If you want to improve your writing and feel confident about writing in college take this course.",
    "I have already recommended this class to other students, and would absolutely do so again. It was a wonderful class for building and enhancing writing skills, with interesting texts and a great environment. The workload felt challenging but never overwhelming, and Ryan was constantly an instructive and supportive teacher. The class was also very well organized, and I never felt confused about what was expected of me. For someone who wants to help their essay writing while also taking an interesting and engaging class, this course was perfect."
