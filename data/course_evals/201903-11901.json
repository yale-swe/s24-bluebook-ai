    "I thought the class would be primarily focused on data wrangling and working with data sets, but we ended up going through statistical theory for 95% of the semester (and didn't cover 1\/3 of the intended material). Part of this is because Meyers is a visiting professor (JDRS will probably return as the professor after this year). If you took S&DS 220 with Joe Chang, don't take this course, since the extent of R coding is pretty much the same (you go over some extra stuff regarding cleaning and joining data frames, but not anything you wouldn't be able to stackexchange).",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "First time Ethan taught the course so he was unsure how Yale works. More basic R teaching in the beginning.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- really good pace\r\n- put an AI and application spin on it\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- More practice for the midterm\r\n- more structure about the course upfront (changed a lot)",
    "The weaknesses of this course lay in the exam and final structure. The midterm did not resemble the problem sets and I actually thought that it was quite unreasonable. Having a final and a final project is excessive.",
    "This course had informative lecture slides and helpful live, interactive examples on RStudio Cloud where the professor would fill in the code along with us. I found this to be very helpful.",
    "I think the course does a dangerous dance of trying to teach us how to code things that we are assumed to have learned in introductory statistics. Frankly speaking, the beginning of the course was very much in line with statistical concepts that I was familiar with, but the latter stages of the course forayed into more complex statistical analyses that I was not fully comfortable with. The primary issue with this, however, was that the scope of this class did not include going into the theoretical statistical background required to fully understand the tests we were running, so this made it difficult at times to verbalize the findings we found. I think the structure of the class was helpful, however, in that we were lectured about what we were going to do and then we went ahead and did these things in R.",
    "The pace of the class could be sped up in the beginning (through simulations and up to t tests), slowed down through regression and ANOVA, and perhaps better regulated so that it actually gets to data wrangling. The homework assignments are too guided and easy (just regurgitating code lines found on the homework), and I actually found S&DS 220 psets to be more challenging and thought provoking. People did not show up to class starting from week 4. There should be faster feedback on homeworks, and more clarity regarding the final project guidelines. The final project was also not introduced until about mid-October, which would have changed my mind about what courses I am taking this semester had I known during shopping period.",
    "Ethan Meyers reminds me of when Jerry turns into that sad monster in Rick and Morty. I honestly dont think he was prepared to teach a class this large.",
    "The course was quite a good overview of R. I enjoyed the material and the lectures.\r\n\r\nHowever, the grading and assessment portions were a nightmare; particularly, the final exam. We had a line of 25 students trying to ask the professor questions for an in-class coding assessment (for students that are learning to code) that actually made taking the test quite difficult as it was very loud and unclear about what the instructions were. I think that Professor Meyers should be a little more thoughtful about how to assess performance in the course.",
    "Strengths are that it is not that hard to follow along and the programming is fairly intuitive. This course's lectures should be videotaped. Would make life a lot lot easier for a lot of people.",
    "I thought the assignments were very good in helping to practice and reinforce concepts taught in class, and also allowed us to engage with interesting data. Professor Meyers also inserted lots of memes and such during class which was entertaining. Lots of peer tutor office hours during the week provided sufficient opportunities to get help. Weaknesses: t I feel as though the exam had a lot of multiple choice questions which tested arbitrary details in definitions and such, rather than a general understanding of can you understand statistics and work with data. Deadlines were also often getting moved so it was sometimes unclear when things were due.",
    "Strengths are that the course showed many valuable statistical test that could be applied in the real world.\r\nno real weaknesses.",
    "Weaknesses-- unorganized and uninformed professor and extremely unfair final exam that broke several final exam codes\/guidelines. Did not really get anything out of this class that I couldn't have looked up online.",
    "Strengths: interesting and useful content\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: poorly taught this semester, unclear targets for learning, course material moved through at unhelpful and wildly variable pace (e.g. cover a ton of material without explanation one day, cover very little material but in a lot of depth the next day), exams that tested material that wasn't cover and asked very unclear questions",
    "The course is generally well-organized for learning R coding and statistical concepts. I understand that it is difficult to teach coding in a lecture setting, and I believe Professor Meyers did a good job balancing both tasks in class. Also, I have never seen Piazza used so effectively. It was a great learning tool. The problem sets were sometimes confusing because there was a bit of a learning curve to understand how the concepts we learned in class would be applied to the questions given, but overall it was conducive to learning.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness, I believe, was the assignment scheduling throughout the course. During the beginning of the course, on the syllabus there was only a final exam with the possibility of having a final project instead being discussed; after our midterm, we were notified that we will have a final project on top of the existing final exam, which was an unexpected additional burden. This was very disappointing since I already had a very busy semester with my major requirements. My biggest complaint is not the final project itself, but the fact that it was introduced more than halfway through the semester, at which point I already had other assignments which made it doubly difficult to spread the burden across time. Better organization of assignments and better communication of what to expect would really improve the experience for future students.",
    "There sometimes seemed to be a bit of a disconnect between the rather abstract concepts we were learning and the way we applied them in R; that is, it was unclear exactly how a formula, for example, corresponded to the way we used R to get the result or statistic associated with the formula. The midterm was also frustrating in that it focused on concepts and had lots of tricky multiple choice questions where multiple answers could be selected; I thought it wasn't a great reflection of what we spent most of our time in class doing. That said, it's a pretty solid course overall, and this was Prof. Meyers's first (and only?) time teaching it, so snags were expected.",
    "Strengths: Professor was flexible and open to students' feedback.\r\nWeaknesses: Unclear deadlines, lectures were not structured well, poor communication in general.",
    "Professor Meyers is a nice professor but he could have taught concepts a bit more in depth. The problem sets and exams were definitely on the harder side and I do not think we were ready enough for them based on what we learnt in class. The office hours were super helpful though and we went through each and every question during office hours!",
    "To preface, I took this class credit\/d, which was a great decision.\r\n\r\nI learned how to use R pretty well, and class was geared toward using R and data analysis with R.  Psets were pretty manageable and while challenging you were able to do them.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were the tests, which often tested us on very intense statistical premises that the class simply to be able to learn.  We spent all of class on R, without the real ability to understand these premises, and then would try to answer these questions in very hard tests, and it just went very badly.  The workload was pretty significant regardless of the fact that I was taking it credit\/d, which was annoying, but to be expected considering this is a class whose work is primarily coding.",
    "Strengths -- homeworks every week challenged me to apply the concepts I learned in class. \r\nWeaknesses -- I feel like the class was not very structured and focused way too much on statistical concepts when it was supposed to be a lot more application based. Also, the final had some questions that were confusing and definitely not anything we have learned in class.",
    "The Strength of this course was the material itself, as I can definitely see myself using this information in the future. However, there were some weaknesses in the course. One thing is that Ethan has too many typos! In his presentations and Homework. And its not just any regular typo, these are typos that are essentially to understanding the slides\/homework. Many students have missed points on homework assignments because of issues like that. Another weakness were the exams and final project (we should not have both!) . The midterm exam was on paper, and it was extrememly difficult. The questions that were asked were beyond the scope of what we learned (especially the multiple choice section). The final exam was even worse, where part of the exam was on the computer. Many students were having technical difficulties and no other TA was there to help him, so it was him debugging code on everyone's laptop. Now imagine, if you were taking a timed exam and your laptop crashes when you are taking it. That produced unnecessary stress and anxiety levels. The exam should have just been on paper, or maybe we should have only had just a final project and not both.",
    "Strengths: Learned how to use R, although not for very advanced purposes. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Wasn't very well organized. Homework was too similar to classwork.",
    "Psets were fun to do; material was interesting; R was fun to play around with\r\n\r\nExams tested concepts which sometimes weren't explicitly gone through in class; professor was quite cavalier in his attitude; course wasn't very well organized and I felt like I didn't really learn much apart from syntax. Professor was bad at teaching concepts and at telling us what we need to know for the course, resulting in students getting confused at times. I felt like I could have learnt the material easily online by myself; value-add was minimal.",
    "There should not be an in-class final and a final project, especially with a homework due the week before. Also, the in-class final was on R, and, unsurprisingly, R crashed and tons of people had technical difficulties, which made it a total clusterheck. I have no idea how they can fairly assess the final given all of the problems. I also wish we had learned more about the overarching structure of R and how to do basic functions such creating project and then loading data from the internet.",
    "The piazza system didn't seem to work well as many questions were left unanswered but gradescope was good.",
    "The course is a good level of difficulty for an introduction to R and data analysis, and seems to cover all the important topics. However, I felt like a lot of the explanations of certain tests\/concepts was unsatisfying with only a cursory discussion of the math behind it.",
    "I think Ethan should really set the assignments and deadlines from the beginning of the semester and not take polls because it does not represent the whole truth because many students do not arrive to class at 9am.",
    "The lectures seemed to be all over the place. The midterm and the final covered material that we did not learn in this class. Students were often frustrated by the harshness of the exams.",
    "Strengths: Material is pretty standard, lecture notes and code were always available online (although it would have been nicer if they were recorded like in previous years). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course was not engaging at all. The homework assignments were always very easy, because you could complete them by just copying the class notes and also going on piazza (where basically all of the answers would be posted). Lectures were pretty boring and most people did not go. I found the midterm and final to be pretty difficult because they tested the theory behind the statistical concepts we had learned, but the theory was pretty much glossed-over in class and we spent most of each lecture just watching the prof type out code. Even when I went to class I didn't really see any difference in how well I was doing and I don't think the concepts were explained well at all. I decided to take this class because many others had recommended it to me, but I honestly didn't learn that much. I think learning statistical methods is important for everyone to learn, but this class really wasn't it.",
    "Strengths: Weekly problem sets and lectures facilitated learning well.\r\nWeaknesses:  The final exam was done on a computer, but I feel that it unnecessarily complicated things.",
    "This course was one of the most disappointing I have taken at Yale. I found it very unorganized. The midterm exam was not an evaluation of what we had been taught in the classit treated statistical theories whereas we had only been learning how to code in R. The professor spoke about his salary during class in a manner that I thought was inappropriate. The final exam was conducted in a way that blatantly violated Section G of Yale's Academic Regulations. Students who claimed to have computer issues (these claims were never verified) were allowed to take home the exam and receive twice the time that the rest of the students received (violating the rules in Section G that state that the exam must be administered in the assigned location and at the assigned time, and a take-home option, if it is offered, must be offered to all students, not just some). The professor did not provide a separate version of the exam as the take-home, but let some students take home THE SAME version of the exam (yet another violation of Section G). Additionally, there were no proctors other than the professor for a class of over 150 students, many of whom were blatantly cheating during the entire exam. The line of people waiting to speak with the professor at the front of the auditorium at some points neared 20, and the disruption this caused (everyone was talking at full volume) made it impossible for the rest of the class to concentrate on the exam. Some students were eating potato chips during the test, others were talking to students around them. The professor awarded extra time to students who volunteered to fix other people's \"computer issues.\" I have never taken an exam that so clearly and egregiously violated University policies.",
    "The course was good overall, but with a few significant problems. The main one was that initially the course was scheduled to have a final, but the instructor held an in-class vote after shopping period was over to change the final into a project and a final each worth about half the original final. This is not what many people signed up for, and the change was made after schedules were due. Also, Professor Meyers seemed to try to rush many topics to try to get quantity of content in over quality of explanation.",
    "Strengths: TA office hours. Weaknesses: by the second half of the semester, the coding got more heavy, and it wasn't covered in class. It was almost impossible to do the problem sets without already being very proficient in R or going to office hours, which is pretty ridiculous. We weren't taught much statistics in the second half, mostly whatever Ethan wanted to teach, and class wasn't very helpful.",
    "The class structure was clear and facilitated learning.  R Cloud Studio and the powerpoint made going back and looking at the notes easy and understandable.  Gradescope also helped make clear what I needed to improve on.",
    "The biggest weakness was the range of ability levels, and the tendency for this to show in lecture. It made things frustrating when lecture became bogged down in questions over concepts that can easily be learned on one's own. It could be improved by encouraging students to go to office hours--and to learn how to Google.",
    "lectures were pretty boring tbh but i think that's just the nature of the material. learning to code was fun. strength is prof meyers bc he was super nice and always helpful at office hours.",
    "this was the worst course i have ever taken at yale. never have i seen an instructor who was so inexperienced and incompetent. i am so annoyed that i refuse to capitalize any of my letters nor devote any further time to this course evaluation, but suffice to say that whoever hired ethan meyers did not give any thought to how he would actually teach a class of 200 students with multiple grading curves when he has never graded students, taught in a non-seminar format, or had to make a decision in his life. please do not ever ever ever ever ask this man to teach an introductory lecture again, and certainly don't give him one of JDRS' courses. the only good things about this course were the competent TFs and that it gave me a new appreciation for being on financial aid: while i was definitely wasting some of my parents' money, at least i wasn't wasting upwards of $7000 on this trainwreck of a class.",
    "-seems to speed up quickly after the midterm \r\n-new professor this semester so it was a final exam instead of a take-home final which proved to be very hard \r\n-style of multiple choice where there could be more than one correct answer but you get points off for every wrong answer was horrendous and makes you scared to make an educated guess \r\n-psets were fun to do and were not tricky at all from an R perspective\r\n-from a statistics perspective - often felt rushed and you were expected to know concepts that weren't really explained in class and there was no textbook to refer to so made studying for the theory part of the exams hard  \r\n-gradescope was a great way to mark the psets as we got a lot of useful feedback",
    "One of the biggest strengths of this class was the opportunity to explore R and data science further with the final project. However, the abrupt introduction of a midterm and final exam really sucked the fun out of this introductory class.",
    "Course was great in terms of content. The use of a midterm, final and final project was quite excessive and in coding it did not represent our ability well since the midterm was scored harshly.",
    "I think the course material was insightful but the professor this semester did not explain it well.",
    "I enjoyed the course, but I found that there was too much focus on coding in R and not enough focus on exploring the theory behind the code.",
    "There could have been more abstract reinforcement of material.",
    "I appreciated the emphasis on using real-world data; it made the material more easy to understand and made the class feel very applicable. In addition, \r\nI liked how we learned a variety of statistical techniques and the various pros and cons. One way the class could be improved is I would have liked it if we spent more time on the theory to provide a deeper understanding of the material.",
    "This course taught R pretty well, which was good; I also think I got decent at figuring R syntax out on my own over time, which was definitely encouraged by the instructors. One thing I really struggled with was that the lectures were conceptional (eg statistics concepts) and practical (R syntax), the problem sets were almost exclusively practical (R syntax), but the midterm and final had both. I really struggled with how to study the conceptual parts, because there were 2 conceptional practice problems for the midterm and none for the final. There were no example problems from lecture or problem set questions I could draw from. \r\n\r\nThe course was extremely poorly organized, and that significantly interfered with my learning. I didn't love was that we frequently would cover a topic in many chunks, e.g. 20 minutes in one lecture, 30 minutes in the next, and maybe another 30 minutes a week later; this meant that we were juggling multiple topics across multiple lectures. I would have preferred to cover each concept in its entirety in one or two lectures.  \r\n\r\nTo name a couple of more specific examples of poor organization: 1) most homework assignments had multiple errors, which was frustrating; 2) we were told we would have a final OR or a final project, but after the drop deadline we were told we would have BOTH; 3) the due date for the final project was changed several times, including in the hours before it was due, but sometimes this was only communicated over Piazza, which most students do not read in its entirety (this happened with several other important pieces of information); and 4) the grading style on the exams was not transparent at all (for example, on the midterm multiple choice, circling the correct answer AND an incorrect answer could result in 0 points for the question, which is not typical; for the final, the extra credit question (which I spend several minutes on) only counted if you lost points on one previous question, not the rest of the final, which was also not clear until I got the final back). \r\n\r\nI think the final straw for me was other parts of the final. We were to have it in Davies, which has no plugs, with computers. When this was brought to the attention of Professor Meyers by a student, he decided to shorten the exam (so that computer batteries would last), but this wasn't communicated well (I didn't really understand how long it would be going in, despite reading Piazza aggressively). During the exam, there were a number of technical issues, and so many people could not submit their finals that Professor Meyers stopped recording who had technical issues (so many people without technical issues stayed and worked past the allotted time). It didn't help that Professor Meyers showed up to the exam alone with no TAs (~150 person lecture). It was also really stressful that we received an incorrect score for multiple choice during the exam, which freaked me out because the scores were universally low (for context, I ended up getting around 40% higher in the final version than what Canvas told me originally). The feedback we were later given on the final referred several times to the \"solutions\" but I could not find them online anywhere.\r\n\r\nOverall, this was a very poorly organized class.",
    "I'm not sure in class exams that focus on the theory of stats are as in line with the meaning of the course as are projects that show our understanding in R. That being said, I still understand that knowing statistics as a foundation for why we were running models and using certain tests was necessary, it just didn't feel as justifiable during our midterm which was mostly stats knowledge rather than R knowledge.",
    "The lectures went very fast and sometimes we did not understand the code in class",
    "The course follows a logical sequence and the homeworks are manageable. Some of the organizational issues surrounding exams could've been handled better.",
    "Stats 230 was a good overview and introduction to R. I think it could have gone into a smaller number of topics but in more depth. For example, instead of learning about how to make maps or use emojis for glyphs, I think I would have appreciated a stronger unit on how to find, evaluate, and clean data. (I found this to be the hardest part of the final project, because data was typically given to us prepared for our problem sets.)\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion for improvement is that I strongly recommend there only be a larger final project at the end of the course. I believe a final project is more rigorous than a final exam, and a better reflection of our ability to synthesize the material we have learned all semester. If all the time that was spent grading our final exams was divided and allocated to spending a little more time evaluating our final projects, I think this could be feasible (as it has been done for 230 during other semesters). Also, the final exam ended up being quite hectic, and I think it was unfair to students who did not have computer problems (which for many people, seemed just to be errors in their code) that other people got to take the exam as a take-home. Asking students to help de-bug other students code during the final exam is not appropriate, and the professor did not note which of us students helped other students fix their code. Also, students should have had to submit their Canvas quiz before moving to the other section, as some students did seem to Google answers that could have affected their responses to the first section.",
    "There was a lot of back and forth with what deadlines were and I never saw my curved midterm grade which was a little stressful.",
    "Overall it was a pretty solid course. I liked that lecture slides and class code were available online so that I could go over them again if I missed anything in class. I found it frustrating that so little of the syntax of R was even mentioned in class - figuring out the syntax for things that could've been explained in 30 seconds in class ended up taking up about half the total time I spent on homework.",
    "The strength of this course was the powerpoint slides aiding the lecture. We also had weekly pset following the lectures so we could have hands-on experience. However, I disliked the fact that the course had both a final project and a final exam. I believe either form would have done a fine job in assessing students' skills and knowledge. The additional final assignment added extra workload for us during finals period. The final project and the coding section on the final exam were similar. This adds to my argument that there should be only one final assignment.",
    "go over concepts a bit more in depth",
    "Strengths: I really liked the variety of the concepts and tools we learned and really felt like I learned quite a lot! Lecture was also pretty entertaining as Prof Meyers always tried his best to include jokes in his slides and ake the class more engaging. He also really tried to hamer down concepts by bringing them up several times which I appreciated and found helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class was a bit disorganized and not managed the best, but I'm sure that's because it was his first time teaching it and his first time teaching at Yale and such a large class",
    "Get a different professor.",
    "The strengths: homework assignments were relatively easy to follow and understand given the class code\r\nThe weaknesses: in my opinion the 2 exams were very poorly formatted, and placed too much emphasis on relatively obscure \/ vague multiple choice questions that did adequately assessed our understanding of the class material. I think that a take home exam (as there were in past semesters with JRS) would be far better suited for this class."

   "comments": [
    "Maybe if Ethan understood Yale classes more than he did in the beginning it would have been better",
    "Yes, the p-sets are really awesome and you learn a lot!",
    "I would recommend this class if JDRS is teaching it, but don't take it if anyone else is. It's a good class where you have the potential to learn a lot of useful things, but a good professor is key.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who has a strong introductory background in statistics and is interested in learning about how to use R.",
    "I would very much recommend this course as an introduction to more complex concepts in Statistics and Data Science, but I would suggest that future students have a robust knowledge of introductory statistics or that future students engage more heavily in theoretical reading throughout the course of the class to have a higher level understanding of what is going on.",
    "YES, everyone should take this class. Using R for data analysis and visualization is an IMPORTANT and HELPFUL skill to develop. Don't let the anticipated workload scare you away, none of it is busy work and ALL of it is engaging and directly helps you to improve your skills.",
    "I think the usual class with JDRS is better, so this year is just an anomaly. You should take it if you're interested in learning how to use R, and how to work with data!",
    "Yes, I actually would for students that want an introduction to R. Hopefully by next year, the course is better structured for students.",
    "Yes! The project is a great way to do some real stats work, and the psets are not long at all.",
    "Yes! I really learned a lot and the content is very important to many fields that involve data.",
    "Yes, it is a great intro to stats class for those who want to major in S&DS.",
    "NO!!!!! I think this semester was an aberration because of the visiting professor. But if Ethan Meyers is ever teaching this class again, wait until a semester when he isn't.",
    "It depends on who is teaching it honestly. I really enjoyed the material and feel like I learned what I wanted to (e.g. basic R), but the teaching made it really difficult to feel like I was learning a lot in lectures\/was prepared for exams. Most of what I learned was by asking questions in OH and the class time felt a bit useless.",
    "If the suggested changes are implemented, then it would be a strong yes. Overall, it was a good course. As suggested above, if the assignments are scheduled better, it would be a strong course.",
    "Yes.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, as an introduction to data analysis.",
    "Yes! It is an important class to take if you want to do something in R.",
    "You will learn a lot on the psets but the tests were awful, and there was no clear metric to determine how you were doing in the class.",
    "Yeah, learning R is useful",
    "I mean it will be a different professor teaching the next time I'm assuming since Meyers is a visiting professor. In terms of the material, I think learning how to script and run statistical tests is useful so I would recommend people who are interested in big data or anything of the sort to take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This is because 230 is such a useful class in other things (research, jobs, etc). If you care about your grade (and do not want to work that hard to get a good one) I would recommend taking it in the spring with JRS.",
    "Yes, if you are looking to learn R, which is a useful skill for almost any field.",
    "Not really, can learn it online yourself. It's kinda fun though",
    "Yes good at teaching basic statistics.",
    "This course is valuable because it unites statistics with data analysis, which I think is a really applicable skillset. Learning R was easy and useful, I was able to apply it in my research.",
    "Ethan is a GREAT teacher and did an amazing job dealing with stressed Yale students who were only concerned about grades every second. His jokes were also really funny and he made a 9am class enjoyable to come to and I learned a lot. He is very receptive to feedback and offered so many outlets for help outside of class making it very easy to be successful in this class. This was my favorite class this semester and I am grateful for all the work Ethan put in during class and office hours.",
    "I would, especially after this professor receives feedback. Teaching us DPLYR was very valuable and I cannot wait to learn more. This is a valuable skill.",
    "I would not. I think this semester had a lot of unpredictability due to a new professor, and I'd recommend anyone else wait until the Spring to take it with JDRS, when you'll already know what to expect from the class. It turned out to be more difficult than I expected based on past reviews of the class, and not in a good way since I don't feel that I learned any more than I would have in a different semester.",
    "Great exposure to R.  Helps to develop your coding in R.",
    "Under no circumstances should you take a class with this professor. Wait for this class to be taught by Jonathan Reuning-Scherer. This class was the worst class I have taken at Yale. The homework was easy enough but not very conducive to learning. The midterm exam did not include what we had actually been taught in the class (it was all about statistical theory whereas we had only been learning how to code in R and hadn't discussed the concepts that were on the midterm). The professor talked about his salary to the class in a way that I found highly inappropriate. By far the worst part of this class was the final exam. It was administered in a way that blatantly violated Section G of Yale's Academic Regulations. Students who claimed to have computer issues (these claims were never verified) were allowed to take home the exam and receive twice the time that the rest of the students received (violating the rules in Section G that state that the exam must be administered in the assigned location and at the assigned time, and a take-home option, if it is offered, must be offered to all students, not just some). The professor did not provide a separate version of the exam as the take-home, but let some students take home THE SAME version of the exam (yet another violation of Section G). Additionally, there were no proctors other than the professor for a class of over 150 students, many of whom were blatantly cheating during the entire exam. The line of people waiting to speak with the professor at the front of the auditorium at some points neared 20, and the disruption this caused (everyone was talking at full volume) made it impossible for the rest of the class to concentrate on the exam. Some students were eating potato chips during the test, others were talking to students around them. The professor awarded extra time to students who volunteered to fix other people's \"computer issues.\" I have never taken an exam that so clearly and egregiously violated University policies. There is no way that that exam was a fair evaluation of the students' knowledge and work. Please, please, please, do not take a class with this professor.",
    "Yes, but perhaps under a different professor.",
    "Yes. If their is one non major related class to take 230 is the one.",
    "If you want to learn R, take this course! But maybe with another professor.",
    "Yes, it is important statistics and data visualization topics that everyone should know regardless of their major.",
    "If you've taken a more mathematical stats class, then yes, as it will be a pretty straightforward class and it's good for learning the conceptual side of things. Also good practice in R. If you've only taken an intro stats class, it'll still be fine; it might just take a little more time to understand what's happening\/figure out how to do things.",
    "sure why not. not too hard. get to learn R.",
    "no dear god no. not unless you want to find out in late november that instead of having a final exam OR a final project you get BOTH and the deadlines are changed several times.",
    "Yes! Interesting psets and lectures",
    "Would recommend the class students how may already have a clear grasp of introductory statistics. This course takes it one step further and offer approaches to analyze data with R. However, this course was would be a lot more useful with a professor who has experiences teaching.",
    "Absolutely. Coding is super important and very cool when applied to statistics. The course is an excellent into to it without too much work.",
    "Id recommend this course if Ethan Meyers does not teach it. He made the class a lot harder than I expected and the tests werw unfair.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I definitely improved my knowledge of statistics.",
    "I would but know that you may have to teach yourself a bit. It takes some time to get through the psets.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I learned a lot about statistics and became comfortable with using R.",
    "Loved this course. Gave me a genuine desire to learn R and data science. Prof Meyers is also the best.",
    "With another professor, perhaps; with Professor Meyers, probably not. There's a lot of important and material to be learned in this course, but taking it with Professor Meyers was rather trying (very poorly organized logistics that significantly interfered with learning and not great lectures). If you have a good conceptual understanding of statistics and are comfortable with a poorly run class, I think the course could be okay. If you rely on the lectures to learn statistics, I would wait for another professor to teach the course.",
    "Yes! This course is well organized and was honestly a great time. I feel like I have a moderately good grasp on R which is exactly what I wanted out of this course.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who want to learn programming in R. Its a good intro class but can get boring sometimes. Youll probably skip 90% of the lectures and still be fine.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to get a practical understanding of statistics.",
    "Yes, if you are looking for a solid, not-too-time-intensive intro to R.",
    "Yeah if you need\/want the content.",
    "If the student would like to use R to run statistics and manipulate data sets in the future, yes. Otherwise, no.",
    "yes, good intro to r and application to stats, which is important",
    "I would recommend this to students who want to practically apply the skills they learned in intro statistics classes that perhaps were more theoretical or for those who have some stats background and data science background but lack the theoretical basis as to why they do things.",
    "I would recommend taking this course, but with a different professor.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student who is hoping to develop basic R \/ stats skills."
