This really boosted my understanding of these principles from the abstract to be more concrete. I also learned a ton about the economics of 18th and 19th century Europe (obviously), which really helped my understanding of the general history of the continent in a far more fundamental way than I anticipated.",

                "I enjoyed the no-lecture-slides and no-recording policy of the class, since it placed more emphasis on attendance and engagement. The absence policy is very generous and much appreciated especially during more difficult seasons.",
                "The course is great at cramming tons of information about such a wide region across a fair amount of time into your head I am walking away knowing far more about the undercurrents of European history than I walked in, and I study European history for my major! Professor Guinnane is a real strength, his no-nonsense (except some truly corny if fun jokes) makes sure you are learning and understand why you are learning. \r\n\r\nA weakness would definitely be the problem sets there are only three, but they are pretty disconnected from the sort of material you learn in class. Imagine you are taking a history lecture with an occasional supply/demand graph thrown in every once in a while and some econ jargon, and then all of sudden your pset has you scrambling for your ECON116 notes again. It's very doable, and the TF Office Hours are a godsend, but it was a bit of a weak point incorporating more of the problems into lecture could have been nice.",
                "The course is perfectly structured in my opinion: small lecture, great professor, interesting content, helpful assignments.",
                "It's a great class. teaches you a lot about how to think about the world in terms of economics.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to keep up with the note taking.",

                "Prof. G is great",
                "Not much instruction is given on how to do the problem sets in lecture but there is help available in office hours if you go.",
                "I think the course offered wide variety of topics that were interesting.  While the course had a lot of interesting content, I think there was too much reading.  Also, the course wasn't very user-friendly with exams as you are not allowed to ask questions during them.",

As a history major, I feel I am walking away with a far better understanding not just of the actual history of the region but why the sorts of phenomena my other classes discuss might be occurring. I don't know how useful it is to the overall Econ major.\r\n\r\nAs a general student, I would still recommend the class its not too hard, and the topic covered (if you think you might find it interesting) is really rewarding to learn and apply to the rest of one's studies.",
