    "I sort of wish we went a little bit faster so we could have learned even more than we did.",
    "Strengths is it is fun and engaging to students; makes students excited for class. \r\n\r\nCould be improved organizationally, and also by posting scores on canvas. I still do not know what my grade is in the class, as it has been listed as N\/A on Canvas all semester.",
    "Only strengths, the teachers and teaching fellows used a mix of Indonesian and English in class to get their students to begin thinking in Indonesian and responding appropriately.",

    "TAKE THIS CLASS! This has been my favorite class at Yale! Pak Indriyo is the nicest professor and really cares about the language and his students. The teaching assistants are also amazing and are there to help you with everything! Outside of class, Pak Indriyo and the assistants have gone to students' events\/performances\/games and had picnics\/events to learn more about Indonesia. The language itself is not difficult to learn and the workload is low. Pak Indriyo makes this class fun and interactive! Best language to take at Yale!",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes, if they want a fun language credit with lower work load.",
    "Yes because you will learn so much not only about the language of Indonesia but also about the culture from the perspective of a teacher who grew up in Jawa.",
    "Yes"
