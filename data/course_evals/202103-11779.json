                "I improved as a writer and also learned a lot about influential writers in American literature.",
                "I appreciated the different types of writing we explored in this class, as well as the variety of books. It introduced me to genres I had both engaged with before and ones I previously hadn't necessarily discussed in an academic setting.",
                "I learned about careful reading and revising my writing. The ability to revise papers for a week after they are returned to you with comments is invaluable and makes you a much better writer. I really think my writing got better over the course of the semester and I learned alot about american authors that I had not encountered before.",
                "I had the opportunity to read a lot of famous works in American Literature. I also feel like my ability to critically analyze literature was vastly improved by this course. I also learned a lot of interesting information from the various presentations in class.",
                "Broad understanding of 19th and 20th century American writers",
                "I developed skills on how to glean deeper insights when reading a fictional text, in particular, by noticing the structure, word choice, and stylistic patterns an author employs to draw attention to a theme or certain aspect of the story.",
                "I learned about how to look at literature from many different perspectives. The professor spent a lot of time looking at historical context in which the novels, stories and poems we read were written, as well how the personal lives of the authors may have influenced their work. We also spent time looking at individual words and phrases which help shape a novel or a poem, and the significance of how a single word can encompass an overarching theme in a work of literature.",
                "I learned about how great literature is often about the act of writing itself, which completely changed how I read books now.",
                "I got to read a lot of important works of literature that I hadn't had the chance to read in high school. We spent most of class discussing the readings, if not learning more about the authors. I got to learn about how seemingly distinct works of literature had similar influences and themes. The prompts for our papers were interesting and helped me improve in writing about literature."

                "As a junior English major, the course was quite easy, which I think means it would be a great introduction for first-years or people who aren't majoring in English. There wasn't a ton of writing and the professor was very flexible. One weakness is the short writing assignments didn't require that much critical engagement with the texts or comparison between texts.",
                "Strengths: Professor Williams is great and does a great job of making the seminar feel engaging, interesting, and helpful. The canon that was chosen for this section was also wonderful and read some amazing books that I actually enjoyed studying/interacting with. The essays were also pretty fun, but educational. I loved how we got so much feedback, and we had the option to rewrite essays based on the feedback. It made grades so much less stressful and the essays more educational! Weakness: Sometimes the discussion of the book itself felt very prescriptive, and wish had been slightly more spontaneous. Otherwise, none.",
                "Strengths:\r\nProf Williams is super understanding and nice. Allows revision for all essays and gives clear feedback for how to improve. Gives extensions without question.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nClassroom management is relatively inefficient, so sometimes the seminar discussions aren't all that engaging.",
                "Strengths were the texts we read on the syllabus and the professors teaching style.\r\n\r\nThere were no weaknesses I can think of.",
                "The strengths are the lectures from Prof Williams and the really interesting insights he shares about the readings. I also really liked the assignments of this class  the presentation was super fun and the essay revision time was really helpful to improve our writing. I just wish there was more time for student-led discussion during class.",
                "The strengths of this course are the kindness of Prof. Williams and the ability to revise your papers for a week after getting feedback on them. This really encourages students to not freak out about their writing and to get comfortable with the revision process. \r\n\r\nI think the pace of this class is a bit of a weakness. Some weeks it felt like we had a ton of really dense reading, and other weeks we only had a short story to read. I think a more consistent pace would be nice, but I was so grateful that Prof. Williams was willing to change the schedule around when we had really bad weeks, etc.",
                "I thought the class was extremely well organized. I have no complaints or suggestions.",
                "Strengths: fantastic  readings. Prof Williams' interpretations of the text are insightful and his seminar style engaging.\r\nNote: the readings tend to be the less famous works of very famous writers (Hurston, Dickinson, Melville, etc), relaying high quality literature but still a bit \"off the beaten path.\" I found some new favorite books.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The essay topics were, in my opinion, unhelpful to both\r\na) assessing the student's understanding of the material or \r\nb) encouraging the student to explore the greater themes of American Literature at depth. Because essays are the bulk of one's grade in the course, it's a bit disheartening.",
                "The strengths of the course have to do with the reading list and the small seminar format -- all of the novels were interesting, and discussion was something I always looked forward to. I really had no complaints, though I suppose a lot of it has to do with the quality of your group and instructor.",
                "Strengths: Emphasis on discussion among students, Diverse and great texts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes we would discuss one thing for too long, leaving not enough time for other texts.",
                "I chose this course because I wanted to have a seminar on my schedule, and it definitely checked that box. The class was small enough that most people talked and I learned a lot from my classmates. A weakness of the course is that there's a lot of reading, but it's pretty easy to participate in class without having done the readings, so it gets easy to fall behind and then try to catch up in time to write the papers."

The workload is fairly low (there's a lot of reading of course, but it was manageable for the most part) and the essays felt low stakes, while still being genuinely helpful for improving my writing/style of analysis. It's of course required for all English majors, but not a bad writing credit for non-English majors!",
                "Absolute gut! Syllabus is pretty good, but seminar discussions aren't always the most engaging.",
                "Yes, because this class helped me improve as a writer and as a reader, too. Reading works from different writers and poets was interesting and the class was never boring.",
                "Yep! Great as a requirement course for English or American studies major but also a great course for anyone interested in literature (or anyone who misses high school english). The reading list is really fun and the workload is definitely manageable.",
                "Definitely! Even if you're not an English major, the curriculum still includes a lot of great reads that lead to interesting in-class discussions.",
                "Yes! Take this class with Prof. Williams - he has fun anecdotes and is truly a sweetheart. He is also super accommodating and was in touch with our class, knew when weeks were really tough, and laid off the work a bit. He gives really great feedback on papers and is overall just a kind professor (harder to find than you think). I needed this for my major but I know people in the class who were just taking it for fun - either way, I think we all left with at least a little better sense of American literature and some fun memories.",
                "I highly recommend this course, even if you don't already have an interest in English or literature.",

                "Definitely, insofar as they are interested in American literature and are willing to think outside-the-box for discussions and essays.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The readings were varied and covered a wide range of authors and time periods; the professor was great and really allowed students to engage with the materials through both the written and oral assignments!",
                "I would recommend this course to other students because they have the opportunity to read great texts not often covered in other Yale courses and also because they have the opportunity to discuss their opinions on those texts with other people who have different and fascinating opinions.",
                "I would especially recommend this course to a student who loves to read or is interested in learning more about literature. You cover a lot of ground (Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, Zora Neale Hurston, Toni Morrison, Herman Melville). At times, I found it hard to motivate myself to do the readings, but that was a personal lack of interest in literature from a century ago."
