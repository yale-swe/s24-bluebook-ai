                "I learned about Virginia Woolf, her works, and the history around her. I learned more skills about analyzing literature.",
                "It was really nice to focus on one author. I learned a lot about analyzing a text in relation to secondary sources",
                "-deep understanding of Woolf's life and literary influences\r\n-exposure to most of Woolf's major works",
                "I built on the skills I have acquired in previous English seminars. It was really nice to focus on just one author and examine their works as a collection  something I had not been able to do before.",
                "I learned so much in this course- about the history of fiction and modernism, about Virginia Woolf herself, about how to look at and think about artists in history, about art, and about how to discuss and consider complicated texts.",
                "I read Virginia Woolf's canon widely and also delved deeply into criticism surrounding her work. Prof Homans is the expert on Woolf and it was great to hear her insights.",
                "You read the majority of Woolf's novels and a selection of her essays and short stories, as well as optional biographical materials. Most of this course is about reading and thinking critically about the week's texts, while the final part of the course is dedicated to a long research essay."

                "I think that its chronological structure through Woolf's life as she wrote worked incredibly well. I also thought that the specific choices of which books to read was great. I don't feel like we got a ton of guidance on the research paper until the last two weeks of the class, which, as someone who's never written a paper of that length before, felt very daunting.",
                "This course was well-organized, well-taught, and well-assessed (the assignment is a long paper, which is perfect for a senior seminar). The only improvement to the course is its time: on a Wednesday afternoon, everyone is a bit sleepy.",
                "The professor is really good in class. But limited writing feedback because its only one assignment.",
                "Strengths: great reading list; geared towards independent learning; Homans is super kind\r\nWeaknesses: having no grades over the course of the semester can make writing the final paper a little stressful; the discussions weren't always super dynamic",
                "I really liked how each novel had a dedicated week or so, as it gave us plenty of time to talk about most of the novel rather than only being able to talk about a few small sections.",
                "A great syllabus (naturally), an extremely brilliant professor, an engaged group of students. \r\nSometimes discussion could have flowed easier.",
                "I think Prof Homans does a good job of judging which secondary readings will be helpful for the week's assigned readings. This does mean a very heavy reading load, but I think it's worth the work. Sometimes I did wish that Prof Homans played a more active role in leading discussion, but I think that generally the classroom atmosphere is welcoming and conducive to discussion.",
                "The strength of this course is that its focus solely on Virginia Woolf allows for unusual depth in an English class. You become extremely familiar with Woolf's style, experiments, and consistent ideas and track how these evolve over time."

                "If they're interested in Virginia Woolf and also consider themselves a fast reader, yes. Otherwise, the amount of reading is impossible to get through. It's a classic, discussion-based seminar, so if they enjoy that format then absolutely.",
                "I would highly recommend this class. It was instructive, fun, and fulfilling.",
                "I would if they really love to read.",
                "Yes, especially if you love reading a single author in a class. Getting to take a deep dive into these novels was a great experience. But you need to be prepared to do a lot of reading (a book a week, plus a lot of secondary reading), because that's the entirety of the class, and you don't really get anything out of it if you don't read the books. Also, the only real grade given is after the final paper at the end of the term, so there's no way to pace your progress in the class. If you're someone who needs periodic grades over the course of the semester to keep yourself accountable, this will be difficult. But if you love Woolf or want to get into her fiction, this is a great seminar",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Homans is very welcoming and great at facilitating conversation. I also appreciate how she was trying to make sure that everyone in the room had a chance to speak. If you are interested in Woolf at all, this is the perfect class, and even if you are not, having the opportunity to focus on one writer is super fun and intellectually stimulating.",
                "Yes!! To any student interested in modernism or Virginia Woolf, I think this course is a great chance to deep dive into one figures life and work. Homans is an absolute expert and its a great prveledge to learn from her.",
                "I would! I'm not sure if this course is for you if you are not a senior humanities major: there is only one final 20-25 page paper. It can be difficult to produce a paper of this length without experience. It's also a very self-directed course: you have to keep yourself accountable for all of the reading, and it is easy to fall behind. Otherwise, I would strongly recommend because Woolf's work is so rich and compelling and actively relevant."
