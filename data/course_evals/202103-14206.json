                "Strengths: The students in the class came from a wide variety of backgrounds--film majors, math majors, computer science, art, etc. This lent a wide range of perspectives to class discussion. I thought most of the material on the syllabus was carefully selected and was a worthwhile read. Professor Hirschfeld-Kroen was also a strength, effectively guiding discussion and willing to meet to talk about class material, papers, etc. Liked the in-class viewings in the different screening rooms! Prof was willing to move/adjust things based on student feedback (for example, shift deadlines, some folks incorporated creative elements into their final papers).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: For a writing course, I think it would have been nice to have more of an emphasis on crafting arguments, structuring essays, etc. Maybe a workshop or something similar (I think workshopping essays was originally planned, but had to be cut due to time)? I also would have found a bit of a background in feminist movements helpful (first wave/second/third). Knowing the context and major ideas of a movement might have put more of the readings in context (Prof Hirschfeld-Kroen did a little of this ad-hoc). I think classmates with more of a WGSS background might have had this knowledge, but at the same time, one of the strengths of the course is wide variety of academic disciplines of the students, so a common language/background could be helpful. Maybe optional mini-lecture?",
                "The discussions were incredibly interesting and lively.",
                "great discussion and content",
                "The essays were graded very harshly and there was an expectation of knowledge beyond what was taught. That said, very interesting course and engaging Professor."

Readings/films/course material was interesting. There was flexibility in the assignments based on what your interests were. Prof. Hirschfeld-Kroen was receptive to student feedback throughout the course. I'm really glad I took this course!",
