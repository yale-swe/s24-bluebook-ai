   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned about quotas and how they can hurt or help women's election, the barriers women face when they run for office, how to create a research question and construct methods to answer that question, how to read research papers and understand its merits and limitations.",
    "The course helped me learn more about a broad range of topics related to gender and politics, including the role of stereotypes\/electoral rules\/political parties, quotas, voters' use of gender as a heuristic, women's electoral prospects, and women's status in various branches of government. The class also helped me improve my research, writing, and data analysis skills because Professor Aldrich helped us all understand how to interpret the tables in our readings (which none of my previous professors have done!).",
    "I definitely learned how to better read research studies pertaining to social sciences and also a lot about the actual topic of gender and its effects on politics.",
    "Overall, I gained insight into the various ways gender interacts with politics. This course taught me how to think critically of research studies. While I have encountered research studies in other classes, this one really taught me how to break them down, understand what they mean, and how to talk about them in a productive manner. Also, the final project really helped me understand the ins-and-outs of research design.",
    "This was a really great poli sci course because you got very practical experience in the methodologies (statistics, data analysis, etc) of the discipline while still enjoying the course and being engaged with the subject material. It also is enlightening to look at real data and research being done in electoral systems and politics through the lens of gender  this course is very heavily oriented in its content toward women in politics.",
    "I learned how to set up research design which was helpful in understanding a lot of research I have to analyze for other classes",
    "I learned how to approach political research and its challenges.",
    "This is the first and only class I have taken at Yale that focuses on gender disparities in politics and I found the readings interesting because they honed in on an issue I have not been able to study.",
    "Throughout the course, we were able to design a research method to study data from an area of study that we were interested in. We learned about different variables, how data can be interpreted to support or reject hypotheses, and identified common errors throughout political science research.",
    "Overall, the course provided me with a much better understanding of the impediments to greater female representation in politics, along with a much improved understanding of the interaction between institutional factors and female candidates \/ politicians. The course also featured interesting readings on female candidate supply and candidate demand. The research design project allowed us to delve deeper into a topic that we found interesting which was nice."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course depends on the classmates so when the majority of people came to class unprepared, it was hard to have a discussion. And it seems like we spend a lot of time criticizing why the research's findings were flaws instead of looking at we can learn from it. The strength is that the content is interesting and covers a wide variety of topics.",
    "The course was so well organized throughout the semester. I thought that the way we progressed through the topics made a lot of sense, and that each new topic was building on the course's previous learning. I was also very grateful for the way the Prof. Aldrich structured the research paper; having due dates throughout the semester helped to hold me accountable and make sure that people weren't falling behind.",
    "The readings were very interesting and facilitated really good discussions.",
    "Strength: This class really opened my eyes to how gender and politics interact. The fact that students lead discussion really made the class approachable and felt more cooperative than when a professor dictates the discussion. Weaknesses: Sometimes the discussions were dead, but this is just because people do not do the readings  this is a problem in almost all seminars.",
    "Prof. Aldrich is amazing, she's super engaging and is very passionate about the subject (actively does work in comparative electoral systems which is very interesting, ask her about it). I don't usually like poli sci but she really changed the way I view the discipline. The research covered in the course is by and large *the* research to get your feet wet at the intersection of poli sci and WGSS, and I think in this way it's easily digestible for people who have only have experience in one of the two. It is deceptively data heavy  you are reading\/discussing real research designs and explanations of data. Not recommended for people who don't like numbers.",
    "Andrea Aldrich is wonderful! She cares about the students and listens to them, to make the course as good as it can be. I think the only potential vulnerable point is that most of the discussions are student-led--students, in pairs, lead basically the entire two hours every week. While leading discussion is a valuable learning experience, I think having it be the only form of discussion sometimes held us back from really delving into thoughtful discussion to the same extent that we could've if a professor had been leading. Students, while we offer interesting things to the table, sometimes don't know where to prod and ask questions that will evoke really resonating discussion in the same way a prof does.",
    "The course was well organized, with each week focusing on a different aspect of the issue of gender in politics. I appreciated the opportunity for each student to lead a class discussion. I found the final project a bit of a challenge because it was reorganized partway through the course.",
    "Strengths: Weekly journals and student-led discussions were helpful ways to stay engaged in the material and actually stay up on the readings. Professor Aldrich is one of the few professors that I've had who checks in with her students to make sure that her workload is manageable with everything else that is going on, which is very much appreciated.",
    "The syllabus was definitely a strength of the course. The readings complemented the course very well and were quite interesting for the most part. I also enjoyed the research design final project as it allowed me to hone in on a topic that I found particularly interesting. I would say that the only weakness was perhaps that the structure of the course changed a decent amount in the early part of the semester, particularly with regards to the research project. The final incarnation of the research project was quite different from the one put forth in the original syllabus, which definitely caused a bit of uncertainty at first. Nonetheless, the changes were all in response to how the class was developing and the final research design question was still very interesting and manageable."

   "comments": [
    "The content of this course is great and Aldrich is a very supportive and fun professor, but as with any seminar, your experience will probably depend on the other people in the class. We read a lot of research papers and it would be useful to have some stats background.",
    "In my mind, this course is essential who are interested in politics (especially elections and campaign work), feminism, or comparative politics. The course is mostly focused on American politics, which I think is good because that is the political\/gender context that the vast majority of students are most familiar with, but the comparative pieces that we read throughout the semester really added a lot of depth and introduced the potential for some really interesting comparisons and questions about whether certain policies (like quotas) could be implemented in the US.",
    "Definitely. It's a very interesting and relevant seminar that dispels some myths about gender in politics and takes a look at cases both in the U.S. and many other countries.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. There was not too much work (weekly journals which helped me digest the readings and my final project) and one final paper with multiple stages of development. The discussions and readings were interesting, and I greatly enjoyed my time the class. It was early, but it was always a nice start to my Wednesday.",
    "Absolutely",
    "I would recommend this if you're interested in gender imbalances and want to increase your literacy with political research papers. I generally enjoyed it--it sometimes got a little dry or repetitive but was a worthwhile course overall.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. The combination of student-led discussion and professor guidance was well-balanced.",
    "Definitely would recommend this course to another student. Professor Aldrich is excellent in making sure that everyone is on the same page and really encouraged everyone to participate. We each were tasked with leading a discussion, which while seemed to be difficult was quite manageable and inviting to some of the quieter speakers, like I tended to be.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are at all interested in gender equality when it comes to politics, or even just interested in politics more broadly. Through the wide-ranging syllabus, you'll definitely find a topic that you find super interesting. Professor Aldrich is great and facilitates a really engaged discussion for the students."
