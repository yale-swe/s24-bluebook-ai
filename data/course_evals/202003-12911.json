                "This class is the best writing class that I've taken at Yale, and probably the best class I've taken at Yale, period. I learned writing techniques that helped polish and focus my writing. Anne introduced us to everything from the macro to the micro -- writing structures that we could attempt, broad themes\/styles of writing (ex. tragicomedy), as well as sentence-level construction and grammar. She also taught me how to properly edit my own work, as well as other's. I think the most important insight that I learned in this class, however, is that one should take risks with writing, and write for oneself as opposed to anyone else.",
                "OMG where to even begin. First of all, this class was essentially much-needed group therapy mid pandemic. And not to sound like a sappy loser but I learned a lot about myself in this class, just by writing about events from my past. It's a powerful thing to do I highly recommend it. But beyond that, I became a way better writer, a MILES better editor, so much more conscious about word choice and sentence construction. Even if you dont want to write about yourself, you should take this just for how much you'll learn about writing a good sentence.",
                "This course is designed in such a way that you are constantly learningwhether it be from the readings, critiquing your partner's work, or just reading the entire class' essays that week on Canvas. In particular, I got better at honing the \"thesis\" of my creative essays and in taking structural risks with my essays.",
                "I learned so much about how to write about myself, how to read, how to craft sentences, paragraphs, messages, how to put blood on a page, how to know when its too much. Everything I've ever wanted to know. This class. I learned it all.",
                "This class made me a better writer, period. The combination of reading, writing, and responding to my classmates' work made this class the most rigorous, and most rewarding, creative writing class I've taken at Yale.",
                "This is an extraordinary introduction into personal essay writing. As the course title suggests, I became much better at writing about myselfbut I also got better at writing about my family and friends, writing scenes, and writing what I'll call \"auto-theory\" (i.e. psychologizing oneself). I also gained a great introduction to a diverse canon on first-person writers.",
                "My writing got cleaner, sharper, and clearer.  Anne is really good at guiding you towards more clarity in your work."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The one-on-one time and attention your writing gets, not only from Anne, but from everyone in the class. A huge part of this class is supporting one another's work by reading it and commenting on it each week -- unlike other writing classes\/seminars where you only get to read people's work when it comes to workshop. Anne also does individual editing meetings with everyone and goes through your piece with you, which is invaluable and helps you understand what your specific strengths and weaknesses are as a writer. The collaborative and supportive atmosphere of this class is also amazing. You get to know everyone really quickly, and it never feels competitive. It's really exciting to read everyone's new work each week, and to be challenged to write so often and at such a high level. The readings are also really fun to read -- and for once, you don't have to take detailed notes on the reading!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not necessarily a weakness, but just be aware that this is less of a seminar than a really intimate lecture. It gives you a lot of time to learn from Anne's expertise and perspective, which is nice, and there's a lot of information jam-packed in that you would lose with more discussion. But as students, you definitely don't spend *that* much time getting to have back-and-forth.",
                "This questions sucks because I truly cannot think of a weakness. This class was my life for a semester, idk what to even say. The community was so incredibly strong, even at such a huge distance. The classmates--UGH. Wildly talented, interesting, and kind. Don't even get me started on Anne. I simply cannot. Take this class if you possibly can. Put a lot of thought into your application and you statement of interest, it's worth it.",
                "The biggest strength is the course's emphasis on becoming the best version of the way you write. You never feel pigeon-holed into one version of being a great writer, and in fact, Prof. Fadiman equips the class with many devices through which they can evaluate their writing styles. The only weakness is discussion. I wish it had been a bit more free-flowing. I think this course is better thought of as a lecture course with some room for classroom participation than a true discussion seminar.",
                "Anne is very open to tweaking the syllabus over time to accommodate suggestions from students. This semester, she made a particular effort to diversify the voices we were reading, which all of us appreciated. It's a lot of work, but Anne is up front about this going into the semester.",
                "Anne has designed this course expertly. She's been teaching it for many years and takes it more seriously than any professor I've ever had has taken any course I've ever taken. The workload is calculated to be challenging but not impossible. She really gets to know her students and their writing styles, and she makes sure there's space for students to build meaningful creative relationships with one another.",
                "It's a very intensive semester, which is a strength and a weakness.  The strength is that you learn a lot, the weakness is that there's not a lot of room to step back from it.  You have to buy in."

                "Creativity with Zoom really helped virtual engagement -- individual breakout rooms where we had to write about our faces for 5 minutes, multimedia presentations, etc. Active Canvas interaction via discussion boards and commenting on each other's essays also helped with offline engagement.\r\n\r\nHaving two breaks also really helped given the length of the seminar. I really appreciated that we had more than one.",

                "We had a lot of one-on-one assignments built into the syllabus that I think really helped build classroom camaraderie. The biggest change from past syllabi was for one of our partner critiques to be an in-class oral critique, but I think even smaller things, like having to bring in fun facts about someone else in the class or just the lively Canvas forum were super helpful to keeping us engaged inside and outside of class.",
                "The Zoom format honestly worked very well in this class compared to my other seminars. Author presentations and grammar worksheets made particularly good use of Zoom functions -- screensharing, etc. Sometimes discussions felt a little stilted, but I don't think that's function of this particular class.",
                "The class is long for Zoom (2 hours and 50 minutes), but Anne builds in time for two breaks, which is wonderful. She also has conferences with students in the weeks when they write, which gave us space not only to talk about our writing but also about our lives right now. This one-on-one connection and feeling of care was invaluable during a time of pandemic-induced disconnection.",

This is a once-in-a-lifetime sort of course, and Anne is a phenomenal, hands-on professor who is really invested in your success both inside, outside, and after her class. WaO is one of those rare spaces in life where you just get to write for fun and take risks and be surrounded by beautiful writing and a supportive community of writers who you quickly become close with in a way that only writing about your personal life can facilitate.

                "I would definitely recommend! At the beginning, I was sort of turned off by the lecture\/seminar balance, but over time, I tangibly saw improvements in my reading and writing. I quite literally don't think I've ever taken a course that was this geared towards improving each individual. Everyone was SO supportive of the journeys their fellow were embarked on in a way that was truly special. I also think that the one-on-one attention from the professor herself makes this course special.",
                "A thousand times over. But you have to be ready to put in the work. It's worth it, but only if you make it worth your time.",
                "I would recommend this course to anybody who is serious about improving their writing, who is willing to be extremely vulnerable with the topics they write about, and who is excited to put in the work of doing the readings and engaging with your classmates. You get what you put into this class, and it was wonderful how much my classmates put into it this past semester! You really do develop a bond with the class and with Anne, even over Zoom. The most intense and rewarding class I've taken.",
