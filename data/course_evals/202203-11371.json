The class was very much an interactive one, learning how to use the letterpress machines to produce ephemeras, broadsides, and books. I found myself enjoying the class a lot with visits to art galleries and getting a hands-on approach to printmaking."

                "I do enjoy how hands-on the class was with the projects we were able to get done. However, it did often feel as though there were times when the class felt a little bit rushed, and we had to get our projects done in time. In the beginning, I also wished that there was more guidance on how to operate the machinery and placing in type so that we could be more efficient with our projects, but overall I think that the class did offer a skill of visual thinking and printmaking that I'll be coming back to often."

                "I would recommend this course to another student because it is a class that is very much hands-on for those who want to get into printmaking and develop their visual craftsmanship. The class definitely allows you to think deeply about the work you create and provides the freedom to create what you want with the skills and resources you're given. Despite some pocket of moments where you'll have to grind out the work, it was a pleasure to have been in the class."
