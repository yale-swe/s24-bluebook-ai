                "An entirely new level of my process and performance ability as an actor, and sterling examples of theater educators and directors for my career as such. Also a newfound appreciation for the poetry and performance of Shakespeare.",
                "You learn a lot about the language of Shakespeare and how to act in accordance to what the characters are saying on the page. Also, you learn a lot as an actor with work being done in character work, pacing, and how to make full usage of the space you are given as you work on stage.",
                "You will learn how to approach Shakespeare as an actor--to free your voice, make full use of all the tools Shakespeare gives you through his language, and so much more. You will walk away a better actor and more thoughtful appreciator of Shakespeare's work.",
                "My acting improved! I learnt more about the Elizabethan world. I learnt to understand my fellow students/actors better.",
                "I learned that acting shakespeare is nothing like contemporary acting, in that you must say what you mean and mean what you say. In this, I was able to unleash my full potential at conveying whole and untainted emotions of love and pain, finding antitheses within the language, and allowing it to do all the acting for me.",
                "This class made me a better Shakespearean actor and a better person since many of the skills that I acquired in the class (active listening, working with an ensemble of actors, being aware of the self and others, etc) are not only important to an actor but also relevant for any human-being. Taking it with Daniela as well as Sammy and Bobbin made this my favorite class of the semester as a non-major, and I wished that I did it earlier in my career at Yale so that I could explore other opportunities in the theatre."

                "Excellent; my favorite acting course at Yale so far for its approach of each actor on their level and earnest, taxing, kind urging of each student to produce the very best work they're able to.\r\nMy only comment  that the environment was sometimes too generous, not critical enough  also probably granted the course one of its finer qualities, that of its gentle community and everyone's interest in one another's success!",
                "The class was very interactive. Every class you would be able to hear feedback on work that was being done on stage. Even if you are not working that day, you still learn so much during class because you are able to apply your classmate's feedback to your own work. Additionally, there's many exercises in class that are given to help with character work and scene partner work before you are reading lines off a script. \r\nI can't think of any weaknesses. The class was truly amazing.",
                "This course is ALL STRENGTHS!!! Really my only note would be that I think holding our heads back to improve posture during scene-work never really worked--it just made it kind of ridiculous and cumbersome to do the scene. Everything else--EVERYTHING ELSE--was mind-blowingly amazing.",
                "Daniela was such a sharp professor. Shes very open to feedback, so if something isnt working for you in the course, shes more than happy to adjust.",
                "The acting side of things was perfect, though sometimes I felt that each individual student was left to do a lot of watching and observing.",
                "Strengths- The in-class exercises were super fun and eye-opening. I had no idea what I was walking into with this class but if I could take it again I would. From the \"painting the elizabethan world\" exercise in which we were put in a mindset in which our external and internal environments symbolized heaven, earth and hell, to the \"I love you/I hate you exercise\" in which we had to fully unleash both emotions when exclaiming hose phrases to our scene partners, Daniela brought out the best actor in me.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- None! Maybe would've liked more breaks since a lot of the class is sitting down watching your classmates' scenes. But other than that, it was perfect.",
                "Strength: the people. From the instructor to the TFs to my fellow classmates, there was an incredible amount of trust that allowed us all to be vulnerable and bold, without which good acting would not have been possible. The overall structure of the class also lends to effective learning since we get to work on the material throughout the week via lectures, tutorials, and rehearsals. I can't think of any weaknesses."

What makes the class so good is that everyone comes ready work and everyone is passionate about the work that they are doing in the class. Shakespeare can be daunting, especially as a performer, but in this class you are able to start from ground zero and build up your understanding of the text given.",
                "Yes! You have no idea how much you will grow as an actor and student of Shakespeare.",
                "Absolutely. High-level Shakespearean training with a lot of love and joy mixed in!",
                "Absolutely. If you have any interest in acting Shakespeare, you can do no better than this course.",
