            "comments": [
                "There was tons of interesting thinkers which we read, which was great and the reason I signed up for the course, but I thought that the syllabus actually ended up being too ambitious, to the point that the material was being spread too thin and we didn't have time to truly understand any one thinker. For example, I think there's literally no point to assigning pp. 358 - 367 of Phenomenology of Spirit outside of a philosophy course, especially a work like that which is supposed to be a sort of bildungsroman in and of itself; opening to a passage three quarters of the way into the book felt like it literally might as well have been written in Korean.",
                "A strength of this course was how when students advocated for quizzes to not be timed, that the teaching staff listened and responded. The primary weakness of this course include that the readings are nearly undecipherable and I did not continue to read them and even did better in the class once I stopped reading them. I did not find the material of the course very engaging, though it did get much better once we moved into the topics of diversity and gender\/sexuality. That being said, the first half of the semester was unengaging for me.",
                "Strengths were the way the class was organized by the different thinkers. The weakness was the quizzes which felt completely pointless. The quizzes were basically regurgitating class material within a 30 minute period. They did not feel conducive to helping me understand the material and felt like waste of the interesting concepts. The class should just have a standard midterm and final essay.",
                "This course was strong in how in depth it got for each individual person studied. Having a chronological approach was helpful to see the evolution of social theory, but it was also useful for drawing connections between likeminded thinkers.",
                "I think the quizzes should be short answer rather than full essays because that caused a lot of stress",
                "Strenghts: the readings are very interesting, and the lectures help make sense of them. The format with 3 quizzes holds you accountable while giving you some flexibility to catch up (unlike reading responses)\r\n\r\nweakness: I wish section was more challenging\/engaging",
                "Strengths- the material is very interesting; weaknesses- it would be nice to have the lecture slides posted",
                "could not dig in depth; huge amount of readings",
                "Strengths are that its an overview of important sociologists. Weaknesses are it can feel a bit boring and tedious"

                "I would not recommend this course, and I only took it because it was required for sociology. That being said, I think this course would be a very poor introduction into sociology. If you are considering the major, you can definitely get through the course and even leave with some interesting theorists in mind (WEB Du Bois, Fanon, Anna Julia Cooper, Simone De Beauvoir, Marx).",

                "Seeing this is a requirement, people in the sociology major should understand that the reading load for this course is incredibly white and eurocentric, and a good many of the thinkers have influenced the world in terrible ways and contributed to racism, colonialism, and sexism around the globe. I think Professor Erikson makes it very clear that the goal of reading these people is not to celebrate their ideas, but to understand what modern sociology argues against. Later thinkers in the course like DuBois are refuting or adding racial and gender dynamics to previous theory. If you're choosing to pursue sociology, you should understand the ways in which this field and it's philosophy has been used against the people it claims to protect, and I think Professor Erikson tries hard to discuss how problematic some of the thinkers were without excusing their actions.",
