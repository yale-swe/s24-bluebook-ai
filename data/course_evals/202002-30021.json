    "Basic introduction into biology and medical practices.",
    "Principles of genetics, developmental bio, ecology, and evolutionary bio. How to write a scientific research proposal.",
    "Genetics, Evolution",
    "How to read and write scientific research papers",
    "I learned how to write research papers\/proposals, analyze scientific biological papers, and knowledge of developmental and evolutionary\/ecological biology.",
    "genetics and evolution",
    "Learned a lot about genetics, evolution, and ecology. More importantly, I practiced reading scientific literature and synthesizing information from different sources in order to write a research proposal\/paper.",
    "I was able to learn how to do my own research and also learn how to reach out with questions I have. It was very intimidating when on campus needing to go to office hours to ask questions. But on zoom, going to TA office hours, it was nice and easy. It was also interesting to see how much I was abl eot take control of my own learning in BIO S106.",
    "I learned the basics of genetics, development, ecology, and evolutionary biology. I learned how to write a proper research proposal and scientific paper. I also got more used to reading scientific papers.",
    "I gained a good understanding of the basics of developmental biology and of ecology and evolutionary biology. I particularly appreciated the homework assignments in the first half of the course -- it was my first time writing a research proposal, and I really built my writing and researching skills from it. The paper for the second half of the course was also beneficial in building my writing and researching skills. Overall, I developed a strong basis in biology that I'll definitely be able to use in the future.",
    "This course gave me a better understanding not only of the basis and development of life, but also it showed me the fascinating interrelatedness of biodiversity as a whole. I grew in my ability to conduct thorough scientific research, and I learned the process of writing and presenting a grant proposal.",
    "I learned how to write a research proposal.",
    "I learned about genes and developmental biology in the first half of the course and ecology and evolutionary biology in the latter half. Learning about the evolutionary history of the earth and the organisms inhabiting it was particularly interesting because it attempts to explain our past and how present-day came to be. I also enjoyed learning about how humans develop and how our genetic makeup is determined. Another skill I acquired through this course was how to write a research proposal\/paper.",
    "This course helped me realize what kinds of biology I'd like to continue studying for the next 3 years. Profs Lin and Near were both great teachers, but I found myself significantly more engaged with the first half of the course which focused on genetics and developmental biology. Since both professors were great, it really informed my choice to continue studying genetics and developmental biology, because I know my level of engagement was directly related to the course material.",
    "In taking this course, I learned how to use various journal sources to conduct independent research. In doing this, I learned how to read scientific papers and combine the knowledge from various papers to conclusions of my own within the homework assignments for each part of this course. I also learned how to use this information to find questions that still needed answering. This will be helpful in the future as I continue with scientific research.",
    "Learned about genetics and the process of development, history of the tree of life",
    "I learned to write professional science research proposals along with review articles about the topic of evolutionary history. I also learned a lot about asking good questions through listening to my classmates. Overall, I had learning experiences that were hard to obtain at different classroom settings through collaborative work and individual research studies.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about genetics, development, and ecology \/ evolutionary biology.  It was a great introductory course, and I was also able to learn how to write a research proposal and paper.",
    "I learned how to better understand research processes in biology",
    "I gained knowledge in critical thinking and writing a research proposal!",
    "I learned fundamental knowledge of genetics and developmental and evolutionary biology.",
    "I learned a significant amount of evolutionary and developmental biology. The course was particularly important in learning scientific writing and guided students through writing a research proposal and literature review.",
    "I learned how to write real research proposals and literature reviews, similar to those that are written by actual lab PIs, receive funding, and are ultimately published in scientific journals. Additionally, I further developed the scientific literature interpretation skills that were emphasized in Biol 101 and 102. In terms of Biology content, I learned about genetics, development, Ecology, and Evolutionary Biology.",
    "I gained a great understanding of the concept in this class. \r\n\r\nI also learned how to write scientific research papers",
    "I developed a lot of scientific research skills. Using many scientific data bases was hard at first.",
    "The course offers a pretty in depth overview of genetics, ecology, and evolutionary bio. We wrote a proposal and a review, and both pretty straight forward, and feedback was very clear.",
    "Introduction to genes, ecology, and evolutionary biology.",
    "Introductory concepts to genetics and evolutionary\/ecological biology",
    "I was able to learn more about genetics, a topic that has always fascinated me! It was also interesting to see how this related to evolutionary biology in the second half of the course.",
    "I developed an understanding of evolution.",
    "I learned the theoretical and practical aspects of biological development, inheritance, evolution, and ecology.",
    "This course involved two independent research projects, through which I learned how to better critically analyze scientific papers. I additionally learned how to format a research proposal, a skill which will be greatly beneficial as I prepare for a career in academic research. This course also involved 12 group quizzes, which strengthened my communication and collaboration skills as I reasoned with peers."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: interesting material, engaging and knowledgable professors (especially Prof Lin!!), good pace of learning and assessment, group quizzes facilitated learning and also fostered a sense of community within the class (even online)\r\nWeaknesses: I would have preferred if the assignments for Part 2 had been spread out into multiple smaller assignments (like how it was in Part 1) rather than 2 big assignments",
    "Really engaging for a summer class",
    "The strengths are the teaching. Both professors were wonderful and engaging. The homeworks and quizzes were challenging but doable.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness is that 1:45 is long for a class and it is sometimes hard to maintain engagement.",
    "strengths are break out rooms and group quizzes and weaknesses are that the lectures are long so its hard to stay focused",
    "The only weakness was that the course was online, which of course could not have been changed.",
    "Strengths - very much alot of support, the professors were very understanding, group quizzes made a difference, I liked when we started quizzes during class and check in with TAs very easily if we had any questions, the syllabus was very helpful \r\nWeakness - not enough clear feedback in the homeworks and papers, I would want more feedback",
    "The course was very well organized and there were a lot of activities that engaged the student. Even though it was remote, the TAs and the professors both did a good job being as accessible as possible and were very open to helping students. I really liked the environment of the course and it overall felt very collaborative. I was able to learn and engage in the material without feeling stressed at any point.",
    "This course adapted really well to the online format! The homework assignments and quizzes were excellent -- I appreciated that the quizzes were open note and group work so that I could interact with other students in the class. The homework assignments (especially the build-up one for part 1 of the course) were also very helpful and interesting because each student could put their own twist on them. The professors are also amazing lecturers and go out of their way to help the students. The only weakness of the course to me was the length of lecture, but the professors did their best to make this more bearable by adding breaks during the lectures.",
    "There is a lot of information packed in, simply due to the nature of the course, but the days of zoom calls and lecture slides often seemed to blur together, making genuine intake of information was rather difficult.  There was not enough breakup of information from session to session. The main strengths of the course really came from the homework assignments, which pushed students to grapple with specific topics and form a solid understanding of whatever their focus of research was.",
    "The discussion sections did not really enhance my learning.",
    "I enjoyed how this course was designed. I appreciate the fact that both Professor Near and Professor Lin recorded their lectures and posted the accompanying slides because it allowed us to refer back to them and go over concepts we may have been confused about. I also liked the breakout room exercises and group quizzes because it let us talk ideas through and clarify course content together.",
    "I think the way this course was structured was a serious strength. Group quizzes were seriously helpful for getting to know and interact with my classmates, however in the future it might be a good idea to do a mix of group quizzes and individual quizzes, or make them more about application of the information than straight regurgitation to better assess our understanding of the material now that everything is online. It felt very easy and laid-back to me, which is honestly both a strength and weakness. On one hand it was nice to not be super stressed about my grade in this class because I was also working a job while taking this course, but I also felt like I put a lot more effort into this course than some other students but our grades barely differed because of the open-note group quizzes. However, I do think it was definitely the right choice to make quizzes open-note and not have exams because there's no real fair way to assess in the normal way, and I think having the two papers were a really good way of using an application-based manner of assessing students. I just wish there was a way for us to distinguish ourselves in terms of our grades.",
    "In the first part of the course, Professor Lin utilized every aspect of remote learning, from group quizzes to breakout rooms every day. This allowed me to be more engaged and constantly thinking about and debating various questions that she posed with peers. However, in the second half of the course, it was only long lectures which I felt were not very conducive to as engaging remote learning.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Lin was great! Very engaging, made the online format a lot better by having many breakout room exercises, and encouraged collaboration by creating quiz groups. Both parts of the course had very frequent office hours (I think almost every day) and the TAs were all very kind and responsive. I actually think this class was much better online than in-person (did not have the best experience in 101-2 during the year). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Unfortunately I found the BIOL104 portion to be not as engaging, since it was mostly lecture for 1hr45min. I enjoyed this class nonetheless. Also, I felt the feedback during the BIOL104 portion was a bit slow (especially compared to the BIOL103 portion).",
    "Strengths: even though it was held online, we had plenty of collaborative opportunities to work with other people and get to know the class. For instance, the quizzes were solved in pairs, which really helped me on learning collaborative skills and communication abilities. On the other hand, we also got individual study opportunities such as the review articles or proposals. Having both of these dynamics provided a chance to learn a wider variety of skill sets in my opinion. \r\n\r\nWeakness: it is definitely harder to point out a weakness, because both of my professors (professor Near and professor Lin) were such encouraging instructors. Something that can be further improved could be to add even more break-out room discussions especially for the second part of the lecture. For a lot of my classmates,  break-out room discussions helped provide a chance to review the content and move forward, and I personally feel like the frequency of having break-out rooms could be increased.",
    "The course was awesome. Strengths: excellent professors and TAs, interesting course material, collaborative environment. No weaknesses in my opinion",
    "We had more structure for genetics, but not as much for ecology. I wouldve like to see more of that in ecology, especially for the assignments.",
    "Professor Lin and Professor Near are fantastic professors!",
    "This course was very well structured and the assignments allowed students to engage in depth with all the topics. In my opinion, I don't think there were any concerning weaknesses.",
    "The professors are great and really care about student success. The quiz format (group, unlimited time, open note) reduced stress while encouraging communication and made taking classes online less isolating. The homework assignments for the first half of the course were highly specific, but the second half would benefit from more detailed instructions.",
    "The course was very well organized and all materials are easily accessible. Also, the group quiz format of testing was appreciated as it promoted much needed collaboration and made class participation less intimidating as it was within small groups. Out-of-class resources were also abundant which made learning the material and asking for clarification easy. One weakness was that lectures became a bit content-heavy and difficult to follow in the second part of the class. However, that may just be an issue with the content itself, as Ecology and Evolutionary Biology are particularly dense subjects.",
    "-The lecture slides were very interesting",
    "The course was very strong overall, and I only have one suggested improvement. The final quiz and essay grades were not entered into Canvas, nor was any feedback given regarding these final assignments: the improvement would be to give this feedback.",
    "Strengths: strong organization, accessible information, accessible staff\r\nWeaknesses: It was hard to stay fully engaged through the duration of each 1 hr and 45 min lecture.",
    "Strengths: The first part of the course was very engaging, I really enjoyed the breakout rooms which gave everyone a chance to actively participate.\r\nWeaknesses: The second part of the course felt very detached and could have incorporated more active participation.",
    "It was difficult to pay attention all the time especially due to the online format. But, other than that, it was a great class!",
    "Strength: great teacher with passion!\r\nWeakness: felt like a history course at times. but that's okay!",
    "This course was very well-organized! Occasionally, I had difficulty knowing exactly which material I needed to study, but Profs Lin and Near were incredibly well-organized the vast majority of the time. They were also both really helpful and informed, and made the class interesting!!! They also prioritized group work and collaboration, which I appreciated.",
    "Two strengths of this course were (1) the group quizzes and (2) a step-by-step breakdown of research projects. The group quizzes fostered peer communication, and this student engagement was immensely helpful under the given circumstances, given the isolation that often accompanies remote learning. I also found that the group quizzes allowed for better understanding of the material, as students had to go beyond their own understanding and convince others of their logic. Moreover, I appreciated that each of the two research projects were broken down into smaller assignments throughout the semester, rather than just having one final paper due. This layout allowed me to respond to feedback, which was especially helpful when writing the research proposal because I had not formatted a college-level research proposal prior to this course.\r\n\r\nHowever, the online formatting and accelerated pace of this summer course came with weaknesses that may not necessarily be present during an in-person fall\/spring semester. Whereas a 10-minute break per class was offered in the first half of the course, the second half of the course only offered either a 5-minute break or no break at all. In addition, the second half of the course did not offer as many breakout discussions as the first half of the course. In my opinion, one 10-minute break and several brief peer discussions are needed each day in order to keep students engaged in what is otherwise a long lecture, especially when students are isolated within a remote environment."

    "Not in this format as it is a temporary scenario.",
    "Yes! Even though it's a requirement for most students, it's a really well organized course and really good at introducing students to the field of biology.",
    "Yes definitely would reccomend easier than in person",
    "Yes, it is a great way to learn the basics and fundamentals of biology, especially if you are pre-med",
    "yes, it was less stressful than the one during the academic semester",
    "Yes I would, it's a great introduction to these biology fields and its highly organized nature makes it easy for students to do well.",
    "yes because you learn he basics and it's interesting",
    "Yes - the course was interesting and was taught very well!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I felt like I was learning about relevant things and I was very interested in the topics. Professor Lin was the best and Near was very much passionate about his work.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Most likely, it's a requirement, but regardless, you get a lot out of the course compared to other science courses I've taken at Yale. I thoroughly enjoyed being in this class.",
    "Absolutely! Not only is it necessary to complete the intro bio sequence, but it is also super interesting and taught by some amazing profs. If the student is interested in either developmental biology, medicine, or ecology, this is the course to take. It builds up some really important skills that every science student should have.",
    "I would recommend the virtual version of course since it was easier to plan my day around it, especially since the lectures were recorded.",
    "Yes. I would definately recommend this course to another student, even if that student is not deciding to use this course as a pre-requisite for their major. This course was my favorite out of the entire bio sequence because of the way it was taught and the content this course went through. Having a good foundation of the history of earth and developemental and evolutionary biology is important because it helps elucidate the ways in which we came to be.",
    "Absolutely!!!! Based on what I heard from my friends who took BIOL 103 & 104 on-sequence or off-sequence during the school year, the summer version of this course was significantly better structured for student learning and taught much better as well. Those friends thought I was crazy that this was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale, but it was all because of Profs Lin and Near (especially Prof Lin- I hope she gets to lecture more next year) were so great at communicating the information of the course in an interesting and engaging manner. Plus, I also felt like taking this course over the summer while working a very dull job gave me some much needed intellectual stimulation and dare I say... fun? (lol I'm not crazy I promise- this course was just actually very good)",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I am really glad I took it over the summer because it allowed me to focus solely on the class (rather than several classes at once) and digest the information because I haven't taken much biology prior. The course was structured very well, especially given the online format, both in terms of assessments and homework which made it feel doable and like I was learning tangible skills. Professor Lin and Professor Near are both very approachable and great lecturers.",
    "Yes, this course was great!",
    "Yes, I enjoyed this class over the summer, and much more than I would have during the year. The quizzes were all open-note and collaborative, so I felt there wasn't much pressure at all.",
    "I definitely would sheerly because of how much I have learned. This was one of the rare science courses where a student could learn skills not only from the STEM aspect, but also from a literature and discussion point of view through collaborative discussions on research papers and questions provided in class.",
    "Yes, absolutely. The course was fun yet challenging, and gave me the opportunity to work with some great professors and students.",
    "Yes, Professor Lin and Professor Near really care about student engagement and understanding.",
    "Absolutely! Especially Biol103 was fantastic and teaches skill every science student and researcher should know on how to read and analyze primary source literature and write a research proposal.",
    "This is class is required for premed students, however if you are really interested in developmental and evolutionary biology, you will really like this course.",
    "Yes, it is a great way to complete the bio sequence. It is fast-paced, but you really learn a lot throughout the summer and are exposed to so many interesting real world examples of what we are learning-- Cichlid rapid radiation in African lakes, Zika virus, and many, many more.",
    "This is an excellent introductory course for all science majors and it does a great job of building the foundation to develop the biological reasoning skills of students.",
    "Yes, It's a great way to learn the material and also lighten your load for your upcoming semester",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, when taught by professors Lin and Near, to another student. Professor Lin is an amazing lecturer and is very good at explaining topics that may be otherwise confusing; she is also very passionate. Professor Near is also clearly very passionate about his part of the course, and his enthusiasm and excitement come through in his lectures.",
    "Yes, I would, if you are interested in genetics and evolutionary biology. I think the course material was super engaging and it wasn't overwhelming.",
    "Yes, both Professor Lin and Professor Near are wonderful lecturers, I learned so much and really enjoyed the course.",
    "Yes, a great foundation for biology",
    "Yes, if you want to learn more about bio or if you need it for a major",
    "I definitely would! This course with these professors genuinely made the subject interesting, exciting, and engaging.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Although the accelerated nature of this summer course makes the curriculum fast-paced, Professor Lin, Professor Near, and the Teaching Fellows are all very dedicated to the students and make themselves available for any concerns via office hours and email correspondence. BIOL S106 instills critical thinking skills, analytical writing skills, and peer collaboration skills and serves as a smooth continuation of the BIOL 101\/102 sequence."
