The subject matter is interesting from a CS perspective but would be dry if not for his teaching style, which is accessible without overdoing it. Definitely the best proof-centric instruction I've gotten.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, while this isn't a flaw necessarily, you should be aware that this *is* a theory class. We did discuss particular algorithms and behaviors, but there's no implementation further than pseudocode, and problem sets (which are of a good difficulty but are maybe a bit too delayed from the class content) are entirely proof-style."

However, for students who like to take extensive notes, it was probably difficult to write down everything because the professor would clear the board immediately after filling up a page. Waiting a few seconds after writing everything down would help those who are taking notes.",

All in all though, it didn't feel like there were many changes.\r\n\r\nI should point out that there were no exams as a result of the pandemic, so the final grade was based entirely on problem sets. I think student opinions were divided on this - I liked it since I've had pretty bad experiences with online exams (especially proof-ish ones), but it did emphasize the problem sets a bit more than comfortable. Maybe a good compromise would be to have an additional problem set instead?"
