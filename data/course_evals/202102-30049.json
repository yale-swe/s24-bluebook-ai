                "This course taught me the details about lab techniques, even though I was not in lab in-person, but mainly it taught me how to compose scientific lab notes, chemical tables, and reports. I hadn't had any experience writing a more formal report (other than a typical lab report), but learning how to format, synthesize, and revise a more formal article style report was a great experience.",

                "One major strength is that the teaching staff provide a lot of clear guidance and feedback on assignments. Even though the course only lasted five weeks, I felt like I was able to perfect my writing when it came to lab notes and experimental plans. I wish we could have had a little more practice with writing scientific papers/reports, but I understand our time is constrained during the summer. But overall, this course is so much better and more helpful than gen chem lab!",
                "Strengths - weekly meetings with breakout rooms to break down lab info \r\nWeaknesses - more clear on grading, depending on teacher or TA, grading differed greatly",
                "Strengths: teaching staff was AMAZING and made the course very worthwhile and enjoyable. Its clear the class is meant to enhance and develop student learning. Experiments were pretty interesting and had products relevant to biology, pharmaceuticals, and medicine as well as the chemical concept at hand. \r\nWeaknesses: The grading distribution is a bit wonky in that your grade largely depends on the two post labs, but overall its not really that much of an issue - grading is generally pretty generous! This class is also a lot of work for only a half credit. Should probably be 1 credit.",
                "Nothing this course is great.",
                "Online lab is really tricky to organize, but this course was very well organized to capitalize on the parts of lab that could be done online and not try to force the parts that were impossible to do online. The quizzes were somewhat difficult, but short. The EP's and LN's took significantly more time than I thought they would, but we received a lot of feedback on them in the first few weeks before they were graded which was helpful to know what was expected, and throughout the session. The videos were informative and succinct.",
                "The only thing I could think to improve was the lab quizzes I thought they were pretty challenging with the very short time period.",
                "The professor is amazing but obviously there is always something lost in having a lab class online. Generally, it was a well taught class though."

But the teaching staff are really nice and always willing to work with your schedule. Also, taking it during the summer allowed me to focus a lot of my energy on the class compared to the school year where you'd have to balance this class with your other ones.",

The grading is very focused on improvement  and developing your skills as a chemist, and it was a lot less stressful than the other chem labs Ive taken.",
                "I think I would. Its very likely youre taking this as a requirement so you dont have much of a choice but its really not a bad lab class, especially compared to gen chem! The focus is on student learning rather than critique on how well you can synthesize something or carry out the experiment.",
                "Yes, you learn so much and the labs are interesting, applicable, and fun.",
                "Yes!",
                "Definitely. It was doable (a lot of work when combined with the lecture course over the summer), but in general, SO MUCH more enjoyable than Gen Chem lab. If you are scared away by gen chem lab, think again because this is a very very different lab experience. Dr. DiMeglio is amazing and the experiments are interesting and engaging. The writing isn't overwhelming and it is really beneficial to learn the type of scientific writing that is required of you in this course.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. Compared to general chemistry lab, this class was a lot less work, and it actually felt like I was learning something. The assignments were manageable and fair.",
