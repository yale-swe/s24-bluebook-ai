Some of those early assignments felt super daunting but the professor always emphasized having fun, left helpful comments, and ultimately it made completing the final project easier.",

We also learned about the TV industry itself through guest speakers (writers, agents, and producers).",

I not only learned about screenwriting and storytelling more broadly but also about creative development.

This course built my confidence in pursuing longer writing projects.",

                "I think this course is great in a lot of aspects in theory but these didn't necessarily transfer into the classroom experience. For example, we were assigned a lot of scripts to read, which is important for any writer (and I would say most people in the class wanted to be a writer in some way or another). However, the assignment of homework was sporadic and disorganized where in the early weeks the professor told us what to read at the end of each class (though we didn't necessarily discuss what we'd read that next class) and about halfway through we presumably shifted to what was posted on the syllabushowever, my missing this shift led me to not really keep up with readings as the course went on, especially because the professor had a tendency to fill in zoom silences and not call on people so I never felt pressure to engage in class. In general, I think that our weekly writing assignments were great for applying what we learned in class, but I felt in-class time could benefit from more structure (because I wasn't always necessarily sure what I was meant to get from class). I will say, though, that the lack of rigid structure was awesome during the latter half of the course when we essentially just came to class and discussed what we'd written for our final in pairs or threes. So for sure, I think this course is designed in all ways for the benefit of the student (in terms of applying methods and also making the final project very manageable (by finals period you could be basically done if you're proactive during the semester)), but I think a wee bit more structure, specifically in the lectures and reading assignments, could be good.",
                "Everything about this course is its strength. Professor Green is approachable and friendly, gives meaningful feedback without making you feel like he's forcing his opinion and stylistic choices on you. The readings are compelling and complement the subjects of the week nicely, and the weekly projects ensure you start improving right away. There are no weaknesses (in my opinion) to the course.",
                "Strengths: A lot more fun than the rest of your homework, about 5 hours of HW per week, which is quite average and wayyy more fun. I mean your homework is literally writing TV scenes, reading TV shows, and thinking up TV show ideas. Comparing this to my math 112 psets. Fascinating content, insightful professor, and you learn a lot from your peers/build a close knit writer's group. My favorite course so far at Yale. If I could take this course again, and again, and again, I would. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: would have appreciated a bit more feedback on writing assignments. But organized meetings accomplished that, just not on a weekly basis.",
                "I love this course.  It's such a unique opportunity to learn the ropes of professional screenwriting and I feel so grateful to have had the chance to prepare for a job I want in the future!",
                "I thought the course was great! We read great scripts and I really appreciated the professor's mix of both lecture and workshop format, as well as his occasional guest lecturers. I thought that our classroom discussions were sometimes slow, but I think that was mainly because of the awkwardness of online learning--and people often opened up much more in smaller workshops!"

                "Maybe. People say a lot that \"you only get out what you put in,\" but this course is so unstructured that this becomes even more true. This was my first time taking a course that focused on writing screenplays, so I definitely improved from the first to last day, but I didn't really love this course. I think my experience in this course points to why Yale, or perhaps the English department, should focus on creating more courses for students who are interested in writing for screen or going into Hollywood, but don't want to be an Art major. This being said, you do get access to so many scripts through this course, and we had three guests, who work in entertainment/Hollywood, come in, so if you are diligent about doing the readings and really work on multiple drafts of written assignments, I think you could get a lot out of this course.",
                "Yes, this is a fantastic course!! Prof. Green is amazing and really helps students achieve goals that they set for themselves (whether it be improving your writing, getting a summer internship, or trying to make connections in the entertainment industry). If you are interested in screenwriting or going to Hollywood after graduation, this course is certainly a must!",
                "Absolutely. Anyone with any interest in learning more about screenplays, let alone any form of creative writing will find their experiences broadened greatly by taking this class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. You don't need to have a professional interest in screenwriting/television to take this course. It's a wonderful creative experience regardless of your academic or professional interests. And it's really rewarding knowing that you leave the class with a product of a semester's worth of your own creative labor.",
                "If you want to become a better writer -- yes. If you want to learn about the Hollywood industry -- yes. If you want to learn the literary techniques behind your favorite TV shows -- yes. If you want to learn from a true creative -- yes. If you want to build a small community of writer peers -- yes. If you want to watch TV shows for homework and spend your Thursdays daydreaming about characters -- yes. If you want to write a TV pilot & pitch bible for your portfolio, or your own creative fiendishness -- yes!",
