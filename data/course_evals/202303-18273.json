                "Through the ANTH 311: Anthropological Theory course, I gained a nuanced understanding of anthropological concepts and theories, which greatly complemented my research on the failed transfer of Chinese hybrid rice technology in Mozambique. This course provides a deep exploration of theoretical frameworks, which equip me with the analytical tools necessary to disfigure complex narratives of progress and modernization that often obscure the sociocultural and economic realities faced by local communities, such as Mozambican farmers. One of the main strengths of the course is its comprehensive curriculum, which provides a solid understanding of various theoretical approaches. The work of scholars such as Escobar, Pandian, Dewan, Lennon, Ferguson, and Orlove has been particularly influential in providing me with a perspective to critically examine the dynamics of technology transfer in agricultural development and its impact in post-colonial Settings. This theoretical grounding has helped shape my research, allowing me to question and analyze the broader socio-political context and the role of state power in the development narrative. This course also exercises my critical thinking and research ability. By participating in discussions and assignments, I learned to take a more nuanced view of my research, taking into account the multifaceted impact of agricultural technology transfer programs such as ATDC's hybrid rice project. My ability to explain the resistance of local agricultural practitioners to the adoption of new agricultural knowledge has improved significantly, which has helped me identify gaps and neglected needs in knowledge transfer among Mozambican farmers. In addition, the course's emphasis on postcolonial and development theory enabled me to understand the complex relationships between technology disseminators (such as Chinese experts) and recipients (Mozambican farmers). This understanding is essential for assessing the effectiveness of ADC's work and the cultural sensitivities involved in such exchanges.",
                "I built a foundation in social and cultural theory deemed germane to anthropology. Regarding skills, I learned how to historicize authors, analyze dense text, and connect authors and concepts together over time.",
                "You learn so much about the development of anthropology as a discipline and the theory which lies at the basis of many of its core components.",
                "This class taught me to think both critically and constructively about anthropology and the history of the discipline. It introduced me to authors, and also helped ground me in anthropologists that I knew, but had not properly read (Boas, Durkheim, etc.). The arc of the class was well facilitated to merge contemporary critiques of anthropology with the older, and often deeply problematic, works of early anthropology. Our class was ALWAYS interesting, and I truly feel like I learned so much about methodology and scholarship, even though I'm not an anthropology major!"

                "ANTH 311: Anthropological Theory is a course with several significant advantages and some areas that can be improved to enrich the learning experience. One of its advantages is that it provides a broad theoretical framework, which provides a solid foundation for my understanding of complex social and cultural phenomena. This is especially beneficial for those engaged in in-depth theoretical research. The course also introduced me to a wide variety of academic viewpoints, including the works of famous figures such as Escobar and Pandian, which encouraged me to think critically and broadened my intellectual horizons. In addition, it excels at developing analytical skills through participation in discussions and assignments, allowing students to approach their research from a nuanced perspective. The relevance of the course to contemporary global issues, particularly through its focus on postcolonial and development theory, makes it highly relevant to current academic and real-world conversations.",
                "Strengths: I thought the syllabus was extremely well-organized; I knew what I was supposed to get out of each trimester of the course. I also found it helpful that we established baseline themes in the first couple weeks and then moved onto shifting perspectives that redress these limitations. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Students came in with varied exposure to social and cultural theory, which resulted in some students using the class to learn and figure out theory and other students jumping to critique it. This asymmetry inhibited the safe, growth-mindset-led learning environment we set out in the first class. I felt that class discussion was a bit hard to follow sometimes.",
                "I loved this course! The readings were well curated and discussion was great. Its biggest strength is Professor Lynch as a discussion leader, she does an amazing job of moderating which balances her involvement perfectly. I really appreciated her. \r\n\r\nI think the two essays throughout the semester were a bit short, and because the prompts were almost entirely open ended I felt it was difficult to achieve writing a great essay with only 4 pages of space."

                "I would NOT recommend this course to non-anthro majors. The problem is not that its theoretical, but that it is focused on applications only to anthropology.",
                "I would recommend ANTH 311: Anthropological Theory to other students, especially those with a strong interest in deepening their understanding of cultural and social dynamics through a theoretical perspective. The comprehensive theoretical framework of this course will provide a solid foundation for understanding complex social phenomena, making it a valuable resource for students pursuing research or careers in anthropology, sociology, and related fields. This aspect is particularly beneficial for students who wish to engage critically in academic discourse and have a nuanced understanding of a variety of cultural and social issues. The relevance of the course to contemporary global issues, in particular its focus on postcolonial and development theory, makes it highly relevant and applicable to current academic and real-world contexts. Students interested in understanding the complexities of global interactions, power dynamics, and cultural exchanges will find the course content particularly enlightening and practical.",
                "I highly recommend this course to students who are eager to learn sociocultural theory in a smaller seminar environment, willing to endure higher reading loads and formal analytical essays.",
                "Absolutely. Do not be an Anthropology major without taking this course, its so important! And if your not an Anth major, its a really wonderful introduction to the history of the field (though it does not dwell too heavily on its most current form, which is saved mostly for the last couple weeks).",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class, even to non-anthropology majors! Professor Lynch is an excellent teacher and truly knew how to facilitate a seminar space that created generative conversations every week. It was a challenging class, especially because it was very dense with theory, but the class discussions helped guide me through it."
