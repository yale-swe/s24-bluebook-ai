I was pretty surprised about my placement, and was unsure if the level was right for me, but I decided to continue anyway since I have always wanted to be fluent in Spanish. Throughout this semester, I have learned more about Spanish than I ever did in my old school district. I feel comfortable speaking, and can't wait to learn more in subsequent courses.",

                "One strength of this course was having one asynchronous day a week. I appreciated this opportunity as it allowed me to study vocabulary and complete class assignments. Another strength of this course was its small size. I engaged in frequent discussions with both my classmates and my professor, and the professor got to know all of us very well. However, one weakness was the workload during the beginning and middle of the course. There was alot of homework and quizzes during this section of the class, and it was a heavier workload in comparison to the other classes I was taking at the time. However, the workload for this class became more balanced, especially towards the end of the course.",

                "strength: consistency will daily classes\r\nweaknesses: overloaded with work sometimes. We learned a lot of Spanish very quickly, so if you were still practicing or needed help with a concept, there wasn't any time to catch up. There are also students who are more advanced in L1 that make learning altogether a bit more intimidating."

The intimate and supportive learning environment, along with the frequency at which you write, hear, and speak the language allows you to become more immersed in your learning. As someone who didn't take Spanish in high school, taking this class has improved my Spanish speaking and writing abilities while making me more confident about having conversations with Spanish speakers.",
