I definitely learned a lot about photography and its implications for the world we live in and how we live. In general, my writing improved greatly overall.",

    "weaknesses are the readings and lack of writing prep in class, strengths are engagement and small class size",
    "Some weaknesses: The prompts were sometimes confusing, and I did not understand what the professor expected, but he definitely clarifies if you ask him. Some of the readings are not the most exciting and a bit difficult, but I learned a lot from them. \r\n\r\nSome strengths: The professor is very receptive to the students' desires and is always trying to improve the course for his students. He gives you many opportunities to improve your grade and is not an unfair grader. There really were not an overwhelming amount of readings, and he scheduled them in a way that was very manageable.",
    "The professor tries very hard to improve the course consistently",
    "the course information was very interesting and very uninteresting at certain times. the reading load was reasonable but very boring.",
    "In terms of becoming a better writer, this course was effective. My only complaint would be that in the beginning of the year, the material was a little dry."
