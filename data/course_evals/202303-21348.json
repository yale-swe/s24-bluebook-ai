                "Strengths: This class teaches you a lot in a very short amount of time. While the material may be difficult to grasp at times in lecture, the labs and homework do an amazing job and walking you through each step. Also, the ideas brought up in class seemed very fresh and new and it was exciting to learn about an emerging field. Weaknesses: The actual lab sections were a bit unstructured but the content itself was very helpful.",
                "it's very new so we were working through a lot in it. mostly a better understanding of what background is needed would be nice",
                "Strengths: Ilker is very knowledgeable about the subject matter. He selects great readings and the discussion of concepts is exemplary in lecture. John is a wonderful TF, he is extremely responsive, caring, and helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nOverall: Right now the course tries to be a research methods course that teaches students how to use a bunch of different tools of probabilistic programming for cognitive science research. While I learned a lot about cognitive science from the lectures and readings, I don't think I developed a robust set of research skills (and the theory covered was not enough to understand what was actually going on behind the hood in many of the readings).\r\n\r\nThe Location: The Wu Tsai center is great for grad students, but it is very far for undergrads and having to go 3 times a week during the middle of the day (11:35-12:50) made it difficult to schedule amidst other classes (not to mention dealing with lunch). \r\n\r\nThe Labs: It was pointless to walk all the way to the Wu Tsai Center when they could have been completed asynchronously to the same effect. Also, the labs often contained deprecated code and didn't require much engagement. More of the labs should have been like the last lab (which was less about being along for the ride).\r\n\r\nThe PSETS: These were in very few cases I actually felt like I learned something that I couldn't have just used ChatGPT to generate. In other words, these PSETS felt more pedantic than intellectually challenging. They were frequently released late and due at odd times like 8:00 on Sunday even if they weren't actually graded until a month later. \r\n\r\nThe Final Project: There were 2 weeks of school between the day we submitted our project proposals and the day of the presentation. One issue with the Final Project was that it was an engineering project, but because the PSETS/Labs were not sufficient to teach many of these engineering skills needed, and because the time frame was so short, everyone sort of relied on skills they had from past courses (or built a POMDP lol) to varying effect. Really though, the final project was a dumpster fire because of the YCRC maintenance, the lack of cluster support for Julia in December and the variability of the last minute course container. Trying to work on the project only for the cluster to crash or container to break caused me deep anxiety and dread. For the vast amount of time I spent on the project, in the end I was unusually dissatisfied with my result. It was a cool model, but building it was a labor of pain not a labor of love.\r\n\r\nAlright that's enough complaining . . .\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\n-S&DS 238 Prerequisite. Assume knowledge of Bayesian statistics and cut 2 weeks of review material.\r\n\r\n- No lab section. Instead, offer extra office hours on Mondays. Use the first few office hours to help set up the container (this container setup would be associated with the first pset released on day 0 of the course). \r\n\r\n-Readings every week, but students must turn in only 6 reading responses to get full credit (more than this is not required). This solves the problem of having weeks where PSET + reading is too much. Now students can decide when to spend time close reading and crafting a response vs. when to spend time on the PSET etc. \r\n\r\n-5 well-designed problem sets (TWO WEEKS PER PSET -- one every other week with the last one due on Week 10). Each problem set should include a lab at the top and then involve using the ideas from the lab to solve problems down below and answering conceptual questions. PSETS should entail a comprehensive amount of writing code from scratch, not just filling in the blank. As described above there seemingly was little reason to make the psets due within 7 days every time, when the next pset wasn't going to be assigned for another week. \r\n\r\n-Project proposal due anytime from Week 9 to the end of Week 10 and meetings with Ilker during Week 11 to discuss the project. This gives an extra two weeks for project work.",
                "The strengths really lie in its capacity for teaching useful tools that can be deployed for research. I saw undergrads (and myself) do really cool research for their final projects using the principles and tools covered in the class. It was also good to look at how these concepts are applied for cutting edge research in cognitive science. \r\n\r\nI think the weaknesses primarily stem from this course being new, and so I want to take some time with them because I think this couse will only continue to improve and be a real asset for graduate students and undergrads. \r\nI think the course should make clearer commitments to the balance between concepts and programming. And my personal view is that it should lean toward programming a little more. For example, I think it needs more lab time relative to lecture time. I don't know if Yale allows for this, but it would be nice to have just under 2 hours of lecture to cover general overview and intuitions of the concepts and then take some time applying them. Even if it wasn't intense lab sections, we could have our laptops out and code along as we implement basic things in julia that were already in the slides (like pulling balls out of urns). I guess I'm not sure how this would affect the latter part of the course when we go over papers, but that seems flexible enough. \r\nI also think a required pset 0 would be good. But I think it should incorporate both julia and probability. For example, just implementing and sampling different kinds of probability distributions, even in VERY simple generative models so we can also get the basics of traces and choice maps. I think this foundation will be IMMENSELY beneficial for doing the other psets and labs in the course, as well as allowing for some creativity in thinking of different projects that are possible. \r\nIn general, there was more material than I could cover in the labs. If there was more time for lab section this wouldn't be an issue. Also that we got into a better groove for this later in the semester. That speaks to the broader point that I think you are still experimenting with the best format and I'm sure this will all work itself out.",
                "Strengths: responsive teaching staff, engaging lectures\r\nImprovements: I would give at minimum 2 weeks to complete the psets instead of only one (they're due every 3 weeks or so anyway), make the labs longer and more interactive to build confidence in Julia outside of psets (I liked the structure of the final lab with required exercises), give earlier feedback on psets, and pare down the reading schedule so students can read for depth and not just skim. But I know this was the first time this course was taught, so it's possible there will be a lot of changes for the next iteration!",
                "Strengths of the course include relevant and engaging lectures, with a balanced overall workload! The course and concepts were fun and interesting, and I really enjoyed lectures throughout the whole semester!\r\n\r\nThe only major feedback I would suggest for improvement were the structures of the lab sections. While starting strong with guided code walkthroughs, the labs shifted midway through the semester to a more independent-style workflow. I found this change to reduced my learning effectiveness, as students were left to run (more or less) pre-written Julia scripts without too much guidance, and I found this to attenuate my understanding of the transition from concept to code. \r\n\r\nPerhaps an enhancement to the lab structure could involve initially going through a complete Julia script with the TA explaining the coding syntax and pipeline for a base example. This would provide a clear understanding of the practical applications and teach the relevant coding syntax needed for that week's lab/pset. In the second half of the lab, transitioning to small-group coding exercises focused on a simple, yet specific deliverable, like a figure, would reinforce the concepts. This approach would not only facilitate a deeper understanding of the material but also ensure that students can demonstrate their grasp of both the concept and its coding implementation.",
                "Strengths: interesting material, great lectures, prof and TA were both extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Homework was also quite interesting. Weaknesses: I think it would have been better if the labs required us to actually write our own code rather than just run pre written code blocks. The homework could have been a bit more challenging in my opinion. Sometime it seemed like all that was required was just inserting a single line or parameter into the template code. Also, we never really received feedback on our homework. One issue was that the office hours were often during the middle of the day when most undergrads have other classes.",
                "strength: very hands-on practices, nice and well-connected lectures\r\nweakness: it'd be better if the lab section and PSets could be much more ironed out in advance; and also to receive feedback on PSets (haven't received any for the 4 psets)",
                "It was a cool concept in theory, and cool concepts in coding projects as well. However, lectures can become repetitive and aren't very engaging in practice (most of it ends up being technical math background stuff). The coding assignments also felt like syntax bashing/copying from lab work, so this also could have been improved a bit. Sometimes work expectations were unclear, and feedback was a bit lacking. However, this was the first year taught, so the course still has lots of potential for growth.",
                "Strengths: incredibly fascinating topic, fantastic in-depth explorations of state-of-the-art research, good and accommodating professor. Weaknesses: sometimes the distinctions of levels of the topic (formulaic description vs. programming code implementation vs. abstract model diagrams) were difficult to separate and understand on their own",
                "There are a lot of places this course could have been improved. The way the course was organized was a bit confusing -- we first spent a *lot* of time covering probability and bayesian statistics, which was good and necessary to class, but about halfway through the course it wasn't clear when we were going to begin learning about actual cognitive processes and how to model them in class. Once we did start doing that, it was a lot better, but it took a white to get there.\r\n\r\nThe content is incredibly dense. As an undergraduate not coming from a background of any computational modeling or any research of the sort, it was very difficult to keep up to pace. This was accentuated by the fact that there are a ton of grad students who take the class who seem to understand everything, and I often felt left in the dark. Often times I'd leave lecture being like \"okay, that all sounds cool, but I don't understand it at all.\" \r\n\r\nLabs were used to facilitate learning the languages necessary to completing the problem sets. This was good, but help was pretty sparse during those psets. There was only one TF and he had very limited office hours. Ilker's office hours too were limited and this meant that we were on our own for much of the time. There was help via Ed but not all the time (and not always helpful). Luckily the psets were doable but at the beginning of the course this was frustrating. \r\n\r\nThere were a lot of issues with the final project. This comes back to the courses organization  by the time we start thinking about the final project, there is only about a month left in the course, and it's incredibly open-ended and not structured at all. I felt like I was scrambling to understand anything about how to approach the final project. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion I think this class has the potential to be an amazing one, it just felt like a mess most of the time and I did not take away as much as I hoped I would. I'm sure a lot of the issues will be improved going forward because I took the first iteration of the class."
