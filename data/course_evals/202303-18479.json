I learned ways to justify my point of view and also understand the perspective of others. What I learned from this is that humanity has various ways of taking in and creating from reality and that there is no one right way to think of it. It also helped me learn to ask more profound questions and have a reason behind all my views.",
                "This class provides an opportunity to examine how we examine art, existence, imagination, and ourselves as things that exist and seem to exist. It allows students the chance to closely examine things perhaps closer than ever. It is a class that allows us to challenge our assumptions, indulge our assumptions, and search for what and why we assume what we assume.",

I learned a lot about the different ways to distinguish the real from the unreal and how to tangle with the messiness of reality. I found the work engaging and helpful in my life even beyond the classroom."

Unfortunately, this also is the weakness of the course in that I feel like we touched on so many topics that were hyper-niche in their way, but that felt very disjointed at times and hard to connect. I feel like it could have been better with more focus on one thing in the class design.",

                "Depends on what they want out of it. It was enjoyable and exposed me to lots of new writers and disciplines, but it's also such a broad and ill-defined topic that this felt like meandering through different fields and unrelated or contradictory thoughts week to week. I struggled with this a bit, but it was still interesting. Profs. Khawaja and Fiduccia are both wonderful -- thoughtful, engaging, fun in class. Readings were interesting and the three short papers very reasonable.",

I think, even if you are not a student very interested in philosophy, any person could find something valuable to take away from this course. This course has helped me to develop my outlook on life and will continue to impact how I choose to live each day. I am so glad I took this course!",
                "I would not recommend this course. The course started strong, but started to become muddled and directionless soon after. Papers were not handed back In a timely manner."
