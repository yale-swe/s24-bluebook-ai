            "comments": [
                "I think that a lot of information was covered, which can be a strength, but I also think that way too much was covered in way too little time. I think that the course could be improved by just dividing the lectures up into core ideas, which would make all the information much easier to digest.",
                "I think the strengths of the course were: Professor Engleman and his slides, the peer tutors and their review sessions, and the practice exams. I think that in Prof. Breaker's half of the course, it was more challenging to figure out what we needed to know for exams (and in general). Adding to this challenge was the lack of answer keys to practice exams 3 and 4. For a course with only four assignments, these four exams, it feels even more important to provide students with resources there. I think a key weakness to note in the course was the TAs. With few exceptions, discussion sections were unhelpful and often times stress-causing and confusing. The TAs seemed to have a noted lack of knowledge of the subject of biochemistry and some were unable to answer simple questions. Furthermore, they did not conduct review sessions for the later exams, and the answer key they provided had a number of uncorrected errors. Recruiting TAs with more knowledge would help the course significantly, especially in the latter half when there is more of a gap between content taught and content tested.",
                "The professors do not teach what is on any of the exams which are the only form of evaluation.",
                "The strengths and weaknesses are probably the same thing for the class. It's nice having only four exams because you don't have to do any busy work for your grade, but it is a lot of pressure to study and come prepared for each exam to do well on the exam. I had to study a lot for each exam only to continue doing average for each exam.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Wow... the TA's were easily the worst part of this course... I went to three different discussion sections throughout the first two weeks of classes and none of them seemed like they were very knowledgeable about the subject. I remember I would always go to Kevin (peer tutor's) office hours to ask him about material in the course and that was wayyy helpful than going to discussion section. I also remember that the professors struggled finding TA's for this class to begin with. If Breaker and Engelman were more proactive about finding competent TA's who could actually teach, understand, and synthesize the content, I think that would have significantly benefited my experience in the class.",
                "I think that there could be more regularly held review sessions with TAs and a more clear understanding of what to expect on exams. We would often get messages \/ notice the night before an exam letting us know if something is (Example: amino acid structures) or is not (Example: ATP Synthase) on it and since we have other classes and plan our studying around those, it would be great to have notice in advance so we could make more efficient use of our studying time.\r\n\r\nI did appreciate the lecture styles of Engelman and Breaker and found the information super interesting. I think more simple slides and less with \"TMI\" would be helpful to hone in on whats most important and not feel too overwhelmed during lecture.",
                "Drs. Engelman and Breaker were pretty good professors. You learn a lot of content in a short amount of time, which can be very beneficial. However, only having four exams for your grade was scary.",
                "Slow down second half of semester",
                "I think that the material provided during lecture is so much to comprehend in such a short time, and I don't think that it is gone enough in detail for the exams to be asking questions on it.",
                "The course struggled mightily in distinguishing what was supposed to be studied from what was not.  Oftentimes, the professors assure us we only need to have a general sense of a mechanism or detail, but include very specific questions drawn from the lecture slides on exams.  Feedback on tests and TF responsiveness was fairly minimal (sample practice tests in the second half of the class didn't even have answer keys).",
                "I think their needs to be more than just exams in this class to assess students, adding in problem sets or some kind of take home work would allow students to engage with the material more and help students who might not be great test takers or who were unable to properly prepare for the exams do to extenuating circumstances.",
                "strengths: interesting, great peer tutors and TAs, better than organic chemistry \r\nweaknesses: no matter how much professors tell you that you don't need to memorize the material, if you want to do well on the exams, you need to memorize everything",
                "Having four exams throughout the semester be the only assignments made the course a little stressful. Perhaps there could be a problem set component or a policy that allowed for the lowest exams grade to be dropped (perhaps raising the total mid-terms to 5 five for the semester then). That said, the exams are fair and not really as memorization-based as much as understanding core concepts. Engelman's lectures were fairly engaging and well-delivered; he really explained things in an accessible and clear way. Breaker's lectures were a little bit harder to follow, but he is clearly very passionate about the subject and about teaching, which was encouraging.",
                "I felt like the course was well-organized. Both professors were good lecturers. I only wish the lecture recordings were available for viewing after class. There are no assignments, and your grade is only based on tests, which makes the class have a lighter workload.",
                "Strengths: I believe a significant strength of this class was in its ability to encourage higher-level thinking about biochemical processes and to apply the concepts learned in class to medical conditions that would be relevant to any Pre-Medical or Pre-MD\/PhD student!\r\n\r\nWeakness: I do not see any weaknesses of the course!",
                "Strengths: good instructors, exams are the only assignments\r\nWeaknesses: TAs are not great, theres a lot of material so its unclear what you need it know for exams",
                "First half was great - second half not well organized",
                "Strengths- Both professors lay out clear goals and have no tricks on their exams. The lectures are both engaging and interesting. \r\nWeakness- The style of the exams are different from each professor, so there was a bit of disconnect from the first half of the course to the second half of the course. Overall, this was no too big of an issue. Great course!",
                "Strengths: the teaching styles, class resources, the lack of other assignments",
                "One huge weakness of the course is having two different professors over the course of a semester. I thought both were excellent, although the whole pace and density of lecture switched half way through the semester. The strength of the class was the ability to focus on material more in depth by having non-cumulative exams. Something else Id like to add is that although both professors claim the class isnt rogue memorization, I found it to be equally as important as conceptual understanding. Some questions from the exam were almost copy and pastes from a single slide out of 100s.",
                "A strength in the class was the emphasis on understanding the material and how the professors wanted us to do well and not be discouraged. The main weakness was the difference in teaching and testing styles between the 2 professors.",
                "strengths: encourages self directed learning, which is great to learning complex material at your own pace\r\nweakness: lack of answer keys to practice problems (some answer keys were even wrong), unresponsive TAS, limited guidance on how well you are doing at each stage, very complex problems that require spaced learning but very limited time to actually master the content, which impedes on learning. \r\n\r\nto improve: more low stakes quizzes as opposed to only 4 exams in totality, more review sessions, more emphasis on how to complete problems + providing comprehensive answer keys to past papers.",
                "I really enjoyed how the class was structured. I felt like exams were very fair, and that the professors and Teaching Fellows did a great job in preparing us and answering questions before the exams. I appreciated that there wasn't a comprehensive final but that the content itself built upon itself so that we felt like we were learning a ton without having to go back and memorize previous minute details for a final exam. I do think that sometimes lectures could be a bit difficult to follow, especially with chemical mechanisms, and I think the professors could perhaps adjust their slides or lecturing to clarify which details are important.",
                "There is a lot of material but the exams tend to be pretty fair about what they test on. The professor posted practice exams but not an answer key. The TAs were not very knowledgeable over the material",
                "I think it could be helpful to get the TFs a little bit earlier",
                "Both professors are really great but, as expected, have different teaching styles. I think most students found the learning goals on Professor Engelmann's slides helpful. It would also be nice to have the lecture recordings posted.",
                "I thought it was wonderful! The lectures were very lecture-like, so perhaps this can be seen as a weakness. Otherwise I loved that there were no psets or other work, other than truly learning the material.",
                "Bad",
                "I think that it was a weakness that lectures were not recorded. I think that it was hard for students that got sick or were unable to come to lecture to actually learn the material. I also think that a weakness of this course was that it was very memory-heavy instead of focusing on the concepts. One strength of this course was the TA review sessions. They were able to give direction and guidance regarding how we should be studying for the exams. I also think that one weakness of the course was how the exams were graded. I don't think it was great to grade exams relative to one another and not have a standardized rubric. I think this could be an inaccurate way of measuring what students actually know, especially because some students may not have known which details are required for the answers to be sufficient.",
                "Strengths: course is interesting and engaging\r\nWeaknesses: resources are not available to everyone, such as lecture recordings. TAs are not very organized during review sessions, but otherwise TAs are great.",
                "The course was taught well, there is just a lot of material to cover. I think that it would be beneficial to add another form of application of the material besides the exams. Does not have to be problem sets for grades, but maybe optional question sets to help students understand and practice with the material.",
                "Strengths: Smart and kind professors, interesting content\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The overall structure of the course is poor and is not designed to facilitate student learning, but rather student memorization and regurgitation on basic exams. The lectures are not engaging and all of the information can be learned from reading the lecture slides. The professors do not read off the slides per se, but they are not adding any additional information, which can make them difficult to follow. There are no problem sets or quizzes. Four, non-cumulative exams make up the entire grade calculation. I found the topics very interesting, but they were only investigated on the surface. Biochemistry is such an essential course but the way MCDB 300 is designed it does not encourage students to actually engage with the material in any substantial manner.",
                "A strength of the course is the lectures since Breaker and Engelman both are incredibly knowledgeable. Their slides were very concise, easy to follow, and great for studying afterwards. \r\n\r\nA weakness of the course is that there are no problem sets, meaning that you have no feedback until the exam which determine your entire grade. Additionally, sections were incredibly disorganized\/varied greatly depending on the TA (they couldn't find any TAs for the course until 3 weeks into class). I feel like sections could be better organized to focus on doing problems together or in a discussion format.",
                "The first half of the course had clear learning objectives on every slide deck and I think did a better job of focusing on biochemistry concepts in a biological context. The second half of the course got so specific in detailing mechanisms of chemical processes that it was often hard to contextualize what we were learning. There was just so much information and I think we spent so much time going through the mechanisms that we lost out on learning about important biologically relevant pieces of biochemistry. I loved learning about hemoglobin and myoglobin in the first half of the course, but there were few connections like this in the second half.",
                "Problem sets may have been appreciated, as the only engagement was the lectures and a test ever 3 weeks, which didnt encourage incremental studying",
                "The switch of Teaching sort les and exam questions makes it difficult to adjust in the middle of the term",
                "This course's greatest weakness, in my opinion, is the lack of homework or quizzes. Having your entire grade based off only 4 equally weighted exams kinda sucks. Homework makes students review and engage with the material, as well as learn the question style of the professor, and quizzes help students learn the extent of their knowledge and therefore what they need to review and focus on. The lack of these I think may hinder some students learning. On the positive side, both professors were very knowledgeable, approachable, and good lecturers (their lectures were organized, focused, and clear).",
                "I felt like the exams, especially in the second half of the semester, were not comprehensive of the material that was taught. At times the lectures could be monotonous, but the slides were very well organized and clear. Both Breaker and Engleman are great lectures that are clearly very passionate."

With four exams as the only grades, it means that students are stressed for really only about four weeks of the semester with the rest relatively unstressful and low workload. Note that the TAs were really quite unhelpful but the peer tutors were great. Prof. Breaker had more confusing slides than Prof. Engelman, and I think he could benefit from working on lecture timing and laying out better objectives before and after the lecture.",

So if you have to, maybe just take this biochem instead of the MBB (which requires 2 semesters).\r\n\r\nI will say, however, if you really like biochemistry, you should the year long MBB sequence one because it seems to go much more in-depth and none of the material is rushed or sped through (which often felt like the case in this class).",
                "If it is required for your major, yes. I highly recommend taking the MCDB Biochem over the MBB since we are often not left with much space in our schedule to take classes outside of our majors so get it done in one semester instead of two. There is a lot of memorization but understanding the lecture slides is really the key to doing well.",
                "I mean if you are taking it, you probably are required to. It is definitely the better of the two biochemistry options at Yale, and Drs. Breaker and Engelman try to make it as painless as possible.

                "I would recommend this course to another student who desires a more topical survey course in Biochemistry. This course presents you with fundamental ideas. Understandably, due to the short nature of the course, there is not time to dive in-depth in carbohydrates and nucleic acids.",
                "Only if you need for your major",
                "Yes, I learned a lot. When I worked hard, I got expected results which was satisfying.",
                "If you need to take",
                "Yes. Especially if you are looking to take this course for the MCAT. It teaches you almost everything you need to know for the MCAT.",
                "Yes! Its necessary to gain an understanding of the foundation of biochemistry",
                "If you are a premed I would take this course, although this isnt the course to take if you are just trying to explore natural sciences.",
                "Yes for a prerequisite! I learned so much and the structure of the course was great.",
                "yes! take this class if you genuinely want to advance your knowledge of biochemistry & would like to intellectually challenge yourself by doing so.",
                "Yes, if you have previously succeeded in biology and chemistry courses, I think this course is very interesting and manageable.",
                "If you have to take it",
                "Yes, it's a great foundational class",
                "This is a great course! While challenging, you learn a lot and the professor's really care about your learning.",
                "Definitely!",
                "No. Graders are harsh and dont want to regrade eventhough answers are correct",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to students interested in learning more about the biochemical mechanisms thats underly a lot of the biological processes that you have probably learned in earlier bio courses. It does draw upon organic chemistry and requires a lot of memorization but it is a very good course that teaches important concepts.",
                "I would recommend this course to premed students or students that need biochemistry for their major. I think that this course was decently fair in terms of material, but I think that the way it was taught was hard to review and actually learn with it being a lecture class.",
                "For those wanting to be a biology major, I highly recommend this course.",
                "Most students take biochemistry as a pre-med requirement. I think that the course is not necessarily the most fun for all students, but it covers everything and is taught very well.",
                "If you want an easy to manage class without a lot of assignments and time commitment that allows you to learn the basics needed for MCAT biochem, then yes. If you want more engagement with the content and more assignments taken into consideration for your total grade, maybe look into the MB&B biochem.",
                "Not unless if you need this class for pre-med or your major.",
                "I wouldn't really recommend this unless it's a requirement for you.",
                "Its fine, and largely review, but can be challenging and surprising memorization based at times",
                "Most likely a requirement",
                "Probably 95% of students taking this course are taking it because they have to, so my recommendation doesn't really matter but I will say I enjoyed the content of this course and the professors! Your entire grade being based on only 4 exams sucks, so it would be cool if they changed that, but other than that its a cool class. Some of the material can be difficult, but it's all practice and memorization.",
                "Yes. The workload was fair and the material was pretty interesting."
