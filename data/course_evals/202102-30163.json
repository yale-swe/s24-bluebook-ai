                "Strengths: The modules are well organized and helpful. The textbook is generally pretty good. The material by nature isn't very interactive but Professor Dhillon did the job and explained the topics fairly well and in a different way to the textbook. Class didn't feel like a repeat of the pre-class watching, which sometimes is the case for other summer session classes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class moves quickly and if you don't have a very strong pre-calculus background in topics like trig functions and logs then you will have to work to catch up. The Friday workshops are group work which can be extremely hit or miss, especially over Zoom. Sometimes homework and pre-class watching would be posted late, making it difficult to manage time.",

                "I would only recommend this to students who need to take this for a requirement, as the fast pace of the summer class can be stressful. That said, the amount of homework is generally manageable compared to some other summer classes I have taken, so if you have some background in basic differentiation and antidifferentiation, or if you have a very strong pre calculus background, then you might want to take this to get it out of the way. Be aware the exams are very challenging and fast paced and you need to not only be familiar with the material but also able to think on your feet.",
