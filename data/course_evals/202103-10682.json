A comprehensive overview of the prima facie justifications of punishment (retributivism, rehabilitation, deterrence) and the ways they compliment/contradict each other. A chance to apply theory in more practical case studies of the death penalty, sex predator laws, and prison abolition.",
                "The course covers all traditional theoretical justifications for punishment-- retribution, deterrence, etc.-- and introduces students to evolving understandings of punishment, such as moral education theory. We discussed different actors involved in punishment, institutions used for punishment, and alternatives to our current carceral system.",
                "A review of penological literature and the reasons why a government punishes its citizens. Probably one of the most insightful courses I've taken at Yale.",
                "I learned more about the theoretical justifications for punishment and both the strengths/implications of these justifications as well as the weaknesses of/challenges to them. I've gained insight into how society's justifications for punishment don't necessarily match up with its actual practice, and how we need to truly think deeply about what the purpose of punishment is.",
                "I really learned how to deeply examine my normal way of thinking and how to communicate my ideas based on the experiences I've had. I really learned how to listen and be open enough to what I heard in order to change my thoughts.",

                "An overview of the different main purposes of punishment (retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, etc.) along with various case studies like the \"battered wife\", acts of a sexual nature, the death penalty, and more. We worked within all these ideas in a very philosophical/normative framework.",
                "Deepen understanding of theoretical questions around difficult ethical legal questions. Didnt find any answers but thats part of the draw learned so much about my own moral tendencies from discussions in class.",
                "I rethought the fundamental underpinnings of the connection between crime and punishment. This course allowed me to understand criminal justice through numerous new lenses and question the justifications for punishment in the American system.",
                "A deep dive into the legal, political, and philosophical theories and justifications for punishment, with a focus on American legal jurisprudence. Topics included the death penalty, deterrence and incapacitation, prisoners' rights, forgiveness and mercy, the role of vengeance, humiliation, and shame, and sex crimes. This class really taught me to think critically and analytically about law at a higher order of complexity than I had before.",
                "A really challenging and unique course it taught me to think critically about punishment, carceral systems, and the way we apply punishment/shame/discipline in our daily lives, perhaps without thinking. We talked about punishment in theoretical/philosophical terms, but also in more applicable ways (looking at law and policy), so people who are interested in law as well as people who just like political theory/philosophy can get a lot out of this course."

                "Only positive things to say about this course. The readings, both in a particular week and in how they built off-each other over the course of the semester, were chosen well. The discussion, with facilitation from Prof. Rosas, always got into the meat of a given issue, forced people to challenge their views, and generally was of higher quality than anything else I have seen in the PLSC department. The major assignments were also well-designed to not just test our knowledge, but our ability to tease out connections between different concepts. The final paper was also a great opportunity to deep-dive.",
                "Strengths: excellent seminar discussion led by Professor Rosas, manageable reading load (about 100 meaningful pages a week), highly organized class structure, interesting course topics, flexible final paper topic, clear feedback from the professor \r\nWeaknesses: I would have loved to have spent a bit more time on abolition, or introduced it earlier in the course, but the class was excellent otherwise!",
                "Strengths: Rosas is just such a phenomenal discussion leader. Has a very warm, professional way of keeping things focused and challenging students to fully tease out their thoughts. Leads to really insightful and genuine discussion rather than people just saying things for the participation grade.",
                "Professor Rosas was a huge strength of this course; he took the comments students made seriously and often challenged them in class or asked follow up questions (not in an intimidating way at all, but in such a way that it made students think more deeply about the arguments they were making). The readings and the way the course was clearly divided into larger subtopics was also a huge strength. The final paper also lends itself to a lot of flexibility and so you're able to explore anything that interests you. The Oral Reading Reaction Assignment was also  a huge strength! It sounds incredibly intimidating, but Professor Rosas makes you feel very comfortable and it's very low stakes; it's a great opportunity to have a one-on-one conversation about a specific issue that particularly interests/concerns you. The only weakness of the course I can think of is not really the course's fault, but I think the classroom we were in made it difficult to have seminar discussions given that our table was a long rectangle-like table and it was difficult to see each other's faces. I think it would be helpful to shift to a larger (or at least, not as narrow) classroom.",
                "The strength of the class is the quality of the leading questions. Discussion in seminars can go for more than an hour based on one or two questions that really made us think about the reading and the ways punishment affects our society.",
                "- fascinating reading material from a diversity of perspective \r\n- rigorous discussion",
                "strengths",
                "Strengths: Absolutely Rosas as an incredible professor, and the seminar conversation that followed. Talking to other students, we have never been in a more actively engaged and actively fruitful seminar conversation that Prof. Rosas' room, who facilitated an incredible socratic-style method of teaching that kept us all on our toes (at first intimidating, but it's really not!) and continuously developing our ideas on quite complex and difficult ideas. Also, Rosas' continuous feedback is incredible, and it's clear he puts a lot of time into giving the fairest, clearest feedback he can to each student, and absolutely takes their ideas and work seriously. The mid-semester oral exam was new but incredibly rewarding and was another way to work through course concepts 1-on-1.",
                "Only strengths! Prof is amazing at leading discussions, great learning from other class mates, interesting readings and not an inordinate amount, papers are interesting to write.",
                "This course is well taught, well designed, and engaging. It should be repeated as run this year.",
                "So many strengths. Fantastic professor and instructor, really wonderful syllabus (especially like the mix of political philosophy, legal theory and law reviews, and court cases), very high quality of seminar discussion, and great feedback on your debate and writing. I felt like our class got really close and thoughtful by the end, which was especially valuable given the thorny and emotionally fraught subjects that we were discussing.",
                "Strengths: Professor Rosas was excellent at encouraging and facilitating lively discussions he constantly pushed us to refine and articulate the very complex ideas we were learning in this course. He was also very accommodating to students when it came to COVID complications. I thought my classmates were all really bright and engaged with the course, which made for very exciting discussions. Weaknesses: I found that we didn't spend time talking about a lot of the readings (though the readings are there to mostly spark convos + not meant to be discussed super thoroughly), and I wondered if the readings could be cut down for the class."

                "Absolutely take this course! Professor Rosas is by far one of the best seminar leaders I have had-- he expertly frames discussion but still allows student conversation to meander. While the course may leave you with more question than answers, I am now much more well-versed in theoretical justifications for punishment and have further defined my stances on the death penalty and the like. Punishment is such a relevant topic today, and I can't imagine a better environment for thinking about our current understanding more critically. Also, the required readings for this course are not only incredibly interesting but also wholly manageable because Professor Rosas selects only the most pertinent passages for us to read.",
                "A must-take course at Yale. Really well-structured to allow one to ask themselves questions about punishment and incarceration that they maybe never considered; the final paper lets you explore whatever you want in greater detail, with some class time devoted to peer feedback and workshopping.",
                "Yes, the course really challenges you to think deeply about what our justifications of punishment are and what the purposes of punishment are. Throughout the course, you think through a series of questions with important implications; to be totally honest, the course does not answer most of these questions and you end the course with a lot more questions than you started with, but that's the point. We need to critically think about punishment, its practice and its purpose. That being said, I would also say that this class focuses primarily on the theoretical justifications of punishment and so many of our readings are theory-based; although modern practices of punishment did often come up in our conversations, much of the readings (especially in the beginning of the course) are theory heavy.",
                "I would 100% recommend this class to other students because of how topical the discussion is.",
                "Professor Rosas is fantastic, especially when it comes to facilitating discussion and asking probing questions. He offers helpful feedback, and regardless of your background in philosophy (or lack thereof), makes the course material accessible",
                "yes definitely if you are interested in challenging your view of punishment",
                "Absolutely, to anyone interested in normative/philosophical ideas about punishment (especially and even for those who label themselves abolitionists, this course pushed me to really understand how we can separate ideas about punishment and justice from incarceration and our system today). This course forces you to look at a lot of incredibly tough questions where the answers aren't so black and white, but I was able to leave with some revelations about my own beliefs that I'll carry forward for a while.",
                "Yes! though I left with more questions than answers I have a more robust understanding of why we punish, and The questions we must answer to understand how to change how we punish.",
                "Absolutely. Dean Rosas is an amazing instructor, the discussions are captivating, and the course exposes contradictions across justifications for punishment and forces you to engage with institutions of criminal justice in a new light.",
                "YES - just a superb seminar course for anyone interested in law, political theory, and/or criminal justice. Professor Rosas is such an incredible seminar leader, somehow making it look easy to synthesize everyone's comments and points and adding his own challenges and questions at the same time. He so obviously cares about his students, and gives tremendous and detailed feedback on writing and oral evaluation. This is one of only a few seminars at Yale that really delve into jurisprudence and legal theory, and I'd especially recommend Punishment for anyone interested in radical changes and reforms to the criminal justice system - if only to be challenged and forced to think through some really thorny issues.",
                "Yes! Professor Rosas is the best. Though I would say because of the large syllabus, once-a-week format, and open-ended assignments, what you put into this course is what you get out of it definitely only take it if you're very interested in the topics."
