                "I learned more about the Chinese governmental systems of censorship, relevant history of PRC, and various pieces of pop and official media cultures to help inform us of how these entities have been affected by various regimes of censorship and control.

                "Strengths: moderately light workload, very interesting topics, Dr. Cao guides discussion well and provides lots of context ======== Weaknesses: group presentations could have been more organized, a few readings were very field-specific",
                "A few of the readings were very hard to wrap my head around, but some of the concepts are just that complex so I think it is okay.",
                "The strengths are that the topics are super interesting and approachable. The weaknesses are that the course didn't seem to have a clear topic. The title of the class refers to media, and our units were structured around a different form of media (art, movies, novels, etc.), but we didn't analyze them as media in the context of their uses in China. Rather, we only looked at Chinese versions of these media. Other than this, I think the course was a lot of fun, especially because my classmates had a lot of interesting opinions and perspectives.",
                "Strength: systematic studies of the Chinese media from comprehensive perspectives.",
                "It was very interesting and teaches a lot about China, its relationship with the West, and specific examples of film, literature, art, and history.",
                "Strengths: interesting readings, lots of opportunities for students to engage with the material during class, knowledgable professor. Weaknesses: sometimes the readings felt random, and there wasn't a clear progression or theme throughout the course. Touched on lots of different subjects and ideas, but it would have been nice to have more of a focus.",
                "The course material had great variety. Some of the readings were not as interesting.",
                "I enjoyed the learning in our course, the writing assignments, and the feedback we received from the writing assignment. The only part of the course that I didn't think was necessary was perhaps the midterm report project; I didn't end up connecting this project to my final.",

                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in studying modern China. A lot of the courses on China at Yale are about politics, or about ancient history\/poetry. It's nice to take a class about Chinese culture that isn't about ancient history or about political turmoil. Some of the materials that we work with  especially the films  are excellent as well.",
