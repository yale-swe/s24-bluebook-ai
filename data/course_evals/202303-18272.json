                "This course was thoughtfully crafted for high levels of engagement that we all opted into - fabulous teaching, ample learning, every question answered!!! Hard region to cover in one semester and it was done beautifully",
                "Overall, this course was engaging and intriguing. Professor Harms gave us many opportunities to be creative and to share opinions with the class. The main strength of this course was definitely the opportunity to explore, whether that be in writing, while reading, or just in discussion. There were not many weaknesses but one thing that got tiring was reading several texts and just coming to class to discuss. I wish there were different plans/activities to connect the readings and make the interesting topics more engaging.",
                "the readings were helpful and displayed the diversity of themes and experiences in southeast asia. it was helpful to divide the readings so that a different student could facilitate or start the discussion each class. however, i think there were too many assignments in this course. there should have been fewer ripped from the headlines papers. the course design was excellent because there was clear continuity and the content built off the content from the previous week, although there were a few choppy areas because of a change in theme. the materials were a good mix of academic and creative, which was refreshing to experience. the course was most exciting when we discussed borders and kinship structures, and it was less exciting when we entered the phase on genocide across SEA. there is much darkness in the history of the sea, and sometimes it can feel overwhelming, as though the shadow of colonialism and genocide looms over everything modern in SEA to such a great extent that there is no more pure joy in the study of SEA, even though there is joy in day-to-day life. i would have appreciated a reflection at the end of the course where we evaluate the lightness and heaviness of the course in a more comprehensive way so that we would have a where we can go from here type of conclusion.",
                "STRENGTHS: great seminar style, a very caring professor who gives a lot of guidance and wants us to form interpersonal academic connections, interesting content ; WEAKNESSES: none that I can think of"

                "I could not recommend it more! Even if you've never interacted with the region - TAKE IT! You'll learn SO much and it will be applicable to anything and everything else you are interested in",
                "If you are interested in Southeast Asian studies or Anthropology in general, yes! Yes! Yes!!!! Professor Harms has so many experiences and a wealth of knowledge on Southeast Asia that you could probably sit down and chat with him for hours and still have more questions. The course itself is not difficult but there ARE a lot of readings to do and you are expected to think critically about each one and have comments ready for class. Professor Harms has connections that allow him to bring guest speakers to class and during these days, it is always so interesting to just sit, listen, and learn. There are so many ways to be creative in this course through writing or just through discussion as well.",
                "yes, i would recommend this class to any student. the course materials and research methods are important topics to grasp, and SEA is underrepresented at Yale. as students who are expected to be community/world leaders, it is imperative that we get an expansive education and learn from different cultures, histories and methods so that we can strengthen curiosity, empathy and kindness among the student population. this course enables students to achieve these virtues.",
