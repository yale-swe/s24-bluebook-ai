This course is a wonderful overview into a branch of sociology and different from any other course I've taken in sociology at Yale. I gained so much insight from Professor Smith and class discussions, and readings were designed to teach concepts through example."

Splitting the majority of grade distribution into two individual research projects was nice in spreading out the semester's workload. In-class exams were easy enough and did not provide a large stressor. One course drawback was the pacing increase at the end of the semester."

Visual Sociology was admittedly offputting at first (because it felt like an obligation) but ended up becoming one of my favorite courses. The readings had breadth to them, so even if you didn't like one reading one week you will inevitably come across a few that are right up your alley. You'll have ample time and support for the projects, and they're a great opportunity to explore your interests.",

                "Yes! If youre interested in visual media or sociology",
                "Yes! Professor Smith is wonderful and obviously very knowledgeable about the course material. Class discussions were engaging and informative - this was a class I never had a desire to skip. I would recommend this class to anyone inside or outside of the sociology major; course topics were varied and very interesting every week."
