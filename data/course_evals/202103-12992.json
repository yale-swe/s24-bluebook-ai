                "Basic technical vocabulary on film, greater understanding of Latin American cultural and political situation in the twentieth century, greater control of the academic register of Spanish,",
                "I have felt removed from my Latin American culture for a long time and through academia I've been able to get closer to my roots. This idea continued in Professor Tortora's class. The most important skill I developed by taking this course was improving my writing in spanish. I also continued to develop my critical thinking and analysis by watching films and having discussions with my peers and the directors of the films.",
                "Awareness of Latin American film and its history",
                "I greatly improved my Spanish speaking, writing, reading, listening, and interpretive skills. I learned how to write film critiques in Spanish. I was exposed to many interesting Spanish films that opened my eyes to diverse Spanish-speaking cultures.",
                "From a language perspective, I learned to be much more comfortable speaking, and I also improved my auditory comprehension. I also learned so much about film, something I didn't previously know I was interested. Finally, I got my first exposure to the field of Latin American studies, something I hope to pursue more.",
                "This course follows the history of cinematography through several Spanish-speaking countries, discussing how key films (watched as homework) impacted and were influenced by the history of the country, and how these films & filmmakers influenced cinematography abroad. Excellent interesting application of oral and written analytical Spanish skills."

                "Strengths--so much learning, amazing professor. Weakness- sometimes movie load was a lot for a week, but overall pretty manageable",
                "Strengths: movies were generally more interesting than I thought they would be, we covered almost all of Latin America, clear guidelines for assignments, the guest speakers + LIFFY were definitely highlights of the course. Weaknesses: Assigning 2 full films due in two days, could have had feedback on our assignments sooner than 1 month after we submitted them, sometimes the professor would go on political rants that would take up significant class time. More small group projects would be nice too.",
                "A major strength was the visits of filmmakers, actors, and other experts to the class. Their knowledge and insights were a highlight.\r\nOne weakness was the number of documentaries watched for historical background instead of as objects of film study.",
                "Strengths of the course are an amazing selection of films and the ability to talk to the directors and producers of many of these films. The biggest weakness this course had was the technology aspect, Professor Tortora would schedule assistance from the IT department to make sure projectors, external microphones and camera's were set up -- but the person that helped was rarely on time which would always derail in class.",
                "I loved the visits by various filmmakers and the student presentations \r\nModules was confusing and was unclear what our homework was",
                "strengths: very well organized and well taught by Profesora Tortora. Since she is friends with many of the people who make the films we watch, she is able to invite them to speak with us in vibrant discussions. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: none!",
                "The workload felt a bit unrealistic. We were at times expected to watch 6 hours of movies a week, a really daunting assignment. With that much work assigned I sometimes was too overwhelmed to even start and wouldn't get to watch the movies until the weekend, which stopped me from getting as much out of the class as I could have. I honestly don't think more than one movie should be assigned per week.",
                "This course teaches interesting and novel material for any student, particularly one with an interest in international history & culture, or in cinematography. Relevant, interesting, and intellectually challenging movies are chosen and the way these films fit into the history of each country and the international film community as a whole is discussed. It really is amazing how important (and unfamiliar) these stories are. Several luminaries (actors, directors, producers, writers) from the films watched were brought into class for discussion panels, making the class engaging and interesting. In class, discussions were chill and productive. No quizzes are offeredinstead the class focuses on engagement via class discussion and bi-weekly written reflections.\r\n\r\nMy main issue with this class is not with the quality of work but with the quantity. The truth is that there are simply too many films. This class meets two times a week, and in two nights (Mon-Wed) we would often be expected to watch 2-3 full-length movies, read 20-50 pages of context & analysis, and write a couple paragraphs of analysis. This was a lot of work, and made this class feel a lot more like a chore than a passion. What was upsetting was that the majority of these movies were never discussed or hardly mentioned in class, and weren't really connected to the narrative that was built about film's impact on each country's history. This made the mountain of work feel pedantic, rather than deep and engaging.\r\n\r\nI think an effective improvement to this otherwise excellent course would be to pare down on the number of movies assigned to 1 movie per class maximum. That way, each movie could actually be discussed and digested. Although all the movies were interesting, I think this reduction would actually improve the quality of class discussion and appreciation for Latin culture and history. With lower movie volume, I would have enjoyed this class, rather than feel like I was trying to take in information by fire hose, without any time to process.\r\n\r\nThe organization of this course was also often hard to follow, with online materials pretty disorganized and frequent changes to the syllabus via canvas message."

                "Yes, I would recommend this class to someone needing to complete their L5. The movie selection was surprisingly engaging and covered almost all of Latin America over the last 100 years, and I enjoyed speaking with guest filmmakers and actors in class. Sometimes the workload was a bit excessive especially when we had to watch multiple films for class the next day, but Margherita was pretty flexible with assignment deadlines and grades fairly. While my Spanish did improve I wish there were more opportunities to work in small groups or have roundtable discussions.",
                "It depends. If you are trying to find an easy spanish course to fulfill your L5 req look somewhere else. This class is A LOT of work, which is not worth it if you are not deeply interested in the politics of latin america. I am in STEM so I did not have that passion and as a consequence I found a lot of the course frustrating. The work can be mind dumbing and really annoying, we have to watch about 4-5 movies per week and write about EACH ONE OF THEM on a google doc, which takes A LONG TIME. The WORST PART of the class is that we did not get our grades for the first essay until a day or two before the second one was due, and we did not get the grades for our second essay before the final paper was due, so that was really scary, thankfully she is a nice grader and she is a very understanding professor, however not getting grades on time was really stressful. \r\n\r\nEven though I was not the usual person that takes this class, I enjoyed it and learned a lot from it. I would say just BE CAREFUL, this class is not a class that you can just forget about, it is quite a bit of work, but take it if you have enough space.",
                "Yes, if you're prepared to watch a lot of films.",
                "Yes I would. If you're a student looking to improve your advanced spanish while watching incredible movies and films then this is the course for you. Professor Tortora makes a space that is for learning. She's patient and very understanding.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in Latin America and in film.",
                "Yes but be aware that it requires extensive time outside of class",
                "Definitely! This was my first language course at Yale, and it did not disappoint! Learning Spanish through watching films made by Spanish-speaking people is an exciting and authentic way to get exposed to Spanish-speaking cultures.",
                "I would recommend it! My Spanish definitely improved as did my understanding of film and Latin American culture! But, as I said, you should be aware how much work it is before taking the class as it is very time consuming",
                "Although this course has the potential to be very interesting, I cannot recommend this course. The workload is overwhelming to the point where an appreciation for even the most interesting material is overshadowed. There simply isn't time to take it in or appreciate it all, and not enough attention is given to the material covered.\r\n\r\nThis course has potential, but has to be edited to cover fewer movies in greater depth. If you're looking for an L5, I'd look elsewhere."
