   "comments": [
    "The ability to think critically about art coming out of the 1960s, how all art is political, and the way that lived experiences during the 1960s and movements of that decades are still relevant to our lives today.",
    "I came into this course with very little experience in looking at or talking about works of art. By the end of the semester, I felt confident doing close analysis of art works and talking about art work in the seminar. I also left with a deeper knowledge of the 1960s - its dominant philosophies and the lasting legacy it holds.",
    "I learned the basics of art history in this class. Formal analysis, art history and politics were all touched on briefly. Really good for someone who had never taken an art history class before.",
    "I have a more cross-sectional understanding of all the different art and social movements in the 1960s and on. However, I have also learned to not feel incompetent when grappling with complicated readings, thereby having a healthier (and more fruitful) approach to them.",
    "Visual analysis skills, writing skills",
    "I learned a great deal about historical and artistic movements and the relationship between the two. I improved my visual analysis and art historical research skills."

   "comments": [
    "This course is the best course I have ever taken at Yale. Everything was very well-thought out, there were not too many readings, but there were also not too few, so it was still challenging but in a way that is in touch with what students can realistically read each week which I definitely appreciated. A strength specific to this course is definitely the way Professor Lee facilitates the conversation, she was able to engage students in a way that no other professor that I have had has been able to do. You could tell she genuinely wanted to know what students had to say, not just to make everyone in the room talk just to talk.",
    "Professor Lee opened class each week with a mini lecture on that weeks topic (minimalism, feminist performance art, postcolonial senegalese art). Professor Lee made each class feel conversational while at the same time taking the material seriously. Sometimes conversation would circle repetitively on one artwork or topic and not engage as much with readings. It might have been helpful to have shorter more regular reading responses to keep conversation engaged with the readings. That being said, each classmate seemed to come to the class with a different particular interest that they brought to conversations. The class had a specific structure, however, that sometimes hampered conversation. Each week a student would present on that week's topic for 20-30 minutes, and while this was a great exercise, it did mean that class structure became repetitive and the energy of the class wained by the end of the semester. Having a more varied class structure might have helped class discussion fall less into a routine.  A highlight of the class was definitely the weekend trip to DC. It is rare to have a weekend field trip, and Professor Lee organized talks with curators at a range of museums.",
    "I really liked the political bent to this class here. I think it helped to contextualize something as seemingly politically irrelevant as art into events of great relevance. I would, however have appreciated a greater link between art and actual political change (Emory Douglas was a good week) and a little more discussion regarding the limited reach of art. A lot of the course touched on why certain art movements were indeed political and not whether their politics mattered.",
    "I wish I got more one-on-one face time with the professor - she is such an incredibly fascinating and accomplished person!",
    "I loved how well prof lee combined politics, art, and culture in a way some art history classes really leave out",
    "This course provides a comprehensive look at artistic movements occurring around the 1960s. Class time was engaging and thoroughly covered the readings. The field trip to D.C. was an excellent way to spend more time with material that was highly relevant to the course. I would have liked to spend more class time discussing works of art that did not appear in the weekly readings."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I think this course was literally the best course I have taken at Yale! The readings are so relevant, and I love how Professor Lee goes about students leading discussion, but also provides her own context in the class period as well.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student or any course with Professor Lee. Professor Lee is an incredible professor who makes class conversations so interesting you don't realize the many skills you are learning. She also creates a class group that has a diverse range of interests and specialties.",
    "Yes! Pam Les is awesome. Really good seminar leader and eloquent speaker.",
    "I highly recommend this course to any student interested in history or art history. Professor Lee is able to provide context and understanding to the multi-faceted decade.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another friend, especially if they are not humanities majors since this class is very accessible the way it is taught.",
    "Yes",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student remotely interested in the 1960s or art history. It did excellent job being both accessible to non-art history majors, while similarly engaging those with related backgrounds. The fact that by the end of the course, the entire class could have high-level, conceptually-complex discussions about art was quite impressive.",
    "Yes. Prof Lee is an amazing and engaging Professor and the material is so relevant to art and culture today",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The class is cohesive and engaging, and Pam lee is an excellent professor."
