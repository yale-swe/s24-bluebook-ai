Though I rarely listened to KPop before taking the course, Professor Lee-Smith chose melodically appealing songs that told meaningful stories. We learned how to talk about love in class in addition to discussing the meaning behind the movie Parasite. This is a wonderful class.",

I never expected to learn about this in Korean, and it was very fun to learn as a class.",

I also really enjoyed the project-based format because it encourages creativity and taking risks with language.",

This class tends to have less structured homework (e.g. grammar practice/exercises), but I still felt that I improved in Korean by practicing speaking and listening in class and in TA sessions."
