Though I rarely listened to KPop before taking the course, Professor Lee-Smith chose melodically appealing songs that told meaningful stories. We learned how to talk about love in class in addition to discussing the meaning behind the movie Parasite. This is a wonderful class.",

We learned how to make our own lyrics for K-pop songs and interpret existing songs that we know, which was super cool as the songs can be very abstract! I never expected to learn about this in Korean, and it was very fun to learn as a class.",

Everyone was eager to learn and ask questions, which often prompted random vocabulary and grammar concepts to be learned, in addition to our planned material. I also really enjoyed the project-based format because it encourages creativity and taking risks with language.",

                "Yes, absolutely!! This class was so chill and enjoyable, and Angela Lee-Smith is an amazing professor. This class tends to have less structured homework (e.g. grammar practice\/exercises), but I still felt that I improved in Korean by practicing speaking and listening in class and in TA sessions."
