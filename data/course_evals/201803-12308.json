    "The course is well organized and very well paced. The homework is not too overwhelming, but it does push students to review the material that they have learned and occasionally presents a very difficult challenge. It is a good course in my opinion, although I hear from many of my peers that they are struggling because it is very difficult.",
    "I feel as though the head of the course should give more midterm\/final review sessions because his were the best Ive ever been to.",
    "Kolya was an excellent TA who sought to make key mathematical concepts extremely clear to us.",
    "Strengths - there definitely are a lot of resources that are designed to help students make sure they can do well. For instance, there are multiple review sessions for exams, office hours, peer tutors and online practice resources.\r\n\r\nWeakness - Sometimes lectured might be fast paced (although I feel that the extra resources can effectively offset this)"
