This was my first dive into performance theory and I loved every reading that we did -- so much food for thought that was exponentially increased by the participation of everyone in the class. I learned the most about how scholarship and knowledge can transcend traditionally \"academic\" boundaries, say a research paper format, and take a different medium or form that could be more conducive to the overall goal of the project."

                "It was very interesting and I appreciated that you could get as much out of the course as you put in. It was easy to be part of discussions and stay engaged, but there was also grace if someone did not have the ability to complete all the assigned readings.",
                "A strong performance theory course for the major. It was a little difficult to get under at first, but I walked away with a great learning experience and a new method of research! Fun topic to engage with.",
                "I think making the research assignments visible before the week they are due would help students better plan their time.",
                "Strengths were the people and the discussions! It felt as though everyone had something to say, based on personal experience and the readings. I reached conclusions I would have never reached because of interesting insights brought up by everyone, especially Professor Stokes! Everyone's final projects were also fascinating, and I really appreciated the research process. Weakness was that it got a bit unstructured towards the end of the class, but that was just because I was a bit further along in my research and the more free time was more helpful for other people."

                "Yes! Studying publics is so cool and eye-opening. So much of the world opens up through this lens. Shilarna made sure to assign important texts from across various disciplines and genres. Shilarna is also just the best instructor and support system. Would def recommend to anyone!",
                "Yes, absolutely. The students all brought different perspectives and it was incredibly interesting to hear them talk about their backgrounds and interests.",
                "Yes! Great performance theory credit for the TDPS major.",
                "YES! Everyone, no matter your major, should take this class. I learned so much about how scholarship can be best articulated, how publics and narratives are constructed, and why defining an audience is so important. We discussed incredibly fun things (Beyonce vs Donald Trump, pageants, protests, music festivals, etc), but everything related to a larger commentary on society, scholarship, how we present information, and how we view ourselves that will be helpful to everyone. It's a low stress course that develops research skills, provides awesome perspectives, and felt like a breath of life to my semester."
