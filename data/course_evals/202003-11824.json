Amazing for getting insights on the foundations of philosophy, as well as being able to put schools of thought into discussion and debate."

The discussions were always interesting, and nearly everyone in the class was engaged, which helped create a great learning environment. While my classmates were all quite smart, they were also kind and unpretentious, so there was never any of the one-upmanship that arose in my other seminars.",

I had little interest in philosophy before taking the course, and I still do not think it is something that I want to major in, but I was able to get a lot out of the class. The skills I gained in regards to tackling difficult texts will be applicable for all humanities courses.",
