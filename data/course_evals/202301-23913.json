Each week featured a different queen and the topics studied were ordered chronologically, giving us a good sense of how things changed/stayed the same across different time periods and regions. The queens we studied also came from very diverse backgrounds, and I studied in depth about historical figures I hadn't heard from before in very Eurocentric curriculums. This course did a great job combatting that and taught us that queenship is a phenomenon that occurred and still occurs around the world, and both historical and modern conceptions of it are very much influenced by colonialism and race.",
