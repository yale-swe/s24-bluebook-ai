    "I gained a broad understanding of Buddhism's history and the internal theological tensions that arose from its transformations. I how the concepts of rebirth and salvation changed over time as they moved from nation to nation and culture to culture. I also learned a lot about religion in general, how it responds to external social and political pressures and how it serves itself as an institution.",
    "Learned a lot about Buddhist history, teachings, and tradition.",
    "I learned how to closely analyze texts ranging from ancient Buddhist scriptures to modern-day analyses of those scriptures.  With a new 700-word reading response due each week, I was prompted to engage with the reading before class so that I could better understand and participate in that week's class.  I learned a lot about Buddhist history and understanding and how those evolved from the origins of Buddhism to modern-day times.  We watched various films in class which also portrayed different interpretations of the religion.  I learned a lot of Buddhist terminology as well.",
    "I learned about beliefs that all Buddhists share (cycle of rebirth, eightfold path, etc.), as well as beliefs that are particular to specific sects of Buddhism. Generally, the first part of the course focused on basic beliefs shared by all Buddhists, and provided the foundation necessary for the second part of the course, which discussed particular sects of Buddhism. Ideas about Buddhist practice were interspersed throughout the course.",
    "A pretty solid overview of Buddhism, from its history to its philosophy."

    "The main strength of the course was Prof. Greene's lectures. He connected concepts across lectures and involved the class in his thought process. His lectures were always relevant to the reading, contextualizing it. It was often difficult, however, to see how the material connected to current debates and conversations about religion. Some lectures felt like Buddhism for Buddhism's sake, like they didn't fully interact with questions of power and gender. Prof. Greene could have made these connections clearer and more explicit.",
    "I wish this course had been a seminar. I think the strongest points of the class were when we had class discussions on hard questions about Buddhism. A lot of class time was spent going over hard facts about various types of Buddhism, and I just wish wed had more of an opportunity to think about and analyze those facts in class. There was a lot of emphasis on primary source analysis, but less of an emphasis on analyzing the ideas that we drew out of the sources. A huge strength of the class was the weekly short-essay  format. The weekly essays really took the pressure off of any one assignment while keeping me engaged with the readings throughout the course.",
    "I loved the course a lot. The lectures were great, the readings were engaging, and the work makes you think a lot about what you are reading.",
    "Professor Greene is absolutely a strength of this course.  He is exciting, engaging, and incredibly knowledgeable.  He welcomes all questions and answers them clearly and succinctly.  I came into class each day feeling prepared for what we was to be taught, and he came into class each day with a clear layout of what he was teaching.  Feedback on weekly essays from the TF was good and prompt.  I felt like there was a lot of communication between the TF and professor, which is always helpful.  The incorporation of films, a visit to the East Asian Exhibit at the Yale Art Gallery, and readings all paved a way to a good understanding of course material.  I also really enjoyed how the weekly essays forced you to truly engage with the material before it was taught.  This also led to a solid understanding of the course material.",
    "The primary source texts were interesting and Professor Greene was great. I loved the format of the class, with valuing consistent reading responses over bigger, more stressful assignments. The secondary source readings were not very helpful and usually were very long.",
    "A strength of this course is its organization. Usually, each class focused on a slightly different topic, such as the 6 realms of the world, or ideas on the belief of death, etc. Additionally, while Dr. Green usually had an outline prepared for each class period, there was always flexibility, and we went in further depth in topics that we wanted to discuss further. Dr. Green did a fantastic job of providing structure while encouraging discussion and questions. I would consider the discussion section a weakness of this course. While the intention was to go further in depth about the texts that we read, I found that we often covered the readings well in lecture, and the section seemed to drag when students ran out of things to say. I would have preferred to have two 75 minute lectures a week, with perhaps 10 minutes of each lecture devoted to a \"section-like\" discussion among peers.",
    "It's a really chill but interesting class. Professor Greene is a great professor and his knowledge is incredible. We didn't get to go into great discussions during section, which is the only underwhelming part of the class. The class, even though it's listed as a lecture, was run more as a seminar our year which had its ups and downs. I'd prefer it was more lecture based because Professor Greene is a fantastic lecturer and many classes were just back-and-forths between students."

   "comments": [
    "Don't take this class unless you are absolutely fascinated with Buddhism and reading primary Buddhist texts-- poorly organized class with weekly busy work rather than meaningful discussions.",
    "If you're interested in Buddhism, definitely take this course. It's important to go into it with the mindset that it's not just about Buddhism, however. It's much more rewarding if you speak up in lectures and ask broader questions about the nature of religion and religious studies.",
    "Id recommend this class if youre looking for a thorough overview of Buddhism based largely on primary source analysis. Professor Greene was great at making complex topics more accessible, and I left the class with a good grasp of the material. The workload and structure of the course were also well-calibrated.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone, whether you are interested in religious studies or not.",
    "This course is certainly not only intended for Religious Studies majors.  I am not a Religious Studies major, and I learned so much about the Buddhist religion, including history, basic terminology, interpretations of it (even modern-day!), and what it teaches.  Buddhism is a very wise religion, so the primary texts are always incredibly fascinating to read.  The homework each night is quite manageable, as it involves up to 30 pages of reading and then one 700-word reading response each week.  These reading responses are intended to help you engage with the material and come to your own conclusions about it before class so that class time and section time can be used to review the material learned and clarify any doubts.  This really helped me to better understand the material.  Professor Greene is absolutely wonderful--very engaging, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic about teaching and about Buddhism.  He also incorporates a visit to the YUAG's East Asian Exhibit and multiple films to show other parts of the Buddhist tradition.  This course is very well organized and taught.",
    "The class is really fun and you learn a great deal about a religion that is often not well understood in the popular imagination.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was fascinating to learn about different aspects of Buddhism, and there were many times in the semester that I found that my previous views on Buddhism had been wrong or oversimplified. The course provided an in-depth dive into Buddhism, and used pieces of art, humorous texts, and visits to the art gallery to keep students engaged. The reading for each week was definitely reasonable (~30 pages of primary text + ~40 pages of a book per week), and each week we had to write a max 700 word essay on the reading (we were allowed to skip one). This structure provided a steady workload all semester, rather than being loaded on weeks with a midterm. Additionally, for the final exam, we were given 6 essay questions ahead of time, of which two comprised the final examthis greatly reduced the stress of studying for the exam.",
    "It's a great course, especially if you want a basic intro to Buddhism. The readings are great, the lectures are great, the professor is great."
