    "I cannot even begin to explain how much I have learned in this course. My skills as a composer have developed unbelievably over the course of the semester, and I have learned so much about how to specifically write for the musical theater idiom. I came into the class with a fair amount of experience in composition, but I left feeling more confident in my music-writing abilities than I ever thought was possible (although I know there is still lots of room for improvement). I learned how to work on a deadline -- writing a song every week is no small task, especially when you are a perfectionist like I am... But now I have no problem writing songs on a time crunch and finding the inspiration to write music out of thin air.",
    "I was able to refine my skills as a composer and become more familiar with my individual \"voice\" as a musician. Thanks to detailed feedback provided in the course, I was able to pinpoint my weakness and strengths and use that information to drastically improve my songwriting.",
    "Where do I begin? I have grown more in this class than in perhaps any other class I have ever taken. Professor Rosenblum somehow manages to give kind and mind-blowingly specific feedback, always find something nice to say about a song, and still locate areas of growth and give you the tools to work on those areas. I had really never written a piano accompaniment part to anything before, and by the end, it just becomes something you can (because you have to) crank out on a weekly basis. Amazing.",
    "This course taught me so much about composing, musical theater, and composing for musical theater. As someone with minimal exposure to all of those before this semester, there were some moments that felt like trial by fire but I walk away feeling as if I have acquired vast knowledge and skill. \r\n\r\nYour composing acumen will grow significantly every week. With creative song assignments that push you to explore different aspects of a composition, we explored sound and lyrics as comprehensively as possible in one semester. You'll know the ins and outs of structure, style, theme, etc. \r\n\r\nThe exposure to the world of musical theater was wonderful. I made a playlist of all the songs that were used as examples in class that I regularly listen to on Spotify.",
    "I got an incredible foundation in Musical Theater composition, as well as detailed comments that allowed me to refine and strengthen my compositional voice while working within the idiom.",
    "A better listening ear in terms of being able to dissect a piece of music. Confidence in my ability as a composer.",
    "I learned how to write for the musical theater idiom, and craft different narratives through music and lyrics."

   "comments": [
    "The way the class is structured allows a for a good routine, letting you see what you as a composer need to do to get a song done every week. Josh gives such great feedback and encourages a high level of support throughout the students in the class.",
    "This class is absolutely incredible. Don't change a single thing. The best part about the class was the level of camaraderie between the students and the professor. The class environment was quite laid-back and optimal for sharing work, especially when you weren't feeling too confident about your music. Everyone in the class was unbelievably supportive, and although the professor always had abundant feedback, it never felt like he was attacking us by critiquing us. It was a very constructive environment. Also, the one-song-a-week format was really helpful in forming a weekly routine in terms of homework.",
    "This course created a cooperative and supportive environment perfect for songwriting. Coming to class to share a song that you are proud of is always a great experience. There was one assignment that I think is unnecessary, and it the one following the assignment to turn a scene from a movie\/book\/etc into a musical number where we had to pick yet another scene from the same movie\/book\/etc. By that point, I was done with the movie I picked and wanted to work on something new or a song from my own original story.",
    "Its just an amazing course. No notes!",
    "Strengths - Weekly song assignments pushed me to always keep up with the work and explore new ideas. I deeply appreciated the incredible freedom to write whatever we wanted to (within some broad but helpful guidelines).",
    "This is a wonderful class! Its seminar setting allows the class to be a close-knit community, and Joshs seemingly infinite experience and wisdom about Musical Theater makes each meeting super conducive to great learning.",
    "My only complaint was that meeting once a week left me wanting much more.",
    "The strengths of this course are the professor and his individualized feedback on songs."

    "Absolutely. It was my favorite class of the semester. I had never previously composed and this class immediately took all my initial fears of it away.",
    "If you are at all interested in writing music for musical theater, this is the class to take! You will learn so much, and you will certainly have a lot of fun. This class really gave the entire class something to look forward to every week. My only warning is that you really must be prepared to put in the work to compose a new song every single week. Some weeks, you just don't feel inspired, but you still have to write the song. I am a perfectionist, and I tend to spend hours on things until they are exactly as I want them, so I often spent four to five hours a day on this class. That being said, that is a lot more than most students spent (I think?), so maybe I'm just a really slow composer. However, you must be prepared to be in the mental mindset to be really dedicated before you set out to take this class. But don't let this scare you away -- I can't imagine a better class at Yale existing. You will learn more than you thought you could know about musical theater composition, and you will thoroughly enjoy the class.",
    "Absolutely. You get what you put into this class. It could be your lowest workload or your highest by far depending on how involved you want to be. Most songwriters will fall in love with this class and want to pour tons of effort into the assignments. However, hardly any of the many hours spent on the class feel like work, besides the notation process which can be tedious.",
    "Yes! I think its an amazing experience for anyone. It will change the way you listen and appreciate all music and will teach you ways to be creative on command. I think its pretty transformative to realize that you often cant wait for the muse to come down and give you an idea. Its a skill (one Im still working on) to just turn it on and carve out a creative product from nothing on command.",
    "I can't recommend this course enough! A strong musical foundation is required but from one non-Music major to anyone else out there, if you're interested in musical theater, this is a must-take. You will learn so much and have so much fun. Josh is a wonderful professor who creates an incredible class environment. Our Friday class was regularly the highlight of my week.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Josh is a professor who really helps you play to your strengths and creates a really supportive work environment.",
    "Absolutely, without hesitation.",
    "Absolutely. I received invaluable individualized feedback on my works to improve as a composer, but also being in a workshop seminar setting helped to learn from other students' works, styles, and feedback."
