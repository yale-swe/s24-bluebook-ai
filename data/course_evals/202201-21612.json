This semester, I really saw a drastic improvement in my ability to speak and write in Korean, and this was mostly due to the excellent organization and structure of the lessons. I also learned more about Korean culture through korean food, travel, and music.",

Another strength was the choice of vocab. I felt that we learned vocab that we can use easily in daily life. There aren't any weaknesses I can think about nor are there things I can pinpoint as to how the class can be improved.",
                "-Heavy reliance on the textbook is good in the sense that the class is reliable/predictable, but I think the inclusion of more outside material would have a more comprehensive review of the class (eg the TA has stated before the phrases in the textbook sound outdated/less commonly used)\r\nOverall there is a strong emphasis on participation (speaking) in class which is fantastic for building language acquisition\r\nHowever as stated the reliance on textbook lead to a bit of dullness.",
                "Strengths: It's very structured and I like that I have an idea of what I will need to get done each week before the week has started. There is also always encouragement and equality among the students in class which I like because it makes me feel comfortable and relieves my worry of making mistakes \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I honestly can't think of any. This was my favorite class this semester.",
                "Strength: very hands on and easy to engage",

I also made great friends in the class, and this was partly because Professor Back was a very engaging professor and everyone was very excited to learn from her.",
                "I would absolutely recommend the class if a person is interested in Korean culture or the languageProf. Back makes learning fun. However the language itself is not the easiest, so unless there is at least a slight interest, I would not recommend learning it just to complete the distributional requirements.",
                "Absolutely. If you're interested in learning Korean, the department here is amazing.   is one of the best professors I've ever had and I've improved so much this semester. Definitely would recommend taking Korean, I feel so supported and I've loved it so far.",
                "Yes, very fun and engaging, excited to go everyday",
                "I would highly recommend this course. I learned a lot in this class. Meeting for class everyday gave our class a sense of community, and I've met great people through it with whom I can converse with in Korean now!",
