                "Yale's offerings for Korean history have been abysmal for the past four years in that the University has had no consistent classes available for the subject. HIST 302J fills that glaring gap in knowledge and does so well. Professor Shepherd's course introduces the ongoing debates surrounding the historiography of Korea-Japan relations and challenges students to form their own interpretations of the past. Though the Professor includes some background readings, HIST 302J is not a survey class. Dr. Shepherd assumes that seminar participants already have a solid understanding of East Asian events from the latter half of the nineteenth century onwards.",

                "The class caters to the interests of students who already have some understanding of Korea-Japan relations and the recent history of East Asia. Thus, it is a course that is both rigorous and intellectually stimulating. HIST 302J is not an untenable experience for those who don't have the kind of rich background knowledge the structure of the class incentivizes. But those with a cursory understanding of relevant events will want to brush up on their history prior to the start of class.",
                "i think this course started by assuming some level of knowledge of korean and japanese history, which isn't necessarily super plausible given there aren't any introductory korean history courses at yale. however, prof shepherd was great with responding to this feedback and later incorporated more background readings/in-class lecture material giving a basic historical overview. i think prof shepherd also did a good job of interrogating the historiography of these events and including more recent, female, and local voices in addition to more established western scholarship.",
                "Excellent range of topics from political trends to conomics to culture to gender/sexuality. Really cool and helpful use and balance of primary sources. Insights into what is left to learn beyond what was taught in class.",
                "Much of content learned in course is done through the reading material, and class was a time to analyze those readings. I think the course could benefit from having a lecture-style component to it as well. Also, it would be great if the final research paper was more spread out over the semester and due in increments, as I found myself and other struggling towards the end to finish the paper during finals week.",
                "The strength is definitely the very interesting readings and the great professor. The discussions were always enjoyable and stimulating. I wouldnt say there are any weaknesses except sometimes I wasnt able to finish all the readings.",
                "The course was incredibly taught, the readings were all great, and the professor was easily available.",
                "The readings are very informative and thought-provoking, and the seminar discussions are well-led. Professor Shepherd is also very helpful providing background information and supplementing discussions with primary sources and media. The class is titled critical contexts, but sometimes I feel a weeks readings might not have a theme but just be about an important chronological event. Nonetheless, I love how this class brings in different narratives that might challenge more common and simplistic assumptions like those that serve nationalist ends",
                "I thought that the weekly focus on one significant historical event grounded by background readings about a wider range of topics during that time period was a very effective way to cover a broad timescale and range of topics. I really appreciated the diversity of the readings and the exposure to many of the English-language historians of Korean and Japanese history. The amount of reading especially towards the beginning of the course was intense, and additionally towards the beginning of the course it was harder to connect the broad scope of the readings with the specific topic of focus for the week. In order to help prepare more specifically for in-class discussions, it could be helpful to highlight a specific theme, event, or figures in the text to pay close attention to during the readings, although at the same time I appreciated the discussion post format of preparing for the discussions and discussing the topics that stood out to the class when doing the readings. I thought the midterm and final paper in-class workshops were both helpful in giving structure to the final research paper. I think the in-class leading of discussion on a reading and the reading response papers could potentially be more integrated with the rest of the class, maybe by giving more emphasis to the reading responses as a place to explore ideas and themes that are interesting and could be part of the final research assignment, or by having the people leading reading discussions in the same week collaborate on a set of common themes or ideas to focus on for discussion that week."

                "yes! the material was interesting, and prof shepherd is great",
                "Yes, strongly. Aside from being the only class on Korean history at Yale, it's a fantastic history class generally. Topics are discussed deeply despite their breadth, which is a rare combination.",
                "Yes. The workload is manageable, and you will learn about a fascinating subject.",

                "Yes, 100%.",
                "Its probably the only course at Yale that touches on Korean history, and it also provides a fascinating look at a non-European modern empire. It also brings in multiple perspective, useful for developing critical historical thinking abilities",
                "Yes, definitely. This course is obviously worth taking for anyone interested in Korean or Japanese history, and will give you solid grounding in the colonial period of Korean/Japanese history as well as freedom to explore topics of your interest within this period. It would also be a great course for anyone interested in exploring broader historical topics related to colonialism, including modernity and development, nationalism, collaboration and resistance, and personal histories. You do not need to know Korean or Japanese to take the course, or be knowledgeable about Korean or Japanese history - although these skills can definitely be helpful, they are not required to be successful."
