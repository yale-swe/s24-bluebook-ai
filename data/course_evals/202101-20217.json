                "Strengths: Professor Richards is phenomenal, course curriculum and books were pretty cool too! Most of your interaction will be with your TF, who, for me, was also a strength because we always had fun discussions in section.\r\nWeaknesses: This course is awesome, but I would've liked to see more non-white authors maybe.",
                "Strengths - engaging lecturer who cares about their students\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - class was super useless if you had not read the books since that is basically all we talked about. We were also expected to read approximately 1 book per week, so it was really easy to fall behind.",
                "Strengths: The discussion section was helpful in discussing the texts, especially because the writing wasn't always the easiest thing to read. Professor Richards tried to keep lectures engaging with movie\/video clips, which was really nice. My TA was really flexible with deadlines, and that was so nice with everything that's been going on. This also may have been just my TA, but feedback on returned papers is always a plus.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course wasn't really supportive of people who had never taken a college writing course before. More guidelines for those who had never analyzed a literary piece would have been appreciated. Recorded lectures would have been nice, but they won't be recorded for in-person so that's not necessarily a weakness. Also, just a side note, the books that are read in this class are generally not uplifting.",
                "Strengths- very engaging lectures, powerpoints very effectively communicated important ideas\/info",
                "Strengths: Engaging and interesting content and readings\r\nCons: Readings were too long\/fast-paced. Not enough time each week in section and in lecture to fully discuss the readings. Lectures often was on the background context or a specific close-text reading but rarely surrounded overall thematic ideas.",
                "Prof. Richards is a great lecturer and the course was really engaging. Only weakness is I wish it was in person!",
                "Strengths: Professor Richards is an awesome lecturer and has a really great, uplifting personality!\r\nWeaknesses: Very heavy reading list, dont expect to read all of the novels especially if you are in any other reading-intense classes. Some of the books were dense or somewhat boring, also I felt too many were written by\/about upper-class white people. The reading list could have used a little more variety in terms of represented voices",
                "The reading list is something the professor is actively working on, but it is currently very aristocratic and white. You will be drained after reading about wealthy white Queer culture in Paris for the 6th book in a row. That being said, it does have some excellent reads and the professor and their lecturing is really great.",
                "Strengths: We got to read seminal works in queer history, and Professor Richards' analysis is absolutely amazing to listen to. She was able to bring the works to life with her analysis, and I loved reading the books through that lens. Lectures were really fun and engaging. Weaknesses: I wish that we had learned more about actual queer history. I felt like a lot of the lectures were about close-reading certain passages, but I was missing some much-needed context. I also wish that we had read more books by authors of color. We barely touched on the Harlem Drag Balls and yet we spent so much time reading white authors who were blatantly racist (*cough cough* Virginia Woolf). I just wish that we had acknowledged more of the contributions of qtPOC because the course felt a bit alienating. I came in wanting to situate my own queerness within a historical context and instead found myself consistently alienated by the works we read.",
                "Strengths: Professor Richards is so amazing!!  Her lectures are super engaging, relevant, and informative, and the way she closely read and engaged with the text during lectures really helped me understand how to close read novels and poetry in a way that was accessible and clear. The music they played every day before lecture also helped create a nice sense of community over the Zoom format. The accessibility of the teaching fellows  and the instructor was also key, and definitely made my experience in this class awesome. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think some of the more challenging texts (e.g. Nightwood, Orlando) should have been introduced earlier on in the semester, and should also have been given more time to be  explored  and discussed in section and class. It also would have been nice to have read some more upbeat books that showed up happier\/more positive queer futures.",
                "Strengths: GREAT readings, fascinating lectures, and a sense of community among students despite the remote format. I also think the first close reading assignment was a great way to prepare us for the later papers. \r\nWeaknesses: We move a little too quickly through each reading, especially for dense texts like \"Nightwood\". I also think the final paper guidelines were a little restrictive. Each prompt required a a comparison of two texts from the second half of the syllabus (although different combinations were ultimately permitted). It made comparisons feel forced, where I would have preferred to write a paper that was more topic-driven and simply examined that topic through the lens of multiple texts.",
                "I would have enjoyed a more engaging discussion section, but the lectures themselves were fantastic. The reading became overwhelming towards the end of the course with a new book due every week. The inclusion of queer history alongside the novels was my favorite part of the class.",
                "I think the strongest aspect of the course is its  syllabus. Every book on the syllabus brings something new to the discussion of modernism. However, the lectures sometimes felt inconsequential. I didnt feel like I needed to go to the lectures in order to do well on assignments and in discussion.",
                "Great syllabus (although a few I was not able to completely get through), lectures were very engaging",
                "Great course, readings are all picked pretty well. Definitely will be great to take in person, Professor Richards is lovely.",
                "The lectures were interesting but I felt that at times they could be hard to follow just because there was so much information to take in. I did appreciate Professor Richards' close readings and text analyses, though. Some of the books were also hard to engage with--either they ere very dense in vocabulary\/literary techniques, or just weren't the most interesting.",
                "this course was very informative and went along at a good pace. the professor was engaging and very knowledgeable.",
                "(My above rating is mostly a result of stretching myself too thin this semester, rather than any facet of the class.)\r\n\r\nStrengths: I loved the specificity of the paper prompts and the passages we looked at during section and lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I know that limiting book selection to pre-Stonewall makes this difficult, but I would have loved to talk more about how queer people were able to find happiness on or off the page and what that means for our discussions of queer futurity."

The structure of the assignments (shorter, mid-length, then longer paper) provided a gentle introduction to how to close reading, and then expanded upon those skills as the semester went on. Professor Richards provided examples in class of how they might close read certain passages, which was helpful for understanding what was expected in our papers.",
                "I feel like this course was just a little bit misleading. I was expecting more of a history class where we learn about queer history through reading books but this got really English-y. Like a lot of close readings, examining art, etc. instead of learning about queer people and broadly how they lived. This just isn't what I expected - if you want to read old books that are queer\/queercoded and analyze them, this is the class for you! If you are looking for more of a history class, however, then you should not take this.",

                "yes- I took this course, unaware at first that it was an English course, and LOVED it!  The selected works that are read are very insightful pieces of queer literature, and the course is very entertaining.",
                "Yes! Wide and great selection of queer modernist literature and taught with engaging lectures. However, do note that it is fast paced: often will be moving to a new or two new books every week which in turn leaves not a lot of time to get in depth with the material. Thus, some of the discussions often are surface level.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I think that this is a great course in the English department that gives a good introduction into important queer literature while still being accessible to those that are not English majors. It is well organized and while there is a lot of reading, the reading list is interesting and varied. It was very enjoyable to go to lectures and be exposed to numerous ideas and perspectives about the books.",

The different literary works that Professor Richards picked for this class provided a really varied, rich understanding  of queer literature, and the way so many different themes\/concepts (e.g. colonial same-sex desire, the queer underworld, upper-class queer desire) have come out play over the course of history.",
