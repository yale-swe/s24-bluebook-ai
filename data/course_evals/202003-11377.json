Our reading of Burke (which served as a key figure in our understanding of conservatism) taught me how to better appreciate vertical theories of society\/government, linking our aesthetic tastes with our political sensibilities. Professor North gave a series of absolutely incredible lectures of Woolf's \"Mrs. Dalloway\", performing the art of close reading to its highest degree. Though this class is listed in the English department, I learned a solid amount of political science from a particularly leftist perspective, which I appreciated. Professor North also demonstrated for us analysis in the style of Raymond Williams's \"Keywords\", a skill that I imagine I'll turn to often in future research and writing. Towards the end of the course, we had the opportunity to explore more \"distant\" political systems distant in the sense of different from Western models. Namely, we thought a lot about and discussed the system of stateless democracy (if you could call it that) of Australian Aboriginals super interesting!",

                "This course is a great course to take to think critically about political literature and the intersection between politics and aesthetics. It did not have that high of a workload, so it was a fun and manageable fifth class.",
                "Strengths: virtual lectures were helpful to watch on our own time so we could come to Q\/A with pre-thought out questions. Organization of centrism definitions in the beginning, then history of its evolution, and finally its context within modern political issues and where to go from here was very useful. \r\nWeaknesses: lectures, Q\/A, and section did make the course time per week substantial, though not too much time was spent outside on work, since there are only 2 essays and a few weekly response assignments, on top of reading texts.",
                "Professor North is super knowledgeable about the course material, and the TFs were great as well. While I love learning about political literature, I do wish we had focused on Social Justice through the lens of the more technical aspects of writing. Overall, a really fun class.",
                "The course was an interesting way to look at the modern political and aesthetic conversation through the lens of a left-wing \/socialist critic. I think looking at some of the other ways of thinking about the modern world might have helped us understand the complexities of it rather than just one argument about it.",
                "This course did a really good job of making us think more critically about different writers\/thinkers. But, I think we could've delved more into the \"social justice\" and historical aspects of the course.",
                "Weaknesses: none.\r\nStrengths: more than I could describe, but I'll try. First, Professor North is simply amazing; undoubtedly one of the best educators I've ever had. All of the teaching fellows were also lovely! We had the especially unique and beneficial opportunity of having a TF dedicated as a writing tutor specifically for this course. The course was also well and creatively adapted to remote learning, so kudos to the teaching team for that! The readings for this class were great and interesting! Great feedback on essays as well.",
                "Strengths: Professor North is brilliant, kind, and funny, and the teaching fellows are great! The syllabus is also very interesting and, while it includes big name authors, also includes some more obscure ones that I most likely would not have read if I hadn't taken this course. I also like how the class mixed readings in theory and fiction, most of which were very interesting and genuinely good reads. I really enjoyed the way the course focused on the idea of centrism, and how it tied together the class and its arc.\r\nWeaknesses: I don't think the virtual format was good for this course. The podcast + Q&A combo meant 3 hours of listening to Professor North speak every week, which was a bizarre and unnecessary way to conduct a literature class that was so ripe for discussion. Additionally, feedback was only given on the midterm and final papers, which made gauging expectations and grading very difficult, and also provided few chances to get to display improvement or to actually act on the feedback that was given. Lastly, I felt like the amount I learned over the semester decreased substantially after the first couple of weeks, and I would have liked to see more of a connection to the \"social justice\" part of the class, which was surprisingly not very prevalent.",
                "Strengths--reading list is amazing. It was really interesting to analyze the intersection of politics and literature. Feedback on essays is constructive and abundant, which was great.\r\nWeaknesses: I think the course would benefit from reducing the number of lectures at the beginning on contemporary political movements and moving more quickly to the literature--the way the course stands, the reading gets really heavy in the latter half of the course, and could be more evenly distributed if we started on the literature a bit sooner. I also would have liked to read literature from the 19th century, which we skipped over. I also would have liked to read some more political philosophy at the beginning other than Wallerstein's work (which is of course interesting, but I think having perspectives from other theorists would have been helpful too). The Q&A sessions also often dragged on; the sessions where there was more discussion were more interesting, so perhaps incorporating more discussion would make the sessions more engaging",
                "The strengths were the Professor and the Teaching Fellows.  They were potent and powerful in their delivery and engagement. Additionally, the diverse works of literature that we covered in the scope of the course was significant.  In fact, it was amazing. The only weakness was the remote nature of the course."

That, combined with the fact that lectures were taken down after 24 hours, made it difficult to have material to look back on.",

Professor North is equally fantastic: not only is he an incredibly knowledgeable scholar, but also a deeply caring, sympathetic, and generous person. Throughout the semester, he made it a priority to connect with us students and to hear our thoughts on the material. Joe mentioned that the material of this class is an active area of research for him, so it was especially exciting to be able to be part of that. The TFs were likewise great and a joy to discuss with and learn from. For all those reasons, I recommend this class to any student without any reservations. Please, take this class!",
                "I would recommend taking this class in person, but I would not recommend taking it virtually. Professor North was great and clearly wanted to connect with us and discuss, but I think the virtual setting just made that really difficult and caused him to speak more \"at\" us than I assume he normally would.",
