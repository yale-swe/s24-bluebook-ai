                "I think this course was a really great way to learn both wood and metal working. I think the professors were skilled and adept at helping students with their projects. I think it could be improved by setting up some lessons about types of wood/how to achieve certain looks for those who are not as familiar with the tools. I think the discussions could've been structured differently (not as many readings, etc.)",
                "I thought the the course gave extremely insightful and fun prompts for each of the projects. I appreciated how open ended each assignment was and how the students essentially have full liberty to take advantage of the materials and pull skills they've gathered from different area. I also loved the overall environment the class created within discussions or work hours and also the fun interactions with the grad students through outside class workshops and iron pours. The one weakness I would mention is sometimes the course felt a little unstructured with changing due dates or how discussion readings were organized (I think for the future using canvas for files and announcements might be a bit more clear)",
                "Strengths are the time we spend in the shop during class. We got instant feedback and supervision which was critical to getting projects across the finish line. Weaknesses are the lack of attendance and effort from other students. Furthermore the classes seminar discussion component was not taken very seriously and in turn we did not get much out of them. Albeit the readings and references were very well curated."

                "YES absolutely it was definitely my favorite class I've ever taken at yale and you get to leave with this innovative mindset and a complete new set of technical skills which essentially opens you up to an entire new field of possibilities. Every class was so enjoyable alongside the iron pours and etc and I even looked forward to dedicating a lot of hours to come into the studio outside class to work on the projects. The course became well known among people that weren't even close to the art major because of how many cool projects got to do",
