    "More clear feedback",
    "This course is a lot of work, but the teachers are extremely well versed in preparing you for every assignment.",
    "I think a weakness of the course is the textbook material and quiz system. I think testing on material that is not discussed in class is an odd system, and that perhaps they could cut down on the number of chapters covered and frequency of quizzes.",
    "Strengths: \r\nOur papers were broken up by section so we could really focus on writing one section at a time; the detailed worksheets on Canvas that told us exactly what should go in each section of our paper.",
    "I thought the class was very well organized. None of the assignments felt like busy work and I think I learned a lot from the textbook. The only thing that I thought could be improved were the few lectures we had. None of them were particularly helpful and I felt like the information could have been presented in a different way. However, these were pretty rare and we spent most of the class in lab meetings which I thought were a great way to improve our individual projects and gain experimental experience."

    "Yes, take this if you want to learn a lot and work efficiently.",
    "This course greatly improved my writing across all subjects, so yes! It is a challenge though.",
    "This is a required course for those in the psychology major. If not a psychology major, I would only recommend taking it if you want to learn how to write a proper research paper.",
    "Yes! This class is required for psych majors, and I would recommend it over the more specific research methods class because I think it provided a more thorough overview of research methods from the ground up. \r\n\r\nIt is a little specific so if you were not a psych major it might not be the best fit, but if you did want to get experience designing studies, I don't think it would be too difficult for non-majors to switch gears and still get a lot out of the class."
