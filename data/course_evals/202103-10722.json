                "I learned about the IAD and SES frameworks, polycentricity, Elinor Ostrom's and others' brilliance, and a lot about the Maine lobster fishery. \r\n\r\nI became a better writer. There's a lot of writing in this class, from short weekly memos to two medium-length papers. I also became a better thinker in the context of environmental policymaking. I underestimated the power of the \"what is really going on here?\" question. \r\n\r\nThis class transformed the way that I view economics (speaking as an economics major who took this class for related course credit). The essence of the IAD -- zooming in on actors, understanding community characteristics, analyzing rules in use, and summarizing outcomes -- seems like a pretty obvious thing to do when developing policy, but it seems like economics at the intro and intermediate level simply stresses \"utility maximization\" or \"cost minimization\" without 1) understanding how such objectives can be achieved through institutions; and 2) justifying why the \"max\" and \"min\" approach is the best policymaking strategy. It's clear from this class that people themselves (rather than markets and governments) can solve their own problems. Broadly, there's a whole lot of incredibly valuable things that I learned in this class -- beyond the ideas that I've tried to articulate here.",
                "Lots of knowledge about sustainability in theory and practice! The class had both depth and breadth and I really liked that.",
                "The course is primarily about the IAD (Institutional Analysis and Development) framework. Super cool stuff.",
                "The concept of polycentricity, co-management, collective governance, and generally the teachings of Elinor Ostrom",
                "I learned about qualitative research methods and how collective action problems can be solved. I left the class with a lesser sense of impending doom about the environment, politics, and climate crisis; people can work together to solve problems!",
                "I learned how to use the IAD framework for policy and institutional analysis. I deepened my understanding of environmental injustice. I increased my ability to analyze and question the black boxes of society. I improved my research and discussion skills a lot. I learned from my classmates. This was a wonderful class. Im so grateful I took it.",
                "deeper understanding of american democracy, justifications for protests, the necessity of polycentricity, the complicated nature of common pool resources",
                "I would say that I learned a little about a lot of cool stuff. We learned the IAD Framework (a quantitative research method), but the real value of the class came from talking about different approaches to solving different, interesting collective action issues.",
                "I learned how to apply a lot of theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios in order to better articulate and understand the pitfalls and potential of democracy and institutions as they relate to managing environmental resources and other societal issues.",

                "In Democracy and Sustainability, I developed knowledge and understanding of Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development framework and how to apply this to institutions and social-economic systems. I developed organisational skills due to the large but very interesting amount of readings required. I developed discussion presentation skills and the ability to write short and succinct reading responses."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: This class really makes you learn -- through readings, memos, and papers. I felt so proud of the essays that I wrote for this class and it was encouraging to be in a class with other students who were also excited and passionate about their research. Professor Fotos also makes sure that the class bonds -- I felt super close to my classmates (and to Professor Fotos) and feel lucky to have had the opportunity to be in this class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have benefited from more instruction about what the IAD framework -- we mostly learned via reading and \"doing,\" but I'm still unclear on what some terminology from the IAD means, even after the semester is over. There is also quite a bit of reading in this class, and as the syllabus acknowledges, it can be pretty dry. Dry reading might be unavoidable, but it did result in fewer people doing the readings, and some class discussions that felt a bit unfocused.",
                "Really interesting and engaging, no big flaws",
                "Can't think of any weaknesses. This course was amazing.",
                "Strengths: the seminar rocked because of the people who were in it. Most of us where juniors/seniors with a deep commitment to environmentalism and sustainability. Prof Fotos cultivated excellent conversations. But they really came alive because of my classmates.\r\nWeaknesses: hot take - I didn't love the lobster case study. I thought the first few weeks of the semester and then the last weeks of the semester were the most interesting content-wise.",
                "Professor Fotos painstakingly organizes each seminar meeting, which is a major strength of this course. The readings are engaging, though I do believe there were too many at times. The one major weakness, for me, was that we did not hold a seminar meeting dedicated specifically to walking through Elinor Ostrom's IAD framework. If we had been able to go through the seven steps of the IAD together as a class to clarify their ins-and-outs, I would have been better prepared for our final project.",
                "Strengths: amazing discussions; class was dynamic with discussion, lectures, and activities incorporated. Professor Fotos cares about his students as people and as learners so much. It is incredible to be in class with him. My classmates were equally engaged. Learned a lot about writing. Amazing class to take as a junior to prep for senior essays/theses. Great EVST/EPE foundational class \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a lottt of reading. Hard to know what to focus on some weeks because there was no way for me to get to it all.",
                "strengths: interesting readings, engaging activities and discussions, brief required responses, well structured to allow for ample time to write the assigned papers, organized, professor was deeply interested in the subjects\r\nweaknesses: could have spent some more time on the exact workings of the IAD framework. I felt a little unsure, and noticed that my classmates felt similarly, while writing my papers on the interpretations of various IAD framework sections.",
                "Strengths: The people in this class are so cool, and there's a great sense of community that develops over the course of the semester. The readings for class are also super interesting and varied, so you won't be bored on that front. Professor Fotos is just about the nicest and most sincere guy out there, and that really lends that class a good vibe.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We don't spend enough time understanding the basics of the main focus of the class (The IAD model), so everyone is trying to figure it out on the fly.",
                "Strengths: Professor Fotos creates a really supportive and engaging learning environment and fosters a strong sense of class community.   \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the material is REALLY HARD. Some of the theoretical concepts are REALLY CONFUSING. This class frequently made me feel like I had imposter syndrome because it was hard to understand all the theoretical stuff that we were talking about. There is a lot of reading and it is easy to miss things if you fall behind or don't catch everything. I also feel like a lot of people were confused about how to approach the IAD paper until we were far into the project. Providing more examples of past papers (and providing them early in the semester) would be very helpful in the future.",
                "The course was centered around the Institutional Analysis Framework but I wish we had covered it in more detail, rather than going right to the examples. The strength of the course was how brilliant Professor Fotos is and how engaging the readings are.",
                "Strengths: Fotos' teaching, his feedback on papers and weekly write-ups, great selection of readings, facilitation of familial atmosphere in seminar\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think some of us were a little fearful of the IAD at the beginning of the semester. It turned out that we had no reason to be and that Professor Fotos' assessment and feedback on our work was more than fair, but somehow assuaging those fears early in the term could help students be more present week-to-week instead of worrying about the paper that will come later.",
                "Strengths:  We usually had very good discussions, and there is definitely a lot of cool content to learn especially if you've had a lot of experience with environmental science and less with poli sci, or vice versa.  Weaknesses:  Readings were often too long for me to get close to finishing, but sometimes we'd just focus on 1 or 2 readings during class so if you started with the wrong ones, that was rough.  I think it might benefit from shortened sections of the same readings to really focus in on.",
                "Strengths- Fotos, weaknesses- the amount of reading",
                "This is the best class I have taken at Yale by far. I loved the material, and readings as well as the structure of seminars and the assignments. Even though the final paper is a significant task, paper one and reading responses prepare you for the paper very nicely. I struggle to find weaknesses of this course."

                "Yes! I would view this as a must-take class for anyone interested in environmental policy. It makes you criticize current policymaking methods and wonder how to make them better. \r\n\r\nThere's also flexibility built in for students to write about topics that are not related to the environment. Some students in this seminar wrote about housing policy, labor, and other topics that I wouldn't have immediately associated with \"sustainability.\" \r\n\r\nYou'll have to be patient with dry and challenging readings and some weeks during which you feel like you can't grasp the material, but it's worth it in the end. You learn a lot.",

                "Absolutely. Professor Fotos is so passionate and thoughtful and kind, and genuinely imbues these qualities into his teaching style and his curriculum. This course has highkey renewed my faith in humanity and reaffirmed my passions.",
                "Absolutely, 100%. This was one of my favorite classes I've ever taken at Yale. Many of the concepts we discussed over the course of the semester (polycentricity, co-management) were ideas I've thought about tangentially for years but never was able to directly articulate. It was truly empowering to learn about a concept in a class and then use the idea to defend and substantiate past experiences the environmental policy and conservation. Elinor Ostrom is one of the most under-appreciated economists of all time. She should be required reading for all economics majors. Please take this class if you're interested in climate, climate policy, environmentalism, or sustainability. It's fantastic.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the politics of the environment. Specifically, if you are interested in a particular environmental problem of resource management, this class will be great for you! I really did learn so much about strategies for collective action.",
                "Yes, if you want to learn a lot and be challenged by the readings/discussion/writing. If you put high input energy, you will get a lot out of this class. Im very grateful I took it even when it felt really challenging at times because the theory was hard to grasp and it occupied a lot of thought space each week. But Professor Fotos is incredible and Im so glad I was able to take a class from him. He is very helpful in office hours if you are confused and come with questions. Eager learners will do well in this class. Im also really proud of the work I produced in the end (my term paper) - one of the most meaningful assignments Ive done in college thus far.",
                "Yes! I am not an EVST, poli-sci, EP&E, or econ major and feel as though I gained such valuable insight and skills that changed the way I view communal issues globally. It provides students with excellent exposure to various classic authors and readings, gives them space to get more comfortable with seminar discussion, and forces them to work on specific writing skills and styles.",
                "I would recommend it, but only if you are willing to put in the work. You really need to do the readings and engage with the class to gain value.",
                "I would recommend it but only to an upperclassmen who has a background in some environmental politics, economics, or political science. It is most certainly not an intro level course.",
                "I would! Fotos is a great professor and a kind man. This course did more to help me focus my writing than any other course in the poli sci department I've taken. Again, the readings and the seminar make this class. Outstanding stuff on that front.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, 100%. Professor Fotos was incredible and allowed me to understand the challenging course material through his weekly reviews and class discussions. I really enjoyed the class material which included a range of topics but focused on each topic for the perfect amount of time to analyse and discuss as a class."
