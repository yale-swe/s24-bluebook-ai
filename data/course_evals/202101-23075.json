Like many American students, I had learned about the era in high school and in other education settings, but I found myself surprised and intrigued at every lecture. I also have a better understanding of how to write a history paper using primary and secondary sources.",

                "I learned so much about the Civil War and Reconstruction that I hadn't learned in high school history classes. Prof Shinn did a great job of making the history accessible and demonstrating the dynamics/events/etc he was talking about with primary sources and direct examples that kept it interesting. It definitely added to my knowledge of the Civil War itself and of the overall history of slavery, Jim Crow, and white supremacy in the US. Definitely a great class to take to get an in-depth but also relatively comprehensive course on the Civil War.",

                "This class is phenomenal. Prof Shinn is an excellent lecturer, and my TA (Anna) was outstanding. The feedback I got on all my assignments was exceptionally useful. Quality of lecture/lecture content is superb.",
                "I thought Professor Shinn was a fantastic lecturer. I always looked forward to class, even in a Zoom semester. I also thought our teaching fellows did a great job of both reviewing concepts and exploring ideas more deeply than would be possible in lecture. I would personally have enjoyed exploring more of the reconstruction era and the late nineteenth centurywe spent a good amount of time on the war (and rightfully so) but I found the later portion especially intriguing and far less widely known. The readings were always interesting, and the workload was very manageable.",

                "Great introduction to a lot of the prevailing thought surrounding race and slavery in the mid-19th century.",

I really got a clear sense of the big picture and equally enjoyed our deeper dives into the lives of everyday citizens in our readings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think that the chronological order of the material was useful in most cases to organize when/how things occurred, but I wonder if some themes would be clearer with a little more thematic grouping.",

That being said, some of the TAs grade a lot harder than others and there is a ton of reading (similar to an English class where you read a book a week, sometimes more).",

The focus of the class is more on political movements and motivations behind the war opposed to the memorization of various battles. Highlights a less drawn out narrative of the force of enslaved peoples in northern victory.",
                "Yes, you will learn a lot and the teaching is excellent.",
                "Yes! This is a great history course for major and nonmajors. For majors, it's a great exploration of a pivotal moment in American history that you can then apply to every other history course you take about the region or the concepts (so much of the material is still terrifyingly relevant). For non-majors, this is a very approachable introduction to the discipline where you can learn interesting content, try out a few papers, and read interesting readings with a great professor.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student.  It is great for non-humanities majors because it covers a topic that most Americans are familiar with.  As a history major, I also felt that it was worth taking because I learned a lot of information that I had never been exposed to before.",
                "Yes. This course is a very thorough overview of the Civil War. I would recommend it to any student who is interested in American history.",
                "Yes, it is super interesting and I really enjoyed it.",
                "Yes! This course is so full of information and so engaging. Professor Shinn is an interesting communicator, and the application to today is so important. Take the class!",

                "Yes! The material is extremely interesting and easily accessible.",
                "I definitely would! Especially if you want to have a good understanding of the Civil War (obviously) and get a better picture of earlier U.S. history.",
                "Yes, it was a great course.",
                "Yes! I'm really glad I know everything I came away from this course with in terms of understanding the history of the Civil War accurately.",
                "Yes 100% - I really enjoyed Professor Shinn's teaching style and the readings were interesting. A great gateway course for anyone interested in African American Studies, American Studies or History.",
                "I would definitely recommend to someone who wants to delve into the Civil War and Reconstruction. This knowledge is very useful to understand the current state of US politics and culture.",
                "Yes! I think the history learned is something every American should know. It's really important in understanding a lot of modern discourse on race. Would highly recommend.",
                "Yes, it's a good hums credit for a stem major. It's no gut though so be prepared.",
                "Yes! This is a great foundational course in the Civil War and Reconstruction. It teaches you everything you need to know about the era-- not in tremendous depth, but it doesn't need to. Professor Shinn is great and gives very engaging lectures. The TFs were also very prepared. Assignment-wise, it was not strenuous, just 2 short, topical papers and a take-home final exam. I'd highly recommend this class to anyone interested in the CIvil War and following events.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who has any interest in learning more about the Civil War period.",
                "I would only recommend this  course if students had a particular TF in mind. I did not overly enjoy lecture, but the TFs really make or break this class.",
                "This was my favorite class this past semester! I found the material fascinating and actually looked forward to discussion section. I learned so much and felt I had a better understanding of modern day U.S. after taking this class."
