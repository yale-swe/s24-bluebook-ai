I think our class in particular had different ranges of speaking ability so it was difficult to speak on the same level as peers who had already studied abroad in the past. I also think that the Lingco assignments were helpful in some cases but in other cases would be tedious and took up a lot of time and did not necessarily correspond to the lesson in class. I wish we had other HW assignments that encouraged practice in concepts during class rather than Lingco. I also think that the asynchronous assignments were fun and encouraged speaking with peers but I wish it aligned more with what we are learning.",
