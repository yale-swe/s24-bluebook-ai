    "I learned how to hold a simple conversation with people in Japanese .",
    "Japanese alphabets (hiragana, katakana, kanji), particles, cultural notes, conversation, vocabulary",
    "I learned a lot of Japanese language basics and would feel comfortable holding a basic conversation with someone.",
    "I gained a basic understanding of Japanese, from hiragana, katakana, to a little bit of kanji, and a good amount of vocab plus sentence structure. Japanese is very different from Romance languages, and learning it partly changed the way I think about language as a way to transmit thought.",
    "I learned how to hold a basic conversation in Japanese such as by inviting someone to do something or talking about my background. I also learned how to read a simple passage written in Japanese.",
    "I learned 2 out of the 3 Japanese alphabets, along with around 70 kanji. I learned basic sentence structure and grammar, surrounding common conversations and cultural practices."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The material is covered very well, even if it is at a fast pace.",
    "I thought it was well-organized.",
    "The class does a great job of teaching Japanese language concepts, and students practice them in helpful ways so it's easy to remember what we learn. It would maybe be helpful to have more conversation\/speaking practice with professors\/teaching assistants because by just conversing with other students, we sometimes learn concepts incorrectly and continue to use words improperly, etc.",
    "The strengths of the course were the daily practices in the concepts we learned in the Japanese textbook on our own. One arguable weakness was that most of the concepts were left to the student to learn on their own and not really went over in-class. Also, I think the mandatory Japanese clinic sessions that you had to attend outside of class weren't that helpful every week."

    "If you have a passion for learning Japanese, absolutely! The professor is extremely helpful and I believe that anyone can succeed in this course through strong work.",
    "Yes, this is a great course for a student with little to no background in Japanese. However, there are many assignments and examinations, and kanji will require memorization.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking to learn Japanese. It is a very comfortable environment for learning because the classes are small and the professor is gives very good feedback.",
    "Absolutely! If you're interested in becoming proficient at Japanese then I highly recommend taking the classes at Yale.",
    "Yes, I found this course to be challenging, but fulfilling and fun. I would preface my recommendation by saying you should only take the class if you have enough time and dedication to take on a language with demanding amounts of work and study."
