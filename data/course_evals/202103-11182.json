                "I improved my Russian grammar, speaking, and reading skills. The class also exposed me to a lot of Russian cultural nuances from the Soviet and post-Stalin eras through film and literature.",
                "This course was great for being exposed to a wider variety of Russian media sources as well as literature and film.  I strengthened my vocabulary and learned more about Russian\/Soviet history.",

            "comments": [
                "A strength is definitely Irinas enthusiasm and kindness. She really cares about each students personal development and contributions to class discussion. Another strength is that the films are really fun to watch and interesting! Some weaknesses are that we watched the films together on Sundays and although you dont have to go it (you can watch it by yourself) often felt as though we had a third class each week. Another difficulty was that homework assignments were really long and often posted the day before they due so that often I had to stay up working and reading a long article for class the next day. Also, towards the end of the semester I feel as though class discussions became a little more terse (maybe we got a little tired) and I think having shorter homeworks or articles that really get to the core of things may have helped. Another thing was that often even though the readings had some words defined, I often found that I knew very few words and had to look up every other word and thus readings took even longer and were hard to understand sometimes. Other times, the readings were great! Overall though the strengths outweigh the weaknesses and you should def take this class",
                "It uses real resources such as texts, films, etc to learn about modern Russian history, and is very engaging. I enjoyed the film screenings very much, although some of the films were dark. The only thing I think could have been improved was scheduling the film screenings at a better time but that depends on people's individual schedules.",
                "The course uses interesting material and Irina is great at teaching valuable grammar skills. Class conversations were useful for practicing listening and speaking. I think the course could have had a bit more structure and clarity about assessments. We also did not write much beyond short question\/answer homework assignments and I think more writing could have been helpful.",
                "A strength is that the course syllabus is very much connected to student interests.  We were often able to choose which assignments interested us the most.  Class discussions were also very interesting and well facilitated.  Prof. Dolgova also gave thorough feedback on every homework assignment.",
                "I think the course is very strong, but it has way too much work. Its often at the detriment of learning. I dont have enough time after class to learn vocabulary because homework takes up so much time. Its often not very helpful.",
                "This course does a good job at not only covering the plot of narratives through literature & film, but providing context for what was happening in history during the time that the narrative took place. While some texts were sometimes difficult to understand, we always made sure to cover any confusing points or fill in the historical gaps of knowledge. The one weakness was not having a consistent syllabus to go off of, but Irina made up for this in this course's flexibility.",
                "Strengths: Irina Andreevna is a great professor, and I really enjoyed all of the films she selected for us to watch. Weaknesses: The amount of homework was inconsistent  sometimes it would be a manageable workload, and other times there would be lengthy readings followed by tons of questions. I also would have liked to learn more about other periods in Russian history (for example, World War II), but I recognize that there is limited time in the semester and I learned a lot from our in-depth study of the topics we focused on."

                "YES! Take this course after fourth year russian! You wont regret it! You get to watch a ton of awesome movies and get to read lots of interesting articles and novels bits. Also we cover some grammar (review) so its useful and we learn a ton of new useful vocab.",
                "I would only recommend this class to those seriously studying Russian. This is an engaging and interesting class, but those dedicated to studying Russian are probably the only people who can benefit from it.",
                "If you want to improve your Russian skills and watch some great films, this is a good course. There is less of a focus on literature but the film selection was great.",
                "I would recommend any course with Prof. Dolgova to another student.  The course is well-organized and very attentive to the interests of our group.",
                "Yes! This was an enjoyable course where you can watch movies, read Russian literature, and improve your Russian. I strongly recommend taking any class with Irina.",
                "Yes, this class is a great way to continue developing Russian language proficiency while learning about Russian history and culture through authentic media. I recommend this course to students who have taken fourth-year Russian and are interested in learning more about Russia\/the USSR in an engaging and fairly low-stress environment."
