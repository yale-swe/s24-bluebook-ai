                "Close reading of works that are very philosophical. Coming from a very STEM-heavy person, I at first struggled understanding Foucault's style of writing, but by the end of the semester I felt more prepared to tackle philosophical work.",
                "Through this course, I was able to dive deeper into Foucaults studies and expand my knowledge on gender and sexuality studies.",
                "A close reading of Foucaults History of Sexuality that was elaborated on with supplemental readings. Was able to develop a better understanding of Foucault by applying his concepts to family, sexuality, etc.",
                "I learned the approach of Foucauldian analysis and a new perspective of how to understand and think about sexuality.",
                "I learned how to articulate cohesive and coherent arguments in seminar as well as conduct a foucauldian analysis.",
                "I learned more about Foucauldian theory and how to interpret Michel Foucault's work, in addition to how to use Foucauldian thought to support and argument and how his work is used in modern contexts.",

                "Strengths- readings are very interesting and manageable. Super interesting class discussions about sex vs sexuality, suicide, addiction, and queer relationships. If you're worried about speaking a lot/your participation grade, don't! Prof de Souza values anything you have to contribute to the class and welcomes you to office hours!\r\nWeaknesses- papers took 2+ weeks to be graded (this likely isnt the norm because aProf de Souza did say he was having some health issues)",
                "I really enjoyed the discussions we had in class regarding the assigned readings and our own thoughts. Small group discussion at the beginning of the class was especially helpful for digging deeper at the material and seeing other opinions on the pieces. One thing that might have helped my study would have been a sort of a summary of what Foucault says for his readings. His writing was oftentimes confusing and I got lost thinking about his philosophy.",
                "I really enjoyed the class structure and the discussions, and the professor allowed discussions to really go on any direction based on student interest. I think sometimes discussions could get a little off topic and could use some more support in keeping on topic, but that was very minor.",
                "The strengths was that the topics of discussion were very interesting and Professor De Souza was fantastic - super insightful and flexible to student need. The workload was also low and grading was fair. The weaknesses were that sometimes the readings were often dense (but not too long), and that while sometimes the discussion was very engaging sometimes it got a little slow. I would have loved to hear some more background context sometimes from Professor De Souza because he is very knowledgable.",
                "More help with writing style through example essays",
                "Strengths of this course are that the discussions help clarify the readings, all the readings are relevant to the discussion, and there aren't too many pages of reading so that I could focus on what was assigned. I think this is especially important in a philosophy class since it takes time to process philosophy texts. One weakness of the course is that it is two hours long once a week, so those two hours can feel like a really long time especially without a break. However, the class is only once a week which is a good tradeoff.",
                "More student-led dialogue, so many missed opportunities for us to bounce ideas/critiques off of each other. I also wish we would have wrapped up Foucault earlier on"

I think this course has changed how I view certain things in the world, or understand how they came to be. If someone doesn't like philosophy, I maybe wouldn't recommend this class, but I think that is pretty self explanatory.",
