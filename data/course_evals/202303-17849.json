                "We were able to survey a larger history of opera and operatic trends while simultaneously delving deeply into four operas. Overall a very strong course.",
                "Strength: Well-chosen operas/readings and papers were designed to be open-ended; Professor Tomlinson is very engaging and highly knowledgeable; I enjoyed the focus on the music itself, but this could be a weakness for those more interested in the philosophy Weakness: Nothing major, I personally found the lecture setup to be conducive to the course, though some might prefer a seminar style",
                "Strengths: This course was well-organized & engaging. The workload was relatively even throughout the term. Weaknesses: Occasionally the reading/viewing assignments were unclear or not fully updated. There could have been a bit more direct student engagement in class with the readings.",
                "Extremely engaging, I especially liked when Prof. Tomlinson would play the piano in class and point out aspects of the musical structure. I wish he also went a bit more in depth technically with the music, even though it may go over some peoples' heads, I think quick technical comments would have been fascinating."

                "Yes, for sure, especially if they are interested in opera, less so if they are interested in philosophy. I enjoyed writing the papers and thought the feedback was helpful, though some may find that the writing style is different than that for other writing-heavy courses, so plan accordingly",
                "I would 100% recommend this class to other students! This course was amazing! Professor Tomlinson is an engaging teacher, and you will have a blast learning about opera, its history, and its philosophical context. This is not a gut class--you will have to put in the work--but it is a rewarding experience that everyone at Yale should take.",
