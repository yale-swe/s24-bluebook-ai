                "Strengths -- Prof McCarthy is really really good at explaining concepts and provides lots of supplementary material and written answers to questions online. \r\nHaving the textbook as a background was helpful although admittedly I did not read it. \r\nThe course was overall well organized in terms of the order that material was presented and tying concepts together.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- I'm not sure how it could be improved, but the only grade in the course were based on written examinations. The exams were fair and reflective of the material covered and discussed in class, but some period recap and other grade might also be helpful -- especially since the second exam required a lot of writing and not quite enough time to do it all.",
                "Prof. McCarthy is a very good lecturer! He explains complex topics very well and often prompts us to arrive at solutions in intuitive ways. He also holds really helpful and in-depth review sessions before exams and is very responsive on Ed discussion. Another strength for me is that the content was all very practical, compared to many other classes I have taken in psych\/cogsci departments. A weakness is that your entire grade is 3 exams, which is stressful. The exams are fair but long.",
                "Would have been nice to see live demos and do trips to the medical school",
                "strengths: \r\n- lectures were well paced and concepts were very clearly explained\r\n- instructor was extremely responsive on Ed Discussion\r\n- review sessions were very helpful \r\n- I think the exams were overall pretty fair\r\n\r\nweakness: \r\n- I understand that the professor has past videos that are helpful to look back at to understand concepts such as undersampling and signal averaging, but I feel like we could have taken more time to walk through these difficult concepts together in class",
                "Sometimes the content is a lot in terms of the total amount of information you learn in a single class. But I feel the assessments were fair in checking for comprehension of key ideas.",
                "The material was very applicable to psychology - neuro track and neuroscience majors, but the class was a bit challenging to follow and the assessments were very hard. I think a more consistent assessment method would have been helpful.",
                "I liked the lectures, but they could be a bit too slow for me. This course should have sections for students to engage with the material beyond lectures. It is difficult material. More options to review could be helpful. Having a portion of the course that rehashes specific content that is assumed knowledge would be incredibly helpful.",
                "No weaknesses.",
                "More assignments would be better",
                "Strengths: Not having homework was nice\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there could be little quizzes throughout the semester, or something else to help break up the grade, also, this course can get pretty technical, so having a physics background would be helpful.",
                "I thought the class was very well organized, and there were many resources available for help. I think that some of the lectures moved quickly or incorporated concepts that we were not necessarily prepared for. However, Professor McCarthy did a great job explaining these when asked.",
                "strong: very comprehensive it was a good deal of work",
                "Strengths: definitely gave me a good foundation on imaging techniques and practical experimentation",
                "Grading schema is such a weakness. There is no way to improve in the class because the grades are all determined by exams",
                "Prof. McCarthy is an experienced teacher and he knows what he is doing. The only improvement I personally would recommend is to switch from only 3 exam and nothing else assessment format to something which integrates a weekly\/biweekly check (can be something small like pass\/fail quizzes to something more intense like Human Brain qset format)",
                "This was a content-rich lecture style course that did a great job clearly explaining the methods discussed. I would have liked weekly assignments to help solidify information and understand it better. Basing the entire grade off of 3 exams does not fairly assess what students understand about the material, as they might not remember the specifics of a certain experiment discussed in class but they can understand how it works. Also, I did not like having to schedule a meeting with the TA to see my exam answers because it was inconvenient and I did not particularly want to discuss any aspects of my score -- I just wanted to see where marks were taken.",
                "I think the lectures are very formative, you can tell the professor enjoys teaching the content. I loved the review sessions before the exams, they were very helpful.",
                "I really love the content of this course. The information is engaging and also helps provide an important foundation for anyone in the neuroscience major. I actually think it should be a foundational class for the major because it really helps you understand the basis of so many important methods.  I really liked the exams and structure of the class. However, I do think that the class could have a few more assignments to keep students engaged in the material and encourage continuous learning rather than cramming before exams which I often fell into (and recognize is often my own fault)."

                "Yes! 100%. This class was incredible and so foundational if you are studying neuroscience. It really put all of the methods into perspective and helped me feel confident reading research papers and conducting research myself. Professor McCarthy is also amazing and great at answering questions."
