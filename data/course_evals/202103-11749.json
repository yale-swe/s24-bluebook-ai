                "My writing improved significantly throughout the course, thanks to regular meetings with the instructor and the frequency of the papers (four papers with revisions on Papers 2 and 3). I also learned how to analyze writing, both others and my own, to identify strong and weak arguments. The course provides a thorough introduction to college writing. Finally, I exited the course with a much better understanding of chivalry, questioning how chivalry takes its form in the modern world through the final paper.",
                "I strongly developed my writing and critical reading skills. I became more confident in my writing as the course progressed.",

                "The strength of this course was definitely the professor, I thought the weakness was that the material at the beginning was very disengaging.",
                "Strengths: The course emphasizes writing from the first day. Workshops were engaging, as they gave me the opportunity to identify weaknesses and strengths within our peers writing, which could often easily translate to my own writing. The courses focus on chivalry gave us a really unique lens to view a modern issue (whether chivalry should still exist) by traveling back in time to events like the Titanic, the Victorian Era, and the Middle Ages. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, the reading load could be heavy, considering the amount of analysis needed for each reading. In class, we did not always have time to discuss all of the readings, and often, our focus on identifying arguments could sideline further discussion of the substantive topics within the readings.",
                "The strengths of this course was the detailed feedback the professor gave on each essay and draft leading up to the final draft. As students we could see where we needed to rethink and the professor gave us the ability to improve each draft and rewarded us with a grade on both quality of the writing but also improvements from the first draft. I think one weakness of the course was sometimes I felt the readings were unclear and I wasn't sure what to look for but I also think this is because the material was so new to me (medieval chivalry)."

One moment I am crying over a laptop, frantically asking myself if this sentence is a claim or a warrant, and the next, I am listening to such a beautiful or fascinating intellectual take that I'm crying yet again. Ulrich is leaving Yale, so for anyone else, this course will be too different in the future for me to give you advice on it. This class was Ulrich. If I had to pick my own first semester at Yale all over again, I would still take it.",
                "I would have if the professor that taught me had not just left Yale. She was really the best part of this course.",
                "If the student was interested in improving their writing and not afraid of a heavy workload, then yes. I would not recommend the course for someone who is not invested in really improving their writing. The amount of attention, analysis and detail needed in the course to do well is very high.",
                "I would recommend this course less for the material but more for the quality of the professor. Professor Ulrich was so talented and skilled in her field that although I knew nothing about the history of chivalry, she was able to answer every question the students had and provided so many interesting articles. I think this class specifically challenged me too because since I knew nothing about chivalry the articles were challenging and then writing papers on the challenging articles was even more challenging. Although I struggled I felt proud of the work I did and looking back I would recommend the class for the feeling of accomplishment.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in chivalry  not just the modern social aspect, but where chivalry originated from and what the meaning of chivalry was in its medieval context."
