The class content was really interesting (ranged from topics in psych to philosophy to politics) and the essay process was really conducive to improvement: we were given feedback after each draft that was clear and helped us reconstruct our essay into an even better one for the next draft.",

                "I have never considered myself a writer and have always chosen written exams over papers. After this class my confidence in my writing has improved 10 fold. I think the structure of the class was excellent in making it easy to see improvement from paper to paper. I challenged myself and am very proud of how much I have learned over the course of the semester.",

                "One strength: the course went very in-depth into the skills involved in writing a good academic essay. I truly do feel like I've become a much better writer this semester. One weakness: the class was pretty fast-moving at points, so it was sometimes a high workload.",
                "Strengths: Professor Eklund was amazing and chose really interesting texts. I really liked the psychological experiments that he would incorporate into his lecture. There was also a lot of feedback provided on each essay, so you could really grow as a writer if you put in the effort to make the necessary revisions between drafts. Weaknesses: honestly can't think of any weaknesses, but we didn't get to some texts \/ topics at the end, so maybe the time management of each unit could be improved slightly.",

The topics he chose were super interesting (especially if you enjoy stuff related to psychology\/cognitive science), and he's also a really funny person, so class discussions were a perfect blend between being serious and comfortable.",
                "Yes! I think it is a great way to get your writing credit or just to use to improve writing skills like I did. These skills are something that I will take with me to many other areas."
