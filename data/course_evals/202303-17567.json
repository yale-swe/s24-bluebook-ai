                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I took this course as a senior, and I would recommend taking this course in a semester that you know you will have the time to give to it. It is a lot of reading, and you will consistently be expected to write responses and engage thoughtfully in seminar. I appreciated the workload in many ways because none of it felt like busy work. Seminars were run excellently by Professor Kunzel, and she added just the right amount of historical information so as to facilitate discussion but not to turn the seminar into a lecture. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about incarceration, and I think the class could benefit from a few more contrarian voices.",
                "Yes! An incredibly eye-opening course that truly changed my perspective on the current state of U.S. politics and society, and the way the two interact.",
                "Yes! It is an excellent angle on US history and Prof. Kunzel is fantastic.",
                "I would very much so recommend this course to other students at Yale College. Professor Kunzel has created an incredible course that challenges students to endeavor for greater overall knowledge and understanding in a rather intense and harsh vein of history in the United States. Additionally, the seminar style learning rivaled that of Directed Studies if not exceeded in terms of engagement, material, and progress with writing abilities and prowess.",
