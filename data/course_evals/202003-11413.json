I learned about writing extensive papers at the college level, and how to look at history through a different lens.",

We wrote four essays over the course of the semester: rhetorical analysis, synthesis, research, and historical fiction. I felt like each one allowed me to build a different writing skill, resulting in a lot of overall improvement.",

I also improved my argumentative skills, and I learned how to more effectively analyze the implications and nuances of my arguments. Also, I learned to view the world as a collection of storiesstories that, by their very nature, require subjective and often arbitrary choices to create and interpret."

Also, I enjoyed the peer review process that we went through to get feedback from students in class. If I could change anything, I would want a little bit more guidance in the planning stages of the paper - I feel like often we brought in our first draft and were on our own to discuss ideas\/approaches. However, office hours were very helpful for this.",

                "This course was well-structured, and I felt that I learned a lot from all the essays we had to write, especially the ones that required multiple revisions. The class sessions devoted to peer-editing our drafts were especially helpful, and the one-on-one office hours also helped me greatly improve my writing skills.",
                "I think the workload of this course was consistent with the progression of the semester. The only thing that could improve it would be having in-person classes.",
                "I enjoyed the lively in-class discussions.",
                "I felt like the course was just very good overall at improving writing across many disciplines. I felt like one of the weaknesses was that the discussions were sometimes difficult to get into, but much of that can likely be attributed to the virtual environment.",
                "Strengths: excellent professor, interesting material, a great intro to college-level writing\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: besides being on Zoom (which obviously couldnt have been helped) I cant think of any weaknesses!"

This course was very helpful in making me feel more comfortable writing more extensive papers and using the resources at the Yale libraries. This was a great course and I would definitely encourage others to take it.",

I felt like the course was a very good introduction to \"college-style writing\" and certainly did a lot to help me prepare for future writing.",

The material was interesting, the grading was very fair, and Prof. Ringel-Ensley was a wonderful professor. She was kind, funny, and relatable, she was very skilled at facilitating class discussion, and she gave very thorough and high-quality feedback that improved the quality of my writing and also the quality of my thinking."
