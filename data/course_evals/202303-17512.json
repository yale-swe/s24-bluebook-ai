                "Strengths: Covers a wide range of intellectual history across 300+ years and weaves together different writers from across time and space very well. The discussion section is fantastic and vibrant. The exams are just three papers (~1,500-2,000 words) plus section participation. Plus very short weekly assignments for sections (like response paragraphs).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lecture is mostly random professorial commentary on the topics. After a few weeks, you realize that the lecture is, for all intents and purposes, just for fun. You don't need to go to any lectures to participate fully in the discussion section and write all the papers.",
                "The real strength of this course was my TF Charlie Troup. And its weakness, if any, was its lack of structure in lecture.",
                "The biggest weakness is a lack of student engagement. Most of the lectures were listening to the panel and a few mins of questions after. Some more engagement with students would have been better",
                "The lecture format with discussion among the three instructors was great. I enjoyed hearing them respond directly to one another (and jab at each other from time to time). It made for lots of interesting and funny moments. I think one thing that could be improved is bridging the gap between theory and current events. I'm partial to theory, so I would have liked to see more of it in the latter parts of the course.",
                "Content is interesting and professors are entertaining. But it's not a traditional class. Lectures and essays aren't really connected. Lectures and sections won't cover all the readings. Take the class if you're interested in the readings and will find the Douthat/Moyn disagreements in lecture entertaining.",
                "Lots of variation in the readings and very thoughtfully curated syllabus. The lectures are less helpful and the sound was muffled for a lot of it. 3 professors lecturing sort of made topic unclear for each day it went on.",
                "The strength of this course is the unconventional format. The three professors essentially doing an IRL podcast was interesting, with their banter or answer to a question often being more insightful than the mini-lecture at the beginning. All of them are really brilliant and great to listen to. While their analysis and teaching were great, I think they were too ambitious when it came to the syllabus. They often never touched all of the readings for one particular class during their discussion, preferring to go deeper on one small point. This made the overall narrative of the class very unclear, as each meeting felt like its own dive into one particular idea on one particular reading. The course would be much better if the syllabus and scope of the class were smaller, tackling the micro-issues the professors would be talking about anyways.",
                "The strength was the section for this course  truly excellent and helped me to improve as a writer.\r\n\r\nThe lectures were interesting, and each professor is an interesting thinker, but the lectures were redundant and the readings were not always inspiring. The class should be more about putting the three views in conversation with ancient political theory; instead it often felt like the three professors (Douthat and Moyn in particular) were just repeatedly saying their views and never conceding.",

                "Yes, I recommend it if you're interested in the intellectual history of liberalism, and critics of liberalism. The discussion section is fantastic. I had fewer than eight students in mine and all of them and the TF were truly fantastic (top 10% of discussion sections at Yale probably). The course is very similar to DS (except only three papers during the semester), so you'll do very well if you were in DS. Even if you weren't, as long as you go to office hours with the TF to review your paper outline and you can handle a few ~loquacious~ people in section, you'll do great.",

                "Two things to know about the class:\r\n1. The three professor format means that the lectures are almost like podcasts, with the profs sort of just talking about the stuff that they find interesting. If you like this kind of thing, as I do, take the class, but if you don't then probably don't.\r\n2. The class, to my disappointment, was more about political philosophy than current events. There is some current events, but it's mostly connected to the \"what challenges to liberalism exist?\" question.",
                "Recommend for basic intro to western liberalism.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the history of political ideology. Having the experience of listening to the professors is worth it, even if the curriculum itself is pretty disorganized.",
                "YES! This is one of my favorite classes I've taken at yale.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in political theory and contemporary politics or journalism. But be prepared to encounter similar ideas repeatedly  it can be redundant often. The writing improvement was strong, but the reading and lectures were often trite.",
                "No. Too disorganized and lots of reading we never really got to discuss. Section was great though."
