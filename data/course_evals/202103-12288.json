                "Strengths: Professor Chan is always super enthusiastic and makes class more exciting. The class itself and the schedule is very organized as well. \r\nWeaknesses: A lot of emphasis is placed on the lesson texts and verbal/listening skills, less so the writing. I also personally wish that there was more emphasis on the grammar rather than the lesson texts.",
                "The grammar could have been delivered a little better. We learned grammar mostly through discussion, which helps to introduce the grammar, but doesn't help that much with retention and application. It would have also been nice to practice writing characters seeing as we were tested on them on the midterm and final. This doesn't necessarily have to be done through additional assignments, but some way to keep us accountable for memorizing the phrases. Other than those, the course was great overall. Highly engaging and not difficult to participate during class.",
                "I wish grammar were emphasized more during class time and that we were provided with more review material for exams",
                "I thought the course did a great job of allowing people at various levels of skill be able to equally engage and contribute to the class. The amount of coursework is relatively heavy, but also consistent enough that it was easy to fall into a reliable rhythm. No improvements for the course recommended",
                "this class was a lot more lecture-y than the ones i took before, and it became kind of exhausting sometimes and hard to pick up everything. i felt like my friends and i missed things in class sometimes because of that, especially in terms of grammar and word usage. it would be helpful if the teacher could have lecture notes about grammar and word usage for us to refer back yo so im not frantically trying to write everything down in my own notes.",
                "The strength of this class is the volume of material, you learn so much in only a semester, and frequent assignments ensure you don't miss a beat. The weakness is that it can be difficult to follow at times, and difficult to determine which vocab is need-to-know vs. vocab that is nice-to-know."

                "Yes. There is a lot less emphasis on the writing and not enough attention on the grammar, which I wish could be different, but it made me a lot better at and more confident in my verbal and listening skills. Overall, a good continuation to L4 Chinese.",
                "Yes! Continue to learn Chinese if you've already started because you will forget it!",
                "Yes, for those looking to continue their Chinese education, absolutely.",
