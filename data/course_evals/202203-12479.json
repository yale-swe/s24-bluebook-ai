                "As my first history seminar, this course helped me interact with historical texts in a way I hadn't before. Professor Aslanidis really pushed us to be critical of all the sources he assigned us, including our textbook, which I thought was a refreshing way of learning.",
                "I developed more analytical skills in the field of historiography. Prior to this course, I did not think to criticize the ways in which historians present conflicts and wars so much, and classroom discussion not only focused on the events of revolutions but also in how their legacy is impacted by their recollection. Beyond that, I learned how to write a long research paper with more sophistication and direction.",
                "This course taught me a lot about how to critically view history and the historical texts I read. I realized the importance at not simply knowing facts but really analyzing historical events and formulating opinions about them. This course also taught me how to write better and with an actual argument, which is a testament to the feedback I got from the professor. I also enjoyed engaging with difficult texts, which I think I got better at through this course.",
                "As the course title suggests, I learned about the major players and events in many of the revolutions that occurred during the \"Age of Revolutions.\" More importantly, however, this was the first class where I really learned about historiography. This class forced me to think critically about certain historical interpretations of, say, the French and American revolutions. This class helped me push back against many pro-Enlightenment narratives of history which I was taught throughout middle and high school. Further, I learned how to develop structured history papers that were more nuanced and thorough than papers in other courses.",
                "My structural thinking in historical essay writing increased tremendously. I thought so much harder about how my essays would feel to read.",
                "I knew little about revolutions around the world prior to this class, and left feeling much more confident in my understandings of them. The papers were excellent opportunities to enrich my own personal interests and the feedback from Professor Aslanidis has helped me so much as a writer.",
                "I really gained an understanding of broad trends occurring throughout the world from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century. We studied politics, culture, society, and their intersections, along with present-day issues and implications. I gained insights into present-day political and social issues by surveying a wide range of historical perspectives. We also studied different schools of historiography and political philosophies, their perspectives, and their histories.",
                "I learned a lot about revolutions and specifically how to analyze and interpret sources that you may not always agree with. This class really teaches you to think critically and to push your own personal beliefs."

            "comments": [
                "I loved the scope of the course and how much time we dedicated to the various revolutions. We did go through 1848 a bit quicker than I would have liked, and I would have enjoyed spending another week on it. Overall, this course strengthened my historical knowledge of countries other than just the U.S. and made me feel like a world citizen. In terms of workload, the readings were digestible in only 2-3 hours a week. Most people in the seminar were able to get through all the texts, and there weren't any weeks with an obscene workload. The papers are pretty hefty, especially for a non-writing credit course. But the topics for the papers are so open-ended (literally anything revolutionary-related) that you can choose something that interests you, which makes the workload seem less.",
                "The class is challenging. Though the readings are not always incredibly long, the content is dense and most of it requires some prior knowledge of the revolutions we were studying. It is the sort of class you have to come prepared in order to meaningfully contribute, which is a good thing and I could see my classmates really understood the concepts we were discussing. I think the grading distribution could be improved. Despite the amount of reading and discussion, the only grades beyond participation are  the midterm and final paper, which can be stressful if the midterm doesn't go well.",
                "I had a lot of issues with this class, the first being it isn't so much a history course as much as it is a political science one. The level of knowledge required for this course is really high, specifically when it comes to global political history and just an understanding of government and politics. Further, and this is not the fault of the professor, but class conversations were oftentimes dominated by a select few students, who tended to be male. This is an issue of class makeup, but I do think this class attracts a certain type of student that is comfortable taking a lot of airtime and not really considering other classmates. I also think the class wasn't really focused on collective learning as a group, but instead unnecessary debates that pushed the thinking of the two people participating in said debates. However, the class did not feel like a cohesive community or group, which is unfortunate because I usually leave seminars feeling the opposite.",
                "This course was difficult for me because I only really knew the American revolution. It was difficult to think about the historiography of the French Revolution when, frankly, my understanding of the major events was a little hazy. There is a general understanding that you have prior knowledge of most of these revolutions. I wish the professor would spend 20 minutes at the beginning of the seminar lecturing about the major events so that everyone is one the same field.",
                "The classroom atmosphere here was unlike any other history seminar. Professor Aslanidis is not interested in wasting time or filling two hours with talk for talk's sake. You will be encouraged and pushed to engage critically with the texts, with the political ideas being discussed, and with your peers. The room was always fun because I never knew what the discussion was going to look like ahead of time.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with the class's survey nature is that we occasionally found ourselves in discussions about the political ramifications of the details of a revolution's development without having really studied said development. So sometimes, for example, we might be asked to discuss the political ramifications of our interpretation of the cause of a particular revolution, having read only five or ten pages about the cause.",
                "The class is incredibly inclusive and engaging. I feel as if every student in the class participated extensively. Professor Aslanidis is truly gifted at helping to facilitate class discussions, and is a gem in the Yale faculty. Every student should take at least one of his classes.",
                "The readings were a major strength of the course. They were from a wide range of perspectives and schools of historiography. The course did a good job of adequately covering a range of views, from conservative to Marxist. Another major strength was the classroom discussions which Professor Aslanidis led extremely well. I always deepened my understanding of course material from the questions the professor asked and how he guided discussion. I can think of no major weaknesses of the course.",
                "I loved how the class was discussion based and all the readings were very interesting. Sometimes discussions could get repetitive so maybe for some of the class having some structure could help with that."

                "Yes! If you have a strong grasp on at least one of the revolutions the course covers, the rest of the discussed revolutions could be a great supplement to your already established knowledge. The readings are generally pretty interesting and not too dense. I always enjoyed attending our seminar and hearing the wildly varying views that were present in the class. If the syllabus at all sounds interesting, I would try to apply. Professor Aslanidis always took notice when a student engaged with the week's readings and was a helping hand if any of us ever felt stuck. Highly recommend.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in revolutionary thought and motivation over time. Each revolution we studied helped inform my understanding of radicalism and mobilization of the masses in major world conflicts. It was out of my comfort zone, but I feel the content was very valuable.",
                "If you are looking for a political science class, sure, but this class caters to a certain type of student that is very comfortable dominating a conversation, and if you are that student, great. If not, find another class. I also think this class was filled with a lot of jargon and thrown-around phrases that were really hard to follow. Class conversations (which were not usually conversations but pointless debates that did absolutely nothing for the learning of the class) were not designed to facilitate learning but just a way for us to get participation points. I also have a big issue with the fact that participation in this class was weighted so heavily when it was sometimes hard to even get a word in, what with students spending 5 minutes talking about their canvassing on the bernie campaign (nothing to do with the class), and further, the class was not a very comfortable or welcoming environment that made sharing thoughts very easy. Last thing - loved spending 2 weeks each on the american, french, and greek revolutions while other revolutions such as the haitian and latin american (or subjects such as women in the revolution) got a week.",
                "I would recommend this course to devoted history scholars. I felt disillusioned about history after finishing this course, but in a good way! I am much more comfortable knowing that there are many historiographical strands of thought and that history is commonly fought over. Further, I was forced to grapple with pretty tough questions concerning violence and the usefulness of facts at all.",
                "Yes.",
                "I'd definitely recommend this course to another student. It was a great overview of the various revolutions in the \"Age of Revolution,\" the through lines connecting them, and the competing explanations for their occurrences.",
                "100%, Professor Aslanidis is awesome and the material discussed is invaluable in shaping one's understanding of the world we live in today.",
                "Absolutely. This is one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale thus far. Anyone interested in history, political science, sociology, international affairs, or U.S. politics in general should definitely take this course. It's so much more than the history of various revolutions from the 1770s to the 1840s\/50. The readings are not overly laborious\/lengthy and are highly engaging. The classroom discussions are intense and Professor Aslanidis asks very good questions to further discussion and debate.",
                "Yes! Professor Aslanidis is amazing and you really get the chance to have meaningful and interesting discussions."
