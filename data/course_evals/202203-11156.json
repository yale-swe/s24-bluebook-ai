                "Since I was a heritage speaker, I could understand 80% of what Laoshi was saying but where I truly improved on was my speaking, writing, and reading. I came in not knowing how to form complete, coherent sentences and now I do. Learning the sentence structure and simple grammar in L1 gets you so far when talking with native speakers. You can have conversations now!!! I can read passages now which it is crazy to think about before this class. Also, biggest improvement is my writing. I can write a lot of characters now but the hard part is keeping them memorized.",
                "My skills in Chinese skyrocketed after taking this course. Coming in, I was barely able to read Chinese and now I can read paragraphs of it in the workbook. This class also teaches you how to successfully manage workload in college.",
                "There were many skills that I learned by taking this course. We learned many so much new vocabulary and grammar rules, utilizing them in a variety of contexts from making requests to asking questions. I found myself being able to recognize Chinese characters and also develop my writing, speaking, and listening abilities.",

                "Strengths: great teacher, textbook was easy to follow \r\nWeaknesses: every student started at a different pace so If you were behind the rest of the students it was hard to catch up. Many students took the class in high school or previously already.",
                "Strengths: SUN LAOSHI is so so good at teaching. She cares so much for her students and it truly shows through her class. She remembers small details about her students and brings it up for examples which makes the class so engaging. She is so funny and makes learning Chinese so fun. It doesn't even feel like class. She has created such a great class community and always encourages us to be friends outside of class. I could not have had a better Chinese laoshi.\r\nWeakness: For the course specifically, the homework sometimes is writing heavy so it would help if the course split up homework to have a good spread of listening, reading, and writing everyday.",
                "Strengths are that this class genuinely has helped me improve Chinese comprehension. The assignments are very easy. Also, the teachers are wonderful and I would recommend them to anyone. Weaknesses are that sometimes the workload can be a bit too much and that a lot of the work seems like busy work.",
                "I think that the course could help with providing more resources for students to learn outside of the classroom such as things we could do to practice our writing, listening, and speaking that wasn't just textbook-based. Examples such as podcasts or optional writing prompts would be beneficial.",
                "Strengths: very organized, class is similiar to a discussion section, provides many resources.\r\n\r\nImprovement Areas: focus more on chinese grammar"

                "YES especially with SUN LAOSHI! Everyone says the workload is horrible but for heritage class, it is very manageable. I did about 30 mins of homework and studying everyday. You learn so much in one semester and my foundation is great!",
                "Yes I would! My experience with this class has been wonderful. Sun Lao shi is amazing and by far one of the most caring people I have met. She teaches the course so well and ensures our comprehension before moving on. Amazing class!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because of the community you're able to make. The people here are some of the most passionate and engaging students on campus, and with such a brilliant and kind teacher, you're bound to have a good time in learning Chinese.",
