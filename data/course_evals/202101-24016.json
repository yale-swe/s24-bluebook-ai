            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the content on the exams is identical to that of the psets, which makes studying very accessible and no-surprises. JT makes the lectures rather engaging and fun for a math class. The discussion sections are very helpful and informative.\r\nWeaknesses: slow response time for feedback on assignments. The TF's and JT provide very very little insight when asking help on specific questions, and frequently tell you to just go back and watch the lecture which isn't helpful or constructive; you're very much on your own in this class beyond the lecture and section so there's a fair amount of independent learning.",
                "Strengths, very straightforward. JT makes it easy to learn and follow and expectations for problem sets and exams are very clear. Always willing to help.\r\nWeaknesses, timing. Psets were often posted very late and messed with my weekly schedule. Same for exam information etc. Tried to be as proactive as possible but sometimes impossible as the problem set was simply not available.",
                "Strengths: JT is very approachable, well-informed, and generally engaging teacher; exams reflected classwork\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: problem sets were always posted a day later than they should have been, which reduced the time we could think deeply about them; TAs occasionally gave different answers to questions (meaning  that we would get questions wrong by applying the logic one TA had told us); class seemed rushed (it felt like too much time was spent answering questions/giving opportunities for feedback vs learning material) and did not delve into deeper understanding of the topics, only surface level understanding (would have liked to consistently critically evaluate the data of actual research papers on problem sets/exams)",
                "Cheating runs rampant among the students in this class and it is incredibly upsetting to the few students, like myself, that believe in integrity and choose not to be academically dishonest. As is often the case with the global major, the students all know each other very very well from various global-oriented extracurriculars. Thus, even when JT assigns 5-6 different versions of the midterms/finals, students in the class easily coordinate groups for each version and complete the assessments together on a zoom call. If I had known about this occurrence earlier, I would have reported it anonymously a long time ago; however, I was not made aware of it until this past week. The person who told me about it said that it has occurred during every midterm and final in both AQA I and AQA II. My understanding is that about 35-40 students are involved. I know that during COVID, it is incredibly hard to monitor cheating so I do not at all blame the instructor. That being said, as one of the students in the class that is not involved in the widespread cheating, I am incredibly disheartened. I have worked very hard in this class and am so frustrated that my peers don't do the same. Aside from it being a blatant and punishable violation of Yale's academic guidelines, it is very unfair to the students in class who did not choose to be academically dishonest. I am sure my exam grades would have been better if I had a group of friends helping me, but I care about integrity and it's frustrating to know that put me at a distinct disadvantage in this class. I hope that the university can look into this somehow, especially considering that many of the cheating sessions took place on Yale zoom and Yale wifi. I am a firm believer in accountability and think that these students have the responsibility to own up to their actions.",
                "Feedback was often unclear and grades were extremely subjective by TA, which made a complicated subject somewhat more frustrating.",
                "I appreciate JT's efforts to keep everyone engaged",
                "This course was really well taught - the lectures are engaging, the discussion sections practical, and the problem sets get you practicing yourself. The greatest strength is JT's teaching. He turns what could be a really dry subject into an interesting exercise that you can actually use in a job after Yale. My only small criticism is that some problem set questions were meant only for practice and we weren't actually supposed to get them right, but this wasn't made clear unless we went to office hours - this was a little confusing. But this is a minor point in an otherwise fantastic course that I'm very glad to have taken!",
                "Very passionate lecturer, JT is great",
                "Strengths: The material is useful, and it's nice to practice using Stata. Weaknesses: The problem sets were often overly long and tedious, and the grading was sometimes opaque. The pacing of the course is also a bit slow.",
                "Strengths - JT is a great guy\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Unfortunately, this course is ungodly boring; particularly after a semester of 121, it's incredibly dry and hard to engage. The problem sets are a force. Global Affairs needs to not make this course required.",
                "Strengths: JT's humor really made the class more fun. The lectures slides were clear and made reviewing easier. Overall the course is well-organized and the tests directly reflected what we learned during lecture and practiced on the psets. The psets can get long, but ultimately I appreciate the well-rounded practice we got.\r\nWeakness: At times, there seems to be a disconnect between JT and some of the TFs. Occasionally, JT would say something during lecture or put certain words on the slides, then the TFs would take off points for the exact same answer on the psets. It was frustrating to spend more time than necessary going back and forth between JT and the TFs, trying to figure out what exactly is expected of us.",
                "The course's strengths are the value of the information learned, JT, and the assignments for the semester (the combination of 7 problem sets, a midterm, and final helped with practicing the material often and mastering it). The weaknesses are that it is a significant amount of work and the lectures can sometimes be long and boring, especially online.",
                "The strengths of the course is JT and the TFs. They do a good job of making the dry material fun and entertaining. They break it down in a way that is easy to understand. A very great course.  The weaknesses of the course is the vagueness of some of the questions on the problem set that made it very difficult to complete on some occasions, and on some days the material was just very hard to get through.  Also, the time to complete psets are very short on occasion.",
                "This course should be taught to undergraduate and graduate students separately because these two groups do not have the same expectation and understanding of the class, and also, how they would like to use the class time are completely different.\r\nI think the next year grad students should be fully informed about the details of this class such as the class size, teaching style, etc. as I believe current grad students started the course with wrong expectations.\r\nMoreover, I think it is important to cover all the subjects identified in the syllabus. I wish we spent less time on how not to think about concepts and theories and covered all the subjects in detail.",
                "The course is really good, but I wish JT provided more supplemental material to learn the information.",
                "The strength of this course is how applicable and relevant the material is.",
                "Strengths: JT is the absolute best part of this course. He is incredibly engaging and really makes sure that the material is clearly explained within the lectures. \r\nWeaknesses: I think the main weakness I experienced was how unhelpful office hours with the TAs would be right before when PSETs were due. I often left more confused. Also, they would take a while to grade the PSETs, so it was hard to know what you did wrong to adjust for the next one. Also, it really depends on your learning style, but sometimes the constant participation expected in class may be a bit overwhelming for someone.",
                "Strengths: Excellent professor, clear feedback on problem sets, professor offered many office hours for answering questions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Delayed feedback on problem sets, T.A. office hours were at times that were slightly inconvenient for the schedule at which the problem sets were provided and due \r\n\r\nI enjoyed this course, I recommend offering students the opportunity to be put into study groups because being able to discuss the problem sets with other students would have been very helpful",
                "The strengths of the course are JTs way of explaining complex topics in intuitive terms. The problem sets are also a good way to keep practicing we learn in class but at the same time learning how to run the analysis on Stata. Working with the TA's in section is also one of the strengths of this course.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness is definitely the size of the group. With such a large class, it was very difficult for JT to balance out giving people the opportunity to ask questions and also moving through the material. The result was that people were constantly confused and felt that some things needed more explanation, but people were also constantly feeling like we were moving too slowly. JT likes to teach using an almost Socratic Method, which, again, does not work with large groups because we spent a lot of time hearing wrong answers from student's trying their best and not enough time getting into the nuances of each model.",
                "Strength: The course is like a series of episodes that build a bigger stroy. Each lecture is closely connected. The instructor worked really hard to make each connection intriguing for the students so that they can appreciate the value of each method and nuance. Besides the teaching materials, the instructor built the \"JT teaching module\" that encourages each student to participate in the course (eg. life and time, coffee chat, etc). \r\n\r\nWeakness: It would have been better if the instructor makes a stronger connection between the textbook and the teaching materials. I understand that it would be difficult to match the storyline described above (and the level of difficulty, particularly materials involved a lot of mathematical thinkings), but it would provide more opportunities for the students to explore beyond the teachings of the class. I believe that the majority of the students end up just following the lecture slides and video without textbook materials.",
                "Strengths: JT as the instructor. He is very caring, always 100% making sure students will have their questions answered and he is also very knowledgeable regarding STATA and statistical analysis. \r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "Psets were highly related to the lecture (no surprises), professor was amazing and did everything he could to make the course engaging. No weaknesses.",
                "JT is a great professor, but the lectures were often hard to follow. Additionally, there were no answers to problem sets or previous exams, so it was difficult to prepare for exams, especially when the TAs gave different comments and scores for the same answers on psets. Additionally, office hours were often inaccessible to a lot of schedules, and there were no review sessions before exams. Students were left fighting for 15 minute office hour slots prior to the final exam. I wish the class had more resources to help students fully understand and apply the course material.",
                "Professor and TAs are very clear in their explanations of concepts",
                "Strength: JT! He's a greater lecturer, easy to talk to, cares about students, replies to emails. The TFs were also helpful and nice.\r\nWeakness: with the whole Zoom thing, the office hours experience was very limited, but can't really help that. Grading should be more standardized among different graders.",
                "Theyre very picky about answers on problem sets! Can be either a strength or weakness...",
                "The course is well organized despite the problem sets being tedious. More complete lecture slides would be highly recommended.",
                "For a class of that size, it should have been more of a lecture. I actually found it easier to learn from the recorded lectures rather than the actual live ones because I could pause/slow down during the nuggets of information and speed up through the fluff. I understand that the purpose of asking students to explain concepts is to let them learn through thinking out loud, but the result of that was I was generally confused until the professor actually just said \"this is the answer.\" The professor should have just led each concept with \"this is the answer\" and then let people ask questions/challenge their assumptions, rather than the opposite.",
                "Strengths: JT is INCREDIBLE. I can't say enough good things about him and the way that he ran this course. First off, I wish every professor did a Life and Times. If I ever teach a class, that's how I'm kicking things off. JT ticked every box for a truly stellar professor: he has an engaging teaching style, he was personable outside of class, he clearly went above and beyond to set his students up for success. He set up an environment for learning that felt incredibly safe and welcoming and that's no small thing in an area like statistics where some students (me) may feel hesitant to put themselves out there. I only wish that I'd had him as a professor for longer. \r\n\r\nJT also ran a tight ship in terms of organization, too. Sometimes professors who are incredible people just aren't very good instructors. Not the case here. I absorbed much more material than I thought I would due largely to JT's willingness to repeat and recap over and over (and over) again, until he could be sure that we really got it. \r\n\r\nSo many strengths to this course in terms of the TAs, the organization, the clarity of instruction and expectations. But all of that stemmed from JT, who set up a wonderful environment for learning and made this semester of Zoom-hell a lot less horrible than it could have been.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: (very) minor, but just struggled sometimes to make it to office hours. Not sure if it might be possible to poll students ahead of time to see which times work best for the majority of the class? I know the TAs have busy schedules though too, so not sure that would be feasible."

                "I find the virtual format to be better because of recorded lectures",
                "Virtual learning was fine in this course. The one big issue is the way that exams functioned. The exams were really long, so students really had to rush through them. This made it feel like they were less an accurate assessment of how well you knew the material and more just a test of how quickly you could work.",
                "I appreciate that JT encouraged multiple forms of virtual engagement, including answering questions in class or on Canvas afterwards. This gave me more flexibility and I didn't feel as pressured to answer a question every single class. The Stata tutorial videos were also very helpful: I like that I can go back and rewatch a video to refresh my memory before tackling psets.",
                "The lecture and participation scheme (cameras on, screenshots taken every so often, participation recorded, and an opportunity to answer questions on Canvas for participation credit) definitely helped with engagement.",
                "JT kept the class super entertained and taught super well, so the lecture was able to move very quickly and well. The requirement to speak was fixed and that is definitely the way to continue moving forward allowing students to answer questions after or speak in class.",
                "I think having a fully virtual class with 65+ people does not provide the greatest environment for learning.",
                "I really enjoyed this class, and I appreciate JT's method of keeping us engaged. In GLBL 121, there was no participation. However, in GLBL 122 there was a participation factor. I think it was actually useful. I was a fan. However, I think it should be graded more harshly in order to encourage participation. Rather than having one block of text, there should be a response due every Monday and Wednesday after class so it forces students to go over the material again. It should be graded on completion, and count for a fair few points in order to incentivize students. I think it was a good addition, it just wasn't executed as well as it could have been.",
                "The requirement for camera-on, graded attendance led to a competitive atmosphere that was not conducive to learning. It also didn't take into account the myriad of situations that different students may have been in.",
                "The lecture format and discussion sections were successful",
                "Fully online classes should not be this large. It truly does not work, particularly for participation. It was a good class because JT is a good teacher, but even he really struggled to keep us engaged.",
                "Success: One of the notable advantages of the zoom lecture was video recording. Since all the lectures were well recorded and made available for the students, those videos became great tools for the students to review the entire class materials so much easier than before. It is particularly true because the course is heavily dependent on the instructor's logical pathway to address each statistical method and method. For this reason, I hope that the instructor considers providing the same recording service for the future course as well even after the pandemic. \r\n\r\nImprovement: Based on my semi-in-person classes last semester, I felt that the virtual setting was better suited for this course because of the advantage described above. I found that it was easier to engage with the instructor through zoom in the class despite the size of the class. Although this comment does not entirely fall into the category of \"things to be improved,\" I would like to leave this feedback to point out that the instructor pulled out really in the virtual setting, even better than the in-person setting.",
                "Both the lectures and sections allow students to actively participate and engage in class by answering relevant questions posed by the professor and TAs.",
                "office hours can have a little improvement, because it was hard to get all questions in, but not sure if this can be improved if virtual",
                "JT adapted marvelously",
                "Live lecture worked despite participation being such a problem because there's a lot of people talking.",
                "The socratic method did not work with a class that size over zoom. That said, I am very glad lectures were recorded, otherwise I would have had a really hard time just learning through live lectures.",
                "Coffee chats were much appreciated! Hope that there will be other opportunities to say hi to JT next year, when we're all back in-person."

                "Yes if you're a Global major it's smart to get this out of the way ASAP. If you have any statistics knowledge this class is nothing super new and makes you very comfortable with concepts like linear/logistic regression and ANOVA analysis.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I think especially for global students with little to no stats background, this course is a good fit. For students with a greater math or stats background, the course moves a bit slowly.",
                "Yes. If you want to be more comfortable discussing, evaluating, and performing different kinds of regression analyses, this course is a must. You'll leave knowing more than you thought you ever would.",
                "JT is great, and AQA is a requirement",
                "Only if you have to take it for the Global major.",
                "No. Don't take it unless you have to, but Global should really stop mandating this course. JT is a great guy. Unfortunately, this course is ungodly boring; particularly after a semester of 121, it's incredibly dry and hard to engage. The problem sets are a force. Global Affairs needs to not make this course required.",
                "Absolutely. The course really helped me gain more confidence when looking at the results section of research papers, and it provides a good foundation for using Stata. Also JT is a cool professor, and I always felt comfortable approaching him with questions outside of class.",
                "I would recommend it to another student. I would imagine that the student taking it is a Global Affairs major. If you are not a Global Affairs major, you should still feel free to take it, although there are probably better/more aligned statistics courses out there for you to choose from.",
                "Well it is a required course for the GLBL major, but it is definitely one that should not push you away from pursuing the major.",
                "I would not recommend this course to a graduate student.",
                "Yes. JT is a great professor and really fun and easy to talk to. The material is interesting and will undoubtedly serve you well in the future.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I  enjoyed learning about Stata and statistics",
                "Yes with caveats. I would not recommend for grad students to take it if they have a choice of a similar course that is not meant for an undergrad public. Although they are super smart, I felt like the pace of the class was slow on account of student's mean age and familiarity with the material. Student's questions were also naturally at an undergrad level.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students because it really forces students to think critically about causality, particularly in the context of public policy. How to accurately present the realities? How to be sure that a certain policy brings positive/negative impacts to the population? How to major such impacts without minimum bias? These are the fundamental questions any policymaker (or any manager in the company) should address. We may not be exposed to all of the sophisticated methods and models in the career, I found it immensely useful to explore the reasoning embedded in the methods and models. For this reason, despite the difficulties and challenges of the course materials, I would encourage students to take this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to all students who are interested in studying impacts of variables like race, socioeconomic status, elements of social variables and how they affect people's welfare. I came in with no statistics background and now I am leaving with a fine understanding of R^2 and other mechanisms that allow us to understand the nature of regression analysis.",
                "100%. Global majors need to take this course but the professor is one of the best if not the best at Yale. Professor really pushes you to fully internalize the material because he knows how useful it will be in the future, and he succeeded in his goal.",
                "Yes, if you are a Global major, it is a required course-- I would not recommend taking this class if you are outside of the major, honestly.",
                "Yes, the statistical skills taught in this course is cruicial to research in and understanding of the social sciences",
                "Yes! JT is a greater lecturer and you learn a lot on using ANOVA and multiple regression to test your hypotheses, which is helpful for understanding different literature/research that incorporate significance tests/ statistics.",
                "Absolutely, anyone who wishes to do research in the social sciences should absolutely take this course.",
                "Depends on what the student was trying to achieve. as a graduate student, I probably would say no and instead find a graduate level alternative that was smaller and more focused than a large undergrad class."
