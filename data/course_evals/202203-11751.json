                "I learned to play bass gamba, improved my ability to read in alto clef, read about different tuning systems and how colonial Mexico approached music, and learned compositions from colonial Mexico.",

                "Improved skills on the viola da gamba; learned about music of Spain, the Spanish Empire, and colonial Mexico; learned about Renaissance music and instruments; learned about temperament and tuning systems; performed in early music ensemble."

                "I enjoyed playing early music and learning new musical instruments. I wouldn't change anything about the course.",
                "I don't believe the course has any discernible weaknesses. Its strengths are the amount of repetitions we get with each song, which facilitated my improvement as a performer, as well as Professor Herreid's wonderful contextualizations of each piece of music.",
                "Strengths: this class is a fantastic combination of historical/linguistic exploration of early music and refinement of performance techniques. The music is incredibly beautiful and performing in the Beinecke is a truly special experience. We had a great guest lecturer one class who opened up my view of interpreting music. Weaknesses: non",
                "This class is great. It's a welcoming environment for those interested in early music, and it provides plenty of space for those that want to challenge themselves to do so. I think the TAs are a huge strength of the course because they are all very supportive of the students and are very knowledgeable about early music. All of the TAs made an effort to get to know all the students, welcome them, and share their experience. In a large ensemble where individual interactions with the professor are rare, I think it is especially important that the TAs were there to bridge the gap between students and professor. I also very much enjoyed our guest speakers because meeting new musicians is a very valuable experience.",
                "I think that I was generally confused as to what the course's structure was throughout the whole semester. The syllabus said our grades would be determined by a set of items quite different from what I actually experienced. I also wasn't really sure how we were expected to take notes during class when we were constantly holding our instruments and would have appreciated a better discussion of what to expect from the course at the beginning of the semester.",
                "It was a very fun class - low pressure, no stress. I loved that we didn't have to worry about anything in the class and just go to class and learn.",
                "Strengths: this course gives you the incredible opportunity to play music of the Renaissance with your fellow students. The music is both incredibly beautiful and of historical significance. One can learn a Renaissance instrument, a great opportunity not available elsewhere. The professor, Grant, is incredibly knowledgeable about this music and talented in playing all types of Renaissance instruments. The class also performs for the public in the Beinecke, an incredible experience!\r\nWeaknesses: there are none, this is a great class."

                "For someone with a background in music theory and experience performing, absolutely. You will get to sing beautiful music in languages and styles and are likely new to you and that will challenge you. If you are not an experienced musician this class may be unpleasant, especially if you're an instrumentalist learning a new variant of your instrument (harpsichord, viola da gamba, recorder etc.)",
                "I would highly recommend this course because it's a supportive, low pressure environment where you can learn at your own pace and feel comfortable. I've taken very few classes at Yale where everyone feels comfortable and has freedom to focus on whatever aspect of the class they want. While this class was not difficult, it provided students with plenty of resources to go beyond the bare requirements for the class and improve as a musician in other ways.",
                "Yes! Grant is a great instructor with tons of knowledge about early music.",
                "Yes, it is just a great time to learn something niche and cool.",
                "Yes, this course is undoubtedly one of the best at Yale. Any instrumentalist or singer should take it!"
