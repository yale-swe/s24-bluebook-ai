   "comments": [
    "I learned to better analyze poetry and worked on my fundamental paper writing skills.",
    "I learned how to analyze poetry with respect to its particular time period, make arguments about poetry and support them with evidence, and engage in meaningful discussion about poetry.",
    "How to close read with deftness and passion in a way that does not feel like Im shaking a poem and begging it to divulge its secrets to me",
    "Close reading, discussion skills",
    "This course equipped me to perform close readings and comparative analyses of poetry. I learned how to discuss the craft and content of poems, and to write critical essays of various lengths. I also learned historical context from many of the periods we studied.",
    "We read from T.S. Eliot to Robin Coste Lewis. The class essay schedule focuses on close reading analyses, taking small bits of text and building on writing longer and longer essays. Before the class, I had never had a lot of exposure to twentieth-century poets and am glad I had the opportunity to read some of them in a class setting.",
    "An improved ability to close-read passages of poetry and to understand a poem in the context of the broader aesthetic and intellectual questions the poet is grappling with. Also, an improved ability to expand on an idea over a number of pages (our last two essays, on limited passages of poetry, were about 8 pages long."

   "comments": [
    "it was taught really well - I wouldn't have changed anything.",
    "Strengths- well lead discussions, which made for engaging class time.",
    "Marta is an INCREDIBLE professor. The most brilliant and supportive and kind person",
    "I liked most of the syllabus for this course (was not a fan of Pope but otherwise liked everything we read) and thought discussion was fairly good.",
    "I think that the syllabus was pretty well-designed and conducive to learning. I would have enjoyed reading a little more history or other context from the period from which we were reading poetry. I also think that the class made a great use of art in the YCBA and archives in the Beinecke, which I appreciated, and I think that there could be more field trips or outside connections made to strengthen the course. I enjoyed the discussions and felt like they were well-led.",
    "I personally really benefitted from the flexibility in the essay prompts. I struggled to make the weekly reading responses, but on the whole believe that they are net good for engagement.",
    "The syllabus was outstanding, and I appreciated the length of time usually one or two weeks on each poet, depending on the poet's prominence. Professor Figlerowicz was a wonderful discussion leader and facilitated an open and encouraging environment for students to volunteer their thoughts. Her manner encouraged everyone to share ideas and participation was high. Moreover, she was extremely generous with her time and very open to scheduling individual appointments. I learned as much from my one-on-one discussions with her as I did from the twice-weekly seminars. In her office hours, I was able to ask questions tangentially related, but nonetheless relevant, to the course. I always felt supported by her."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class as a way of improving your writing and analyzing skills if you're interested in poetry, or if you need a foundational credit as an English major.",
    "Yes! Especially if you need it for the major, and especially with Professor Figlerowicz. Personally, I don't like the older poetry associated with ENGL 125, so this was the perfect fit for me.",
    "Yes!",
    "I took 126 because I needed to (English major). At the beginning, the poetry was frustrating to me, but by the middle and end I think Professor Figlerowicz had made the medium tolerable and even enjoyable. I would definitely recommend their section if they offer it again because I received clear and detailed feedback. Our class had 10 students in it, so they could spend what felt like an appropriate amount of time commenting on our work and inviting us to meet with us. They were really thoughtful and encouraged us to send thesis statements in beforehand to read over. I do not think of myself as a weak writer, but they supported my growth in a way that was a genuine surprise for an introductory course.",
    "Yes! I guess it really depends on who you take it with, but I know a lot of English majors not very excited to fulfill their foundational courses (especially English poets I and II). I would say, if you are torn with that choice, definitely take 126 because the readings are more interesting!",
    "I'd highly recommend. Instructional quality was excellent, and so was the syllabus. As a second-semester English major, it was challenging, but within my skill level. I think it would be much more of a challenge for the newer English student, especially because of the length and depth of the papers."
