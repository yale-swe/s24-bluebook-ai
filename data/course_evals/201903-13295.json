   "comments": [
    "You learn to become a better person, and you learn that by doing so you become a better leader, teammate, friend, family, and significant other. In no other university will you learn how to do that. Take it, because you need it.",
    "I became a much more concise writer. I learned how to better interact with those around me. I learned how to have difficult conversations and manage conflict. This course was so life-changing, I loved it.",
    "I gained so much from this course. I learned a slew of actionable leadership\/life skills, from asking powerful questions to reading affect to holding a mic correctly. I also gained so much personal clarity. Having to write your own obituary definitely forces you to put your life in perspective. This was my favorite class of the semester and I felt so energized after leaving week after week.",
    "All the experiential skills: basic attending, feedback, crucial conversations, conversations with those we disagree. Also writing short sentences with simple language and minimal adjectives.",
    "this was the best class i've taken at yale. if you can, TAKE THIS CLASS. i cannot recommend it enough. it will change your life. its not a typical leadership class. it teaches you how to be a better listener, presenter, and person. it redefines what leadership means. leadership is being real, honest, and brave. this class takes you on a journey to find these things inside of you. peter bensinger is an ANGEL. im going to miss this class so much. the most applicable material ive ever learned. just take it if you can you WILL not regret it.",
    "I learned about basic attending skills, how to express gratitude, how to ask meaningful questions, how to have important conversations, how to tell my story, how to improve my public speaking, and how to be better person. The value of the knowledge and skills this course helps you develop is hard to articulate in words. This is a course that every student should take. I wish it was a part of the larger Yale curriculum.",
    "This class was absolutely amazing. We gained interpersonal skills that are rarely taught but come into play every day. I learned how to have authentic gratitude and express it to those around me. I learned how to make what is implicit, explicit. Not only has this class helped me to improve and strengthen my relationships with my family and friends, but it has helped me improve my relationship with myself.",
    "I learned to become a better leader, and in turn, a better human being. \r\n\r\nI think the course academized what is called the \"hidden curriculum\" of Yale. I learned how to listen better, be more emotionally intelligent, tell stories, practice public speaking, receive feedback better, have difficult conversations, and listen to those I disagree with, just to mention a few.\r\n\r\nOn top of the interpersonal skills, I also developed intrapersonal skills. Not only did I learn how to better communicate with others, but I also learned how to communicate with myself, in my own mind. We were required to keep a 90-day gratitude journal, write a 5-page letter to someone we're grateful for, and then write our own eulogies. I had to reach deep into my own mind to take on those assignments.",
    "Controlling where you focus attention; empathic listening; asking powerful questions; expressing gratitude; creating psychological safety in your teams; giving and receiving feedback; and engaging with those with whom you disagree to understand their views, how they feel about those views, and why they feel that way; daily gratitude journaling.",
    "This class taught me skills that are important to life beyond Yale. We learned how to have meaningful crucial conversations, ask powerful questions, tell important stories, and improve presentation skills.",
    "I learned more in this class than in all of the classes Ive ever taken  combined. We learned how to listen attentively and make others feel listened to, how to approach and execute a difficult conversation, how to feel and express gratitude, how to ask questions that provoke deep and meaningful conversation, how to be an effective public speaker, how to hold a microphone professionally, and even mastered the art of the handshake. I learned so much about myself, others, and how I look at the world. I learned skills that I will use (and continue to improve on) for the rest of my life. Peter also taught us how to write. He taught us the importance of short sentences, concise word choices, and the importance of style and the overall appearance of a paragraph (e.g. no hangovers).",
    "All of them. This is the most important class Yale could ever offer. This class taught me how to be a better friend, mentor, daughter, sister, girlfriend, citizen, team-player, leader, and human being. Take this class.",
    "How to effectively communicate, write, listen and think - in professional and personal atmospheres.",
    "Through this class, I have grown as a thinker, writer, listener, and public speaker.  I have learned how to prepare for challenging conversations. I have reckoned with what it means to lead a meaningful life. I have grown to appreciate the power of expressing gratitude to foster joy. I have faced the subtle distortions in my own emotions and stories and begun the long, difficult process of being my own honest mirror. What an incredible gift it has been to be in this class.",
    "This course taught me how to be a better person. It taught me how to be a better leader, in every sense. Leadership isn't about being a CEO or the President (of the United States or a Yale College club). Leadership is about being a role model to others, making them feel heard and seen, and being the type of person you want to be. I learned how to create meaningful relationships and assess my own values. This all sounds very mushy and I get that. But, I think it's true. We learned how to deal with emotions, how to ask (GOOD) questions, and how to give feedback. All of the lessons were backed up by academic research, which made the course feel very relevant and applied.",
    "I learned how to write clearly and concisely, so I'll exhibit that to you now. I learned so much from Peter. We read academic literature on gratitude, psychological safety, empathic listening, and much, much more. It truly was an experiential workshop. I practiced having crucial conversations, giving and receiving feedback, and presenting another's viewpoints to the class. This class helped me own who I am as a person, an intellectual, and a leader."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There are no weaknesses. This course was incredibly carefully organized and prepared by the instructor for the students to maximize their learning. The strengths are that there is not a single second wasted either during class or at home engaging with the assignments.",
    "Peter. Peter is the course's strength. He is the most fantastic professor. He actively cares about each of his students and never once assigned work that made me feel like my time was being wasted.",
    "Strengths: Peter. Peters dedication to the class was incredible. Flying in from Chicago every week, taking the initiative to scheduling office hours for us, bringing Peter Salovey and Marvin Chun for the last class! Truly just an outstanding individual. He makes you feel like you are the most important person in the world when he talks to you. He was able to create a class dynamic between my peers unlike any I have seen before. Peter + Great, Useful Content = Best Class at Yale.",
    "Peter is this class's biggest strength. The way he created psychological safety and an environment where everyone felt accepted and gave 100% to this class is so unique. I liked the structure of the class, especially the experiential parts and small group exercises.\r\n\r\nThis was my favorite class of the semester, and I really don't have any big criticisms.",
    "only strengths. peter bensinger is an incredible professor, person, mentor, and ally. small class size made us a little family. i knew everyone well by the end of the semester because we were all vulnerable together. the concept is super interesting and approachable. the assignments are groundbreaking. writing a gratitude letter to give to someone, writing your own obituary, presenting the views of someone with which you disagree, research paper with a topic of your choice... just such cool and emotional assignments. I often got emotional thinking about or participating in this class. its emotional content and vulnerable conversation with your peers. i cant say enough about this class and yet im at a loss for words. this is the best class at yale.",
    "This class is clearly and effectively organized. This class never wasted time, and everything had a clear purpose. The cohort of students got extremely close. I have never seen this in a class before. The only weakness of this class is that not every student can take it.",
    "The strengths of this course were endless. Peter was the most amazing professor I have ever had, who cared deeply about his students. The content he curated and presented was extraordinarily important to learn. The ways classes were set up, with presentations by Peter, group discussions, and small group work made for an extremely fulfilling class. I can honestly think of no ways to improve this course for which I will be forever gratefu.",
    "The strengths were the readings, the professor's authenticity, and the course's setting (which was a theater, the Trumbull theater).\r\nThe course was experiential. We didn't just talk; we took action and practiced what we learned outside-the-classroom.\r\n\r\nI can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "This course facilitates a type of learning and academic growth like no other. It practices core skills that are not only interdisciplinary, but are essential to any future personal or professional pursuit. The only way this course could be improved maybe with more group projects so that students in the class can work together and leverage their strengths and improve on their weaknesses in smaller units.",
    "The main strength of this course is that it is unlike any Yale course being taught. It is an experiential workshop meaning that students are able to interact n the classroom and actually experience the skills the class teach.",
    "Everything about this class is strong. We sat in a circle of chairs in the black box theatre and that really encouraged open and honest conversations. Peter built an incredibly strong sense of psychological safety in the class. There were no weaknesses in my experience at all, but I could potentially see a major one ensuing: if theres even one person that doesnt buy into this class and what its all about, it could ruin it for everyone. One wet blanket could really be a roadblock for meaningful conversations or connections to happen.",
    "I have not one complaint. Not one moment of my time was wasted in this class - in or out of class. That is something I cannot say for any other class I've taken in my 7 semesters at Yale. Peter perfectly curated every class. His love for learning is contagious. He cares so much and is brilliant. He made everyone feel welcome and capable.",
    "This course is enormously strong. The professor, Peter, will forever be a role model of mine. He is genuine, kind, and exceptionally thoughtful. He cares more about his students than anyone else I know. The coursework is relevant and important. The readings are good as well. The reading responses force us to do the reading. I think the course was thought-out and never a waste of time. No weaknesses!",
    "Strengths: Peter's investment in us as people was the greatest strength of the course. He constantly encouraged us to reach new heights. When we were writing two-line sentences with ease, he pushed us to write one-liners. He established an open and safe intellectual environment like none other I've experienced at Yale. Each week tackled a new quality of leadership behavior, and I greatly benefited from this sequence. Peter clearly thought it out very carefully. As the semester carried on, I could see how we were integrating and . Not many Yale courses teach you life skills; this course certainly did. Every second of work I did for this class was meaningful, both in class and the homework outside of it. The conversations that Peter assigned us were with people and in situations actually significant to our lives. I can't say that of any other class I've taken at Yale.\r\nWeaknesses: I can think of no major weaknesses. I'm sure the course will only improve as Peter gets more practice teaching it. The heavy-hitter assignments, one after another towards the end was a lot to manage."

   "comments": [
    "This course is the best thing that has happened not to me, but to Yale. As an education institution, Yale should make this course a mandatory distributional requirement. The life lessons that you take away from each course are far greater than the memorized equations or definitions from other disciplines. You learn to become a better person, and that is what Yale should be teaching to all students. This class is so much more than just leadership skills. It's a deep introspection to who you are and who you aspire to be. Everyone should take this course with Peter Bensinger.",
    "Yes. I think this should be a requirement for all Yale students because it has changed the way I approach social interactions and has made me an all-together better person.",
    "Yes! I can not recommend it enough really. Peter is willing to teach this class again and Yale would be foolish to not let him. I cannot emphasize enough how much I recommend this class, but only go to it if you are willing to really step into the role. The class pushes you to tackle some real-life things and will have an impact on how you interact with others. Do not take the class because you think it will make you a better CEO or something, take it to learn about yourself. You have to know yourself before you can be a leader.",
    "YES ABSOLUTELY YES. EVERYONE NEEDS SOMEONE LIKE PETER IN THEIR LIFE TO HELP GET THROUGH YALE.",
    "i cannot recommend it enough. I was on the waitlist for a while and started thinking it wasnt worth it to fight for it. my semester would have been so different (and likely much worse) if i didnt fight for my spot. its one of the best choices ive ever made. if you're fighting for a spot, keep fighting. and reach out to peter. he wants to help and wants you to be there. the chance to work with peter and this content in a small seminar... it's unlike any other. this class challenged my understanding of what constitutes academia. it doesn't have to be literature analysis or equations, it can be learning how to be a more effective communicator and better person. in the long run, the latter skills matter so much more. ive grown so much because of this class and im incredibly grateful for it. yes yes yes yes yes take this class!!!",
    "I would recommend this course to every student. The workload and \"intellectual\" challenge are not greater than the average Yale class, but this course demands more emotionally from students in order to experience the growth this course enables. You will become very close to your classmates and you will see an improvement in all of your personal relationships. This class labels itself as a leadership class, but frankly, it's a class on how to be a better person. When it comes to leading, it's easier to follow a good person.",
    "Absolutely. I cannot express enough the life-changing quality of this class for me and my peers. I only wish all Yale students had the ability to take this class.",
    "Without hesitation, I recommend this to all students, no matter what leadership roles they fill or don't fill. I recommend this to administrators and professors as well; I know some Yale leaders who would really benefit from a course like this, or a workship-version of this course.",
    "This course should be a mandatory course for all students. If you are fortunate enough to take this class, you will come out of the semester so much more gifted and full of life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was my favorite course out of my entire Yale experience. Through this course, I learned the interpersonal skills necessary to be a successful and emotionally intelligent individual.",
    "To take this class is the ultimate privilege. It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. You will learn about lifes most important skills and how to grow as a human being. Im gonna leave it at that because I could write a novel about how amazing this class is.",
    "Yes. Yes, yes, yes yes. This class was invaluable to my development as a person. Peter is the best professor I've ever had. Take this class. If you're on the waitlist, go anyway, try to get in. You won't regret it.",
    "1000000000000000%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There are not many classes at Yale that will directly, week to week, change the course of your life. And there is no other teacher at Yale like Peter Bensinger, who will help you realize your strengths and approach your weaknesses with kindness and growth. Taking this class will grow your awareness about your self and your relationships -- it will help you get so much more out of life in each breathing moment. Taking this class will attune your heart to noticing the beauty in each day and moment, even those that seem dark and hopeless. And taking this class will teach you what academics and college classes can and should be, at their very, very best. Our class formed a really special community, where we truly valued, heard, and respected each other. Week after week, we trusted each other with our stories and cheered each other on through the semester. In this class, there was no loudest or quietest voice. I say that as someone who is usually the quietest. It was unbelievably special, in that regard. But do know that taking this class is no joke. The exercises and workshops are for everyone and completely accessible, but they do require an emotional intensity that I have never before experienced in any course here. You have to be willing to get to know yourself deeply and sometimes uncomfortably. That doesn't necessarily mean you have to be ready for this day one when you step into class. I sure wasn't, but we all stepped up to the task. I would do it all over again. Just know that it's coming. But don't let that stop you from diving in completely.",
    "YES",
    "Absolutely. This class is one of--if not the--best class I've taken at Yale. Taking it will help you improve as a writer, a listener, a human being.",
    "Everyone should take this course if they have the chance. You need to be open-minded and ready to engage. You only will get what you put in  if you are lazy, or don't care, you will not like this course and you will ruin the course experience for others. Be prepared to buy in  it's an amazing experience.",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this course to any Yale student. People come into Yale hoping it'll help them become a better person. Oftentimes, it does the exact opposite. We learn to practice technical skills and prioritize many things that aren't important. But in Leadership as Behavior, Peter reminds you what'll really help you maximize your potential as a leader and, dare I say, leave behind a legacy. You practice skills (with guidance, something you'll likely never get in any other context) that help you hold better relationships: gratitude, listening, feedback, handling crucial conversations, the list goes on. I was hesitant at first about the class actually helping me practice these skills, but now that I've taken it I can say with confidence it truly has. And I was the kind of person who thought I was already pretty good at this stuff. It showed me there's always room for improvement. If you're looking for a course that will actually change your life, it's this one."
