She really made us get down to the bare minimum that still accomplished our task.",

                "Yes, I definitely recommend for people who want to learn more about design and the basic principles of it. I would say that this course isn't a course that teaches you software or how to use the adobe suite. It is very much starting from scratch and making things with your hands, but I don't think that that should be a turn off but it really helps you to think about your choices in composition and really gives a lot of flexibility. I also really enjoyed that we did a real world simulation of a designer/client role in which we designed for our classmates.",
                "Yes. You need to set aside enough time to properly work on each project to get something out of the class, so I wouldn't recommend it for an easy 5th class or anything. But the class is excellent and super applicable to the rest of life, and Yeju is a great teacher who really cares about each student's growth.",
                "Absolutely. No matter what major you are, this course will allow you to better appreciate and consider the impacts of design in our everyday lives. I learned so much about how I think, and gained so much insight by discussing other peoples work as well. I finish this course with a greater love and excitement for the meaningful struggles and potentials in design."
