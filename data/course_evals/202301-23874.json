                "I have improved my ability to read and synthesize information in philosophical texts in an efficient and meaningful way. I have been introduced to a vast array of philosophical concepts including but not limited to idealism, materialism, substance monism\/dualism\/pluralism, the a priori and a posteriori knowledge distinction and what it entails for different thinkers, the problem of correspondence (e.g Descartes, Berkeley), synthetic vs analytic judgments (e.g Leibniz, Kant). The three papers have helped me improve my philosophical analysis and ability to reconstruct and question philosophical arguments. Stimulating class discussions have provided interesting entrances into the text and opened my mind to the variety of ways each text can be interpreted and used.",
                "How to analyze and understand the arguments of different philosophers, as well as philosophize on my own",
                "I learned an overview of modern philosophy, seeing the major ideas and developments, as well as how they relate to Classical and medieval philosophies and eachother.",
                "DRST Philosophy in the spring is a truly incredible intellectual experience. Of the three disciplines, it has the best outline and breakdown, with a focus first in metaphysics, then epistemology, and finally ethics and existentialism. I cannot commend this course enough. \r\n\r\nI became and have continued to become an improved writer because of this course. Prof. Grimstad expects a wonderful balance of intriguing arguments and specificity as well as rhetorical flourish, and this provides for some great papers. \r\n\r\nI have become a quicker reader with an eye for philosophy, which allows me to better seek the truth in all of my academic endeavors.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, I have become a much better discusser, debater, and arguer. Of the three courses, this is the course in which your intellectual takes can truly do battle, and this has allowed me to fervently agree or disagree with the ideas of my peers, of the professor, and of the writers, which I believe is the best way to learn.",
                "I learned how to write about philosophy, and how to analyze concepts until I thoroughly understand them. I learned how to read dense texts. Most importantly, I was exposed to dozens of concepts I never would've spent any time on otherwise, like whether the world is real or whether God controls monads.",

            "comments": [
                "I think that this is overall a very good course with interesting lectures and fascinating discussions. Professor Grimstad almost always does a good job facilitating discussions. The conversation sometimes gets sidetracked, but I think thats the nature of the course. I liked how Professor Grimstad would send out extra supplementary materials for some philosophers (I particularly liked the one for Nietzche). I think the biggest weakness of the course is the syllabus; the amount of days allocated to each philosopher is unequal which caused us to skip philosophers and texts that I feel we had time to cover.",
                "Seminars are thought-provoking but they can trail off-topic too much sometimes.",
                "Discussions are led perfectly: Professor Grimstad is always beyond prepared and his responses push the discussion forward. He also always tries to include everyone in the discussion. The only negative I can think of is that sometimes it can be just a little challenging to not be interrupted by professor Grimstad, but this rarely happens.",
                "Strengths: good overview of Western philosophical canon\r\nWeaknesses: too little time for these readings",
                "Strengths: The selection of texts for this course was well-made, where the ideas of one thinker aptly flowed into or responded to the ideas of the previous. I appreciated the informal division of the course into 1) metaphysics and 2) moral philosophy, with Kant and the Kantian revolution as the breaking-point. The vast majority of the lectures in philosophy were extremely helpful this semester: I appreciated especially when the lecturer 1) left a detailed handout\/slide presentation useful for review and 2) divided the lecture into an explanation, and the a critique, of the arguments of the week's thinker. This was done for example during the lecture on Hume's moral philosophy, the two lectures on Kant and the lecture on Nietzsche. I found the structure of the final exam, which provided great opportunities to display one's knowledge on a vast array of subjects, while focussing on conceptual understanding rather than identification of passages, very pleasant and well-suited to the way DS philosophy is taught.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only weakness I can think of right now as to the overall structure of the course is that more of the power-points \/ handouts could have been posted to the canvas page. And perhaps that the Hume-books were extremely expensive both to buy and rent but that it was still insisted that we should do so, for one week of study on each text.",
                "It was excellent.",
                "The course certainly did go fast, and maybe it would be better to slow down some, but I am not sure if that would be possible given the nature of DS. A lot of material is learned, though perhaps not terribly in depth.",
                "I would say that the strengths of the course was its allowance of student debate, the texts, and the writing prompts. These provided for some really excellent intellectual growth on the students part, as well as cultural growth. The debate was paramount and helped me seek the truth in a real way; the texts were fantastic; the prompts demanding and specific.\r\n\r\nFor the texts, I think that it is important that we include Hegel and Wittgenstein, namely by cutting a week of David Hume (the texts kind of repeat themselves) and pairing G.E.M Anscombe's readings with a L. Wittgenstein paper. \r\n\r\nProf. Grimstad was a really fantastic professor; more on this below.",
                "Strengths - Fascinating stuff, great professor, engaged peers. Weaknesses - speed of covering content meant limited depth for each.",
                "I can't think of any weaknesses, but the strengths definitely resided in the quality of discussions and the feedback.",
                "Strengths: great class size and student engagement, great reading materials\r\nWeaknesses: too much material",
                "Sometimes the class discussions veer off topic from the actual content of the texts, but I've learned so much from student and professor contributions in this setting. The essay feedback was always helpful!",
                "The course moves way too fast but that's just DS. But if you're lucky enough to take it with Grimstad, he shaves down the material to what he views as most important, which always ends up allowing students to take away more than they would have if they had to brute force through too much reading."

                "Yes! DS Spring Philosophy provides a perfect introduction to modern philosophy, with an extremely talented, interested group of peers and knowledgeable, passionate faculty members for company. I have been introduced to a vast array of texts central to understanding the development of philosophy since Descartes and have gained insights into how different philosophical schools of thought responded to - and interacted with one another and their contemporary society. I believe the way that the student's knowledge is assessed in the DS Philosophy track in particular (3 papers allowing for in depth, close-reading analysis as well as a final exam testing your conceptual knowledge on vast array of subjects with plenty of freedom of selection) is the best out of any I have yet encountered at Yale.",
                "Absolutely. I learned so much about philosophy and about the world in general.",
                "This course is a great intro to modern philosophy, as I feel philosophy in general should be read in comparison as often thinkers are directly responding to each other.",
                "Absolutely! The challenge this course provided is well-worth any serious humanities students time.",
                "Of course! DRST Philosophy is a must, and a broad philosophical understanding helps all students and human beings interested in the truth, regardless of prospective academic pathway.",
                "Absolutely - Professor Grimstad is incredibly engaging in class, articulate, concise, and insightful. He moderates discussions well and gives well-structured lectures. The course as a whole was a great introduction to philosophical concepts and helped me to deepen my understanding of the world, critique my reality, and analyze religion.",
                "If you want to dive into these raw philosophical texts, and discuss how fundamental thinkers wrestle differently with concepts like morality  this course is for you.",
                "Yes! It is very intellectually stimulating and makes you reflect upon your own philosophies in life.",
                "Yes! This course didn't just teach me to question, it taught me what the right questions to ask were and how exactly to ask them.",
                "Yes absolutely if you're into lofty thinking. Definitely philosophy at Yale plays into the stereotype of sitting in a room and talking about things that will never really influence your life, but boy is it interesting. It's a great way to expand your mind, and at the end of the day, I do find myself thinking about the concepts very regularly as I encounter different situations."
