   "comments": [
    "A strength is that the course was a very small seminar which allowed students to be engaged in discussion about the texts and helped engagement with the topics of the course. A weakness is that sometimes class discussions were overpowered by one student who didn't really give other people a chance to speak.",
    "This course had the potential to be fantastic, but I felt that the overall engagement with the material was low on both the student and faculty ends. The general organization of the course could be dramatically improved to foster more effective dialogue during the seminar. I also feel that students should be allowed to discuss ideas more freely, without having to raise their hands to speak. The seminar felt more like individual conversations between students and the professor than a collective conversation.",
    "Definitely having the last two papers  spaced out more would have been nice and also the final presentations were redundant.",
    "The last two essays were due 3 days apart which was tough but besides that everything was good",
    "The material was very interesting and well taught, but sometimes I think the feedback could have been more useful.",
    "Great feedback and great readings."

    "Yes, What is Life? was a great English 114!",
    "yes",
    "Absolutely - the introductory writing seminars are great for anyone. The \"What is Life\" section in particular is very interesting, yet Professor Tazudeen allows for laid-back discussions, which are both fun and insightful.",
    "Yes, only if they want to learn how to write at Yales level."
