                "Strengths: If you have great classmates, you will have a great discussion. Weakness: Professor was very busy with her child and we had to end class early\/take half hour breaks almost every class. Hopefully this will not be the case next time.",
                "Professor Harris is incredibly thorough in explaining assignments and providing feedback. Her class had a good balance of lecture instruction and student-led presentations that allowed students to freely discuss and bounce ideas off of each other.",
                "strengths: applicable and relevant topic, interesting readings\r\nweakness: course almost completely based on students presenting readings and there is minimal formal lecture from the professor. I feel like a lot more information could have been learned through lectures instead of people presenting on the readings everyone has already read.",
                "The readings were all pretty interesting, and the studies showed interesting findings of the effects of incarceration on individuals from many different angles. Professor Harris was really understanding about class through Zoom, so that was nice. Most of the class is just student presentations, and I'm not sure how helpful that format was.",
                "Strength: The material is super interesting and Prof. Harris is amazing! Prof. Harris created a very thoughtful syllabus. We got to learn a lot about crime and from various lenses, from narrative readings to more empirical\/historical studies.\r\nWeakness: Most of the class is just students presenting. I think it would be more engaging if more time was given towards just discussion instead of students presenting the readings.",
                "i think the format of the class was great especially having breaks in between since the class was quite long. One thing that could be improved would be to maybe incorporate more activities besides presentations in class.",
                "I liked the presentation aspect of the course as a solid way to keep everyone engaged with the content, but a major downside was the length of class. We often found ourselves with too much time than we knew what to deal with in the 3 hours, and I think a 2 hour class would be more than enough.",

All of the readings were insightful and interesting, and Professor harris does a good job of providing background in the first couple of classes. The workload was pretty light (besides the readings), so I would highly recommend!",
