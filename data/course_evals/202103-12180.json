And while I have had exposure to the equations of motion and some of the different force balances we discussed, I came out with a much stronger understanding of them.",
                "I learned about oceanography - large scale thermohaline circulation in the ocean, the smaller scale effects of winds and the rotation of the earth, about the atmosphere and about the ocean. This class is a thorough study of ocean currents and processes."

                "I think the lectures were well structured, especially the second half of the semester when lectures were on the blackboard. I think the major weakness of the course for me was the problem sets. I think a lot of the questions didn't provide enough context to where I didn't know how to approach the question because I didn't know what was really being asked of me. However, once I understood the question, they weren't too bad.",
                "Strengths: the content of the course is interesting, and the curriculum of the course is very thorough in covering the subject. Perfect for a student considering grad school in oceanography or a related topic\r\nWeaknesses: assignments often had different content from what we would learn in class, which made them difficult to complete on their own. Structuring the assignments more like the questions on exams could help us have a better understanding of the material. It could also have been cool to see an interactive demonstration of something we were learning in class, just to make the content come to life."

                "I would recommend this course if youre interested in oceanography and considering grad school in the subject! The class is mostly grad students and youll learn a lot about the topic. Its not an easy course and it can be difficult to understand everything in the assignments and lectures, but the work you put into learning will pay off, especially if you truly are interested in the subject. Taking this course will set you on the path to further study in oceanography or atmospheric sciences."
