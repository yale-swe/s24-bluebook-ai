To name but a few, I have learned how emotions are conceptually defined; what distinguished a \"basic\" emotion (to the extent any such exists) from other emotions; how emotions can be socially functional or dysfunctional; how the academic literature is generally split in two camps, a constructivist and positivist one; and so on so forth.",
                "I learned a lot about emotions and the different factors that can have a big influence in how one expresses and experiences emotions.",
                "I've learned a great deal about the interpersonal aspect of emotions and the consequences it has on our lives. I've learned to write proper social psychology papers, and was able to take part in very thought-provoking and fun conversations with my classmates in this seminar.",
                "I gained basic overview of emotions like their functions, use, and individual differences",
                "I loved deep-diving into specific emotions with Dr. Clark and the class. It really strengthened my critical thinking of emotions and their influences.",
                "Engaged with material on emotions in social contexts with the presupposition that emotions serve some sort of social function! Read and critiqued psychological articles and discussed findings and design in class.",

                "I very much enjoyed the course, including its structure and content. I only have two suggestions for improvement. One is to, if possible, include more graduate students, and to ensure that expectations for graduate students are clearly defined. The second is to make sure to provide feedbackespecially on research ideas and progressalong the way. Again, this is primarily true for graduate students and does not subtract from my overall assessment of the course as excellent.",
                "I think the format of the class was great. The papers and reading responses were nice and not too burdensome.",
                "Absolutely no weaknesses. This course is amazing and Professor Clark is the most caring, welcoming, and kind instructor I've ever met. She manage to create an extremely welcoming and safe environment, and the conversations we had and the insights I derived from them are extremely valuable.",
                "Strengths: Very engaging classes\/topic matter\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was more of a rubric for the essays",
                "Serious strengths of this course are Dr. Clark, and the selection of students from social science majors and the masters programs. Dr. Clark has unparalleled knowledge of existing research regarding social emotions. Some of the best classes, though, were when the entire seminar spoke equally and students unpacked theories and offered new ideas. \r\nMy only thoughts for improving the course might be to have some more interactive activities. It was often (too) easy to sit back and listen without offering comments.",
                "prof. clark is great and our discussions were always really interesting. The workload is a bit high, normal senior seminars will only have one reading response due each week, but this class had two which i felt was a bit much, but overall they were not too bad.",
                "Strengths - very engaging instructor, very interesting seminar topics\r\nWeaknesses - perhaps could be more seminar-style, sometimes class felt like a lecture",
                "I really enjoyed the combination of discussion and lecture of this course. It was interactive without putting too much pressure on each student to be constantly contributing.",
                "Great discussion seminar where I felt very comfortable participating and where Professor Clark was very involved and enabled student discussion. Some improvement could me to change up the structure curriculum so its not the same every time, even though the topics were different the discussions and way of discussing the topics were very similar"

Not only is Professor Clark amazing, the subject matter is incredibly interesting and the course is set up such that each student can have a high level of engagement without an overwhelming workload. By far my favorite class I took this semester, and one of my top three Ive taken as a cognitive science major!",
