                "I learned the details of anticompetitive actions, from cartels and monopolization to horizontal and vertical mergers. I also learned how to blend together law and business, and how to analyze any business action with a critical eye.",
                "I learnt a lot about anticompetitive regulations, and how messed up the world can sometimes be!",
                "So much. Content covered the three types of anticompetitive behaviour: cartels, mergers, and monopolisation. We study each one through legal cases, with some economic theory papers thrown in. It's a very practical, application-centric approach to learning the concepts. We also used R scripts to conduct merger simulations in the same way that DOJ does.\r\nLots of insights about many specific industries (eg. telecom, credit cards, airlines, tech) in which we studied antitrust cases."

                "Great material, great professor. Would be nice to get to know other students earlier, and the final essay seemed a little redundant to the final presentation.",
                "Prof Scott Morton is truly an expert in her field and this course's syllabus is masterfully crafted. You'll learn everything you could possibly want to know about antitrust enforcement at the federal level in a single semester. ECON 339 is my favorite course I've taken at Yale, and Prof Scott Morton is my favorite instructor. She explains even the most complex economic concepts in an easily digestible way. Can't identify a single weakness in the course.",
                "Strengths: Professor is a very engaging lecturer and has so much knowledge and expertise to share based on her professional experience in antitrust. The ability to take a class with SOM and law students is also very cool.\r\nWeakness: the final exam was very stressful because it felt much more abstract than the course materials throughout the semester, and we weren't shown examples of what good answers might look like.",
                "Strengths: Relatively smooth workload (there are no real assignments other than a final project and R problem sets in the first couple of weeks), very interesting lectures, fascinating readings, great diversity of classmates\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "The lectures were very interesting and captivating, but I feel like a section would have been helpful. Sometimes, speaking in front of a 60 person room can be a little intimidating.",
                "Strenghts-- everything. Prof Scott Morton is absolutely awesome: one of the most knowledgeable and engaging lecturers you'll ever have. It's a perfectly structured course, with well-cultivated readings and just the right amount of theory. Another strength were the practical applications, and the multiple guest speakers that described life prosecuting antitrust cases in the real world. \r\nWeaknesses-- literally nothing. This might just have been the perfect course in every respect."

                "Absolutely! Especially if you are interested in the intersection of business and politics.",
                "yes",
                "Absolutely. Antitrust is appearing in the news more often now and it's important to understand the economic and legal foundations behind these cases. The opportunity to take a class with such a diverse group of students (SOM, law, undergrads), many of whom with their own professional experiences, is also super rewarding.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, I'd definitely recommend! It's a relatively smooth elective that teaches you a lot, and helps you look at one of the most important microeconomic issues in a new lens. As long as you do a good portion of the reading for each class, go to lecture in-person, and ask any questions you may have, you'll be sure to get the most out of this class. Prof. Scott Morton is amazing, so you definitely can't go wrong with this class!",
                "yes! it is very interesting and the lectures are a lot of fun.",
                "Yes, yes, yes. Don't be deterred by the 8:30 start, and take this course no matter what. You won't have a better structured course, more interesting readings, or real-world relevant content, and you definitely won't have a better professor than Fiona Scott Morton. Take the course, take the course, take the course."
