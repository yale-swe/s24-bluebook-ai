                "I improved my speaking abilities and feel much more comfortable giving presentations after this course. I improved my ability to write long-form essays in French. I learned much more about the French and Francophone economies and learned a wealth of vocabulary I can use in my future endeavors in the international business world.",
                "I loved this course!!",
                "This course teaches you to engage in contemporary French economics and culture is a critical way.",
                "Knowledge\/skills\/insights: I learned so much about French business culture in a span of a semester. I think the really special thing is, Prof. Tertrain puts both a global lens and a French\/Francophone-specific lens on the topics that we discuss (for example, how French people think of certain French business leaders, etc.). Furthermore, you also learn so much about French labor laws, the history of labor laws, and current events surrounding it. I think its fascinating to see the development of labor laws in France and how they impact the average workers. We also learned about\/discuss French work culture from the point of view of workers as well as leaders. We discuss the corruptions and the social network that drives decision making in French lawmaking and business operations of private companies. Another thing we discusses is unemployment, its cause, and its impact on the French people. This is just a shortlist of what we learn from this class -- every single topic and class is absolutely fascinating\r\nYou also learn to have a great discussion with your classmates in French",
                "Familiarity with many economic-related (everything from retirement to nuclear energy to contract law) current events and controversies in France and the Francophone world.",
                "I learned a lot of French economic vocabulary and generally improved in speaking.",
                "You learn a lot about business and social culture in France and other francophone countries. You heavily expand your vocabulary as well if you put in the time to master it ."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the workload was consistent week to week, I liked that we had to submit what we found most interesting about the material before each class as it helped prompt good discussions in class.\r\n\r\nWeakness: It was difficult watching films that could not be rented online and only existed in physical copy at Sterling library.",
                "The course was great, a great amount of homework and a lot of fun",
                "Strengths: Professor Tertrain, class discussions, the organized course structure, very engaging topics (with Prof. always encouraging us to look at all the viewpoints), very engaging homework (variety of movies, books, dense comic books, articles, documentaries, etc. allow for intaking information on different levels through different mediums -- very helpful for learning and keeps things interesting)\r\nWeakness: No weakness",
                "This was a fantastic course. The documentaries and movies we watched were informative and (for the most part) interesting, class discussions were lively, and feedback on our assignments was quick and comprehensive. The workload was not insignificant (~5 hours per week, more with somewhat regular quizzes and projects), but it almost never felt stressful. No glaring weaknesses come to mind, I would say that sometimes it felt as though we didn't spend much time discussing the readings\/watchings during presentation season, so maybe class could have been structured differently around that time.",
                "The movies and readings are really great. Vocabulary quizzes weren't super helpful.",
                "The class was very engaging, and the material taught was very rich. The main problem was that it is a lot at once. You could easily have three things due in one day. Also you have daily homework regardless if you have a presentation, essay, or in class vocabulary test which really sucked because there were days where I was struggling to put full effort into the daily homework because I had something bigger due."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student as you become much more comfortable speaking and presenting in French and you learn so many new vocabulary words. In addition, the subject matter is very interesting and it is something you don't have the chance to study in other courses at Yale yet it is extremely useful knowledge.",
                "Yes",
                "I would definitely recommend this class if you are tired of all the old French literature.",
                "Absolutely. If you are above L5 French and looking for another French class to take, you have to take this course. Even if you don't think you are super talented in oral-speaking for French, this is a great class for you to improve and the class discussions are helpful for bettering your oral skills. He also teaches Medical French Fren183 -- and I would suggest that, too! (I am nowhere near a premed and even then it was very engaging.)",
                "Definitely. \"Business French\" is a bit of a misnomer, the class is mostly current affairs oriented with a bit of an economic bent but nothing overwhelming. If you are interested in learning more about current affairs in France and the Francophone world, comparing them to life and culture in the US, and practicing your spoken French, take this class. Professor Tertrain is phenomenal, and it was clear that he was genuinely interested in our contributions and learning about our perspectives as people who aren't from France.",
                "Yes, it's a great opportunity to improve as a speaker. The presentations and class discussions are great practice."
