                "French in Action might be somewhat controversial, but it has been very effective. (As I understand it, they are not using French in Action next year, but I thought I should say that anyway.) The real strength of the course, however, is how Professor Ngame supplements the course material, and how the course itself is structured. The only thing I would change is maybe add one or two more opportunities for individual presentations or sketches (we only had two).",
                "Very helpful to begin the course by focusing primarily on learning to speak (and pronounce) the language rather than just jumping into grammar straight away. Weekly oral tests were also very helpful in this.",
                "Resources for the course are easy to access and concepts are not taught too quickly to understand. The biggest drawback from the current form of the course is the Capretz method. While the immersion aspect of the method was valuable, a large part of your engagement in the course depends on your engagement with the story being presented within the Capretz method. I personally did not find any interest in the story of Robert and Mireille, and I felt that my lack of interest in how the course was prevented sometimes began to hinder my learning.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- very extensive and in-depth\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- very high workload, though arguably necessary to learning so much material in a short time span"

                "I had a lot of fun in this course.  We were all bad a French so we were just going for it.  You probably won't like it if you don't actually want to learn french, you'll just be annoyed at the work.  but if you do want to learn then you'll have a good time",
                "Absolutely, as long as you are willing to put in the work. The course is fast paced, and it's easy to get behind on homework assignments, but you learn a LOT, and Professor Ngame is fantastic and makes the learning process fun. Having weekly tests (with a speaking portion) might be daunting, but it forces you to make sure the material is sinking in, and by the end of the course you realize how much you've learned as a result. If you want to learn French, there is no better way. (I really mean that. This is the fourth language I'm learning, and I've already learned more in one semester of French than I learned in several years of English and Spanish through more traditional methodology, i.e. classes twice a week or so, less of a focus on speaking, and no weekly tests.)",
                "Yes! Especially with Professor Ngame, who really puts in the effort to make sure his students understand the material. Don't be put off by the high workload ratingFREN 110 is definitely a course where the harder you work, the better you will get. I thought the workload was definitely manageable in a 4.5 credit semester, since the only \"hard\" requirements for the class throughout the semester were the weekly workbook chapters, the weekly tests and the occasional composition. The tests really make you revise consistently, and by the time the final exam rolls around, you'll be glad you spent time on them. The level of satisfaction you have after learning how to speak, write and understand French in just one semester is amazing.",
                "Yes, if a student is interested in learning how to speak french, I feel this course is an excellent introduction to the rigor it will take to truly become fluent. The intensity of the class matches the expectation that a student would have to achieve proficiency in just 5 semesters.",
                "Yes! Very welcoming and efficient introductory level language class with a great professor!",
                "Yes, this course teaches basic essentials and foundations of French. This class is essential if you want to learn the French language without any prior experience.",
                "Yes, but only to students interested in learning french specifically, given the high workload."
