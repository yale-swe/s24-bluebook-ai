The topics and materials chosen by Prof. Schneider each week were engaging and unique, and our class discussions often involved individual opinions and thoughts that all together broadened my understanding of art both historically and personally. The readings and discussions pushed me out of my comfort zone and gave me new perspectives that I enjoyed experimenting with and implementing into my work for the weekly class response assignments."
