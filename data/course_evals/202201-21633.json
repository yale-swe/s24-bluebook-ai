                "Strengths: you learn how to solve some diff eqs. Weaknesses: 1. class engagement overall was low. After the first class, never more than 10 people would show up to lecture. 2. I think the syllabus can be much more ambitious. I liked the laplace transform stuff we did at the end and wish we could have done more of it. I don't think we needed to spend so much time on first-order and second-order diff eqs. 3. Make homework consistent. We had consistent assignments through the midterm, but after, we only had 2 or 3, when we could have had 4 or 5. More practice is better, especially for this kind of stuff.",
                "Professor Moncrief did a great job of mixing application with theory. Contrary to my preconceptions, this class did not solely involve solving problems without any mathematical understanding of what we were doing. I enjoyed how Professor Moncrief strived to derive each of the techniques we developed rather than just simply telling us how to do them.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness to this class is the length of the exams. Although the content itself is very fair, there were so many problems on the midterm that I found myself racing to finish. I think that Professor Moncrief just needs to get a better grasp on how much time the problems will actually take students.",
                "Strengths: Do feel like I now know how to solve many types of ODEs as well as knowing several key theorems regarding those solutions; The HW was really helpful at solidifying material and providing practice; Midterms were fair  (though not necessarily easy) and representative of the material. Professor always willing to take questions and did seem to genuinely care about students, always being available by email or for OH.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The professor has lecture notes which they essentially write on the board and do not deviate from them nearly at all. Of course, this isn't necessarily a problem, since the lecture notes were okay, but it also led to a not particularly inspiring lecture style. The main weakness is that we so closely follow the textbook that I could have gotten nearly all of the lessons from the course just out of the textbook. Normally this is somewhat true in e.g. Math courses, however, here the lecture notes followed the book so closely most of the time that it really felt like class wasn't adding that much beyond what the book already covered (note it still is helpful to go to class to be able to ask questions or get a second exposure)",
                "A lot of hands-on experience on differential equation solving as well as examples during classes aided learning quite a bit. The lectures were however a bit convoluted.",
                "More time could be spent on Fourier series and Laplace transforms. I feel that these are super useful for many fields and not spending more time on them is a missed opportunity.",
                "The course is pretty straightforward and easy to follow since we progress approximately linearly according to the textbook. The class sometimes felt a little dry and mechanical, mostly because the content of the course involves covering different types of ODEs and techniques we can use to solve them. I do not think this is a problem with the way the course is taught, but more due to the nature of the course content itself.",
                "Awful course. It's a gut for math majors, but no othere redeamable qualities.",
                "Honestly its fine for a math class but the lectures are dry, weekly psets are good",
                "No office hours or peer tutor. Course was incredibly boring and poorly taught",
                "I loved this class! The homework directly reflected the things we learned in the class and the book readings, as did the exams.",
                "It could be improved by allowing psets to be turned in virtually through canvas.",
                "The lectures were a bit dry, and the material could usually be learned by just reading the textbook. Perhaps this can be improved by having more interactive lectures and not just copying notes onto the board from a packet of notes.\r\nThe course was very manageable and accessible for being a higher level math course. \r\nProblem sets and exams were fair. I feel as if the laid back attitude of the course helped to facilitate my learning better"

If those aren't your goals then I would council against this course: You could learn the main techniques very quickly just by reading the relevant chapters of the textbook, and it isn't some really inspirational course or anything like that, it really is just being told (and proving) how to solve certain types of ODEs, and then just doing that repeatedly.",

Lectures are boring and unnecessary, I only went to like three of them and you can teach yourself very easily from the textbook as you do the psets. Sometimes the psets are insanely long. In class open note midterm and take home final are nice though.",
