You learn about the pandemics in the early modern period and how they affected all aspects of life including religion, culture, the persecution of the Jews, the medical world, the literary world and much more.  It was really interesting to draw similarities and differences between earlier pandemics and 2020.",
                "I learned a lot about the study of history itself, how historians have struggled with answering the same questions for decades. Especially concerning the Bubonic Plague, there are a lot of instances of conflicting or missing information, so it was enlightening to see how, as historians, we must both address but also work around gaps to provide logical answers to important questions. I learned a lot not only about the Bubonic Plague specifically but also how natural events and broad demographic changes can impact history and society."

                "This was the first seminar I have ever taken where I did not want to die after an hour and fifty minutes. It was a good class that had interesting discussion point and I learned a lot. I wish the professor gave more feedback when reviewing papers, and in general more instruction for each paper, though it was fairly informal compared to many history classes.",
                "Great course. No weaknesses",
                "The small class size was really great for discussion and Professor Sahlins led the seminars well.  We had three writing assignments and that was definitely manageable, but some weeks I felt like there was too much reading to really dive into the historians' arguments (which were interesting, but often complicated).  As all discussion in class was based off the readings for that week, I think it might have been better to have less reading and more in-depth discussion on fewer articles.",
                "One of the strengths of the course was the small class size which allowed (and helped to encourage) students to engage with material and also talk directly with Professor Sahlins. The readings of the course were extensive and covered much of the literature surrounding the subject of plague from a variety of different angles. The class' focus on the readings' arguments and their implications both helped ground our discussion in real evidence (which sometimes seems to be lacking in larger survey courses where a general textbook often provides both information and a narrative) and made me feel like I was really engaging in discussion and dialogue with the often competing arguments of the historians we encountered.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course might be the structure of the assignments (besides the open final paper). The earlier essays were focused on close readings of specific texts that restricted the extent of analysis students could offer about the implications and importance of an event to the evidence provided in that text. I also was not a huge fan of the section on the Epidemiology of the Bubonic Plague which, although perhaps necessary, was a bit dry from non-STEM perspective."

Professor Sahlins challenges you but is also understanding and always willing to meet outside of class to discuss the readings or papers.  I found the course definitely challenged me more than other history classes I've taken at Yale, but I also felt like I learnt a huge amount, as well as improved my fast reading, research and writing skills.",
