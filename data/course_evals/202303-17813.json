However, this class has definitely taught me to manage stress levels and taught me the basics of working in a lab.",

The major weakness of this course was how disorganized and unclear the instructions were, which often brought confusion of lab execution and writing about the lab in the lab notebook or report.",
                "Stengths: I liked the pace of the course. Because it is known to be an introductory bio lab, Prof Moreno always waited to make sure everyone was on the same page before moving on.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lab reports took way too much time. I would easily spend 12 hours on one lab report, but to be fair, she does give you 2 weeks to complete it. I just think that given the work load and the time spent in class, the class should be worth 1 credit and not 0.5.",

                "Strengths: We received helpful feedback on assignments and useful guides for reports. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the labs were quite lengthy and we sometimes left without a strong understanding of them.",
                "Strengths: I loved every lab session we did, especially the ones involving model organisms such as C. elegans and zebrafish. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course felt a little confusing at times, where instructions for certain assignments (e.g. lab reports and notebook checks) felt a little dense and unclear",
                "I think that in the beginning, the lab portion was a little confusing (it seemed more like I was just following a set of instructions) and I didn't understand how to do the lab reports. However, it was very engaging and I learned a lot as the semester went on.",
