    "critical observation",
    "Great class! Learned to look critically at the urban landscape and to start noticing certain details. I'm leaving this class with a broad knowledge of urban issues, with an application of them in a New Haven context. Every class was, though long, very interesting and fruitful.",
    "I absolutely loved this course. It gave me a much greater appreciation for New Haven. I discovered so many new areas, on and off campus, that I never knew of before and I am excited to keep exploring. It also helped me learn how to read the landscape, how the past interacts with the present and future.",
    "Learned how to understand the spatial form and history of a city through direct observation. Built skills to present select sites in a city within the framework of a tour. Combined direct observation (\"reading the city\") with archival work to paint a picture about how a city functions. Honed my observational skills as well as field-based note taking.",
    "This brilliant gem of a professor does not just teach how to read books and think about architecture but literally teaches students how to look at the world with new eyes. Guided by prof Rubin, we learn how to see history in every detail of a building, to tease out the stories of human struggle and interaction in a street corner, to feel the pulse of a city in the seams and edges of urban life. Take this course and learn how to read the city like a constantly unfurling text, authored by residents from all walks of life, mingling across historical ages.",
    "I learned so much about the city of New Haven.  I also learned a lot about how to \"read\" cities in general, and how to see in a landscape the traces of a lot of overarching themes of urbanism in America.",
    "How to look at and learn about New Haven in a much more active way than from within a classroom. By going out into different neighborhoods, talking to community members and organizers, and trying to burst our own Yale bubble, I gained a real appreciation for this city and its rich history, as well as realized that urbanism initiatives in the past have such tangible results today. Whether through highways, shopping areas, parks, zoning codes, laws and protests, etc, city planning affects people's everyday lives. The skills learned in this class how to analyze an urban landscape without projecting your own biases and experiences onto it are going to be helpful in the future as I navigate my own city and the cities I may travel to.",
    "I fell in love with New Haven",
    "I learned a lot about the history of the city of New Haven from a variety of different lenses and gleaned several thoughtful ways to engage with the city in an academic way.",
    "I absolutely loved this class. I appreciated getting to think about politics and style, social issues and economic ones, all in conjunction while on my feet! The loved experience provided by the course was one of a kind.",
    "Urban Field Geography was a great survey of the urban and social histories of New Haven. We got valuable experience analyzing the city scape and insight from local stakeholders in various parts of New Haven."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "great instructor, engaging seminars",
    "Strengths: \r\n- Elihu is a treasure; he really makes this class. \r\n- The fluid structure of the syllabus; it was great to adjust deadlines to the class's needs and to edit content as we\/Elihu saw fit.\r\n- The soft deadlines for the weekly field notes were also great!",
    "This course was extremely engaging and I especially liked when on our tours we met with different members of the community. One weakness was the weather. As it became colder and colder outside, 3 hours of walking outside was a little hard to dress for.",
    "Strengths: Extremely innovative way to run a course (outside of a classroom, within the fabric of the city we are actually studying); built my understanding of New Haven which I believe is very important for Yale studentswe should know things exist beyond the university; Elihu is incredibly knowledgable and passionate (if you've had him for Arch 280, you know exactly what I'm talking about); assignments were interesting, fun, and allowed for lots of creativity.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses (take these with a grain of salt because this was the first year of the course): Sometimes disorganizedwe sometimes did not finish our entire planned walking tour because Elihu misjudged the amount of time it would take us; I wish there had been more explicit exercises about reading the city (I think lots of our walks implied we would be doing this, and we did have field notes assignments every week, but I would have liked to see more things like what we did on the first day, which was to walk just one block and then talk about what we observed).\r\n\r\nThis class is outdoors! Sometimes it gets really cold! Just know this.",
    "The major strength of this course is the professor. You can feel the passion he has for the material as you walk through the city, learning new things at every turn.\r\nThe occasional sit-down class to discuss an assigned reading might be useful, but not at the expense of time in the field.",
    "This course was incredible.  Elihu is such a great professor -- he combined his own interesting ideas with true engagement with and investment in each of his students.\r\nThe format of walking around outside for 3 hours each week could've been prohibitive to some people, though.  It's tough because this class was kind of built around seeing the city on foot, and in many ways it's the best way to see a city, and it's also the fault of urbanism itself being exclusionary and not the course itself, per se, but it was kind of concerning how ableist the existence of this course is.  Even on a less extreme scale as people with disabilities not being able to participate at all, the fact of having to be in good health in order to participate was kind of an obstacle at times.  I can imagine people with various sorts of health barriers (asthma, diabetes, etc.) or just physical injuries (shin splints from track practice) having trouble participate in this course.  Even just regular illnesses where it would probably be okay to attend a normal class, I felt I had to skip this one because I wasn't sure that I could make it three hours walking around outside.\r\nAlso, there was little to no engagement with the readings.  Which meant that there was little to no motivation to actually do the readings.  Which was sad, because they were really interesting readings.  But when it doesn't feel like they're required, it's easy for them to sink to the bottom of the list of academic priorities.",
    "This was the first year a class like this was offered to Yale College, and so its strengths and weaknesses are very unique. The class is a lot of walking and a lot of hours, even though it meets once a week. It is during the Fall and this year we had classes on way more good weather days than bad, so I think keeping it in the Fall is smart because the Spring semester is cold for most of the time we'd be in the field. I loved the kind of freeform, unpredictable nature of some of our walks, where interactions with strangers in the area turned really informative (I think that's the whole point of urbanism, to learn from the people living and working around you), but having some planned stops for some of the longer walks is a good idea because we get that interaction while continuing along our journey; it's definitely easy to get sidetracked without that planning and the class is already long. Elihu also did a good job of taking feedback throughout the semester, improving the class based on what students said and how he felt. The Architecture and Urban Studies majors are getting more popular so it may be difficult to limit the class size, but it did seem too big to me, especially in terms of how we took up the street as a walking group. But a real range of majors were in the class and everyone brought a unique perspective which was great!",
    "This course was extremely interesting and well-designed. The size of the class felt about right, and it was great to have a variety of guest guides who contributed valuable insights. The weekly field notes were also an effective way for the class to reflect and stay on track. Although the structure of the assignments changed from what was written on the syllabus, it still felt like we were gradually building up to the final project, and the pace was great for me. In terms of improvements, I would suggest building into the syllabus 1-2 formal meetings with Professor Rubin to make sure our final projects are appropriate, so we can make changes earlier on. It would also be great to have more discussion time as a class - some weeks, I felt that there was so much material to cover that there wasn't a lot of time to hear each other's thoughts. Overall, an outstanding class.",
    "If yale provided the class with a shuttle to and from our meeting locations, since theyre sometimes ~30 mins from Rudolph, we could have more in class time.",
    "It was experimental in a good way, it left a lot of room for growth in both the students and instructor side. I felt like my input was appreciated",
    "Loved the structure of the course - though sometimes the classes felt a little long, we saw so much of the city and heard from so many different voices in the community about the culture and development of New Haven.",
    "I loved meeting people and seeing buildings and structures-- the more walking, the merrier! I must profess that I stopped doing the readings pretty early, and think that, along with field notes, a reading response would have been a helpful accountability measure. Otherwise a true pleasure of a course, and I learned a lot!",
    "This was a very fun class. Tours were long and sometimes cold, but the conversation and pure marvel of being out in the world for class inhanced my curiosity for the material. At times the conversation felt surface level, or evasive of actual politics, but overall this course was a great start to what I think could be a much more intentional curriculum if it took on a political perspective."

   "comments": [
    "yes!",
    "Yes!!! It is about 3+ hours of walking every week, but you do learn a lot. Take this class especially if you are interested in learning about New Haven, which has a super rich urban landscape and history that you might never otherwise experience or learn about in the Yale bubble.",
    "Definitely. I would recommend it to both urban studies majors but also anyone who is interested in learning more about New Haven.",
    "Yes!!! A very interesting course for urban studies. I believe it's crucial that students understand New Haven and know how to work in the fieldI wish Yale would explore adding more courses like this, or at least adding elements of it to other courses. Elihu is a fantastic professor and has so many connections to knowledgable people in the city who often were guests during classnewspaper reporters, library branch managers, ex-alderman, etc. etc. Definitely a great addition to an urban studies\/architecture major.",
    "Yes, very interesting, enjoyable and good topic. Helps students learn more about our city.",
    "I would recommend this course in a heartbeat. We live in an age when we fail to find time to stop and look around. But this course is an antidote to the blase outlook and the obliviousness of our times. Here, you learn to take a city like New Haven and see a thousand micro-histories and stories pulsing with the vibrancy of human life. Rubin is a magician who turns everyday urbanism into a source of awe and wonder. Just walk along Grand Avenue with this professor and you will learn to appreciate humanity in all its simple wonder.",
    "Yes! Take this course! It was such a wonderful way to learn more about the city of New Haven, and about urbanism in general.  All of the assignments felt incredibly worthwhile and rewarding.  Elihu is one of the most wonderful professors I've worked with.  I wish that there were more thought dedicated to how to make this course more inclusionary to people with various disabilities, illnesses, injuries, or other obstacles that might prevent them from being able to walk around a city for 3 hours.",
    "YES! If you like cities, architecture, history, people, urbanism, Elihu Rubin, walking instead of sitting in class, etc. this is a great class to take.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was the best course I have taken at Yale.",
    "This is one of the best classes Ive ever taken at yale, and I hugely recommend that anyone even slightly interested in urbanism and\/or New Haven take it!",
    "Yes!! You learn more about the city than you would in just a classroom",
    "Yes!! Elihu is hands down one of the Architecture school's greatest professors - he clearly gives a lot of thought towards how best to approach our engagement with the city as 'Yalies' and is so passionate about facilitating his students' research. Our weekly walks brought us to all corners of the city and led us to discussions about all different aspects of urban development. The final project, a pamphlet for a tour of New Haven based on a theme of your choosing, was spread out over the course of several weeks (and several smaller progress assignments) which just made it that much more enjoyable and fun to create.",
    "Oh, I have already recommended it to most people that I know. Elihu is amazing and a class taken on your feet is urbanism at its finest and most quintessential. Think Dead Poet's Society, I'd say!"
