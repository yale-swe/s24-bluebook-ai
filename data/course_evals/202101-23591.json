This course really challenged my ways of thinking and taught me so wonderful new things.",

Most importantly, I learned how important it is to not just consider science as just as an objective field, but as a field with nuance. It is what we, as humans, make it out to be.",
                "I learned about science fiction, narratives and paradigms in science, and different ways that people have told stories about science. I read and watched widely across short stories, novels, plays, academic texts, and films. This was a thoroughly interdisciplinary and inter-media class, so I got practice in analysis and synthesis across genres and media.",

I engaged in interesting conversations on topics such as communication, humanity, and the use and misuse of science. I improved my writing skills."

Although the format for the final paper was very flexible, I would have liked if it were a paper assignment. Or, just having another paper or two for the course would be great for practicing writing.",
                "The topic of the class is wonderful: it attracted students with all sorts of backgrounds and interests, and the discussions we had in class were better for it. The wide variety of texts was also a strength: I think everyone found something new, something interesting, something challenging in the syllabus throughout the semester. I think the organization of the class could be improved: because it is a wide range of material, it sometimes felt like some weeks didn't connect as well as they could have, while links between other weeks were really strong.",
                "The professors are a lot of fun, and lead some really wonderful conversations. They obviously have put a lot of care into the syllabus and into developing course materials, as the texts that we were asked to read were universally engaging and interesting. Occasionally, we were asked to read an entire book in preparation, which always seemed a little bit too much reading for one week. However, most weeks the readings were interesting and manageable. The writing portion of this class was super manageable - one 5 page paper on a scientific object, one ~6000 word annotated bibliography, and one final 10-12 page research paper. I had a lot of fun completing these assignments."

                "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in the interplay of science and narrative. I already expected to find the materials and the discussions interesting, but I was surprised with how deeply engaged I was and how surprising I found the new ideas that I was exposed to. This is a great writing credit for a STEM student - I was able to primarily write about my courses of study, critically engaging with topics which I already had great interest in. For those who are writing-weary, this course is fairly low-workload.",
                "Definitely! It was great to have weekly discussions about the reading from people who come from very different academic backgrounds. The discussions never disappointed and were always stimulating! (I am a STEM major)"
