   "comments": [
    "I learned so much about the ways that different cultures convey the sacred",
    "Great but hard class. Survey HSAR classes even if they are intro can be difficult just because it's so hard to keep track of the whole timeline with every class doing a different thing. Still absolutely loved the class though. Very well taught and the sections and lectures interwove beautifully. Learned so much, despite there being a decent amount of work, but can't complain.",
    "A survey of global religions and how they express notions of divinity through art bad architecture.",
    "Skills and knowledge about analyzing and appreciating scared art and architecture on our own by close observation and reading",
    "I learned how to focus my writing on formal analysis of the pieces that we discussed. I also learned a great foundational understanding of a wide breath of religions around the world and how sacrality can exist outside of a religious context.",
    "As a survey course, we didn't delve deeply into any one specific religion very much, but I learned a lot about commonalities and key aspects of each religion's artistic representation. My visual analysis skills also grew.",
    "This course was a survey course that explored religious and sacred art, architecture, and places throughout the world. I learned basic art history terminology and also learned how to analytically approach works of art based on physical appearance. This course involved weekly sections at the Yale Art Gallery, where students analyzed pieces of art with the help of a TF. We explored the different features that separate the profane and the sacred, and learned about different examples of art and architecture from a variety of cultures.",
    "I learned about so many incredible sites around the world and also a lot about their corresponding religions.",
    "This course gave me a deeper understanding of the various ways different cultures depict the sacred through art and architecture and the trends that tie cultures together across the world.",
    "This class looked at what \"the sacred\" means, and how it manifests in many forms of art. The material covered a great span of cultures and time, from ancient Egypt to the 9\/11 memorials. It was a good intro course that included close-looking, visual analysis essays, and also a fun analysis of a sacred space."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course covered a global scale of art, taking a look at the patterns and differences that emerge in the cultures creation of sacred art. By taking this (somewhat) nonlinear approach, the larger picture emerges in a clearer way. Each lecture builds off the other.",
    "strength: sections! I loved the sections at the YUAG. And Professor Jung is an amazing lecturer. \r\nweakness: none!",
    "Strengths were prof jung and TA Gavi. both so great at what they did. Course material was well planned out and lectures and sections never missed a beat.",
    "The course material was sufficiently wide and deep to offer a solid understanding of the various religions studied. Access to YUAG was a real highlight.",
    "Amazing selections of art and architecture pieces of wide varieties and different natures to look at\r\n\r\nCould be more focused in the sense that we closely look at fewer places or if there is a time frame to give the structure some more boundaries",
    "Though the artworks discussed are not presented in order, I found the thematic teachings allowed for easier understanding of the works on their larger scales.",
    "The subject matter and lecture style of the course were very interesting. I always enjoyed lecture and the heavy emphasis on visuals. Section in the YUAG was also really great because we could see concrete examples of what we were learning. My one complaint was that it felt a little disorganized in terms of the essays and the exams--a rubric for the essays would have been nice, or sample essays. Additionally,  the exams kind of felt like the point was to just write as much as possible that we could memorize from lecture, rather than applying that knowledge. It essentially favored students that could write fast.",
    "The course lectures were clear and focused on using images to talk about pieces of art and architecture. Having section was helpful in honing my eye in examining works of art. I feel like having longer lectures might have been helpful, since it felt like we would cram a lot of information into our 50-minute lecture. However, the majority of lectures ran smoothly and finished on time.",
    "I loved how thoroughly Professor Jung went into each site and talked not only about the artistic elements but the spiritual and cultural elements as well.",
    "I really liked how this course was structured around the concepts, not chronologically. This made it much more interesting and gave it more of a natural flow. I also really enjoyed the discussion sections, as they provided us with the opportunity to think creatively about art studied in class. My one critique would be that sometimes the reading seemed a bit dull and excessive, going into much greater depth than what was actually needed for the class.",
    "One of the strengths was the breadth of material and the quick pace of the class. I never felt bored because each lecture was a new, fascinating, and well thought-out topic. Another strength were the sections in the YUAG. They were intimate and engaging, and it was amazing seeing objects from the cultures we studied in class. The class was also very organized, and the workload was manageable. There are few weaknesses of the course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! This course does an excellent job at revealing the overarching patterns in sacred art throughout time. The lectures are clear and structured - it is obvious Professor Jung cares greatly about what she is teaching. Incredibly interesting, respectful, and beautiful, the course made me feel a greater connection to our predecessors.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I came into the course with absolutely no knowledge of art history, so the first half of the course was quite difficult, as I didn't really understand what was expected in terms of the midterm exam and paper. However, Professor Jung and the TFs very clearly care a lot about the subject material, and that helped me improve a lot in the second half of the course. That being said, the course is a fair amount of work: two 5-6 page papers (one of which was due a few days before the midterm exam), a midterm exam, and a final exam.",
    "YES! I thought this class was beautifully taught and captures important material that everyone should be familiar with.",
    "Yes. Really good survey class and intro to HSAR in a different way from normal notions of painting. Focus is on sculpture and architectural figures in the sacred environment and was very different from any class i've ever taken.",
    "Yes it was very interesting and a good introductory art history course that awakens a globally attuned artistic empathy.",
    "YesAn amazing course if anyone wants to begin their journey of art history with amazing and detailed lectures and discussion sections offered",
    "Definitely, I loved this course wholeheartedly. It was a fun and intriguing introduction to the realm of History of Art, especially with such a niche overarching theme of sacrality in art.",
    "Yes! The subject matter was very interesting and I think it is a great class to gauge your interest in art history.",
    "I highly recommend this course. This was the first art history course I ever took, and it taught me a lot about how humans create images and buildings of sacrality in a world grounded by reality. It also gave me an introduction on how to view objectively view art without bringing in context or history, and helped me learn how to analyze objects. If you are trying to find an introductory art history course that explores different cultures throughout the world, then you should definitely consider taking this course. Prof. Jung brings in a variety of examples throughout the world, purposefully making sure to not limit the examples to Western culture. I immensely enjoyed taking this class and would recommend it to any student.",
    "Yes I would! The material is incredibly interesting and Professor Jung is very engaging.",
    "Yes if you are interested in art history! Professor Jung is a great lecturer and the material is relevant",
    "Yes, even though I am not planning on majoring in art history, it was still interesting to explore the artisitic connections between cultures worldwide. The readings were a bit dull at times, but it was the broad concepts that I appreciated about this course, not the nitty gritty details of the reading.",
    "Yes! I'd recommend it to any major, as it was a great intro course with a wide breadth of material. It made me think about the sacred in a very different way, and now I notice sacred spaces and objects around me in a different light.",
    "If you have an interest in a variety of cultures and their art, then I would take this class. The content is interesting and this class will effectively give you a brief idea of the art and architecture of select places around the globe."
