Because it is kind of a survey course, it is difficult to get into true depth; but that is more a factor of limited time than anything else. Dr. Machava was fantastic.",

I have two small criticisms: we read a good number of wall street journal articles which did not feel very helpful for the material of the class, I would have preferred more of the scholarly works. Second, I think I would have preferred either a longer final exam or longer final paper rather than a shorter version of both."
