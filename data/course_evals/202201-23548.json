                "The topic is a bit too hard for undergrads, so he taught it in a pretty superficial level.",
                "He is a very nice professor and clearly knows a lot, but the class was not very structured, and I'm not sure how the topics taught in class really applied to whatever field.",
                "Strength: not a lot of work load\r\nWeakness: not a lot of people understood what's going on in the class",
                "Strengths: Good overview about recent topics in electrical engineering research that could be helpful for those who are interested in conducting independent research. Very low workload and chill professor. Weaknesses: What one learns from the class entirely depends on what one puts in. There are only five homework assignments and one oral exam, so those who lack motivation to actually learn something from the class will probably end up learning very little. This may be a plus or minus depending on what one expects to get out of the class."

The course has almost no work, so the reservation is not about the difficulty of the coursework. Rather, I believe one would get very little out of the course without appropriate background and real motivation."
