I feel like the course could be improved by giving students slightly more guidance when it comes to some of the homeworks because many of the concepts were totally unfamiliar.",

                "The course was well paced and there was a lot of content but it felt approachable. The OverTheWire challenges, where you \"hack\" a publicly available server or website, were fun and also taught me a lot in terms of \"practical\" security experience.",
                "This is a very interesting course and it covers a lot of content. That's a big strength. Sometimes it was hard for the professor to cover all the material presented in one lecture. If anything, there was so much to learn, we didn't end up covering it all, or glossed over things quickly. All that said, it's a very good course. One of the only courses I've ever taken where I looked forward to doing the problem sets, they are very fun.",
                "too much theoretical material and to less practice",
                "The topics we learnt were very interesting and practical in the real world.",
                "This course suffers immensely from fixation on irrelevant and tiny details, while not having the infrastructure to genuinely facilitate learning. One lecture, we spent 30-40 minutes talking about the different types of domain squatting, even though as soon as the slide listing an example for each was on the board, everyone knew exactly what each type referred to. Nearly all the psets are online challenges not curated for our class, so they feel wildly disjuncted with what we're learning and force students to basically look up guides because we didn't know php or sql. It takes a lot of work to create a class, but unfortunately in this case it is time to go back to the drawing board and rebuild with a focus on more technical learning and examples in class, and more curated psets that follow class material more closely.",
                "Final Project was enjoyable and the options were fun to select from. Pretty low stress. The check-in meeting was helpful. \r\n\r\nWould have appreciated more canvas reminders about the quizzes. It's actually pretty costly to your grade to miss one or two. \r\n\r\nFinal exam was substantially harder than the midterm.\r\n\r\nSome lectures were a lot better than the others, like the domain security lectures were more engaging than the rest. It was a little too easy to zone out, most of the time.",
                "The class was very well taught and the material was interesting, but the homeworks were sometimes difficult because you needed a much better understanding of the material than it was possible to get from just the lectures."

This class isn't overly difficult, but there were many moments where I felt like I was learning nothing from the course that I couldn't have learned from a YouTube video going over high level concepts. My advice take a CS elective that actually improves your skills.",

Computer security is an important topic to be familiar with, especially if you go into software engineering or build your own projects, and this course provides a pretty comprehensive introduction to the topic. It would help to take the application security unit of this course after or at the same time as CS323 since it involves understanding assembly code.",
                "Yes, I definitely recommend this course. The problem sets are extremely fun, and the content is very interesting. If anything, it should be split into two different courses to cover more material. Definitely take this course, I highly recommend it.",
                "Yes",
                "No the homework is unreasonably hard and not explained well in class. There were very few examples showing how to do the tasks in the homework",
                "Yes.",
                "Do not take this course. It is severely lacking in technical details and the psets are not aligned with in-class material very well. The quizzes and tests are also built on a lot of trivia-like knowledge from class as opposed to concepts, techniques, or explicitly taught technical skills. You really don't learn much in this class which is a shame because it could be fascinating.",
                "Only if you have a prior interest in security or hope to focus on it for your career. I thought it might be cool to have some general \"hacker\" knowledge, but the material is at times too broad to feel useful or too specific to be interesting unless you're obsessed with the topic. Shop the class to get a feel for how engaged you are, the first week. It's a pretty good indicator of how the rest of the semester will go. It's easy to do well on homeworks and quizzes, if you don't miss them, but the final exam is hard. Not the easiest A.",
                "Definitely. This was a very interesting class and not a huge work suck. If you are looking for an interesting CS elective to take, I would definitely recommend this."
