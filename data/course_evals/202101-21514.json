                "The psets are decent for learning the topic but use weird numbers for no reason",
                "I withdrew from this course before the third and final midterm. Part of this is my own fault as I didn't keep up with the weeks and attempted to re-watch lectures instead of go to them live and ask questions. I also didn't find a study group (being off campus). But I also think this course is poorly organized and didn't prepare students well to be successful. The videos to watch before class were usually very long, and then lectures also went over. As someone who was able to easily engage with Math 120, I thought Math 222 was very confusing. Answers were never posted for PSETs, so you couldn't tell what you did wrong or right. TAs also couldn't check your answers to help you. In the beginning, study guides didn't have answers either. TAs and Peer Tutors were hit or miss. For people taking this course, I recommend following MIT Courseware, 3Blue1Brown, and Khan Academy (I learned about these resources too late), but I think their explanations were more clear on most topics.",
                "Strenghts: The course material was relevant, the problem sets were reasonable and a good test of knowledge, having minimum cut offs was nice (for ex. 90%+ guarantees an A)\r\nWeaknesses: The exams were unnecessarily time consuming given the time constraints. They weren't even hard, given how I knew how to solve everything. I could just never finish them. This was frustrating because the exams ended up becoming a test of how fast you can multiply matrices rather than how well you understand the concepts. In a world where matrices can just be multiplied using a calculator and understanding concepts is more important, the exams were not reasonable. Another weakness of the course was the extra credit problem set. There was no mention of an extra credit problem set in the syllabus. It was suddenly introduced in the last week of classes and made due during reading week. When many of us are juggling finals, it was a huge inconvenience to have a problem set due that is equivalent in weightage to a midterm, especially when we weren't told about it in advance and couldn't plan for it. Given the really high weightage of the problem set, anyone who didn't turn it in would suffer with a bad grade. Additionally, it was annoying how the last problem in this pset was a coding question. It is not necessary that people in a math class know how to code, so it didn't make sense to ask people to code when the course didn't teach anything about coding. I also didn't understand why problem set solutions and practice midterm solutions were never posted - this was a huge drawback for me.",
                "The recorded lectures definitely helped by allowing us to learn at our own pace and time.",
                "The videos took a horrendous amount of time to watch, given that 2 out of 3 professors often typed their notes before they recorded the video, so you needed to pause the video every 10 seconds to copy down the large amounts of text that would appear. The videos did not give enough detail or provide useful examples to apply to the problem sets or midterms. The notes were extremely poor preparation for the problem sets and midterms. I found the internet to be more useful for solving problems than the notes were.",
                "Strengths: Interesting material, not harsh grading (a bit lenient in fact?), accessible Peer Tutors, fun textbook\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The professors are smart but dull (Taylor is an exception, she's fun). Even if Linear Algebra is quite interesting and applicable, I doubt the professors would have made me enjoy it one bit (Thanks Khan Academy for the amazing 144 videos!) The recorded lectures hardly focused on conceptualizing the lesson or motivating what we learned--they often gave \"definitions\", \"claims\" or dry \"proofs\" making it hard to understand let alone appreciate L.A. for first-timers (Taylor, again, is an exception). Of course, I qualified this with an \"often\" because there were some superior lectures with clear presentations (but this wasn't the norm). Another HUGE weakness is the fact that the profs. don't provide Practice Exams as they did in MATH 120. It's just weird and senseless to just give out, during exam season, \"practice questions that do not parallel the exam's length or difficulty\"! If it was possible in MATH 120, I don't see why it's impossible in MATH 222. Finally, Strang's textbook is great but I'd suggest a different version of his book (\"Intro to Linear Algebra\") as opposed to L.A. With Applications because the former has a LOT of solid practice problems and even clearer applications.",
                "Weakness was organization -- I didn't have access to the other classes notes even though they were all available. Answer keys and exam review was not sent out until right a day or two before the exam. It felt like the content we would learn in class was disconnected from what we learned in the videos. A strength of the course could be the psets. They were pretty difficult, but were my main way of learning the material.",
                "The biggest strength of this course was its use of pre-recorded content to teach the content, and then review and dive deep into this content in the lecture. This allowed for the students to pause and re-watch vital or difficult content, allowing for a greater understanding of the class. \r\n\r\nOne of the biggest weaknesses of this course was its lack of content for exam review. I simply wish we had previous years' exams to study with, as going into the exam, we had no sense of how long / how many problems the exam would be.",
                "The recorded lectures were thorough and time-consuming, especially since I wanted to take good notes on them; I often found myself slightly behind in catching up on video lectures. Watching the professor work through concepts and examples in live classes was helpful, even if I did not always have the opportunity to watch the corresponding video first.",
                "The course was a good pace and I liked the three non-cumulative tests.",

The 3 instructors took turns recording the videos which meant that every week there was a new lecture style and notation for the material. This was confusing. The in class lectures were very helpful and it was nice to have time to ask questions on the material and get more practice. The homeworks were challenging but manageable if you went to office hours. They did have some errors in the homeworks so hopefully those will be fixed by next semester.",

I would not have covered the breadth of info treated in MATH 222 had I opted for the former proof-based class (much more suited for math majors imo!) But I have a huge caveat: don't depend on the profs./class to learn the concepts. Watch the 144-video-playlist on Khan Academy over the summer/Winter Break and the short 3Blue1Brown L.A. playlist on YouTube--that will give you enough time to absorb the abstract and not-uncomplicated (sorry for the double negative) topics in Linear Algebra. Plus, you'll safely focus on doing practice problems during exam season as opposed to worrying about \"getting this new hard concept.\" And if you attend Peer Tutor/Discussion Section sessions (which I recommend!), you'll not feel brain-dead as the TA/ULA/PT is trying to explain the class concepts (as some people used to feel, myself included, at times!). In a nutshell: Take it after you know it--if you need it.",
