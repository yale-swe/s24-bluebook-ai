This course has sharpened my analytical skills and provided me with a thorough trajectory of the different perspectives on the concept of space.",
                "Definitely learned a lot about architectural theory, but also how to apply philosophical modes of thought to the study of art history -- which is an immensely useful skill.",
                "This course explored interpretations and discussions of the concept of space at the intersection of art history, critical theory, and philosophy. We began with philosophical foundations on definitions of space, which were threaded as recurring themes throughout our discussions of space in practice--namely, in architecture and art. I learned not only about different methods of conceptualizing space, but also about applying these frameworks to concrete contexts. Thinking spatially and about space's significance provides a rich lens through which to interpret art, architecture, and daily activities.",
                "This course is one of the most interesting courses I have taken at Yale. While I am not an art or architecture major, this course has given me insights into how to visualize and understand what space means. It gave me the skills to question why our surrounding spaces are the way they are and what impact it has on our lives. I am not exaggerating when I say that when I walk down the street or enter a building, I feel differently about the space and more cognizant about my surroundings. Professor Buckley does a great job trying to convey these themes and questions that let us challenge our conceptions of space."

                "A strength of the course is definitely in Professor Buckley who is extremely insightful. The way he talks about complicated readings and concepts make it easy to understand and digest. Every seminar was interesting and it was fun to engage in discussion since he posed very thought-provoking questions. Readings were also interesting and there was a good mix of different types of reading (philosophical, historical, architectural, etc.). I also think the class transitioned to online learning very well and was conducive to online leaning because the small seminar allowed me to stay engaged throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nOne weakness might be how some of the philosophical readings were very difficult to understand so some background or a synopsis of it prior to reading would have been helpful. The overview was always given in the next class, but maybe getting some background in the previous class would have been helpful.",
                "This is a very strong class. It shapes the ideas of space. In my opinion it should also be a part of the regular YSoA courses for architecture students.",
                "strengths: interesting weekly topics, thought provoking assignments. \r\nweaknesses: honestly none. I loved this class and thought it was very well designed and executed.",
                "The texts and discussions were incredibly interesting every week. Each presented new and interesting perspectives. We did journaling exercises frequently in class, which I found incredibly helpful to thinking through ideas and contributing to discussion on weighty topics.\r\nWhile I liked that student presentations could guide discussions each week, I think I might also have benefited from more structured guidance with the readings. They were often long, dense pieces, which while interesting, could become a bit tedious without guidance. At the same time, though, I think Prof. Buckley's MO of encouraging students to take charge of the discussion created a comfortable environment for everyone to participate as they felt comfortable.",
                "Great content. Quality peers (I found, luckily.) Engaging material. You make it what you want.",
                "The course is constructed very well with a well-designed syllabus. Furthermore, the readings are not too difficult or too long to tackle. To improve the engagement during the seminars (which I believe was somewhat limited due to the virtual format) I would recommend that both the professor and students talk about examples of spaces or objects beyond just the readings or object presentations to expand the breadth of discussion."

I think it was nice to be able to read and comment on readings prior to discussing as a class.\r\nI found it difficult to look at the screen for 2 straight hours. For longer seminars, I think it would help to have some level of break in the middle of class, or to split class into two sessions.",
                "This course adapted well to the virtual format but at times suffered some Zoom fatigue and awkward silences. I don't think this is a reflection of the course or Professor Buckley, but merely the virtual format. To address this, I recommend that both the professor and students talk about examples of spaces or objects beyond just the readings or object presentations to expand the breadth of discussion. This would allow for greater discussion on things that interest students and bring in their expertise from their various disciplines."

                "Definitely recommend! Professor Buckley is so insightful and explains difficult ideas in a way that I could understand.

                "Absolutely. This was one of the most interesting and engaging courses I have taken at Yale, and I only wish I could have taken it in person. But, amidst a pandemic semester that made it difficult to focus on anything, this was the one class I consistently wanted to engage with and participate in. It combines philosophy and art history to deconstruct the idea of space, what it means, how we occupy it, how we leverage it in art and architecture. It genuinely impacted the way I feel I inhabit and pay attention to the spaces and places in my life. Prof. Buckley is brilliant, kind, and engaging in discussion, and he places high value on student contributions. In my experience as a student outside of the art history department, I've found it a bit difficult to feel at home in art history environments, especially at higher level courses--but I didn't feel that here at all. I found the class comfortable and engaging, and I truly enjoyed exploring ideas in the class.",
                "Yes. Have fun!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student at Yale, especially if you are not an art\/architecture person. The concepts and lessons learned are very helpful in all aspects of life and Professor Buckley has many thought-provoking questions on the topic. Furthermore, this class would only be strengthened with in-person interaction and instruction."
