Professor Jackson encouraged students to come each week with specific poems and poets to discuss or present, a structure that, at its best, made for a lively in-class atmosphere.",
                "A strength is, as always, Professor David Jackson's unmatched knowledge on the subject and his personal history with some of the big names in the course. He is a wealth of wisdom and does a great job selecting the works and artists we focus on in the course. One thing I wish we had spent more time on is discussing more of the theory and current state of the genre in class, as a lot of it was isolated to the readings, and I think it would have made for very engaging and intriguing class discussions."
