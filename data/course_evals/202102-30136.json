                "This course allowed me to establish a fundamental understanding of power and domination, and to have a deeper understanding of the mechanism of social power, how the domination of the state, race, gender formed economically and ideologically. It encourages me to be critical and objective.",
                "I have developed basic understanding of political and sociological topics, including but not limited to class, gender, race, state, colonialism, imperialism and social movement in this course, and have started to analyze contemporary issues in the perspective of social sciences.",
                "I have learned a lot in this course. \r\nFirst of all, I am always interested in Economics and this course's theories of Weber's and Marx's really provide me with more information in the arena of Economics and how Economic and Sociology overlap and interact. \r\nAnd secondly, I found Marx and his thoeries truly fascinated: as a Chinese native, I was exposed to Marxism theories at a very young age, learning college-level classes on them when I was in high school. However, I really think that this course managed to handle his theories in a more accurate and thought-provoking way, which was good. \r\nThird, I learned a lot on states on genders, which are very relative to the reality, as governmental functions and gender equality are viewed as really important topics these days. I used to discuss with friends regarding those issues and now I have equipped myself with advanced theories on them! :)",
                "I developed a clear understanding of many sociopolitical concepts and the way they are structured (ie capitalism, neoliberalism, power vs domination, oppression, amongst others). I began to think more critically and engage deeply with texts. I developed better writing skills with the guidance of my TFs all under the pressure of a fast paced course.",
                "In this course, I developed the ability to engage with and mobilize the theories of a wide range of political and sociological scholars at a level that I haven't previously studied at any high school or college-level course. I learned a great deal about the conceptualizations of theorists like Marx, Foucault and Weber in an undeniably engaging and invigorating manner that changed my perspective on sociology as a subject and academia as a whole. The opportunity to work with TFs and professors who were so clearly knowledgeable about the topic and passionate about engaging in discussion with students allowed me to expand my intellectual horizons and pursue my socio-scientific interests.",
                "I developed my knowledge in various key elements of race, power, authority, class, and gender. The most memorable class was about Du Bois and the idea of the dual consciousness.",
                "I think the most important thing I learned is critical thinking.\r\nAnd my professor has systematically sorted out most important and basic concepts of political sociology for us. I think I have learned a lot..",
                "One of the major skills that I developed with this course was my ability to read great amounts of content in a short period of time. I am very grateful for this and will be using this skill a lot in the future.",
                "I particularly enjoyed that aspect of Marxism developed in this course, providing me a new perspective in evaluating the relationship between workers and employers in modern society.",
                "Academic writing, in-text citations modes.\r\nI have developed an insight to major political sociology theories and a deeper understanding to Marxist theory",
                "As one of the first sociology classes I've taken, it was interesting to see a direct link between the concepts in the readings and issues and conflicts I had personally lived through or seen in the news. This class was a necessary awakening of sorts. It forced us to question the realities of our world view and begin to question \"Who does this benefit?\" Despite it's fast-paced nature, the course was structured to pack in a sufficient breadth of foundational readings and concepts related to political sociology. With a foundational understanding of power, we examined class, race, gender, state, state-formation, capitalism, neoliberalism, colonialism, and imperialism. Despite the seemingly laundry list of phrases, however, it was eye-opening to see the concepts connected and applied to varying state identities. Apart from the theoretical though, the class was a necessary introduction into more analytical and evidence-based writing that I hadnt written in college before.",
                "A systematic, dialectical approach to social issues from multiple perspectives.",
                "Political Sociology was an entirely new course to me that I had little prior knowledge about. By taking the course, I have developed some good foundational knowledge of what political sociology is as a discipline and how power is operated in societies. To be more specific, I learned how and why power and domination operate in class, gender, and race systems based on theories, history, and daily lives; different views on capitalism and market society; the power structure and psychological impacts of colonialism and imperialism; and how resistance and social movements arise, fail to arise, or succeed. \r\n\r\nI have gained and developed numerous skills while taking the course and working on its assignments. Trying to understand the readings that are intense both in terms of the content and length, and writing daily response posts about them helped me to read more quickly and think more deeply. I actively engaged with the text by thinking of several examples of how the reading's theories are manifested in the modern world, challenging the author's thoughts, and coming up with questions related to the reading. Writing the weekly reflections helped me to do this even further. It was also a meaningful experience to engage in discussions with students from different parts of the world; it was interesting to see their varying thoughts. I often linked my own country's history and modern-day system to interpret the theories or advance my arguments and other students did so too."

            "comments": [
                "The theories and reading materials are sometimes too abstract,  and it takes me a long time to understand the readings. If it;s possible, I would like to have more examples to help me understand those theories, and discuss them in detail.",
                "This course involved opportunities of participation in online discussion, pre-class comment and after-class assignments, all of which deepen the knowledge and understanding of basic issues involved in this course. The thought-provoking questions provided by the instructor were especially helpful for me to engage gradually with the topic.\r\nThe only thing for improvement, in my opinion, is that some notes or powerpoint slides can be provided for illustrating key points, which might make it clearer for us to digest after class.",
                "Its strengths includes a really good operation among the teaching members, rich and interesting reading materials, and the very humourous manner in which our Prof presents the class. And the content of the course was already very encouraging; imagine that...\r\nI personally think, however, that the discussion session could have more effective, for instance, entailing the teachers' involvement as well.",
                "There is of course the fact that the course length was shortened for the summer session and there was material left out or crammed together, though that isn't necessarily a bad thing because while it required a quick absorption of information, it was also useful in adapting to fast-paced courses.",
                "Strengths: Socratic method of discussion. Frequent student engagement and regular debate about textual theories. Fast pace but not unmanageable. Incredibly knowledgeable professor and TFs. Intriguing subject matter. Fair workload. Fun!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of direct peer-to peer engagement. Perhaps smaller debate rooms in breakout sessions? Group assignments? Icebreakers? :)",
                "The strengths of this course were the intellectual competencies of the professors and TAs to provide us with empirical and theoretical thoughts throughout the entirety of class. I'm not sure if this is a weakness, but it would have been a better experience if we could get into breakout rooms with our TAs or Professors at a  smaller scale at points to increase the clarity of the class.",
                "I think one of the great advantages of this class is that the teacher will use the way of dialogue with the students in class, instead of letting the students do too many presentations or PPT, so that the students can get full discussion and understand the teacher's ideas better.",
                "This course offered great readings that provied good insight into the topics discussed. Every reading was a pleasure to read. I think the course may do well to implement something that would allow for greater student discussions.",
                "Overall I enjoyed the pace and the content of the course, though I might want the course to have more activities for engagement perhaps.",
                "Strengths lie in the profound contents, good-cooperation among professor and TAs and in-time feedback for our homework.\r\nWeakness mainly lies in the relatively single class forms.",
                "The professor provided many reading materials which have been much helpful, the TFs were patient and willing to help\r\nBut the course has spent too much time on discussion, it would be much better to give more lecturing",
                "The structure of the course and the readings made it easy to see how the concepts built on top of each other. Each class had a sense of purpose as we worked to clarify the assigned reading and its place in the political sociology world. Although I know theres no way of knowing beforehand how much participation there will be with every class, maybe asking students to share their written discussion posts could facilitate more group conversation. I understand not wanting to call on people though, so not too sure about the forced participation. \r\n\r\nHaving more explicit instructions and guidance for the writing assignments would be nice to reference, or maybe just more example essays would have helped clarify what was expected for writing from the get-go.",
                "Lack of interaction between students.",
                "I think that the first and foremost strength of this course is that it provides a good overview of some of the most important topics in Political Sociology. Students, whether or not they are new to the discipline, can get a good grasp of the most important theories and views related to Political Sociology. I also liked how the discussions as a whole class and the professor's explanation of key ideas were well-balanced. The readings were enjoyable to read and sometimes varied in terms of the type of writing (some readings were novels or website articles).\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the course would be that, as it tries to cover a vast amount of content in a short period of time, it is likely that students have some misunderstandings or lack of understanding of the course content. The professor and the TFs tried to clarify these occasionally after we submitted our papers, but it would have helped if these were done more often or before we write our papers. But I think it is quite an inevitable issue due to the limited time."

                "Yes!!! Really interesting it is. And I think that our Prof was really good at his job, being so energetic and enlightening as always. I am not sure whether the TFs would join in the class the next semester, but I am sure that their contributions would mean a lot to the course this summer. \r\nIt is common that nowadays young people are more or less interested in the society and politics, and I honestly think that via attending this course, those interested souls can be fully nurtured towards a better overall understanding of the world we are in.",
                "Yes, I would. It served as a great introduction to political sociology and inspired me to read more theory and develop a deeper understanding of social issues. It covers many modern-day concepts and the history and problems behind them.",
                "I absolutely would - many of my reasons have been stated above. The course encouraged me to broaden my intellectual horizons and approach heretofore nebulous subject topics with confidence and open-mindedness. The professor and TFs were excellent in their depth of knowledge and willingness to engage with students outside of class hours. I am really very thankful for the opportunity to have taken this course and I would highly recommend it to any one of my fellow students without hesitation.",

                "Yes\r\nI really learnt a lot from the course",
                "Yes! This course was the opposite of ignorance is bliss. The readings and discussions pulled back the curtain to the powers and oppressive structures that influence society. I appreciate the well-rounded introduction into this perspective of the world and hope to continue using the tools and concepts the class offered with more sociology classes or just in daily life.",
