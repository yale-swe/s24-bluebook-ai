                "This semester has been my most precious as a Humanities Major because of my William Blake class. Enrolling in Professor Soles class on William Blake has realized my belief in the power of imagination. Blake emphasizes the need for humans to exercise their imaginative faculties to create a better world. If a person engages in a war without a vision of post-war peace, which requires creativity, fighting the war is then pointless as it will result in another future war. Thus, our imaginations are vehicles to reimagine our world and interrupt cycles that hinder human potential and growth. Furthermore, understanding the importance of art as a means to express ourselves and understand others has been huge.",
                "I developed my close-reading skills alongside the ability to sketch a broader, schematic picture of Blake's works in both literary and visual mediums, as well as the ability to refine my focus and be attentive to themes, words, and characters Blake would progressively nuance over time.",
                "I learned about the poetry and artwork of William Blake, as well as his extensive mythology, word play, motifs, theology, political views, and philosophy. We learned to think about how to put poetry in conversation with artwork, about Blake's process as an artist-poet, how to close-read, and how to think about our own creative output\/artistic visions. I feel that I've exited the course with a strong grasp on Blake's canon."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths were the classroom discussions, which were at times, quite potent. Prof. Soles was a master at steering the conversation. The weakness' were that occasionally the class would run long and we all wanted it to do so but the class that needed our room immediately afterwards cut us off!",
                "Strengths:\r\nI thought that the feedback\/commentary we received on papers was really thoughtful and gave good points on where to improve on\/expand. Professor Soles was always open to meet and speak about papers\/planning. The papers were very short and you had lots of jumping-off points through different prompts. You aren't expected to immediately understand what's happening, there's room for you to be confused and work through that confusion. Pretty easy grading, the commentary is more important, so it's nicely focused on improvement and your development of what you're interested in. Brought in some nice treats to surprise us multiple times! You can really close read Blake's images and you're encouraged to if you want to which is really fun! It's nice to just focus on one artist's work and the tracking the development of his theology for a semester. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThis seminar felt more like a panel\/lecture in that every comment you made, if you could fit it in, was then subject to a two-minute re-interpretation of your comment by Soles to make it more closely align to his interpretation. This not only makes you feel like you weren't fully heard, but also the constant interruption makes it so there's no natural flow of discussion\/interaction between your classmates. multiple times I had a response to a classmate's comment, but it took so long for Soles to make his response to it that we had fully moved away from what was said and it wasn't worth backtracking. It was the seminar with the least inter-peer discussion I've had at Yale. \r\nWe were constantly behind on covering reading material in class, the discussion posts were often posted the night before they were due, and grades took a healthy amount of time to get back. Class also often ran overtime, much to the frustration of the seminar in the room after us, and frankly rude on the last day of class when that seminar had to set up for their exam. And he is not proficient with technology, which also means he does not reply quickly.\r\nAlso, despite it being cross-listed as in the English department, every comment made that was close reading was met by an overwhelming sense that no one really knew what to do with it. Instead, Soles and the (majority) non-English majors seemed to prefer extrapolating into things that veered pretty far away from the text. \r\nOn the class: it's almost fully made up of his previous students. They've all taken MULTIPLE (some up to FIVE) courses with him. It feels like you've stepped into a cult meeting, and there is some clear favoritism, coined \"Soles-Nepotism,\" of *who* gets into the class. So it ends up feeling like his class ends up as a carefully curated fan club\/ego boost for Soles *by* Soles. So it looks like that twisting of your comments to fit his, has never really been countered before because he has these devotees around him. There also seems to be a fair bit of devotion to Harold Bloom, a since-passed Yale professor who would harass female students during his time teaching at Yale. The only reason I bring this up is the devotion goes beyond Bloom's academic commentary on Blake into his person\/life. \r\nSoles also seems to really want his students to like him, which I guess is natural of any person, but this feels like an extension of the high school type of \"emotional support teacher\", except he is the one wanting to become that \"emotional support teacher\" instead of just naturally becoming one? To be fair he is nice to chat with, but this doesn't feel like the thing to promote in a classroom. When speaking to a classmate outside of class about this (who I really enjoyed the in-class commentary of!), the student said that it was because he had no external relationships, as the justification for his want to create strong ties with his students, however, this pressure to fulfill that emotional tie is sometimes awkward, and the fact that a student both knew this and was using this as a justification felt a bit odd and unprofessional",
                "There are no weaknesses to Professor Soles' course. The electric seminar discussions, Professor Soles' interpretations, and the content itself made this class the perfect type of fun challenge. The feedback I received on all my writing was outstanding. This is a course every Yale student (particularly humanities majors) should be required to take.",
                "Strengths: exciting, good class dynamic, almost all students who had a comment were able to speak, the YCBA visit, Blake glossary on Canvas, weekly Canvas posts (I found them helpful and interesting), and the extensive (and timely!) essay feedback!\r\n\r\nImprovement suggestions: I wish we were able to read more secondary scholarship on Blake to better contextualize his works\/what social concerns he's responding to, and I wish we could have had a second CBA visit!! Sometimes it felt difficult to manage everything going on in Blake's works (especially with Milton and Jerusalem), so maybe a quick 5-10 min presentation at the beginning of these classes with a condensed Bloom commentary might have helped us all start class discussion on the same page! (I also wish we weren't kicked out of class RIGHT at 3:20pm every day by a certain incoming instructor...)",
                "The central strength of this course was Professor Soles' wonderful teaching. Professor Soles not only knows these poems like the back of his hand, but he additionally makes his lessons fun and engaging. His love and enthusiasm for the subject really shines through. Professor Soles is one of those rare professors who really cares about his students, always making himself available for office hours to discuss papers, or ask questions to further discuss class material. He was always ready and willing to offer a more in depth explanation of something we touched on in seminar, or provide his own interpretations of the works. He also offers the most in depth feedback on papers and assignments I've experienced from a professor at Yale, which is truly a testament to his dedication to his students and his strong work ethic as a professor. Because of Professor Soles' openness to his student's ideas, the classroom environment itself was quite welcoming and comfortable. I was never scared to participate or share my ideas because of this. \r\n\r\nAnother strength of this course were the weekly Canvas posts, which really encouraged me to synthesize my ideas in writing as I went along with the reading, which I found to be a very fruitful exercise and also good preparation for the paper assignments. I also loved that the final project was creative, as it really encouraged students to explore their own vision and produce something unique, unlike the typical final assignments in other humanities classes which typically follow a similar format. \r\n\r\nThere is truly nothing that could have been improved because I found the course to be very strong all around, especially given the challenging nature of the thinker at hand."

                "If you're looking for a junior seminar, i think this is a pretty fine option for one, however I did have to take some ibuprofen before class multiple times because of the quasi-yelling and table-slapping effects of some of the discussion. however if you aren't interested in theology then no. \r\n\r\nthe papers are short though and you can do them on Blake's art intersecting with his texts so that's fun! you can really dig in. \r\n\r\nit's also pretty cool to say that you both read all of Milton book the 1st & 2nd, the book of Urizen, AND Jerusalem And wrote papers on them. however that means absolutely nothing to anyone outside of a small field of academia. but if it's something that sounds cool to you, go on ahead and chase your bliss. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses in the other tab are definitely present though, so please read and consider those before making your decision.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student.",
                "Absolutely would recommend IF you: are no stranger to literature and are interested in close-reading, know what you're getting into with Blake (i.e., you've read at least a FEW Blake works\/poems before... please do this because Blake is completely unlike anyone\/anything you've ever encountered), are open-minded, compassionate, patient and willing to work with Blake to understand his greater vision, and want to develop your writing skills from Riley's extensive essay feedback!",
                "Yes, if you like literature that is steeping in philosophy. Blake is very difficult to understand, and the fun of the class is working through small passages to try to make sense of the larger picture of his work. If you enjoy a challenge, this course is for you!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! Blake is a very unique writer, and definitely unlike any other author you've ever read. It is certainly challenging material, but its study is a fruitful endeavor for anyone who loves literature, poetry, and zany thinkers. The ideas in this course are also quite interesting to anyone interested in philosophy, theology, art history, and even political theory, as Blake also engages with contemporary thinkers such as Rousseau and Voltaire, historical events such as the French and American revolutions, and of course, the ideas of the Christian church. Finally, I'd recommend this course simply because of the fact that Professor Soles teaches it. Professor Soles is a wonderful professor and any student at Yale would benefit greatly from his teaching and writing feedback."
