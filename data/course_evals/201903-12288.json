    "Before starting this course, I spoke some Russian at home but did not know who to read or write in Russian. I did not even know the alphabet. Now, after only one semester, I can read and write in both print and cursive and my vocabulary and grammar has improved.",
    "I learned all but one case of the Russian language (and learned about the idea of cases), learned lots of Russian vocabulary, learned how to conjugate verbs correctly, and learned about aspect. This course was a wonderful introduction to Russian; I can now better understand and contribute to conversations in Russian while also understanding the construction of sentences\/phrases. I also learned about Russian culture.",
    "Basics of Russian language (how to read, a lot of basic grammar and vocabulary, etc), some Russian cultural knowledge",
    "I learned to read and write in Russian, using basic grammar. I practiced speaking in class and during oral exams. We also gained insight into Russian culture through videos and movies in and about Russia.",
    "foundations of russian vocabulary, grammar, and culture; greater understanding of how a language indicates the values of the culture that speaks it; some soviet history",
    "I learn the foundations of Russian grammar and vocabulary, as well as basic conversational Russian."

   "comments": [
    "I thought that the frequent quizzes and unit tests were really helpful with motivating students to learn the topics well. With any language class, you really have to be constantly focused and engaged with the topic -- for me, last minute cramming doesn't really work the same way for languages, and all the tests were huge motivators in making me make sure that I learned the vocab\/grammar well.",
    "I believe more cultural aspects can be intergrated into the course. The TF John did a good job of adding modern Russian culture tidbits into the lesson.",
    "This course taught me Russian well in a short period of time, and I enjoyed the rigorous pace, as it caused me to immerse myself in the language as much as possible. However, it was hard to figure out the minutiae behind some concepts because class periods were so short, and I had classes during every office hours session.",
    "Strengths: consistent engagement, fast pace, lots of exercises (necessary for language learning)\r\nWeaknesses: pace varied; beginning felt very slow and end\/middle felt very fast (although might be necessary to deal with the learning curve)",
    "Strengths are the everyday repetitive nature and overall ability to learn a lot in a relatively short time\r\nWeaknesses are difficulty in learning conversation and everything else all at once",
    "One of the strengths of this course is that the workbook includes daily homework which mirrors the progression of the textbook, making it easy to keep up with the concepts in class. I do wish there was more reading out loud to work on pronunciation in class.",
    "strengths: good balance of challenging and engaging, well-organized, comprehensive and understandable textbook and workbook\r\nweaknesses: not a big deal, but i kind of wish we had learned the standard russian keyboard"

   "comments": [
    "Russian is not an easy language to learn. Thus, if the student is committed to learning the language, then I highly recommend.",
    "Yes! It is a very good introductory course that doesn't put too too much pressure on its students so that it is stressful, but enough pressure so that students learn. Russian is also just a wonderful language.",
    "Yes, because it was difficult but not impossible, and I learned the basics a very important language and now have a strong foundation in it",
    "Yes! The workload is consistent but not unmanageable, the class dynamic was fun, and I feel as though I have greatly improved since the beginning of the class.",
    "yes!"
