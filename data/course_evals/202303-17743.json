As a math major, all the first half of the semester (set theory) was revision, so if you have a solid background in math, you should expect to be quite bored for the first half of the semester. However, the second half is very satisfying!",

It also gave me a whole new way of conceptualizing language.",

                "Strengths  small lecture size, engaging professor, interesting psets, take-home exams\r\n\r\nWeaknesses  few. Not necessarily a weakness but be prepared to spend a long time on psets/exams",
                "weaknesses: the course started off fairly manageable for all backgrounds of math and linguistics, but sometime before the midterm the difficulty of the problem sets exponentially increased. I went from being able to complete them in just a few hours (~3) to needing multiple days to complete them (~7-10 hours). I wish there had been more transparency about the fact that the difficulty and workload of the course increases over time. Also, the grading for the psets is somewhat harsh, which is frustrating since your grade in the class is entirely dependent on psets. You could spend hours and hours completing complex problems only to miss 10% of points over the smallest details. Also, office hours were helpful but this is a class where knowing whether you have the right/full answer is very difficult unless a TF tells you, which was never the case. Moreover, towards the second half of the course Bob tended to rush through  lecture material whereas at the beginning he was very thorough in his teaching. This likely added to the increasing difficult of the homeworks.",
                "This class has no weaknesses, only strengths. I would take it again in an instant.",
                "I think that it would be really cool if there was a version of this class for math majors who are already familiar with set theory, natural numbers, algebra, discrete math, etc. so we could just start with the interesting linguistic-y stuff. There seemed to be two distinct audiences (the people with math backgrounds and the people with linguistics backgrounds) and I think it was hard to satisfy both groups at the same time.",
                "Strengths: Professor Frank, relatively small class size, plenty of resources for help\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "The biggest weakness of the course is that there were a mix of people who had done lots of proof based math, and those that had done none at all, and as such it could not appeal fully to everyone. As such, for myself at least a lot of the content in the first half of the semester was something i had seen many times before and thus ultimately not that interesting. However, the second half of the course was well presented to engage those who were and were not previously familiar with proof based math.",
                "The class is super well organized and keeps a very consistent pace. Professor Frank is amazing and such an engaging professor. The topics are all really interesting and everything is very well balanced. No weaknesses.",
                "Professor Frank is a very engaging and kind lecturer who plans and teaches the course material well. This amounts to the course's substantial strengths. The weaknesses are in accessibility, as I think it was much harder for beginners to get a handle on the material.",
                "Bob taught very clearly; the material was interesting, and the pacing was good. The work wasn't trivial, but wasn't overwhelming either. Honestly, great class, I don't have any notes."

                "Yes. If youve taken set theory and/or discrete math, there will be quite a bit of overlap, but its still interesting and worth taking because the professor is engaging and draws connections between the math and linguistics topics that would be new to non-linguistics (or linguistic-adjacent) majors. Solidifies proof based thinking / work",
                "Yes yes yes! This might be the best class I have ever taken. Dr. Frank is hilarious and just so smart. Honestly, the GOAT. Every lecture is a work of art and the psets are a ton of fun. If you have to choose one class to ever take at Yale, choose this one. It is beyond good.",
                "Bob is a great professor, but if you're a math major, you're probably better off with classes like theory of computation.",
                "You should feel comfortable in taking this course as a fifth credit, especially if you either want to earn a social science or a QR credit. In my case, I was partly taking it for the social science credit (as a math major). The problem sets were generally very interesting: from my experience, there are a bunch of straightforward questions (which can be written up quickly), and then one that would always be quite challenging and require new creative ideas (so even if you have a very good math background, you won't necessarily be bored). It also gives a light introduction into many interesting linguistic phenomena (you will learn that some natural languages aren't PDA's, think of models of how our brain processes sentences in terms of the derivation tree of a sentence and it's grammar) so you don't need to be worried about not having a background in linguistics. In retrospect I may have enjoyed taking theory of compuation offered by CPSC a bit more, but as I have an interest in linguistics, it was nice seeing these two fields brought together, so I definitely don't regret choosing this class. Robert Frank is also a fantastic professor, and is great at answering questions for people from all different backgrounds.",
                "Definitely. I think the class would be most beneficial to people with little to no experience in proof-based mathematics. If you already have a lot of experience with proof-based mathematics, then I think the only new material you'd be exposed to is the formal language theory content of the course (i.e. Chomsky hierarchy). We didn't get to Turing machines and Complexity theory, however, if these are included in the future, then these will likely be new as well. What sets this class apart from a traditional proof-based mathematics course, however, is that you also apply the mathematics toward different models in linguistics, which I thought was really interesting. Professor Frank is also great, and I think you'll find that he's very passionate about what he's teaching.",
                "I would definitely encourage those who don't have an in depth math background and are interested in linguistics to take the course, because it explains the necessary fundamentals and introduces some interesting ideas. However, for those that have seen lots of proof based math, i would caution that the first half of the course may not be a good use of your time. That said, the linguistic applications were to some degree worthwhile, and in this case the course could perhaps serve as a 5th credit.",
                "This course really is one of a kind. You start from the basic axioms of set theory and develop an incredibly rich tool set for answering questions about the nature of language. It is really satisfying to eventually get to the point where you can understand a rigorous description of formal languages, a topic which is so interesting there really should be more courses that cover it (I only know of CPSC 201). The assignments are very regular and have the right amount of difficulty. The grading was fair and I really felt like I could just focus on soaking up all go the cool ideas. So I could not recommend this course more!",
                "I would recommend this course to a student with an at least introductory background in proof-based mathematics. The material is very interesting and Professor Frank is a great lecturer. However, to a linguistics or humanities student with less of a mathematical background, I would advise caution though it is doable.",
                "I would. The material was interesting, and Bob taught very well. He introduced mathematical concepts with a lot of intuition, and explained them very clearly. It was a really fun class."
