Topics of healthcare access, past disease outbreaks, natural disaster emergency care\/responses, colonization, reproductive justice, immigrant rights, etc...in many countries\/borderlands such as the United States, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Chile, Mexico, etc. Dove into readings from the 19th century to present times to provide a great historical perspective for the modern lens. Some specific topics include, healthcare during Cuban independence, Reproductive rights and labor camp healthcare in California, Puerto Rico responses from hurricane Maria, historical health experimentation by US doctors in other countries.",
                "I gained a clearer understanding of how modern public health practice is inextricably linked to histories of eugenics, imperialism, and nationalism. This class has fundamentally broadened my understanding of the social determinants of health and the inherently political nature of public health.",
                "By taking this course, I learned more about public health policy in Latinx borderlands and how the US has used public health policies to exert imperialist control over marginalized communities. This course also covered other topics such as eugenics, reproductive health, and traditional medicine.",
                "How discourses of health and disease reveal notions of morality, colonialism, race, national identity, and national belonging as they specifically pertain to the Latinx borderlands.",
                "This class provided students with a nuanced understanding of the history of health within Latine communities. I developed an interest in how health intersected with ethnic studies by looking at eugenics, public health and U.S. imperialism. traditional medicine, health activism in the 20th century, and current struggles for reproductive health.",
                "I learned how to think critically about U.S. involvement in other countries, specifically with health programs.",
                "Better understanding of the history of the US and Latinx borderlands and the connections between health policies in both.",
                "Through this course, I learned about the relationship and role of the United States in various Latin American countries and their respective health issues or crises and what it means for the American health care system.",

                "Strengths: (1) Professor is super knowledgeable and passionate about what she teaches! Her presentations are awesome and she explains everything with enthusiasm and eloquence. (2) readings are super interesting and not overwhelming (I've since bought the full books of some readings that were excerpts and excited to read over summer). (3) seminar style is great for discussion (4) grading is helpful and allows for personal insight in the readings. Possible weakness (if any) is that it was taught at 9:00am? Although I liked the time because it forced me to start my day, so I have signed up for future 9ams :)",
                "The biggest strength is Professor Carrillo! She is an amazing professor whose knowledge and passion for the topic made every class incredibly engaging. Each class reading showed how people of different marginalized identities were affected by public health practice in different and similar ways. Additionally, she is very detailed and responsive in the feedback she gave for our papers, which helped me greatly when I was formulating my arguments.",
                "One strength of this course was that while we covered certain topics in class, students had the chance to learn about other topics through the blogpost assignments. Another strength of this course was the discussions we had on the reading material in class and the analysis we made really helped the students grasp the material and understand it. Something that can be improved is that the class could cover more Latinx borderlands.",
                "Strengths: students have agency over their own learning, content\/structure is fluid and provides flexibility",
                "One of the largest strengths is Professor Lopez Carrillo who is amazingly supportive instructor. She always makes sure that we are understanding the content and checking in on the pace of the class. Additionally, her feedback on assignments is helpful and very clear. She truly believes in her students and wants them to do their best. The content of the course is interesting, especially for STEM, pre-Med, history and ethnic studies students. Class discussions are well-organized and the readings are well-picked and captivating.",
                "The syllabus for this course was great. I learned so much that I had never heard about before. Class discussions were also a strength.",
                "The course readings and class discussions were very well-organized. The assignments directly correlated with everything we were discussing in class and the overall readings were all very engaging. All of the readings managed to incorporate the societal and cultural implications of scientific legislation and innovation. In the future, I would recommend that the syllabus correspond with the weekly readings because there was a bit of a mix-up in some weeks."

                "YES. ABSOLUTELY YES. This class has further inspired my interest in public health, particularly for communities with less resources or historically marginalized. I think this course was well organized to be engaging and not overwhelming, with just the right amount of work to get helpful feedback in return. The professor is also AMAZING! Super encouraging, exciting, and kind. She also writes well thought out reviews and I could tell she really cared about her students!",
                "Yes, definitely! Whether or not you're interested in public health or science at all, this class is very eye-opening and sheds light on why our modern healthcare systems are the way they are today.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students because it was an amazing opportunity to study American imperialist public health policy and the impact it had on Latinx communities both in the US and outside. I learned so many things that I was never taught before and that I wasn't aware of. This course helped me think critically about American history and the dynamics of health and disease.",
                "Yes, make sure to connect with Ximena so your needs could be understood and worked with",
                "Yes! Professor Lopez Carrillo is amazing! You will leave each class wanting to learn more about how health and ethnic studies intersect.",

                "Absolutely, this class allowed me to learn so much about the healthcare system that I was embarrassingly unaware of.",
                "Yes! Prof. Carrillo is a great professor and really gives her all in every class.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend taking this course with Professor Lopez-Carrillo. The class was a blast and I learned so much from the professor and from class discussions. Each student offered a new perspective to the medical themes covered, considering that we all want to specialize in different subjects. The class offered a collaborative environment for all!"
