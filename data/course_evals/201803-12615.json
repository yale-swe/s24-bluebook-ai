    "This class will change the way you approach and understand a lot of contemporary music\/art. Also, even though noise seems like a bit of a ridiculous topic, the material covered a huge range of things and actually proved to be really insightful.",
    "An interesting perspective into a variety of fields through the lense of noise. Also improved ability to read and analyze complex texts.",
    "Learned to look at noise through many new lenses. Learned how to reason through an abstract concept and apply it to various fields.",
    "Learned about noise philosophy and how noise impacts all aspects of life.",
    "I learned a lot about how I function in seminar classes, as well as a lot about this very abstract concept of noise. I think I learned that there are a lot of things and subjects that can be investigated that aren't considered \"normal\" subjects.",
    "Everything about noise and the soundscape",
    "I greater knowledge for the existence of noise and how it is all arounds us and effects us everyday.",
    "I developed a deeper knowledge on noise and the world around me.",
    "How to think abstractly about the world around me. How to listen to abrasive and chaotic sounds."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course had close to no assignments, apart from weekly readings. Should NOT be a writing credit - the only two writing assignments were a 500 word essay towards the beginning of the term and a final project (where you could even choose not to do a paper).",
    "I enjoyed the course very much overall. I do think that some of the readings in the early part of the course were not quite as interesting, yet I very much enjoyed the latter half readings. One of the main advantages of the way this course is taught is that it stretches across a wide range of topics, so everyone is bound to be pulled by at least a few of the readings that are done.",
    "Strengths: Open discussion lead to great discussion; very organized in weekly homework\r\nWeaknesses: Would have liked to have more feedback on works we had turned in, so that I could know what I could improve or what I should look into more.",
    "A little bit of more structure and clarity of grading would be better.",
    "I think that Professor Kane does a very good job of talking about the subject. It is obvious he really likes the subject and is passionate about sharing his love for the subject.\r\nHowever, the materials for the course are very repetitive, and therefore can be boring at times. I felt that the classroom environment was not very engaging, and could have been taught in a lecture style course. Furthermore, I received no feedback and was very disengaged from the instructor.",
    "Its a great course that has a lot of readings, but has a passionate professor who cares and loves what hes doing.",
    "Sometimes the seminars dragged on a little as the class kept discussing the same things, but usually everyone was engaged and entertained.",
    "I liked how the direction of the course could be swayed in any which way depending on what the students were focusing on. The flexibility of the course for you to be able to unleash your creativity was a refreshing change from the structured classes I was already taking. However, I didn't like the direction in which Noise was being pushed. We spent too much time on Information Theory and the logistics behind Noise that I felt like it was starting to become a class that I could no longer freely voice my opinions about because I didn't understand nor was interested in what we were talking about."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It's very much a class where you get out what you put in. If you do the reading and participate in discussions, the class is very interesting and there is a lot to learn. The class covers many different topics so if you are looking for a detailed history of noise, this may not be the class for you, but if you want an out-of-the-box seminar with a professor who is an expert in the field, I would highly recommend Noise.",
    "Yes, a bit of a gut but also filled with super interesting readings and topics",
    "Yes, I enjoyed this course quite a bit, and it made for a great way to start off college.",
    "Yes! This class was intellectually stimulating",
    "A good introduction to the humanities.\r\nVery informed in the subject.",
    "No, I think the first year seminar program is an amazing program, but this is not a great seminar course.",
    "Yes, any student who takes this course will definitely be rewarded at the end.",
    "It's a solid amount of reading, but not much writing, and if you're into electronic music, I'd recommend it.",
    "Yes, the course is different from other classes I have taken, and its a great learning experience about the subconscious and noise music.",
    "I would recommend Noise to another student who was looking for a wonky, off-the-chain class to be taking to further their perspective on a topic never thought about before.",
    "This class was a fun change from my other courses in both its structure and its content. I enjoyed the projects and discussions, however did not feel much reward for the long readings required for every class period."
