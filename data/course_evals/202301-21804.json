And the assigned readings weren't particularly enjoyable. Shiri is a very particular grader and has very particular expectations for written work that don't always make sense and feel inhibitive of free thought.",
                "Critical thinking. great class.",
                "As a writing credit, I gained a lot of skills regarding analyzing texts and expanding my skills within written work. This was the most rewarding course I have taken at Yale thus far regarding knowledge and insight. Through much of the history we learned and the literature we evaluated, I got to better understand my own culture through enriching texts while also having a classroom that facilitated an environment for respectful discussion and disagreement.",
                "I learned a lot about Israeli culture and history through books and film.",
                "I understood more about Israeli culture and responses to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict",

                "I learned a lot about the identity and history of Israel. This class was very important for me to learn about my background and culture.",
                "I learned how to pace myself effectively with reading, since often we would have large amounts of reading for the weak. I also learned very effective peer-review skills (both for giving and receiving edits), since in this class peer-editing constitutes a portion of the grade for each paper.",
                "I learned skills in critical analysis of a wide range of media forms. I learned how to read academic articles about literature in order to expand the scope of my analysis of the literature. I learned how to focus my attention on culture, and while politics are inherently part of culture, I learned to separate cultural case studies from political ideas that can reduce the value of the discourse.",

            "comments": [
                "Strength: Only meets once a week and you get a writing credit. Weaknesses: Lot of dull readings that seem geared towards a younger audience. Shiri also spends the first hour of the weekly seminar going over announcements and procedural matters. When we are discussing the readings, Shiri is overly controlling of the discussion and gets annoyed when people are critical. The grades on the discussion posts seem arbitrarily decided and are very frustrating.",
                "this class rocks. maybe even more current events though",
                "I think that this course was strong overall, with only one slight change I would recommend making regarding one of the books called Dolly City to not be read. However, I understand that my opinion is extremely biased as most to all of the class enjoyed this work greatly and it was a useful piece of text to those who read it. \r\nFor the amount of work covered, I feel as if I would have greatly benefited from a discussion section of a second class meeting as some of the classes felt a bit rushed. \r\nBut, overall, I think this course was conducted wonderfully and, other than one book, I enjoyed all of the text we analyzed and the class discussions.",
                "The strengths of the course were the professor and the organization. She was very nice, knowledgable, on top of things, and structured. I liked that every week there was a different focus. There were no weaknesses. This was one of my favorite courses at Yale!",
                "I think that the material we engage with is great. However, it might make more sense to spend more time with Oz",
                "This was a great course. Dr. Goren is a great professor, the readings were interesting, the workload was appropriate and merciful and the grading was fair!",
                "I think the hardest part of this class was finishing all of the readings on time and a weakness therefore was too much reading in too little time. If there were fewer then we could have focused more on the smaller details and themes.",
                "Strengths: despite being a class about Israeli literature, as a student who is neither Jewish nor Israeli I did not feel out of place under Prof Goren's instruction, even though most of the students in the class were Jewish. This was something I worried about before taking the class, so I am glad that this was not an issue. I also really appreciate that we engage not just with written literature but also with film. I also like that we started some classes going around to say our weekend plans, or saying something we were proud of...I wish more classes did this. \r\nWeaknesses: too much of each class period is relegated to announcements about events and readings for next week; this information can be kept in an email. Fortunately, Prof Goren switched to an email format for this information in the second half of the semester; I hope this continues to be the case.",
                "Each meeting of the class seemed to be its own independent discussion. This had pros and cons. This allowed for the topics of the course to cover a wide range of the \"Israeli Narrative\" spectrum. Understanding that each narrative can stand alone to some degree is important in the study of narrative literature. However, I do feel that the course would benefit from explicit discussions that put the writers into conversation with one another. This would have made the course feel a little more cohesive. \r\nAdditionally, beyond the general coursework (reading responses and essays), the mandatory supplemental assignments such as new reports and event reports were somewhat disorganized. I enjoyed doing the assignments and giving and listening to presentations. However, the way that they were assigned on canvas made it hard to decipher what exactly was expected of us.",
                "Shiri is a wonderful, thoughful professor who always filled the entire 110 minutes of class with interesting material and discussions. I really don't have many complaints, other than that the readings could sometimes be a lot.",
                "Course was great and would be hard to improve!",
                "The course introduces you to several important Israeli authors, and teaches you how to read and write about them. Some of the material could be improved but we have discussed this feedback in class",
                "The spacing of the class was at times odd and some of the readings didn't feel well suited for the kinds of discussions that the class seemed to strive for, but I enjoyed the group dynamic and many of our discussions were thought provoking.",
                "Strenghts: Structure! I loved how each week was framed around a different theme and that the syllabus felt thorough and intentional. Since taking this course I have been in conversations where an Israeli author's name comes up and I realize that I know who they are because I read their work in this class. I really enjoyed the amount of time we devoted to discussions each week and the opportunities students in the class engaged with outside of class. The experience has enriched my understanding of Israel."

                "Yes, its a great way to learn more about Israel and interact with really interesting media",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a good option to balance out classes and is very engaging and interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in the literature and culture of the Israeli people, with the caveat that we discuss Palestinians and Arab Israelis very little in this class--we only talked for one class about Arab Israelis. But keeping this in mind, this course is great for learning about Israeli literature and culture.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in learning more about Israeli culture and narratives, and if you are willing to participate frequently in class discussions and in some of the activities outside of class. It's easy to skip readings and put minimal effort into the reading responses, but you really get out of the course what you put in.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
                "Yes, if you want exposure to Israeli literature and are prepared to write analytically about literature",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they were willing to take an often chaotic course that was at times rewarding, but at other times frustrating.",
                "Yes! I love Shiri! She is so intentional about creating a class that is fun, well-structured, and intimate. I particularly enjoyed all of the events she brought us to outside of class and the peer editing aspect of our midterm and final papers. The class offers much more than the single class period each week."
