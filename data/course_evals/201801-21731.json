    "Received a serious introduction to the field of Analytic philosophy using Gotlob Frege as a medium. Also learned a significant amount about the philosophy of language.",
    "Broad overview of Frege's philosophy of math and language, as well as many of the classical problems in analytic philosophy. Got a little bit better at reading philosophy and syncretizing multiple perspectives into a coherent intellectual narrative.",
    "I learned the major philosophies of Frege, and how they transitioned into modern analytic philosophy.",
    "This course provided a great introduction to the problems and methodology of analytic philosophy",
    "Introduction to a lot of analytic philosophy through Frege.",
    "The class really challenged me. I had to learn a bit of set theoretic notation and concepts (which I hadn't been introduced to prior). Some of the arguments used these ideas, and while the class was branded for those who had only taken one course in introductory logic, I think it would be helpful to have a stronger math background. This class also taught me how to think about some of the central problems in philosophy of language and the types of arguments (and what those arguments are committed to) that have been offered. This has been particularly exciting because I think about language in a completely different way."

   "comments": [
    "A clearer map of where we were going both on a daily basis and on a semester long basis is in order. Professor Stanely often seemed to be making things up as he went along but this made it difficult to follow sometimes as it wasn't clear what the large stucture of the argument was until after several days of dicussion. It also made it difficult to plane workload and reading in advance.",
    "This course began very organized as we worked through Gotlob Frege's \"Foundations of Arithmethic\" but became gradually less and less organized as we moved from the foundations and Frege's \"On Sense and Reference\" to various topics and problems within the field of analytic philosophy.",
    "The class covered some really interesting problems in analytic philosophy, and the prof went sufficiently deep into each so that we would know what the interesting questions are. It would've helped to get more frequent reminders of what the trajectory of the class is, to better motivate each individual problem that we discussed. There were also moments where individual student questions would go very far, which is good if you're interested in the question, but not so good if you don't understand the question or why it's important.",
    "The course is a great introduction to analytic philosophy that also incorporates philosophy of math, made accessible to people with minimal background in math.",
    "I loved this class. Great foundation to Frege's thoughts and analytic philosophy in general. I think Professor Stanley kept the entire class engaged and helped everyone understand the concepts. The syllabus was great and I liked the additional reading Stanley provided when it was relevant.",
    "Deep engagement with Frege's thought and very good introduction to analytic philosophy."

    "Any student that wishes to develop a truly deep understanding of first and second order logic should take this course. We begin this course examining the first formal language for conducting proofs invented by Gotlob Frege and investigate very deeply the content of this formal system and what it is capable of accomplishing. The class sheds a lot of light on the history of logic and linguistics.",
    "Yes. It's a fun course with a lot of interesting concepts that you otherwise wouldn't encounter.",
    "If you take a lecture class with Professor Stanley he will ramble. This didn't happen too much in this class because we were free to interrupt him and ask questions. He stayed on track and gave great explanations. I found Professor Stanley to be a very engaging professor in this course. Here are the kinds of questions you will encounter: what kind of things are numbers? what is the meaning of a proper name? What is the logical structure of natural language? If these sound even a little bit interesting, you will love this course.",
    "Yes--but only if you're interested in the content. It can get pretty technical so I think interest in the ideas is an important motivator for putting in the effort required to understand the various arguments. However, it was a super interesting and rewarding class and I learned a lot!",
    "Deep engagement with Frege's thought and very good introduction to analytic philosophy.  Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in the philosophy of mathematics and\/or philosophy of language."
