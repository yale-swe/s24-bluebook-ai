    "professor wolenski makes class fun and the job talks were a great way to prepare us for future presentations\/give us insight into the scientist world",
    "Strengths: Professor Wolenski is a fantastic lecturer who cares about his students a lot. All the lecture material was recorded and posted to canvas, which was very helpful. The tests followed the lectures very closely and were designed fairly. Matthew Ellis was also a great TA who was very responsive and willing to answer any questions. I think the biggest strength of this course was the small class size, which allowed students to participate a lot and even give presentations (something that wouldn't be possible in the larger lecture course during the year). \r\n\r\nWeaknessess: I would have appreciated set office hours where we could ask questions, but the professor and TA were very responsive over email anyways. Also I think the lack of any assignments made keeping up with the material difficult, but I understand that's just the nature of many biology courses.",
    "I understand that there is just so much content covered in this course, but the multiple choice questions of the exams didn't feel like they actually tested my knowledge. Some things were just never mentioned in lecture and didn't seem like they reflected the key concepts. Many questions felt like exercises in translation (\"what is even being said here?\") and pure guesswork.\r\nAdditionally, having so much of the exams come from the content of student presentations was also difficult, as many times it felt like the students presenting the content barely understood it themselves, and then everyone else was supposed to figure it out in 15 minutes.\r\nThis course was great in that I \/did\/ learn a lot, even if it was mostly just broad key themes (which definitely seemed to be what was most important), but I did not feel like the assessments provided the opportunity to show my learning of these things. \r\nI really did appreciate the commitment to accessibility with lecture recordings and slides posted before each lecture. This really aided in my learning for an online lecture.",
    "a discussion section to review material would help greatly, even if it is optional. otherwise the teaching was done well and organization was efficient",
    "Could not be improved. This guy has got it down."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Professor Wolenski is the best",
    "Yes! I think there is an advantage to taking the summer course because of the smaller class size. But I have also heard that this course is great and well-organized during the year. I would recommend it if the student is willing to put in the time to self-study, since there is a lot of material and it is hard to keep up when the course is only 5 weeks long. It might be hard to retain all the information as well.",
    "This was difficult, but it never really felt unfair. Definitely infinitely better than the bio sequence and other MCDB courses.",
    "yes, it is a helpful class for understand basic biological concepts. especially good for those planning on going to med school",
    "Yes! Professor Wolenski is amazing and makes the matieral so fascinating and digestible.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially if Professor Wolenski is teaching it."
