                "This class is so good!! I think the discussions we had were so interesting, and all of the literature was incredible well-chosen and interesting. One way I think it could be improved is through the workload -- reading a book a week and then the secondary literature on top of that was sometimes a lot, especially when we also had assignments due. But I think some people brought up concerns about the workload in mid-semester evaluations, and Professor Iheka was very responsive and changed some of the assigned readings for the remainder of the semester to make things more manageable, so that was really kind!",
                "The course was incredibly engaging and insightful. I learned so much from this class! However, the reading load only got heavier as the semester went on, which did not coincide well with finals period.",
                "The strength of this class was the reading list. We read excellent novels. The weakness of the class was that sometimes I wish we had spent more time on secondary sources instead of so much literary close readings.",
                "The course was well-structured, but as we moved through the course I felt we could spend more time on secondary sources!",
                "strengths: varied sorts of readings (novels, poems, academic papers), engaging class discussions, well-laid out syllabus (Professor Iheka was very clear about expectations and deadlines)\r\nweaknesses: confusing emphasis on writing while I appreciated Prof. Iheka's guidance in writing a compelling/organized paper, some class time was spent on reviewing very basic aspects of writing (paragraphs, topic sentences, incorporating evidence, etc.) that I felt juniors and seniors (the core students of the course) would already be familiar with",
                "I really enjoyed having the space to talk and learn from my peers who had experience in a variety of different fields. I think this course could have also benefited from short reading responses with the texts we read for us to prepare many of the ideas and motifs we noticed in the book. This could also help us come in with questions."

Especially if you are in Ecology/Environmental Studies, I feel like this class has prompted me to question a lot of the things we have been taught in EVST classes or just in the way we talk about the environment in general, so this class is an excellent place to start thinking critically about it!! I also genuinely enjoyed all of the books we read even though they were a little sad, and I feel like I learned so much about environmental issues but also about talking about literature, so I would highly recommend this class!",
