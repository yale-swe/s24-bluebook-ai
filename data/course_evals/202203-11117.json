                "In this course, I learned so many things. Primarily, I learned how to read and analyze research papers. Coming into the class, I did not have a strong background in research, so this was a very important skill for me to learn. I also learned how to present research papers and how to write a grant proposal.",
                "This course helped me to grow so much in terms of understanding difficult literature, presenting in front of peers, and learning how to write a full grant proposal. I am eager to conduct research over the next four years I am at Yale and this course truly was able to facilitate the start of my journey. I learned how to annotate and understand literature based around COVID-19 and how scientists presented data including their techniques involved as well. In addition, the understanding went so deep that I was able to learn how to present research through powerpoints to a class of enthusiastic peers. It was memorable to be able to speak for an hour in front of the class and discuss a paper that had overtime, become a part of me. Finally, writing the group grant proposal, I felt a wonderful sense of accomplishment as our group worked tirelessly to create a proposal for something so ambitious, yet exciting to us.",
                "I truly learned so much from taking this course--not only did I learn more about COVID-19 and the biology behind it, but I learned how to apply different research techniques to the material. We practiced analyzing research papers and data in-depth, as well as applying the concepts in presentations. Perhaps most importantly, we learned how to structure our own grant proposals, which will be vital when we have to submit grant proposals for funding in the spring.",
                "This course was very helpful in introducing me to many different scientific topics, like presentations and literature. It was also very interesting to learn more about SARS-CoV-2.",
                "Reading research papers, thinking critically about biological mechanisms, biochemical and biophysical techniques, collaborating with peers to write grant proposal",
                "Gained a deeper understanding of the biology behind Sars-CoV-2, while simultaneously learning the skills needed to accurately read and discuss research papers. In addition, students learned the proper writing style for grant research proposals."

                "There were many strengths of this course, including myself becoming more confident in presenting, learning how to read primary research papers, and learning how to write a grant proposal. The instructor of this course, Dean Chang, was also an excellent resource to me as I navigated through my first year in STEM. The weakness of this course was that it is only 0.5 credit hours and I found myself putting in a lot more work than 0.5 credits worth.",
                "The strengths of this course include the fact that as a first-year we are introduced to techniques that are used commonly in any laboratory you may want to intern in. In addition, you gain such a better grasp for scientific literature, presenting it, and the idea of writing a grant proposal that you are ahead of your peers in that you have worked through understanding the start of conducting research. One weakness of this course may be the time commitment and work load that the class presents, however one must accomplish this amount of workload and devote this amount of time to fully immerse and engage in a class as useful and guided as this one.",
                "There were many strengths to this course--the professor's office hours were extremely helpful, the professor was always open to questions, and all my peers seemed engaged with all the topics. However, I wish that we could go a little deeper into the research techniques before reading some of the research papers; it took me a while to understand some of them.",
                "This course was very organized, which I appreciated. There were regular problem sets, regular presentations, a few quizzes, and a few lectures. Though it may have gotten a bit repetitive, I was glad that I knew what to do every week. I think the course structure was very helpful, and by the end of the course I felt prepared to work on the final assignment.",
                "Strengths: very in depth about the content and good support from Dean Chang \r\nWeaknesses: not enough review of techniques and could receive better feedback on psets",
                "The seminar style of this course is fantastic, allowing for great discussion about the topics covered in the research papers. Additionally, I really enjoyed the end of semester project, as it allowed us to be more creative and apply the different techniques we learned over the semester to our own research project proposal."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student as it truly gave me a lot of insight into how I could improve as a young scientist and it gave me a new perspective to how I approach scientific literature and presenting important results. Learning how to work collaboratively was also very inspiring as I experienced working in a group and learned how to adjust to all different circumstances. It will forever be a memorable class that impacts the way I approach research the rest of my college career and beyond.",
                "Yes, especially if they are STEM or want to do research in the summer! I truly learned so much about research techniques and grant proposals from this class--skills that are crucial both inside and outside the classroom. Moreover, we did so by focusing on a very relevant topic: COVID-19. While I learned a lot about research, I also learned a lot about the science behind what was currently happening in our world.",
                "Absolutely. This couse is incredibly great at helping students develop skills related to science, and is very interesting for anyone who likes pathology.",
                "Yes, well worth the time and effort. Rewarding course that gives a different perspective on biology",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to a student that is interested in the life sciences and looking to get involved in undergraduate research at their time at Yale."
