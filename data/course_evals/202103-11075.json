                "-The in person labs really reinforce learning and understanding of topics previously taught in human physiology\r\n\r\n-I am just sad the respiratory lab was not in person (COVID)",
                "Strengths: interesting labs, every other week schedule was nice\r\nWeaknesses: I never really got to know my professors at all",
                "The every other week format is great and I think that the large amount of time spent on the lab reports definitely makes up for the less than usual class time. The class was well structured and the reports were self explanatory, but they did take a very long time to do.",
                "Strengths: short in lab components, doesn't take too much time\r\nWeaknesses: None really. this is required for many majors and compared to previous lab experiences at yale, this one was definitely the best! Note, you need to know matlab!",
                "Too many teachers and too little guidance! The lab reports were not very specific on what they wanted and it ended up making them take ages longer than they should have.",
                "I enjoyed the format of the course in which is met every other week and how the lab was very hands on.",
                "I thought this course was effective at providing interesting, engaging, fun labs. I particularly enjoyed the labs on cardiac function, bones, and neuromuscular signaling. It was also very helpful that we worked in the same groups every week, eliminating the traditional awkward dynamics that come with weekly new groups. I also appreciated that we often finished labs early and came in every other week, instead of every week. The lab reports were time-intensive and MATLAB could be frustrating, but it was nice to be able devote full engagement to the lab on \"on\" weeks and then take a week off to regather my lab energy. I wish the lab matched up better with the lecture course, and it often felt like a physics lab when I would have loved to focus more on non-physics physiology material (although I understand signaling aligns very well with physics for data collection). The TAs were also great for help with lab reports.",
                "Lab reports could be more guided",
                "Strengths: not too too much work (good since half credit), interesting and fun lab assignments. Lab reports weren't terrible (didn't take too much time usually or ask overly specific questions)\r\nWeaknesses: I am in general not a huge fan of lab courses. Although you get some hands on experience, it doesn't really mimic really research. The lab reports aren't very useful in my view. So this course suffers many of the same issues of other lab courses.",
                "Strengths: lab reports are not excessively time-consuming or difficult, labs were fairly short compared to introductory STEM lab courses, the pre-lab lectures were helpful, final exam was fair\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes questions on the lab reports were a little bit unclear but I was able to clarify them at TF office hours",
                "The strengths of this course is that it is not an overbearing lab like other yale labs yet it was still challenging. I thought the feedback from the lab reports weren't the best and lost some points due to inconsistent grading. Weakness is that the final exam was a bit difficult and there was no real way of knowing what type of questions we were going to be given.",
                "I really liked how lab was every other week. This setup made the class alot more fun, and helped with the workload of other classes, allowing me to be more engaged.",
                "i wish there was more structure. Although the pre-lab material was clear and the procedures were helpful, I wish we had a clear picture of the end goal and purpose of the lab beforehand",
                "I thought the labs were fair and pretty straightforward. The professors were all extremely kind and willing to help during the lab to make sure we understood what we were doing. Sometimes the lab reports were a tad long and confusing in wording. The turnaround between turning in our lab report and getting our grades back sometimes took a while, so it was hard to figure out how to improve later labs as to not make the same mistakes.",
                "The introductions to the labs seemed like a wall of specific information at first, so be prepared for extensive preparation before each lab (mostly regarding extra readings)",
                "The schedule is really nice with the alternating weeks of in lab and reports due, because you can focus on the reports much better."

Especially with labs counting as 0.5 credits, I really appreciated the shorter labs and every-other-week schedule. Lab reports were very time intensive, but with lab reports coming every 2 weeks, it was manageable.",

                "I would recommend this course to students who need a biology lab and want to understand physiological principles behind commonly-used lab techniques. If you are a BME major, this course is a pretty low-stress way to learn a lot.",
