                "Strength: great practice in class and with worksheets, and Professor Lalli's practice recordings are super helpful\r\nWeakness: honestly, sometimes we felt a little bullied in class even though I know it was meant to be playful when we answered incorrect questions.",
                "Strength: I think the intro music theory is BY NATURE very boring, because essentially you need to learn a set of \"music language\" to start do things. MUSI 110 is teaching you such knowledge, and you need to learn it well so that the courses that follow are enjoyable. \r\n\r\n110 does teach it well. The progress speed is gentle and well-paced, and it all comes together in the end. Listening, singing, reading, quirky music history are mixed and make this class enjoyable at times. \r\n\r\nWeakness: 1. some people have significant music backgrounds and are still taking this class, which makes it a bit frustrating. \r\n2. the structure isn't very clear. I have no idea what my grades will be at all throughout the term. The worksheets are not graded, the midterms are take home so it's hard to gauge how I am doing. 3. Some people are seriously behind in this class, and I think the Prof. should figure out something to accommodate them, otherwise other people are just sitting around and feeling bored.",
                "Some people already know this stuff so it discourages you if you dont get it as well as other, but the professor will work with you to catch up.",
                "The small class size is perfect for facilitating understanding by every single person in the class. Prof. Lalli would cold call on each of us to answer questions that tested out understanding of the lesson, which some people dont like, but I thought was great because it was a supportive environment so it was effective in keeping us all on the same page and caught up.",
                "It is a very good introductory course for beginners. It gets you up to speed very fast and lets someone go from no knowledge to a solid understanding of music. I do wish there was more discussion of song structure or songwriting, such as melody construction or chord progression. I understand it is an intro course, but I would have enjoyed more discussion of songwriting.",
                "Strength: solid material taught by an experienced instructor who loves music and will make you do the same\r\nWeakness: could have moved forward faster in theory at times instead of repeating drills"

Learning this stuff is really cool and exciting; it's interesting to see how the songs you know are made. This course is even good for someone who has played an instrument before but never really taken a class on theory, it really solidified my understanding of music.",
