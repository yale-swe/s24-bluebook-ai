                "A solid grasp of topics in contemporary sociological theory. Also, how to apply theories that are abstract to my daily life.",
                "This course provided me with an excellent, in-depth introduction to contemporary social theory. The units include social power (with a focus on class, race, and gender) and social critique (including a final section on sociology and its publics). I learned a lot about the background and key theories of prominent thinkers in sociology both past and present.",
                "I became very knowledgeable on the core aspects of our this course, including readings by various sociological authors. In addition, I have broadened my scope of understanding of the social world in analysis and comparison of these readings.",
                "This course in sociology, especially as it's taught by Professor Gorski, is the kind of class that will change perspectives. Leaving this class, I definitely feel as though I have a new outlook on the world. Whether it be in regards to economics, politics, or American culture, this class definitely left with new insights that I could've never imagined having. Though a lot of them were thanks to Professor Gorski, I also do not want to underestimate the value of class discussion and how important that is for this course. Many of my new insights were actually thanks to my fellow peers and their own lived experiences. Overall, this course is wonderful and I believe it extends far beyond what usually feels like a limited scope in academia.",
                "Overview on prominent social theories of the Western canon from early 20th century - present. Background + knowledge of the theories of Bourdeiu, Butler, DuBois, Mills, Hill Collins, and others, on social category formation, social fields, race, gender, critical theory, and some sense of their relevance today and connections to contemporary themes.",
                "I learned how to interpret social critiques and other sociological works while also becoming aware of the possible applications of these theories to present times. After this course, I've also honed my ability to critique and evaluate the strength and, perhaps, areas of improvement in popular social theories.",
                "I developed a much broader and deeper understanding of the most popular and relevant topics in contemporary sociology. The works I was exposed to in this course is sure to support me in my future classes and studies. I also feel I can think more critically about the sociological writing I will continue to encounter and study."

                "I really enjoyed this class! I think Professor Gorski had a great teaching style and I really appreciated the discussion questions that he used in class. I think the readings are at times a bit lengthy for a week, especially when they include ones that are a bit harder to parse. But overall, I think it is a great course and am glad I took it.",
                "strengths: awesome professor, prof G. is awesome, discussions were always very helpful and enjoyable to participate in, the readings were also really interesting, super interesting topics chosen, one of my favorite classes at Yale",
                "I think the more frequent, shorter reading response model of 151 is probably better than the long-form one of this one, although I definitely see the benefits of encouraging students to more seriously engage with the texts before class. \r\n\r\nThe lecture followed by small group discussion is a good model - I think the group questions should be more directed\/specific, as discussion sometimes felt like it didn't really have any particular goal related to the topic or text.",
                "The main strength is that the course covers a wide number of topics that feel relevant. One weakness is that the syllabus lacked flow at times, especially in unit two.",
                "I loved the range of texts we read (we covered everything from Marx to contemporary critical social theory about social science as public philosophy). Other strengths include Professor Gorskis intelligence and ability to lecture\/lead group discussions, the thoughtful TFs, the class combination of lecture with group discussion, the optional discussion section, and the fact that the content is so interesting and relevant to the present day. I liked the assignments and appreciated that we got to connect the theories to our own lives and to current events. Some weaknesses include the inaccessibility of certain readings with regards to their readability, the lack of context for some readings (ex. sometimes readings would reference authors we had not yet read, and this would leave some students disadvantaged in comparison with those who had studied the authors in other sociology courses), the fact that some of the harder, longer readings appear at the very start of the course, and the lateness of feedback on discussion posts.",
                "This course is good in its aspect of interpersonal dialogue, which helped me gain a better understanding of the texts.",
                "This course benefits a lot from intense class discussion on very personal topics. A lot of the time, when we're talking about cultural phenomena, many of my peers would chime in with valuable insights based on their own lived experiences. In this sense, this is a huge strength for the course. You're not only benefitting from Professor Gorski's knowledge, you're also benefitting from real people's experiences.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I'd attribute to this course would be in regards to the reading discussion posts. I feel that these posts basically functioned more as essays than actual conversations with my classmates. It would've been nice to, maybe alongside the discussion posts, have some other format to casually discuss the readings with my classmates before class time.",
                "I enjoyed the critical theory unit the most, as it encompassed the reflexive theory and black, feminist, decolonial perspectives that I was looking for in a course on contemporary social theory. There was a good attempt to include a more diverse canon of theorists in the curriculum, though I believe there is still more room for more critical theorists and theorists of color so that students can be exposed to a wider ranger of theory beyond the primarily white, Western canon that most sociology students are likely already familiar with from other classes or 151. The work of these critical theorists could be elevated as well, and put in more direct conversation with the theories they are criticizing. When evaluating theories, I wish we had paid more attention to the significance of platforming potentially harmful theories and evaluated them by their social impact\/reception outside the academic sphere rather than just their intellectual rigor or academic merit. What does it mean to have these theories be the \"foundation\" of modern social theory? How does the absence of certain thinkers and knowledge projects frame what is in the center? \r\n\r\nI enjoyed the course and professor overall, but I'm not sure if I would have continued with the sociology major had this been one of the first courses I took. The course and other students felt out of touch with other courses I've taken in sociology, which function on the understanding that the theories and principals we talk about do not exist in a vacuum and are grounded in lived experiences. I wish this course asked its students to think about the power social theories hold in shaping institutions and policy, and for whom social theory exists for, rather than asking us to apply the theories we talked about to our lives inside the Yale bubble. Also just thinking more critically about the academy as a space of knowledge making and exclusion.",
                "Strengths: Covers numerous sociological topics in an effective manner, professor is friendly and engaging, teaching fellows are dedicated and helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Gender studies unit felt a bit discombobulated --> Perhaps start from a broader outlook (Mohr and Almeling or Cho, Crenshaw, and McCall?)",
                "Strengths: Professor Gorski is a PHENOMENAL lecturer. It is clear that he is sincerely interested in, knowledgeable about, and invested in the work that he discusses. His ideas are expressed with a great amount of clarity and linearity. There is also a clear, sincere interest in the thoughts and ideas of his students, as he asks meaningful questions of us to discuss (either as a class or in groups) and was extremely receptive to questions or criticisms. There was also a pleasant contrast from SOCY 151 in that we covered a very broad range of topics (including gender\/sexuality, race and its relationships within systems and societies, critical sociology, public sociology, etc.), with multiple perspectives provided for each topic. It was clear that the syllabus was thoughtfully curated and developed. I really did love this class, its lectures, and its accompanying discussions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have loved to study a wider range of \"forms\" of writing; I think sociology could be studied in more different forms than just long essay\/research paper formats (however I understand that this just also is generally a pretty uncommon practice in the field). I also think the pieces within each \"unit\" of the course could be ordered a little bit more coherently."

                "Yes, if youre interested in the topic and are looking to get a strong foundation",
                "I highly recommend taking this course! I knew nothing about sociology beforehand and left feeling well-equipped with a more nuanced, informed, and critical perspective perspective of society and justice. Dont be afraid of the readings; even if you lack background with these kinds of thinkers, youll get through it, and youll learn a lot. Anyone interested in social justice, boundaries, intersectionality, class, race, gender, and other social markers should take this course.",

                "sure but it won't be life changing. does not ask students to think critically lol",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student, even if they have not taken a sociology course in the past. I felt that the broad investigation of various prominent social theorists and their works bore a powerful relevance to contemporary life. Students may find that they walk away from the course with a new lens on certain aspects of life (gender, race, etc.). Additionally, students with experience in economics and other fields may be able to corroborate or modify their understanding of the world based on what they have learned in this course.",
                "Absolutely. Even though this course is technically a requirement for my major, I would have chosen to taken it regardless (and there were plenty of students in the class that were not taking the course for a requirement). It ended up being my favorite course of my semester."
