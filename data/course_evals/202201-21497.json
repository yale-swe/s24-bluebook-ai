As we considered questions of the universal and particular, our class discussions encouraged me to think beyond and connect our weekly novels while also considering them as individual texts in their political context and style. Especially as we discussed the political and historical dynamics that shape any piece of literature, this course taught me how to be a better reader and student. The term paper assignment only pushed these lessons home as I learned to use the archives to inform my textual analysis."

                "Excellent course! Steph is a gem and is so knowledgeable about everything. She is amazing at guiding class discussions and asking the \"hard\" questions to the point that sometimes none of us would be able to answer, haha. I do wish we spent more time close-reading though. I couldn't wrap my head around some of the books we read and wanted to spend more time studying them closely. I feel like I am leaving the class without understanding some of the books and their contexts. I also wanted more of a throughline in the class. Sometimes it felt like we were just jumping from one book to the next. Also the class started at 9:25 and attendance was often spotty, which made class discussions less rewarding than other classes'.",

                "Strengths are prof Newell!",
                "The strengths of this course are its reading list and Professor Stephanie Newell's teaching. Professor Newell brought so much knowledge and enthusiasm to each text we read, encouraging us to dig deeper both in our class discussions and through the secondary reading material she provided us. We spent our entire sessions engaged in class discussions, and the conversations we had continue to be my most lasting impression from the course. The weakness of this course is not a weakness but rather a challenge of a short academic schedule. Because we read a different novel each week, sometimes we struggled to touch on every aspect of the book we were hoping to cover. We often brought past books into future discussions to mitigate this problem, but the weekly seminar format often felt too short for the amount of material we were tackling. I would have loved more class time to discuss our texts!",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Every Yale student should take a course with Professor Newell before they graduate. Not only do you learn so much about contemporary African fiction and the dynamics and contestations of the postcolonial publishing world at large, but Professor Newell encourages you to be a better and more conscious reader, writer, and student. Our class discussions were the best part of my week, and they continue to stay with me. Moreover, the texts themselves are incredible, and the term paper was a rewarding experience that allowed me to use archival research to more deeply explore my questions of textual analysis. I cannot recommend this class enough.",
