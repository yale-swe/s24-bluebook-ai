                "CAD, basic programming, 3D printing, soldering, the basics of sound physics in tubes and more and electronic sound production\/processing. Lots of hands-on skills",
                "1) The lectures in the first part of the course taught the physics of acoustics: oscillatory systems, waves on strings, waves in tubes, boundary conditions, resonators, tuning systems, etc - follows the syllabus pretty closely. Konrad's few lectures at the end covered additive and subtractive synthesis, filtering, several instrument demos, etc.\r\n2) The labs built up a working familiarity with many of the CEID's tools: using 3D printers and the laser cutter, soldering, getting to know CEID staff, and generally feeling comfortable\/knowing where things are. Looking forward to using the space more for personal projects in the future now that I know my way around!\r\n3) The final project taught me a lot about design: iterating on a design until it fits\/works\/sounds good, keeping close track of progress and checking in with yourself about what works\/doesn't work often, and breaking down a large project into manageable, time-oriented weekly goals.",
                "Broad overview of acoustics for instruments, lots of practical knowledge for engineering.",
                "I learned the physics behind acoustic instruments (e.g., recorders, guitars) and the mechanics behind electronic instruments (e.g., additive synthesis). I also learned how to 3D-design and use a 3D printer, how to use a laser cutter, and many other pieces of equipment in the CEID.",

            "comments": [
                "Midterm felt extra\/unnecessary even though it wasn't too bad when I actually took it, maybe something could better replace that so people don't worry about it so much. The project is enough to worry about later. The class is very well structured otherwise. I really enjoyed the build up of the class to prepare to actually make our own instruments, since we learn a lot of basics foundations first then go off on our own. The profs are super significant strengths of the class being very available, communicative, and helpful",
                "Strengths: manageable workload (ca. a few hours\/week for hw outside of lab, though the final project takes more time and setting sizeable weekly goals is a must), accessible office hours, hands-on labs, fair midterm\r\nWeaknesses: lecture could be more interactive, don't let brainstorming for the final project idea sneak up on you!",
                "There are labs\/weeks that barely take any time at all, and some that take much longer. The final project in particular is extremely time consuming. That said, Larry and Konrad are always willing to guide you through all of the assignments, and do an excellent job of getting you excited enough about the course that it rarely ever feels like work.",
                "Strengths: It's really really fun, especially the final project, where you get to design and create your own instrument. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had more time to work on said final project; I would definitely prefer if it were started alongside the labs, rather than after all of them are over, since we ended up only having about 4 weeks to design and create the instrument, a lot less time than it seems. Also, 9am lectures aren't great, and I would have definitely preferred later lectures.",
                "The strengths are you get to work on a project of your choosing within the realm of musical instruments, so long as it had acoustic and electronic components. The professors monitor you very very closely through this project, helping you through most of the aspects. The projects turn out cool. \r\nThe weakness is that this class IS SO MUCH TIME. The profs will tell you that workload ramps up in the last 1\/3 of the semester once the final projects start, but I found the workload (6+ hours outside of class in lab homework and midterm prep) and class time (3 hour lab plus 2 weekly lectures) to be steady and tedious from the very start. I had all of my prerequisites, too. \r\nThe other weakness of this class is that the lectures end once you start your project, so you basically stop learning 2\/3 of the way through the semester, and you start building and iterating, alone. There was zero collaborative element to this course, and I think this is a huge fault, especially as compared to the other CEID project-based courses I've taken. We could have done so much more in teams, and felt less siloed and frustrated while in the process. \r\nAlso, this course is marketed as a senior course, but I highly discourage you from taking it senior spring. None of the seniors in the course wanted to be spending 20+ hours a week in the CEID during their last month at Yale, when the weather was glorious outside and everyone else was winding down their coursework. \r\nFinally, the professors, while very very generous with their time and ideas, pretty much expect you to follow their ideas and frameworks to a tee, and I saw them get frustrated with other students who had diverging processes or ideas. I didn't mind their ideas because I was pretty lost on my own, though it was frustrating also to have to talk to the professors for every step in the process, and I would have done much better on a team where different people brought different skill sets. \r\nIt is so hard to build anything, and the expectations for this course are really above and beyond any course that I've taken at Yale, including other project and building classes taught in the CEID."

                "Absolutely, such a great intro to a lot of awesome skills with a low barrier to entry (I play music but had no engineering hands-on skills). I was super satisfied by being able to build something to cool in a class even though it did take a lot of effort. This class is a must for interested musicians",
                "Yes, without a doubt! Physically building your own instrument in the CEID and being able to draw on the help of two extremely knowledgeable professors was an opportunity I would highly recommend. (I also found it rewarding as a musician to understand more of the physics behind the instruments I play beyond \"the reed vibrates and makes a sound\".) Small caveats: I would be hesitant to recommend the course to those without AP Calc BC or AP Physics I level of calculus\/physics if you want to understand what's happening in the first half of the lectures. Also, experience with coding or working with CEID tools will save you hours - though you can learn either or both through the course itself. But overall, this is one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale and I would recommend taking it if you get the chance!",
                "Yes, if you are interested in hands-on projects and instrument design. One of the best courses I've taken here",
                "It's hard to get into the class, because the class size is intentionally kept small (so the professors can focus on students on a one-on-one basis). Priority is given to seniors and those with prior experience in music\/engineering\/physics. Also, you have to have lots of time. A few students dropped the course because it was too time-consuming. The final project is extremely stressful because you're expected to spend almost every day making significant progress in the CEID. Overall, take the class if you can get in, but know what you're getting into.",
                "Absolutely. The course is structured in such a way that even people without too extensive physics or music background can understand everything, and the instrument building part is really really fun."
