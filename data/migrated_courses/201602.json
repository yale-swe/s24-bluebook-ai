The course is open to Yale students and other IARU members only. Memory powerfully shapes our understanding of our lives. In this course, we will examine how photographic images equally powerfully shape our memory. We will read some of the key concepts of several thinkers who have taken individual and collective memory as their subject, such as Jacques Derrida, Benedict Anderson, Maurice Halbwachs and Marianne Hirsch. Additionally, we will study some of the great writers on photography, such as Susan Sontag, John Berger, Walter Benjamin, Allan Sekula and Roland Barthes. At the same time we will also explore what we can learn about memory from photographs, digital photographs, and photographic memorials, from the 1830s to the present. These photographs can be anonymous or famous, historical or recent. Our interest will not be simply in what makes them great images, but also in what makes them greatly influential in our lives. We will have class discussions as well as lectures, and students will be expected to bring photographs to share with the class. There will also be two field trips to photographic galleries in Beijing. For further information visit the Study Abroad program page. 1 Credit. Tuition $3,750. Course dates: July 4 - July 29.",

The challenges of the 21st century in protecting the tangible and intangible, cultural and natural heritage of the world are global in character and need to be also addressed on a global level. Cultural and natural heritage are increasingly threatened with destruction not only by the traditional causes of decay, but also by changing social and economic conditions. For example, in the last years we have seen the phenomena of cultural cleansing rising in the Middle East and Africa, while natural disasters have taken a toll and underlined the need to develop sustainable and global strategies for preservation. This course offers an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the complex factors that challenge the preservation of cultural heritage. Guest speakers with relevant expertise will be invited to participate in many of the class sessions. In addition, the course will draw on the collections of the Yale University Museums for discussion and as the basis of student assignments. 1 Credit. Tuition $3,750. Session B: July 4 - August 5.",

Blending classroom instruction on NUS Kent Ridge campus with hands-on fieldwork in Singapore, Cambodia and Thailand, SEA in Context offers modules on Southeast Asia with anthropological, historical and archaeological concentrations. The core module, \"SE2222: Southeast Asia In Context\" provides a broad overview of Southeast Asia from a historical, sociological and anthropological perspective. Its partner module, \"SE2880A: Southeast Asia's Cultural Mosaic\", will equip students with the analytical tools for the comparative study of society and culture, and features a 10-day field trip to various religious, cultural and archaeological sites in Cambodia and Thailand. Both modules deploy 'context-based' learning by combining in-class instruction at NUS campus with local and regional hands-on experience of Southeast Asian life. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Singapore, costs of room and board, and all other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: February 15. Enrollment limited.

The classes are in the following areas: (1) play analysis class, to understand what is to be acted; (2) acting class, to learn the application of basic acting techniques; (3) vocal production class, to improve vocal and articulation skills; (4) improvisation and mask class, to help free the imagination and to build confidence in spontaneous self-expression; (5) movement class, to strengthen the body and to encourage the use of the body for emotional expression; and (6) scene study class, to understand how the classes listed above come together when working on a scene. The instructors constitute a teaching staff of working professionals and are assisted by teaching associates giving the students individual attention. The summer drama program requires a full commitment of the student's time. Classes are held in the mornings, afternoons, and two evenings each week, Monday through Friday, with 26 to 28 classroom hours each week, 4 to 6 library hours each week, plus additional hours for individual tutorials and scheduled rehearsal time.

Emphasis on three critical eras and technologies: the Renaissance and the hand-press book, the nineteenth century and the rise of mechanized printing and mass distribution, and the current digital age, when long-held assumptions about books, publishing, and reading will be examined and far-reaching questions about literacy, distribution, global access and equity, and even cognitive science discussed. The course is taught as a seminar through a series of firsthand encounters with manuscripts, rare books, prints, and other primary sources, from the medieval period through the present day.

The social, cultural, and technological aspects of book publishing, production, and distribution from the fifteenth century to the present. Emphasis on three critical eras and technologies: the Renaissance and the hand-press book, the nineteenth century and the rise of mechanized printing and mass distribution, and the current digital age, when long-held assumptions about books, publishing, and reading will be examined and far-reaching questions about literacy, distribution, global access and equity, and even cognitive science discussed. The course is taught as a seminar through a series of firsthand encounters with manuscripts, rare books, prints, and other primary sources, from the medieval period through the present day. In addition, several class meetings will take place in other Yale collections that contain objects related to our study of the book as an instrument and agent of social change. 1 Credit.
