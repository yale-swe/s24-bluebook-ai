The Maghrib--Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya--has historically been a critical frontier zone linking Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. This crossroads remains strategically important with sub-Saharan and North African migration, political Islam, Arab-Berber identity, terrorism and counter-terrorism, the Sahara question, and Mediterranean trade relationships being current international concerns.  This course provides a thorough overview of North African history, the legacies of colonialism and nationalism, political systems and opposition, Islam in North Africa, and the Maghrib in the twenty-first century. Students will meet with local experts, interact with Moroccan university students, and be able to do optional home stays with Moroccan families. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Morocco, room and board costs in Morocco, and any other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: March 1. Enrollment limited.

In this joint studio with third-year students from Tsinghua University's School of Architecture, students will explore the programmatic, situational, and tectonic range of the Chinese courtyard house typology (the fundamental module of pre-1949 Chinese architecture and urbanism). The elasticity and persistence of this type will be explored in a series of radically different sites: a central Beijing hutong, a chain of rural villages in Shanxi Province, and the Forbidden City. Working in teams, students will use survey, analysis, and design exercises to engage each location. A final project will ask them to synthesize these diverse efforts (and sites) into a contemporary take on the typology. Must be taken in conjunction with ARCH S241. Prerequisite: an introductory course in architecture or drawing. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from China, costs of room and board, and all other expenses beyond tuition.

Students learn the narrative film form and its collaborative nature by participating in the production process. By screening classic narrative masterpieces they will gain a sense of the medium's historical and aesthetic context, as well as develop a common vocabulary and point of reference with their fellow collaborators. The students will begin with seminars, readings, and exercises that cover working with actors, script analysis, producing, camera, lighting, sound, and editing and then move on to an actual production where as a group they make a short HD movie. Film professionals from various areas of expertise instruct and guide students in the application of industry standards to the exercises and projects. The course is fully integrated with FILM S203 to provide filmmakers with a pool of acting talent and enable students to move beyond the technological requirements of the medium. This workshop requires a full daily commitment of the student's time, including 5 hours of classroom instruction, 2 hours of screenings, 1-2 hours of reading homework and workshop projects outside of class time and on weekends.

Students will learn Italian through classes and full-immersion in the study-abroad experience (including a homestay), and will explore the representation of Tuscany through the screening and close analysis of films where the Tuscan setting has been elevated to the level of a primary thematic concern. Among the films to be considered are Room with a View, Night of the Shooting Stars, The First Beautiful Thing, Tea with Mussolini, The Sky Is Falling, Life Is Beautiful, Sandra, Mar nero, Good Morning Babylon, Fiorile, and the Florentine episode of Paisa. Students who wish to continue with Italian are required to take a placement test in order to place into ITAL 120. Students may petition for one HU credit. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Siena, room and board costs in Italy, and any other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: March 1. Enrollment limited.

        "description": "Offered in Siena, Italy. The course will focus on close readings of a selection of short stories (novella) from the Decameron, the masterpiece of Giovanni Boccaccio. It will define the context of Boccaccio's narrative, placing it first of all in the cultural geography of Tuscany (Siena, Florence, Certaldo, his native town). Secondly, the discussion will explore Boccaccio's specific intellectual framework: the sense of nature; the place of human beings in the natural world; the value of medicine in the face of the Plague; the economy of the marketplace; the bourgeois ethos of selfishness, politics, tyranny, and power within the household (such as authority in the family, the place of women, sexuality). Using his native Tuscan vernacular, Boccaccio shaped his short stories and their frame to reveal the relationship between human passions, imagination, and literature. Taught entirely in Italian. Open to both Yale and non-Yale students. Prerequisite: ITAL 140, 145, or equivalent. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Siena, room and board costs in Italy, and any other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: March 1. Enrollment limited.

This crossroads remains strategically important with sub-Saharan and North African migration, political Islam, Arab-Berber identity, terrorism and counterterrorism, the Sahara question, and Mediterranean trade relationships being current international concerns. This course provides a thorough overview of North African history, the legacies of colonialism and nationalism, political systems and opposition, Islam in North Africa, and the Maghrib in the twenty-first century. Students will meet with local experts, interact with Moroccan university students, and be able to do optional home stays with Moroccan families. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Morocco, room and board costs in Morocco, and any other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: March 1. Enrollment limited.

        "description": "Three weeks in New Haven, five weeks in St. Petersburg. This course explores the cultural history of the imperial Russian capital, founded by Peter the Great in the early eighteenth century as a window on Europe. Since then, the city has been seen to embody all of the contradictions of Russia: East vs. West, imperial grandeur vs. the pathos of the little man, nature vs. civilization, free will vs. fate. The course considers the semiotics of Petersburg through a careful reading of selected literary texts, both prose and poetry, including Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Blok, Bely, Gumilev, Akhmatova, Mandelstam, Khlebnikov, Mayakovsky, Kharms, and others, as well as some works of literary and cultural criticism. The classroom sessions are complemented with a rich selection of excursions and tours in and around St.Petersburg. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from St. Petersburg, costs of room and board, and any other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: March 1. Enrollment limited. Must be taken in conjunction with either RUSS 130\/140 or RUSS S150\/151. For further information visit the Yale Summer Session website. 1 Credit. Tuition: see RUSS S130\/140 or RUSS S 150\/151.
