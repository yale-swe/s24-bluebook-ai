What has been the impact of increasing social diversity on forms of social control, crime and criminal justice policy?  This seminar explores these questions by examining the intersection of multiculturalism, crime and the criminal justice system.  Students will be introduced to major, relevant criminological and sociological concepts, theories and debates.  Class discussions will address contemporary social problems such as racial profiling, disproportionate punishment, mass incarceration and unequal justice.  Examples draw principally from the American but also from the British context, providing a comparative perspective. 1 Credit. Tuition: $3,000. Session B: July 4 - August 5.",

A range of tools are presented including scanning, digital cameras, retouching, color correction, basic composition, and inkjet printing. Students produce original work throughout the technical component of the class. After mastering the basics, students work toward the completion of a final project, and the focus of the remaining classes is on critiques. Throughout the term, lectures and presentations raise critical issues concerning the impact of digital applications and by-products on the medium of photography. Students must have access to a digital camera and bring it to class. Enrollment limited to 16 students. 1 Credit. Tuition: $3,200. Session B: July 4 - August 5.",

Emphasis on three critical eras and technologies: the Renaissance and the mechanically reproduced book, the nineteenth century and the rise of mass literacy and mass distribution, and the current digital age, when long-held assumptions about books, publishing, and reading will be examined and far-reaching questions about literacy, distribution, global access and equity, and even cognitive science discussed. The course is taught as a seminar at the Beinecke Rare Book Library through a series of first-hand encounters with rare manuscripts, books, prints, and other primary sources, from the medieval period through the present day. In addition, several class meetings will take place in other Yale collections that contain objects related to our study of the book as an instrument and agent of social change.  1 Credit.

An intensive, hands-on exploration of film history, theory and practice, offered in partnership with FAMU, the national film academy of the Czech Republic. At the core of the workshop is a sequence of exercises and projects that recapitulates the evolution of film language, from its silent beginnings through its classical period to its post-modern present. Each exercise and project, guided by instructors from FAMU and Yale, and supported by topical lectures, screenings and workshops, will advance the student's understanding of film as art, craft and cultural institution. Cultural trips and activities include: a one-day orientation program comprising a welcome lunch, a walking tour of Prague, and an inaugural dinner; a 10-day introductory language course; a weekend trip to Uhersk\u00e9 Hradiste for the opening weekend of the 37th annual Summer Film School, a unique film festival known throughout Europe for its energy and dynamism; and a celebratory farewell dinner. In the final week of the workshop, the student will draw on this understanding to produce a comprehensive final project. All instruction will be in English. Some previous film study is recommended, but not required. Enrollment limited to 16. Application deadline: February 1.

Emphasis on three critical eras and technologies: the Renaissance and the mechanically reproduced book, the nineteenth century and the rise of mass literacy and mass distribution, and the current digital age, when long-held assumptions about books, publishing, and reading will be examined and far-reaching questions about literacy, distribution, global access and equity, and even cognitive science discussed. The course is taught as a seminar at the Beinecke Rare Book Library through a series of first-hand encounters with rare manuscripts, books, prints, and other primary sources, from the medieval period through the present day. In addition, several class meetings will take place in other Yale collections that contain objects related to our study of the book as an instrument and agent of social change.  1 Credit.

Emphasis is on prediction of common patient problems, formulation of management protocols, and generation of research questions. The practice sites in acute, ambulatory, and\/or long-term settings provide an opportunity to observe system problems and develop clinical leadership strategies. Required for clinical nurse specialist students in the final year of specialization. Acute care nurse practitioner students must take 810c during the summer following 612b, unless they can demonstrate experience in caring for critically ill patients managed with complex technological interventions.

What has been the impact of increasing social diversity on forms of social control, crime and criminal justice policy?  This seminar explores these questions by examining the intersection of multiculturalism, crime and the criminal justice system.  Students will be introduced to major, relevant criminological and sociological concepts, theories and debates.  Class discussions will address contemporary social problems such as racial profiling, disproportionate punishment, mass incarceration and unequal justice.
