We will ask many questions of these texts, not the least of which is \"what do we mean when we say 'American?'\"  Given the wide range of the body of work that comprises American literature, however, we will also periodically ask in passing what we mean by \"literature,\" so as to consider what roles the literary plays in creating and shaping the possibilities of social imagination, private and public discourse, as well as one's own identity. Emphasis on analytical reading, critical writing, and class discussions. Authors include Melville, Poe, Hawthorne, Whitman, Dickinson, Barnes, Toomer, H. Crane, W. C. Williams, L. Hughes, and M.

Students learn the narrative film form and its collaborative nature by participating in the production process.

Film professionals from various areas of expertise instruct and guide students in the application of industry standards to the exercises projects. The course is fully integrated with FILM S203 to provide filmmakers with a pool of acting talent and enable students to move beyond the technological requirements of the medium. This workshop requires a full daily commitment of the student's time, including 5 hours of classroom instruction, 2 hours of screenings, 1-2 hours of reading homework and workshop projects outside of class time and on weekends.

Students begin with exercises that acclimate them to the tenets of good acting under the pressures and demands of the filmic medium. Then, with rehearsed scene work, they learn the technical language of cinema and they participate in various filmmaking practices. Their knowledge and techniques are tested by acting in one or more of the films produced by the Intensive Filmmaking Workshop. With the Filmmaking Workshop, the students screen classic narrative masterpieces nightly in order to gain a sense of the medium's historical and aesthetic context as well as to develop a common vocabulary and point of reference with fellow collaborators. Screenings, readings, and rehearsals supplement practical application. Daily commitments include, but are not limited to: 3-5 hours daily of classroom instruction, 2.5 hours of nightly screenings, 1-3 hours daily reading, rehearsal and shooting sessions outside of classroom time and on weekends.

At least one session will be devoted to an explicit comparison of the age of print and the current digital\/cyber age - sometimes referred to as the second \"Gutenberg Revolution.\" Did information in the Renaissance, as now, \"want to be free\"? The course is taught at the Beinecke Rare Book Library through a series of first-hand encounters with manuscripts, books, prints, and other rare objects, which students will use as part of their coursework.
