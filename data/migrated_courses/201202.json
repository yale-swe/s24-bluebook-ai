In this joint studio with 3rd year students from Tsinghua University's School of Architecture, students will explore the programmatic, situational and tectonic range of the Chinese courtyard house typology (the fundamental module of pre-1949 Chinese architecture and urbanism). The elasticity and persistence of this type will be explored in three radically different sites: a central Beijing hutong, a rural village and the Forbidden City.  Working in teams, students will use survey, analysis and design exercises to engage each location.  A final project will ask them to synthesize these diverse efforts (and sites) into a contemporary take on the typology. Must be taken in conjunction with ARCH S241. Prerequisite: an introductory course in architecture or drawing. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from China, costs of room and board, and all other expenses beyond tuition.

Focus on the source of each play's pathos and the nature of its poetic sublimity; some attention to performance and to the relation between the genres of history and tragedy. Extensive practice in writing short and medium-sized critical essays. Students should come to the first class having read Julius Caesar.   (The Signet edition,  ordered through The Yale Bookstore, is preferred, but the  Norton genre volumes are especially handsome  substitutions; the Arden single play editions are more than acceptable if their price is not intimidating.)  The regular course meetings will be supplemented by six  one-hour evening screenings, and students are required to attend at least three of these. 1 Credit. Tuition: $3,150.

The social, cultural, and technological aspects of book publishing, production, and distribution from the fifteenth century to the present. Emphasis on three critical eras and technologies: the Renaissance and the mechanically reproduced book, the nineteenth century and the rise of mechanized printing and mass distribution, and the current digital age, when long-held assumptions about books, publishing, and reading will be examined and far-reaching questions about literacy, distribution, global access and equity, and even cognitive science discussed. The course is taught as a seminar through a series of first-hand encounters with rare manuscripts, books, prints, and other primary sources, from the medieval period through the present day. In addition, several class meetings will take place in other Yale collections that contain objects related to our study of the book as an instrument and agent of social change.  1 Credit.

Surveys the history of Japanese film from the silent era, through the golden ages of the 1930s and the 1950s, up until the present, with particular emphasis on recent decades and films that students can relate to the Japan they experience on the streets. Cinema will be connected to various cultural phenomena, including theater, manga, television, comedy, fan subcultures, minority ethnicities, and literature. The focus will be on investigating the cultural significance of Japanese cinema, both within Japanese culture and in world film, particularly by examining how it has been located in divisions between the traditional and the modern, the national and the transnational, the individual and the group, and the private and the public. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Tokyo, costs of room and board in Tokyo, and all other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: February 1. Enrollment limited.

        "description": "An intensive, comprehensive hands-on workshop in which the problems and aesthetics of filmmaking are studied in practice as well as theory. Students learn the narrative film form and its collaborative nature by participating in the production process. By screening classic narrative masterpieces they will gain a sense of the medium's historical and aesthetic as well as develop a common vocabulary and point of reference with their fellow collaborators. The students will begin with seminars, readings and exercises that cover working with actors, script analysis, producing, camera, lighting, sound and editing and then move on to an actual production where as a group they make a short HD movie. Film professionals from various areas of expertise instruct and guide students in the application of industry standards to the exercises projects. The course is fully integrated with FILM S203 to provide filmmakers with a pool of acting talent and enable students to move beyond the technological requirements of the medium. This workshop requires a full daily commitment of the student's time, including 5 hours of classroom instruction, 2 hours of screenings, 1-2 hours of reading homework and workshop projects outside of class time and on weekends.  Enrollment limited to 16. For students in college or beyond only. 2 Credits. Tuition $6,100. More information on course web page: http:\/\/www.yale.edu\/summer\/film\/filmmaking.

Students begin with exercises that acclimate them to the tenets of good acting under the pressures and demands of the filmic medium. Then, with rehearsed scene work, they learn the technical language of cinema and they participate in various filmmaking practices. Their knowledge and techniques are tested by acting in one or more of the films produced by the Intensive Filmmaking Workshop. With the Filmmaking Workshop, the students screen classic narrative masterpieces nightly in order to gain a sense of the medium's historical and aesthetic context as well as to develop a common vocabulary and point of reference with fellow collaborators. Screenings, readings, and rehearsals supplement practical application. Daily commitments include, but are not limited to: 3-5 hours daily of classroom instruction, 2.5 hours of nightly screenings, 1-3 hours daily reading, rehearsal and shooting sessions outside of classroom time and on weekends.

Edward Said has characterized exile as \"the unhealthy rift forced between a human being and a native place, between the self and its true home.\" From this discrepant position in between spaces and cultures, exiled authors have developed a unique perspective on the intricate relationship between writing and national belonging. This course aims to introduce and discuss different experiences of exile in relation to gender, race and class as they have been filtered through French and Francophone literature and film throughout the twentieth century. We will examine different aspects of exile: dislocation and hybridity; the journey as metaphor; nostalgia and the trope of home; definitions of national and ethnic identities; diaspora; language and bi-lingualism. Authors and film makers include Tzara, Cesaire, Ionesco, Triolet, Sebbar, Benguigui.  Conducted in French. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Paris, costs of room and board in Paris, and all other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: February 1. Enrollment limited.

The social, cultural, and technological aspects of book publishing, production, and distribution from the fifteenth century to the present. Emphasis on three critical eras and technologies: the Renaissance and the mechanically reproduced book, the nineteenth century and the rise of mechanized printing and mass distribution, and the current digital age, when long-held assumptions about books, publishing, and reading will be examined and far-reaching questions about literacy, distribution, global access and equity, and even cognitive science discussed. The course is taught as a seminar through a series of first-hand encounters with rare manuscripts, books, prints, and other primary sources, from the medieval period through the present day.

        "description": "Offered in Siena, Italy. The course studies a number of plays of the Italian Renaissance within the context of theoretical debates on the genre and against the realities of the social world in the fifteen and sixteen centuries Tuscany.  More precisely, it will take as its point of departure Poliziano's play and will study the impact of both Aristotle's Poetics on the theatrical premises of the theater and the Florentine intellectual life of the late 15th century. We will then read two plays of Machiavelli, the Mandragola and the Clizia by relating them to the theatrical spectacles of Italian 16th century politics (and the Prince).\r\nBecause so many plays, such as Cecchi's L'assiuolo, were performed not only for festive tides such as Carnival and Epiphany, but also be popular and courtly entertainment we will read Ariosto's Negromante in the context of the traditions of sacre rappresentazioni, and the commedia dell'arte. Taught entirely in Italian. Open to both Yale and non-Yale students. Prerequisite: ITAL 140 or 145. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Siena, room and board costs in Italy, and any other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: February 1. Enrollment limited.

Surveys the history of Japanese film from the silent era, through the golden ages of the 1930s and the 1950s, up until the present, with particular emphasis on recent decades and films that students can relate to the Japan they experience on the streets. Cinema will be connected to various cultural phenomena, including theater, manga, television, comedy, fan subcultures, minority ethnicities, and literature. The focus will be on investigating the cultural significance of Japanese cinema, both within Japanese culture and in world film, particularly by examining how it has been located in divisions between the traditional and the modern, the national and the transnational, the individual and the group, and the private and the public. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Tokyo, costs of room and board in Tokyo, and all other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: February 1. Enrollment limited.

This course explores the cultural history of the imperial Russian capital, founded by Peter the Great in the early eighteenth century as a window on Europe.  Since then, the city has been seen to embody all of the contradictions of Russia: East vs. West, imperial grandeur vs. the pathos of the little man, nature vs. civilization, free will vs. fate. The course considers the semiotics of Petersburg through a careful reading of selected literary texts, both prose and poetry, including Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Blok, Bely, Gumilev, Akhmatova, Mandelstam, Khlebnikov, Mayakovsky, Kharms, and others, as well as some works of literary and cultural criticism. The classroom sessions are complimented with a rich selection of excursions and tours in and around St. Petersburg. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from St. Petersburg, costs of room and board, and any other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: February 1. Enrollment limited.
