        "description": "Since its invention in the 1890s, cinema has been closely linked to American history through its ability to reflect on and shape the course of current events. Films, as forms of mass entertainment, encapsulate the beliefs, values, struggles, and anxieties of both their audiences and creators. This course explores the ways in which films have critically engaged with the various cultural, social, technological, and economic issues that have defined the periods in history at which they were made. Students will learn to closely read a film while being attentive to the cultural implications surrounding its production and reception. The readings, screenings, and assignments will not only train students to learn how to deconstruct the artistic aspects of a film, but also broaden their understanding of American history. Historical periods and events to be discussed in class are Progressive Era politics, the Jazz Age, the Great Depression, the Second World War, Civil Rights, the Cold War, Vietnam, Reaganism, 9\/11, and the 2008 financial crisis. 1 Credit.

The challenges of the 21st century in protecting the tangible and intangible, cultural and natural heritage of the world are global in character and need to be also addressed on a global level. Cultural and natural heritage are increasingly threatened with destruction not only by the traditional causes of decay, but also by changing social and economic conditions. For example, in the last years we have seen the phenomena of cultural cleansing rising in the Middle East and Africa, while natural disasters have taken a toll and underlined the need to develop sustainable and global strategies for preservation. This course offers an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the complex factors that challenge the preservation of cultural heritage. Guest speakers with relevant expertise will be invited to participate in many of the class sessions. In addition, the course will draw on the collections of the Yale University Museums for discussion and as the basis of student assignments. 1 Credit. Tuition $4,050. Session B: July 2 - August 3..",

This seminar surveys the changing London found in influential works of British fiction since 1945, with an emphasis on this immigrant energy, though students also consider contemporary imaginings of the iconic city of the past. Starting with the Trinidadian author Samuel Selvon\u2019s 1956 novel, The Lonely Londoners, stopping in 1970\u2019s London in Hanif Kureishi\u2019s The Buddha of Suburbia, detouring through the reimagined Tudor city of Hilary Mantel\u2019s Wolf Hall (we\u2019ll visit Hampton Court), and ending with Zadie Smith\u2019s NW, students discover how class, language, and ethnicity interact with London\u2019s longer political and social past. Students discover the multicultural city in real time, as well, with visits to a variety of neighborhoods and landmarks related to the novels. Field trips are framed by short readings about observing urban life and a portfolio of classic London scenes from across two centuries of literature. In-class instruction on writing builds technical skills and inspires students to rethink how to experience the city.\u00a0",

We go back to prehistory, look at the medieval cult of death, and bring the story up to date with the issues of memorials to women.

It is also an agent of cultural definition and change and the site of ongoing explorations of personal and social identities. The public nature of theatrical performance, and its history of engagement with the city and its shifting populations, makes theatre a unique site and subject of study. Taking advantage of plays and performances in London in a variety of venues and formats, this course examines theatre and drama as aesthetic objects, social events, and cultural practices. It introduces methods for reading plays and reading performances, and investigates the various uses and functions that theatre serves within the contemporary cultural scene. As an introduction to the study of drama in performance this course presents key methodological questions and approaches for interrogating dramatic and theatrical performances, and encourages personal exploration of how theater functions and how meaning is created.\u00a0",

The classes are in the following areas: (1) play analysis class, to understand what is to be acted; (2) acting class, to learn the application of basic acting techniques; (3) vocal production class, to improve vocal and articulation skills; (4) improvisation and mask class, to help free the imagination and to build confidence in spontaneous self-expression; (5) movement class, to strengthen the body and to encourage the use of the body for emotional expression; and (6) scene study class, to understand how the classes listed above come together when working on a scene. The instructors constitute a teaching staff of working professionals and are assisted by teaching associates giving the students individual attention. The summer drama program requires a full commitment of the student's time. Classes are held in the mornings, afternoons, and two evenings each week, Monday through Friday, with 26 to 28 classroom hours each week, 4 to 6 library hours each week, plus additional hours for individual tutorials and scheduled rehearsal time. Extra evening and Saturday morning sessions may be scheduled for group activities and additional classes. A single grade will be awarded for the course. Enrollment is limited. Complete applications must include a resume of relevant experience and a letter of recommendation from a drama teacher or other theater professional. Application deadline: May 1. 2 Credits. Tuition $7,900. Session B: July 2 - August 3.",

Starting with the heyday of Edo when the city lent its name not only to the shogun\u2019s capital, already a thriving urban center of over a million inhabitants, but to the historical period itself (1604-1868), we will examine the city\u2019s reincarnation as the imperial metropolis of Tokyo in the Meiji period (1868-1912), the phoenix-like cycles of destruction and reconstruction through the Great Kanto Earthquake (1923), the firebombing of the city during WWII and other significant changes in the topography and lived experiences of the city. Particular emphasis will be given to contextualizing the classroom content with field trips to museums, historic neighborhoods and a hands-on experience of living in Tokyo. Enrollment limited.

The curriculum develops through a substantive theoretical component and a practical component, with on-site modules at the International Court of Commercial Arbitration in Paris. This course takes the existing institutions of trade and contract law seriously - students will, for instance, develop familiarity with everyday trading practices and basic legal rules of exchange - and then asks whether and how they facilitate efficient trade. A principal topic of the course will be contractual solutions to the hold-up problem. Starting from seminal articles in the bilateral trade literature and the literature on breach remedies, the course will introduce students to the most recent developments of the field. Prerequisite: ECON 121 (Intermediate Microeconomics), MATH 112 (Calculus of Functions of One Variable I), or permission of instructor. All instruction is in English. Enrollment limited. Application Deadline: February 15. Students are responsible for arranging travel to and from Paris and all other expenses beyond tuition. For further details visit the program page on the Study Abroad website. Credits: 2. Tuition: $7,900. Course Dates: June 25 - July 27.",

How might a regionalist sensibility manifest itself in narrative? In what ways do varying geographies \u2013 of New England, the South, the West \u2013 register in cultural texts, and in what ways do their respective literatures differ from one another? What exactly is \u201clocal color,\u201d and how is it presented \u2013 and preserved \u2013 textually? We will study the emergence of \u201cregionalism\u201d through texts from the height of the regionalist movement and will also consider whether regionalism can be considered a contemporary (or continuous) American literary phenomenon.

This course examines a wide range of place-based literature, from long-form city portraits to travel memoir excerpts. Readings by writers such as Ryszard Kapuscinski, Jan Morris, Leslie Jamison, and Pico Iyer will acquaint students with the techniques by which journalists and writers capture the essential qualities of a place. All instruction is in English. Enrollment limited. Application Deadline: February 15. Students are responsible for arranging travel to and from Auvillar and any other expenses beyond tuition.

        "description": "Since its invention in the 1890s, cinema has been closely linked to American history through its ability to reflect on and shape the course of current events. Films, as forms of mass entertainment, encapsulate the beliefs, values, struggles, and anxieties of both their audiences and creators. This course explores the ways in which films have critically engaged with the various cultural, social, technological, and economic issues that have defined the periods in history at which they were made. Students will learn to closely read a film while being attentive to the cultural implications surrounding its production and reception. The readings, screenings, and assignments will not only train students to learn how to deconstruct the artistic aspects of a film, but also broaden their understanding of American history. Historical periods and events to be discussed in class are Progressive Era politics, the Jazz Age, the Great Depression, the Second World War, Civil Rights, the Cold War, Vietnam, Reaganism, 9\/11, and the 2008 financial crisis. 1 Credit.
