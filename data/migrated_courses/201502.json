Blending classroom instruction on NUS Kent Ridge campus with hands-on fieldwork in Singapore, Cambodia and Thailand, SEA in Context offers modules on Southeast Asia with anthropological, historical and archaeological concentrations. The core module, SE2222: Southeast Asia in Context provides a broad overview of Southeast Asia from a historical, sociological, and anthropological perspective. Its partner module, SE2880A: Southeast Asia's Cultural Mosaic, will equip students with the analytical tools for the comparative study of society and culture, and features a 10-day field trip to various religious, cultural, and archaeological sites in Cambodia and Thailand. Both modules deploy context-based learning by combining in-class instruction at NUS campus with local and regional hands-on experience of Southeast Asian life. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Singapore, costs of room and board, and all other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: February 15. Enrollment limited.

In this course it is used to denote both the attempts to modernize the city itself, as well as its inhabitants' experiences of the ambiguities of life in the biggest city the world has ever known. How London coped (or failed to cope) with the social and environmental problems created by its enormous size is one of the early questions explored in the course. Other key themes are: the local and the global, sexual scandal, popular entertainment, consumer culture, the experience of war, and the development of a multi-racial society. The fashion, food and popular music of London emerge as important components of the city's global identity in the 20th century. Students will come to see today's London as a complex product of development and destruction, viewing it more as historians than mere tourists.",

        "description": "Exploration and development of the fundamentals of the actor's craft based on the principles of Stanislavski. The course is actually a concise training program in which each student takes more than one class. The classes are in the following areas: (1) play analysis class, to understand what is to be acted; (2) acting class, to learn the application of basic acting techniques; (3) vocal production class, to improve vocal and articulation skills; (4) improvisation and mask class, to help free the imagination and to build confidence in spontaneous self-expression; (5) movement class, to strengthen the body and to encourage the use of the body for emotional expression; and (6) scene study class, to understand how the classes listed above come together when working on a scene. The instructors constitute a teaching staff of working professionals and are assisted by teaching associates giving the students individual attention. The summer drama program requires a full commitment of the student's time. Classes are held in the mornings, afternoons, and two evenings each week, Monday through Friday, with 26 to 28 classroom hours each week, 4 to 6 library hours each week, plus additional hours for individual tutorials and scheduled rehearsal time. Extra evening and Saturday morning sessions may be scheduled for group activities and additional classes. A single grade will be awarded for the course. Enrollment is limited. Complete applications must include a resume of relevant experience and a letter of recommendation from a drama teacher or other theater professional. Application deadline: May 1. 2 Credits. Tuition $7,000. Session B: July 6 - August 7.",

Emphasis on three critical eras and technologies: the Renaissance and the hand-press book, the nineteenth century and the rise of mechanized printing and mass distribution, and the current digital age, when long-held assumptions about books, publishing, and reading will be examined and far-reaching questions about literacy, distribution, global access and equity, and even cognitive science discussed. The course is taught as a seminar through a series of firsthand encounters with manuscripts, rare books, prints, and other primary sources, from the medieval period through the present day. In addition, several class meetings will take place in other Yale collections that contain objects related to our study of the book as an instrument and agent of social change. 1 Credit.

        "description": "The basic building block of a movie is a well-crafted scene. It instructs the screenwriter\/filmmaker in a visceral and tangible way as to what does and does not work in production.This class focuses on the anatomy of a motion picture scene using the tools, craft, technical, and creative methods required to translate the written word to a visual language. Students learn filmmaking -- script analysis for production preparation: producing, budgeting scheduling, camera aesthetics and techniques, directing, working with actors, lighting, sound design, editing and media management. The course is a comprehensive collaborative journey using material previously produced and critically recognized in order to allow students to explore the contribution of the producer, director, cinematographer, sound designer, and editor. The emphasis is as much on process as product. Each student works collaboratively on multiple scenes over the course of the semester in each of the above mentioned crew positions. The pace of the course assumes some prior technical familiarity with digital HD cameras, field sound recording, competency with HD workflow and final cut non-linear editing: however, the course begins with detailed seminars in each of the crew positions before productions begin. The goal of the class is to go through a practical professional procedure of creating scenes from the perspective of key crew positions as if it were a complete motion picture, thus enabling the students to understand, absorb and solve their own work. Limited to 16 students. 2 Credits. Tuition: $7,000. Session B: July 6 - August 7.",

Is there really a fundamental difference between low or even sexual desires and those higher forms that art can provide us with?\u00a0 And is it true that dreaming is as close to suppression and wish fulfilment, as film is said to be? What does this tell us about our dreams - and about art? Apart from theoretical texts (including Freud, Jung, Fechner) class will treat painting (from Raffaello to Dali), Photography (from Man Ray to Jeanloup Sieff) and Literature (From Rousseau to Doeblin), as well as opera and film. 1 Credit.

What constitutes the experience in the arts? And what separates our desires in the real world from the pleasures art promises us? Is there really a fundamental difference between low or even sexual desires and those higher forms that art can provide us with? And is it true that dreaming is as close to suppression and wish fulfillment as film is said to be?Apart from theoretical texts (including Freud, Jung, Fechner) class will treat painting (from Raffaello to Dali), photography (from Man Ray to Jeanloup Sieff) and literature (from Rousseau to Doeblin), as well as opera and film. 1 Credit.
