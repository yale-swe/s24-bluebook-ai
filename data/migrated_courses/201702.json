The challenges of the 21st century in protecting the tangible and intangible, cultural and natural heritage of the world are global in character and need to be also addressed on a global level. Cultural and natural heritage are increasingly threatened with destruction not only by the traditional causes of decay, but also by changing social and economic conditions. For example, in the last years we have seen the phenomena of cultural cleansing rising in the Middle East and Africa, while natural disasters have taken a toll and underlined the need to develop sustainable and global strategies for preservation. This course offers an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the complex factors that challenge the preservation of cultural heritage. Guest speakers with relevant expertise will be invited to participate in many of the class sessions. In addition, the course will draw on the collections of the Yale University Museums for discussion and as the basis of student assignments. 1 Credit. Tuition $3,900. Session B: July 3 - August 4.",

        "description": "Offered in Singapore. This course is part of the International Alliance of Research Universities' Global Summer Program. Southeast Asia in Context is a five-week exploration of Southeast Asia\u2019s geographical, historical and cultural diversity. This course takes advantage of Singapore\u2019s strategic position in offering a unique blend of classroom instruction at the NUS campus with hands-on fieldwork in other SE Asian countries. The lecturers are experienced teachers and researchers of Southeast Asia, who will explore themes such as Southeast Asian religion, archaeology, rural development, politics and regional integration. The field trip includes visits to magnificent ancient temples, rural agricultural communities, war memorials and a fair sampling of local village life that is well off the usual tourist track. Participants study two modules (choose 2 out of 3 elective modules) on Southeast Asian Studies with an anthropological and historical concentration. The first elective module, \"SE2222: Southeast Asia In Context\" provides a broad overview of Southeast Asia. The other two elective modules, \u201cSE2880A: Southeast Asia's Cultural Mosaic\" and \u201cSE3214: Marketing Southeast Asia\u2019s Heritage\u201d, will equip students with the analytical tools for the comparative study of society and culture. SE2880A features a 7 to 9-day field trip to various religious and cultural sites in Indonesia while SE3214 will bring students to various field trips in Singapore. All three modules deploy 'context-based' learning by combining in-class instruction at NUS campus with local and regional hands-on experience of Southeast Asian life. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Singapore, costs of room and board, and all other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: February 15. Enrollment limited. For further information visit the Study Abroad program page. 1 Yale Credit and 1 NUS Credit. Tuition: $4,810. Course dates: June 17 - July 22.",

Corruption occurs where fundamental institutions are weak or poorly designed, while situation-specific incentives make corruption tempting, and personal ethics are malleable. This course examines the economic, cultural, and political causes and consequences of corruption; cross-country comparisons of corruption levels; and examples of successful reforms and policies to combat corruption in bureaucracy and business. This summer, the textbook and the course materials have been updated. For college students and beyond. Prerequisite: ECON 110 or 115, or equivalent. 1 Credit. Tuition: $3,900. Technology fee: $85.

The internship experience sometimes serves as a basis for the M.P.H. thesis. The internship is displayed on the transcript with a grade of \"S\" (Satisfactory) upon completion. A course unit is not given for the summer internship. All students, with the exception of those in the Advanced Professional M.P.H. Program and the Accelerated M.B.A.\/M.P.H. Program, must complete an approved Summer Internship. The Summer Internship may be used to complete the practice requirement for the M.P.H. degree with prior approval from the Office of Public Health Practice.",

Students will then embark on pitching, outlining and writing their own scripts. We will intensively focus on character development, creating \"cinematic\" dialogue, plot construction, conflict, pacing, dramatic foreshadowing, the element of surprise, text and subtext and visual story-telling. Several classic and contemporary films will first be read and then screened for analysis and discussion. (Psycho, Chinatown, Blade Runner, Winter's Bone, The Devil Wears Prada, The Social Network). Students will learn professional screenplay format and write an 8-12 page screenplay that will be read aloud in class and critiqued. Enrollment limited to 15. 1 Credit. Tuition: $3,900.

        "description": "Must be taken in New Haven. May be arranged for currently enrolled Yale students only. Independent Research in the Summer consists of special projects set up by the student in an area of particular interest with the help of a faculty adviser and the director of undergraduate studies, intended to enable the student to cover material not otherwise offered by the department. The course may be used for research, design projects, or for directed reading, but in all cases a term paper, written report on the research project, or its equivalent is normally required as determined by the faculty advisor and DUS. The student must meet regularly with the faculty adviser. Students wishing to enroll must complete the regular application for Yale Summer Session. In addition, students must submit written permission of (1) the faculty advisor, who should also supply a 1- or 2-paragraph description of the research to be undertaken including the proposed starting and ending dates, (2) the Director of Summer Sciences for students in STEM, or the Dean of Summer Session for students in the Humanities or Social Sciences, and (3) the director of undergraduate studies of the applicant's major department. All approvals may be submitted via email to summer.session@yale.edu with IDRS S300 and the student\u2019s name in the subject line. Students taking Independent Research in the Summer for 1 credit should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for five weeks (either Session A or B); for 2 credits students should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for ten weeks (both Session A and B). Students may receive academic credit only if they are not being paid for doing research, but they may work for credit in one 5-week period and for pay in the other. 1 Credit. Tuition: $3,900. Session A: May 29 \u2013 June 30\/Session B: July 3-August 4.",

Students also identify appropriate software, tools, and communication techniques essential for leading an interprofessional team from inception to completion of the project within and across health care systems or other organizations. The tools and processes learned in this course will support work toward the subsequent capstone experience. Taught as an intensive during the summer intersession. Required of D.N.P. students in the first year.",

This course provides a critical overview of the historical and contemporary health and health disparities research, relevant literature, and policies as essential context for understanding how to achieve health equity. The social and biological determinants of health and health disparities are also critically examined in light of political, economic, cultural, legal, and ethical issues. Selected health and health disparities population-based data are examined as a foundation for explicating how subpopulations experience disparate health across the life span. Students examine how past and current policies (state, federal, tribal), politics, population-based data findings, and selected frameworks enhance or act as barriers to achieving health equity with diverse populations, systems, and\/or communities. Additionally, students design an organizational policy plan for achieving population health and health equity within a health system, organization, and\/or community-based health system.",
