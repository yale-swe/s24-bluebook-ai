Sessions will be structured around ten films, each an entry point into a broader topic, such as the Fifth and Sixth Generation directors; the Hong Kong New Wave; New Taiwan Cinema; martial arts film; commercial blockbuster; and independent documentary. Directors of interest include Jia Zhangke, Zhang Yimou, Ang Lee, Wong Kar-Wai, Ann Hui, Tsui Hark, Edward Yang, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Tsai Ming-Liang, and Wang Bing. We will examine their films formally, through shot-by-shot analysis, as well as in relation to major social, political, and economic developments in recent Chinese history. We will also consider pertinent questions of propaganda and censorship; aesthetics and politics; history and memory; transnational networks and audiences; and what constitutes \"Chineseness\" in a globalized world. 1 Credit.

The course will provide a survey for students so that at the end they will understand the major themes and developments in the history of the Middle East starting from the end of the 18th century to the last decades of the 20th century. The course will specifically track the development of the modern state in the Middle East through the reforms of the late Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, to the creation of the mandate system after WWI, and to the rise of the Arab nationalist states and Gulf monarchies during the cold war. Throughout the course students will encounter the entangled histories of state-making in the Middle East and the various areas in which these histories intersect with discussions about Islam, orientalism, colonialism, imperialism, oil, and gender. All this aims to provide students with a comprehensive basis for understanding the modern Middle East. This course will combine various mediums for online learning including synchronous teaching and live lectures, small group discussions, walk-throughs of digital archives, and documentary films related to the making of the modern Middle East. 1 Credit.

We will engage the concept of modernism and the formation of modern art as an art historical category through a global, cross-cultural perspective. The course proceeds chronologically, aiming to trace conceptual through-lines as well as disjunctures. Students will develop skills in close visual observation and analysis through class discussion and gallery visits. Half of each session will be spent at the Yale University Art Gallery or the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. These sessions will introduce students to relevant objects in the Yale collections, offering them first-hand encounters with the material being covered. Gallery visits include time for individual observation, group discussion, and writing exercises designed to encourage close looking. Writing assignments will familiarize students with the process of art historical research, emphasizing object-based inquiry.\u00a0\u00a01 Credit.\u00a0 Technology Fee: $85. Tuition: $4,350.

Analyzing why revolutions occur, how to start them, how to end them, and sometimes how to prevent them became a chief pursuit of thinkers like Edmund Burke, Karl Marx, and Hannah Arendt. But their theories of revolution didn\u2019t always coincide with revolutionary practice. This gap between theory and practice is our general theme as we survey the intellectual and cultural history of the French Revolution, the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, the Paris Commune of 1871, the Russian Revolutions of 1905 and 1917, the failed revolutions of 1968, and finally the series of \u201cvelvet revolutions\u201d that brought about the collapse of the Soviet bloc starting in 1989. Other themes include the construction of revolutionary catechisms, the formation of revolutionary subjects (e.g., the working class, oppressed minorities, dissidents), the writing of manifestos, tactics (e.g., conspiracy, propaganda, violence), and the relationship between vanguard parties and mass movements. Together we\u2019ll read a graphic biography of the Polish revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg, look at radical avant-garde artwork, and listen to the militant songs that inspired past generations of European revolutionaries.\u00a01 Credit.

Must be taken pass\/fail. May not be taken as part of a senior project or be deemed to be constituent of the senior requirement. Independent Research in the Summer consists of special projects set up by the student in an area of particular interest with the help of a faculty adviser and the director of undergraduate studies, intended to enable the student to cover material not otherwise offered by the department. The course may be used for research, design projects, or for directed reading, but in all cases a term paper, written report on the research project, or its equivalent is normally required as determined by the faculty advisor and DUS. The student must meet regularly with the faculty adviser. Students wishing to enroll must complete the regular application for Yale Summer Session. In addition, students must supply a 1- to 2- paragraph project description of the research to be undertaken, written in collaboration with the faculty advisor, including the proposed starting and ending dates.\u00a0 The student must also submit written permission of (1) the faculty advisor, (2) the Director of Summer Sciences for students in STEM, or the Dean of Summer Session for students in the Humanities or Social Sciences, and (3) the director of undergraduate studies of the applicant's major department. All approvals may be submitted via email to summer.session@yale.edu with IDRS S300 and the student\u2019s name in the subject line. Students taking Independent Research in the Summer for 1 credit should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for five weeks (either Session A or B); for 2 credits students should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for ten weeks (both Session A and B). Students may receive academic credit only if they are not being paid for doing research, but they may work for credit in one 5-week period and for pay in the other. Upon completion of the course, the faculty advisor must submit a substantive report that both describes the nature of the independent research and evaluates the student\u2019s performance in it.\u00a0 The report must include the grade. These reports should be shared with the student and the director of undergraduate studies in the department or program in which the research is based and kept in the office of the student\u2019s residential college dean. Applications are due: Session A by May 4 and Session B by June 8. 1 Credit. Technology Fee: $85. Tuition $4,350. Offered in Session A: May 25 - June 26 and Session B: June 29 \u2013 July 31.",

The course will provide a survey for students so that at the end they will understand the major themes and developments in the history of the Middle East starting from the end of the 18th century to the last decades of the 20th century. The course will specifically track the development of the modern state in the Middle East through the reforms of the late Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, to the creation of the mandate system after WWI, and to the rise of the Arab nationalist states and Gulf monarchies during the cold war. Throughout the course students will encounter the entangled histories of state-making in the Middle East and the various areas in which these histories intersect with discussions about Islam, orientalism, colonialism, imperialism, oil, and gender. All this aims to provide students with a comprehensive basis for understanding the modern Middle East. This course will combine various mediums for online learning including synchronous teaching and live lectures, small group discussions, walk-throughs of digital archives, and documentary films related to the making of the modern Middle East. 1 Credit.

        "description": "Online Course. As an introduction to sociological perspectives on social movements, this course is about how people act collectively to challenge the status quo of powerful political, economic, and cultural systems that resist change. Social movements that challenge such systems vary widely in terms of their group identities, social locations, strategies for action, particular demands, and tactics. In this course, we will consider a range of historical and contemporary case studies like the U.S. civil rights movement, the labor movement, \u201cnew\u201d social movements in the 1960s (like the feminist and gay rights movements), the Tea Party and its challengers, and the Movement for Black Lives. We will approach these movements through concepts like: Solidarity, Organization, Mobilization, Identity, Resources, Framing, Collective Memory, Narrative, Networks and Organizations, Forms of Protest, and Performance. Though our case studies are mainly American, we will pay close attention to the ways that collective behavior and protest in the U.S. matters globally. And we will also consider how the internet and social media have changed social movements by investigating the roots and future prospects of movements represented by hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo. 1 Credit.
