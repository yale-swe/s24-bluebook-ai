An intensive, hands-on exploration of the history, theory, tools and techniques of narrative filmmaking offered jointly by Yale and FAMU, the national film and television academy of the Czech Republic. The program interweaves a Yale seminar, in which students learn the fundamental principles and techniques of cinematic storytelling via readings, screenings, discussions and creative exercises, and a FAMU practicum in which students expand and apply the knowledge acquired in the seminar in hands-on workshops and the production, in small groups, of four short film projects: a silent film shot and edited on 16mm film, a classical scene shot on FAMU's state-of-the-art soundstage, a chase film shot on the streets of Prague, and a location-inspired final film. Students choose either FILM or ART credit. All instruction is in English. Enrollment limited. Application deadline: February 15. Students are responsible for arranging travel to and from Prague and all other program expenses beyond tuition.

The course moves chronologically from the early years of the twentieth century to the advent of the headline-grabbing \u2018Young British Artists\u2019 (YBAs) in the 1990s, focusing on major artistic trends and their significance in the broader cultural history, a period marked by tremendous energy, rebellion and innovation. Drawing on the collections in numerous museums, galleries and art colleges across London, this course will be a mix of classroom discussions and field trips responding to art objects and both primary and secondary textual sources.",

There is a lot more art in mathematical modeling than is commonly acknowledged and improvisation plays a significant role. The artistic aspects are important and intellectually engaging because they often lead to a deeper understanding. This course provides a general introduction to engineering analysis and to chemical engineering principles. Material will include the derivation of governing equations from first principles and the analysis of these equations, including underlying assumptions, degrees of freedom, dimensional analysis, scaling arguments, and approximation techniques. The goal of this course is to obtain the necessary skills for improvising mathematical models for a broad range of problems that arise in engineering, science and everyday life.

Students will study, with particular emphasis on economic efficiency, the design of these contracts and the body of law that governs them. The curriculum develops through a substantive theoretical component and a practical component, with on-site modules at the International Court of Commercial Arbitration in Paris. This course takes the existing institutions of trade and contract law seriously - students will, for instance, develop familiarity with everyday trading practices and basic legal rules of exchange - and then asks whether and how they facilitate efficient trade. A principal topic of the course will be contractual solutions to the hold-up problem. Starting from seminal articles in the bilateral trade literature and the literature on breach remedies, the course will introduce students to the most recent developments of the field. Prerequisite: ECON 121 (Intermediate Microeconomics), MATH 112 (Calculus of Functions of One Variable I), or permission of instructor. All instruction is in English. Enrollment limited. Application deadline: February 15. Students are responsible for arranging travel to and from Paris and all other program expenses beyond tuition.

There are only two plots in all of literature, claimed the late John Gardner: the story of a journey, and of a stranger coming to town. Most travel literature is both: the story of a journey as well as a tale of a stranger, stepping into an alien land. This course examines a wide range of place-based literature, from long-form city portraits to travel memoir excerpts. Readings by writers such as Ryszard Kapuscinski, Jan Morris, Leslie Jamison, and Pico Iyer will acquaint students with the techniques by which journalists and writers capture the essential qualities of a place. All instruction is in English. Enrollment limited. Application deadline: February 15. Students are responsible for arranging travel to and from France and all other program expenses beyond tuition. For further details, such as program costs, exact dates, credits, etc., visit the program page on the Yale Study Abroad website.",

The program interweaves a Yale seminar, in which students learn the fundamental principles and techniques of cinematic storytelling via readings, screenings, discussions and creative exercises, and a FAMU practicum in which students expand and apply the knowledge acquired in the seminar in hands-on workshops and the production, in small groups, of four short film projects: a silent film shot and edited on 16mm film, a classical scene shot on FAMU's state-of-the-art soundstage, a chase film shot on the streets of Prague, and a location-inspired final film. Students choose either FILM or ART credit. All instruction is in English. Enrollment limited. Application deadline: February 15. Students are responsible for arranging travel to and from Prague and all other program expenses beyond tuition.

Students will then embark on pitching, outlining and writing their own scripts. We will intensively focus on character development, creating \"cinematic\" dialogue, plot construction, conflict, pacing, dramatic foreshadowing, the element of surprise, text and subtext and visual story-telling. Several classic and contemporary films will first be read and then screened for analysis and discussion. (Psycho, Chinatown, Blade Runner, Winter's Bone, The Devil Wears Prada, The Social Network). Students will learn professional screenplay format and write an 8-12 page screenplay that will be read aloud in class and critiqued. Enrollment limited to 15. 1 Credit. Tuition $4,200.

May not be taken as part of a senior project or be deemed to be constituent of the senior requirement. Independent Research in the Summer consists of special projects set up by the student in an area of particular interest with the help of a faculty adviser and the director of undergraduate studies, intended to enable the student to cover material not otherwise offered by the department. The course may be used for research, design projects, or for directed reading, but in all cases a term paper, written report on the research project, or its equivalent is normally required as determined by the faculty advisor and DUS. The student must meet regularly with the faculty adviser. Students wishing to enroll must complete the regular application for Yale Summer Session. In addition, students must submit written permission of (1) the faculty advisor, who should also supply a 1- or 2-paragraph description of the research to be undertaken including the proposed starting and ending dates, (2) the Director of Summer Sciences for students in STEM, or the Dean of Summer Session for students in the Humanities or Social Sciences, and (3) the director of undergraduate studies of the applicant's major department. All approvals may be submitted via email to summer.session@yale.edu with IDRS S300 and the student\u2019s name in the subject line. Students taking Independent Research in the Summer for 1 credit should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for five weeks (either Session A or B); for 2 credits students should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for ten weeks (both Session A and B). Students may receive academic credit only if they are not being paid for doing research, but they may work for credit in one 5-week period and for pay in the other. Upon completion of the course, the faculty advisor should submit a substantive report that both describes the nature of the independent research and evaluates the student\u2019s performance in it.

        "description": "Must be taken in New Haven. May be arranged for currently enrolled Yale students only. Must be taken pass\/fail. May not be taken as part of a senior project or be deemed to be constituent of the senior requirement. Independent Research in the Summer consists of special projects set up by the student in an area of particular interest with the help of a faculty adviser and the director of undergraduate studies, intended to enable the student to cover material not otherwise offered by the department. The course may be used for research, design projects, or for directed reading, but in all cases a term paper, written report on the research project, or its equivalent is normally required as determined by the faculty advisor and DUS. The student must meet regularly with the faculty adviser. Students wishing to enroll must complete the regular application for Yale Summer Session. In addition, students must submit written permission of (1) the faculty advisor, who should also supply a 1- or 2-paragraph description of the research to be undertaken including the proposed starting and ending dates, (2) the Director of Summer Sciences for students in STEM, or the Dean of Summer Session for students in the Humanities or Social Sciences, and (3) the director of undergraduate studies of the applicant's major department. All approvals may be submitted via email to summer.session@yale.edu with IDRS S300 and the student\u2019s name in the subject line. Students taking Independent Research in the Summer for 1 credit should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for five weeks (either Session A or B); for 2 credits students should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for ten weeks (both Session A and B). Students may receive academic credit only if they are not being paid for doing research, but they may work for credit in one 5-week period and for pay in the other. Upon completion of the course, the faculty advisor should submit a substantive report that both describes the nature of the independent research and evaluates the student\u2019s performance in it. These reports should be shared with the student and the director of undergraduate studies in the department or program in which the research is based, and kept in the office of the student\u2019s residential college dean. 1 Credit.

The first term of a yearlong (with 787b) practicum that provides students with clinical experience in data-gathering techniques, diagnostic reasoning, management of acute and chronic health problems, application of technology in patient care, consultation, collaboration, health promotion, and risk factor modification. This course builds upon the foundational objectives successfully met in 784b. The differential diagnosis and treatment of complex health problems commonly seen in acutely ill adult\/gerontology patients are stressed, with special emphasis on conditions presented in 783b and 785a. The focus is on those acute illnesses with a predictable course and established treatment approaches. Students have the opportunity to manage a caseload of patients from admission through discharge, as well as follow patients on an outpatient basis. A one-hour weekly clinical conference addresses acute care clinical issues. Required of all adult\/gerontology acute care nurse practitioner students in the final year. Preceptors are A.P.R.N.s and physicians. Twenty-four hours per week in an acute care setting for fifteen weeks.

Social movements that challenge such systems vary widely in terms of their group identities, social locations, strategies for action, particular demands, and tactics. In this course, we will consider a range of historical and contemporary case studies like the U.S. civil rights movement, the labor movement, \u201cnew\u201d social movements in the 1960s (like the feminist and gay rights movements), the Tea Party and its challengers, and the Movement for Black Lives. We will approach these movements through concepts like: Solidarity, Organization, Mobilization, Identity, Resources, Framing, Collective Memory, Narrative, Networks and Organizations, Forms of Protest, and Performance. Though our case studies are mainly American, we will pay close attention to the ways that collective behavior and protest in the U.S. matters globally. And we will also consider how the internet and social media have changed social movements by investigating the roots and future prospects of movements represented by hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo. 1 Credit.

        "description": " Chekov In Performance is a studio based exploration of the world of Anton Chekhov, focusing on acting technique through scene work as well as character analysis and development. The class will consist of close reading, rehearsal, research presentations, and occasional performance. This course is meant to promote truthful talking and listening, living moment to moment, a willingness to take risks regardless of outcome, playing from impulses in oneself and the text, personalizing circumstances and a better understanding of how to develop character. The course will use scenes from IVANOV, THE SEAGULL, UNCLE VANYA, THE THREE SISTERS and THE CHERRY ORCHARD to launch into an exploration of The Five Questions which stem from Stanislavsky\u2019s work with Chekhov. While progressing through a sequence of short scenes and then longer scenes, the stress will be on understanding an acting technique that hinges upon an experiential exchange of energy between actors in pursuit of objectives. 1 Credit. Tuition $4,200. Session A: May 27 - June 28.",
