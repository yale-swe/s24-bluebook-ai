I thought the assignments could have been more productive and interesting, but they became a bit difficult to write because it often seemed like Professor Goff gave unclear rubrics with different amounts of questions to answer and it was stressful to feel like I could be knocked off several points for being more subtle or inexplicit. Often, I felt I was sacrificing fluidity in my writing to answer questions more plainly/make unnecessary separate points. \r\nThat being said, Professor Goff is an outstanding lecturer.

We were asked to do discussion questions every week, which is perfectly normal. But in a lot of other classes, the discussion questions are sent in the day before section, not on Monday at the beginning of the week. So I would have to gloss over the readings just to get these questions in by Monday at 5 pm, even though my section was later in the week, and I didn&#39;t have time to fully engage with all the readings. Furthermore, the way that we engaged with the readings was very frustrating. Maybe I&#39;m just too used to sections where we start off on a point, and then naturally flow from there until we either need to hit another point or we run out of things to say, but sections for this class were essentially another lecture, rather than a moment to actually discuss things. It felt much too academic, especially in a class where I expected things to be a little bit more personal.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow37_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11380&amp;evaluatorId=1533932&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pag55&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1533932</span>\n                        1533932\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1533932</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I really enjoyed the discussion sessions</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow38_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11380&amp;evaluatorId=1533946&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pag55&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1533946</span>\n                        1533946\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1533946</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This class was strong because the lectures were very interesting and pretty engaging.

Furthermore, as someone who was sick often this semester and often had to miss sections/assignments, Prof. Goff and my TA were extremely helpful and accommodating. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the only weakness I would say is the discussion questions. Because you have to do 2 for each reading with an average of 3 readings per week (6 Qs total), it&#39;s an assignment that often took me a ton of time given the depth of the readings and my urge to make the discussion questions thoughtful. However, I would&#39;ve been more engaged with the assignment/readings had the discussion questions not been due every Monday at 5pm. Because my section wasn&#39;t until later in the week and the readings were supposed to stretch across both classes, it felt counterintuitive to have the questions due all on Monday as opposed to before section. I am not sure what the best solution would be, as I understand this is a way to ensure all students read the material, but perhaps having only 1 question for each reading or even 2 things per reading where one can be a reflection/interesting quote/passage and the other can be a question.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow46_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11380&amp;evaluatorId=1537888&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pag55&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1537888</span>\n                        1537888\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1537888</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The topic is, of course, of the utmost relevance.

Both the TFs and Prof. Goff were also very responsive to questions by email and were truly willing to meet, which was extremely helpful.\r\nOne weakness is that the sections were very short, and we rarely had time enough to discuss all of the readings in much detail. Another small issue might be the slightly imprecise nature of the weekly &quot;critical reading question&quot; assignment: some general guidance around that would have been appreciated.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow47_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11380&amp;evaluatorId=1539319&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pag55&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1539319</span>\n                        1539319\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1539319</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The readings were well supplemented by the lecture content, but the reading content tended to be dense, making it harder to contribute accurately and effectively in section; however, it did make for a really engaging section environment as we were often faced with hard questions that forced us to really think.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow48_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11380&amp;evaluatorId=1540957&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pag55&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1540957</span>\n                        1540957\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1540957</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Pros: Section helped a lot with hammering out the ideas explained in lecture, prof.

A good paper (if you got 4/5 in every category of the rubric for the midterm you got a 80% which seemed quite steep). However I am very fine with how this class progressed and that would never make me regret the course</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow49_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11380&amp;evaluatorId=1541797&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pag55&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1541797</span>\n                        1541797\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1541797</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Honestly, this class was amazing and it could be improved by having more support for the course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow50_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11380&amp;evaluatorId=1544282&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pag55&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1544282</span>\n                        1544282\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1544282</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>There were too many readings assigned that sometimes did not feel necessary--the lectures easily summarized them and much more clearly.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow51_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11380&amp;evaluatorId=1546056&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pag55&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1546056</span>\n                        1546056\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1546056</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Walking into class I knew the lecture would always be engaging.

Professor Goff was also excellent in office hours, he made time to meet with students and gave me super helpful and specific feedback when I went to meet with him.\r\nWeaknesses: First off, my section always let out at least 15 min late every single session. I would recommend that sections are an extra 20 or so minutes, so we could get through everything we wanted and still get let out on time.\r\nSecond, section wasn&#39;t super helpful. The readings were quite difficult and so sometimes I felt like I wasn&#39;t getting as much out of the readings as I could when we didn&#39;t talk about them in section. I personally think the one person presenting the readings at the beginning of each section was a waste of time. In my section we all just covered information that everyone had probably already gotten themselves. I would recommend more of a 3 key insights type of structure to keep it shorter to not waste so much time and also actually useful to the other students.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow53_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11380&amp;evaluatorId=1547133&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pag55&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1547133</span>\n                        1547133\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1547133</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Stengths:\r\n- environment to challenge your/other&#39;s beliefs about race and racism\r\n- participation!!\r\n- Dr. Goff&#39;s superb lectures\r\n- some very interesting readings on the syllabus\r\n- sections were (mostly) awesome\r\n- making critical questions was super helpful for digesting the reading material\r\n- academic freedom with papers\r\n- recorded lectures\r\n- music at lecture\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- in section, I experienced that non-POC students in the class were not as comfortable contributing (as well as some unwelcoming comments from other students in the class that would promote this)\r\n- would have found example papers from previous semesters to be helpful</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow54_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11380&amp;evaluatorId=1549628&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pag55&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1549628</span>\n                        1549628\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1549628</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>A weakness was that sometimes the lectures were just a recap and did not give much additional information to the readings which were extremely long.

Treating racism as something to diagnose implies that it is like an illness. That is, that it&#39;s a problem from individuals and not a structural problem. The approach of this class to try to quantify racism through psych studies seems to be more of an appeal to white academics who don&#39;t experience racism themselves than a constructive way to actually understand how racism functions.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow60_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11380&amp;evaluatorId=1556333&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pag55&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1556333</span>\n                        1556333\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1556333</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: The content was very interesting and relevant overall. \r\nWeaknesses: Dr. Goff goes really quickly during lectures and it&#39;s sometimes hard to follow the flow of what he&#39;s saying.

This is a fantastic course. As an Asian-American, I feel like I learned a whole lot about racism, not only toward Asian-Americans, but also toward Black, Latinx, and Native people. This class has given me the historical and theoretical understanding and the vocabulary to diagnose racism in my own life. I&#39;m really grateful to have this knowledge and to be able to apply it to my future work. \r\n\r\nI felt a little uncertain about taking this class at first -- this was my first class in the AFAM/ER&amp;M/PSYC domain, but it was a great intro class tailored to anyone interested in the subject. I especially encourage other Asian-Americans to take this class -- there weren&#39;t too many other Asian-Americans enrolled in the class this semester, but it is so valuable to have been in this class to understand how racism operates intricately to affect life for Asian-Americans in this country.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow1_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11380&amp;evaluatorId=1521021&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=pag55&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1521021</span>\n                        1521021\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1521021</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Absolutely.

The amount of subconscious and conscious learning that happened was astounding. You are truly made to feel as though you can explore racism, ask questions, and have different opinions, which was incredibly refreshing.

You would think for a survey course about racism that we would at least read about the history of racism so that it becomes abundantly clear that race and racism are social constructs and are not innate or quantifiable to people. Instead, we spent much of the course reading psych studies of white academics trying to make &quot;formulas for racism&quot; than talking about how racism is created and constantly changing to systemically oppress and exploit people of color. Meanwhile the studies that we read for this class that are &quot;more credible&quot; in generalizing how racism works than a person&#39;s first-hand experience have less participants in them than the half empty lecture room each class session. We spent three weeks on understanding methodology in an intro level survey class about racism while we barely even spent 10 minutes on topics like anti-Black racism from nonwhite people, colorism, defining race as a social construct, or engaging with any history. \r\n\r\nWe spent more time sympathizing with the mental health of racists in this course than we do with talking about how the mental health of people of color is impacted by racism. We had a whole unit on &quot;White Injury&quot; where we read a couple of psych studies telling us how racists actually experience negative effects from being racist while we completely ignored the wellbeing of people of color actually experiencing racism.\r\n\r\nWhat is also frustrating about this course is how we addressed topics like intersectionality, but we didn&#39;t read a SINGLE WORD from Kimberl Crenshaw herself. Same thing goes for DuBois who we also read about but not from. The short piece we read by Stuart Hall was about the only piece that wasn&#39;t a psych study that was by a Black author. The readings in general were uninteresting because they were either psych studies with bad methodologies or some random person summarizing scholarship from other academics. I would have maybe been more invested if we actually read more scholarship from Black academics themselves and not some random person telling us about them. \r\n\r\nOverall, this class is the definition of clickbait. If you want to actually learn what racism is and how to tell if something is racist, take literally ANY good AFAM or ER&amp;M class instead.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow65_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11380&amp;evaluatorId=1556333&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=pag55&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1556333</span>\n                        1556333\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1556333</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would recommend this course to another student!
