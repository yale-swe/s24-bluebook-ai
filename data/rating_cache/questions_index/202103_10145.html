Toolkit lectures were also extremely helpful, providing insight on many of the basic lab techniques often blindly followed out of convention, rather than understanding. The level at which I engage with biology and biological research papers has improved significantly. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Assignments frequently contained ambiguous, poorly-worded questions that seemed designed to trip up students, rather than test their understanding of the material (particularly on lecture quizzes, and also many pset questions). When faced with these inconsistencies/ambiguities, instructors went to incredible lengths to wriggle their way out of taking responsibility for the mistakes, often providing lengthy, convoluted explanations that made little sense. The grading policy followed suit, with points taken off for things that no student could have foreseen without having the grading rubric sitting in front of them when answering the question. Given these items, along with the withheld lecture recordings, nonstop assignments, and high level of stress among us students, it seems inconceivable to me that the assignments in this course were designed with the goal of facilitating learning in mind.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow2_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1521475&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1521475</span>\n                        1521475\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1521475</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Weaknesses: \r\n-Discussion sections: Despite being essential for the quizzes and the PSETs, discussion sections were not carried out in a time-efficient manner (always running over by 10-15 minutes) and did not place enough emphasis on the explanations for figures or important points of the paper (frequently flashing the slides for only a few seconds or skipping them entirely [extremely detrimental to students who need to read or see something to process information]).\r\n-Lectures: Always extremely longwinded and the presentation slides, despite having access to them, were not very helpful as they were organized in a confusing manner. \r\n\r\nOverall, the structure of the class made it extremely difficult to learn anything.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow3_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1521962&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1521962</span>\n                        1521962\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1521962</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course could be made an actual cell biology course as the title of the class suggests instead of a lab techniques course.

Mark stops for questions which is great, but the course is too ambitious on the amount of material. This also means he moves too fast for an intro sequence.

Lecture seemed clear enough, but then the problem sets and lecture sets seemed to require much more detail and knowledge than was covered in lecture. In particular, the lecture quizzes seemed less like an assessment of our knowledge and how well we could follow the lecture content, but more a collection of confusing, badly worded true/false questions so that the professor could trick as many students as possible. This was true for many other assessments, and felt like this class was supposed to weed people out. The TAs were great at answering questions, but the grading did also seem much harsher than in 101 on psets in particular. The peer tutors were also very helpful. Finally, since this is labelled to be a course on cell biology, there is a remarkable lack of the topic, rather focusing on research methods and landmark papers. I personally liked this approach as it seems more useful in the long run, but it is potentially worrying that we are not getting a good basis of cell bio for future classes or exams like the MCAT. To be clear, I believe that professor Mooseker and the bio 102 team are all very nice people and want to help and teach us, but the ways in which they do so are not effective. They should remember that this is an introductory biology course for many people whose high school classes did not have nearly the same workload or preparation, and this course should certainly not follow bio 101.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow9_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1525277&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1525277</span>\n                        1525277\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1525277</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course could definitely be improved by adding more structure.

Strengths: Apart from the mental struggle at every lecture, I LOVED the course!

Prof Mooseker is very humorous in lectures and his &quot;high-tech demonstrations&quot; are HILARIOUS. Profs Hartman and Mooseker are very available via Ed Discussion and email, and Prof Mooseker hosts weekly review sessions, which I have found very helpful. Feedback on problem sets is usually given ~1.5 weeks after they are due, so you&#39;ll probably only get the first grade before the withdrawal deadline (as it&#39;s a half-semester course), but otherwise, it&#39;s been quite timely.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow11_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1525538&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1525538</span>\n                        1525538\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1525538</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course is taught far above an introductory level course.

In class, the professor leaves time to have students do pair-share exercises and strengthen their understanding of the material, and he also encourages students to ask questions. Additionally, the discussion sections are very helpful for building a deeper understanding of the papers that we read in class, and the peer tutoring and professor office hours make it easy for students to get help on the material they don&#39;t understand. \r\nI think the biggest area of improvement is the pace of the class. We cover over 100 slides a week, and the sheer quantity of material we cover on any given day can be overwhelming. I completely understand that all the concepts are necessary for us to develop a full understanding of cell biology, so my suggestion would be to try consolidating the slides such that there are maybe 40-50 slides per lecture. That way, the professor could spend a little bit more time explaining where we are in the cell at any given time and what exactly is happening in a specific organelle or process.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow13_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1526629&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1526629</span>\n                        1526629\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1526629</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: The TAs and the review sessions definitely helped to reinforce the large amount of content covered in lectures. Mooseker&#39;s skits during class also were very entertaining and showcased the information in a novel way. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The content was not cohesive, the lectures were taught too fast-paced, the lecturing was confusing, full of jargon, and not conducive to an introductory level class where many students do not possess previous extensive cell bio knowledge. The papers were also very old, which would be fine except I feel like it defeats the whole purpose of journal clubs being a way to showcase new research. The research that we went over was decades old. The PSETs also varied greatly in difficulty, and the questions were often too expository and not straightforward. The grading on the PSETs was also very harsh, which caused frustration for both the TAs and the students. There was also concerns of cheating, especially on the take-home exams, which was partly because some of the PSET questions were recycled from previous years. Punishment for cheating was that points would get docked, which is not harsh enough. Combined with the fact that PSETs were recycled, this encourages more cheating and is not representative of an honest or fair system. I think this was also an area of frustration for many students. This course could be improved by actually making it an introductory cell biology course, having better worded PSETs, and a more fair system in terms of cheating. I also believe that better communication between the professors, TAs and the peer tutors is needed, because often one or the other would give students inaccurate information for the PSETs.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow14_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1527665&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1527665</span>\n                        1527665\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1527665</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The lecture was rushed.

Another strength of the course was the collaborative PSETS, which I found very engaging and that they deepened my understanding of the material. The non-collaborative psets however were too difficult to complete without collaborating in my opinion, leading some to cheat. I did not cheat, and I felt that I was at a disadvantage. The lecture quizzes were also much too difficult. Professor Mooseker said in lecture that if you skim the lecture slides, you should get a 100%. This was simply not the case for me. I attended every lecture and took notes, and went through the slides painstakingly as I completed the quizzes, and my scores were still very inconsistent. They were not a good indicator of whether you paid attention in lecture and read the papers, and I think this is what someone was referring to when they called them useless.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow16_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1527983&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1527983</span>\n                        1527983\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1527983</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Horrible lectures, I fell asleep in almost every single one of them.

The lead-up for each pset question was also extremely long, often multiple paragraphs chockful of scientific jargon. In addition, during lectures, Professor Mooseker tends to use a lot of scientific jargon, which makes it very difficult to stay engaged, let alone understand what he is talking about. The topics in cell biology are also very specific and geared towards Professor Moosekers interests. (For example, we learned about different types of microscopes for the first one and a half lectures and about cell membranes for two weeks.)</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow25_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1534280&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1534280</span>\n                        1534280\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1534280</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course was honestly terrible.

I always felt I was on an almost equal playing field with students who had already taken AP bio or some other bio course before Yale because I could take my time on the PSETs and collaborate with my peers to better understand the concepts. I think exams would greatly diminish learning while promoting significantly more stress for students. I enjoyed the current format.\r\n\r\nBIO 102 is not an introductory biology course. Many TAs have even joked about the course&#39;s high level concepts, stating it was similar to the material taught in graduate level courses. Because of this, students just don&#39;t get the concepts. It&#39;s too complex and far outside our current scope of knowledge. Having never taken biology before coming to Yale, I feel as though I still lack basic fundamental knowledge about the cell, which Professor Mooseker simply never covered. The course must be simplified, or be replaced by a true introductory course. I would also get rid of the quizzes.

Professor Mooseker tends to go through the information like we already know what he&#39;s talking about, so I don&#39;t think it was a fair assessment to give a lecture based without letting us see the lecture; replaying and rewinding the lecture while doing the lecture quizzes allows us to synthesize the information MUCH better than just staring at semi-complete notes from lecture. Also, info in lecture was not always easy to grasp. It took a lot of effort to fully synthesize the material.

Besides learning black and white facts about certain topics, the lectures barely gave any help to any students for outside work.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow42_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1541397&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1541397</span>\n                        1541397\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1541397</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The material was really interesting.

I also thought there were way too many people in my section (I think this was because a lot of people that needed to switch their section on a given week switched into mine) so I hope the teaching staff will be aware of that issue going forward.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow43_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1541481&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1541481</span>\n                        1541481\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1541481</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Lectures were hard to follow</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow44_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1542348&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1542348</span>\n                        1542348\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1542348</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think that the class should be completely restructured to actually teach cell biology.

Professor Mooseker is clearly a kind and brilliant man but I do not think he is the right person to teach Bio 102, given it is an introductory course.

I say this because this course is not well designed to facilitate student learning. Each week, the lecture consisted of content that was way above the level of an introductory course (I say this as someone who has taken AP and IB Bio HL). There was a large focus on laboratory techniques, which was interesting, but I was often lost. The layout of BIOL 101 was much better as it was organized around Key Concepts, and the lectures were genuinely at the level of an introductory biology course. BIOL 102 would benefit from more structure and cohesion as opposed to its currently disparate strands of topics in cell biology. Professor Mooseker is incredibly knowledgeable in his field, and he injects a lot of humor into his lectures which was much appreciated.

Professor Mooseker is really smart and kind, and he tries his best to make the lectures engaging, but I think he often forgets that this may be the first cellular biology course that some of his students are taking. He often uses technical words that students have never heard of or learned about and expects you to know some concepts that were not taught in BIOL 101. However, he has great reviews in higher-level courses, so I think this is a result of the fact that he engages with biology at such an advanced level in his research and upper-level classes that he doesn&#39;t always realize his students are only at the beginning of their journey of learning biology. Also, I think the course focuses too much on experimental techniques. They were important for reinforcing concepts, but I think there should be more direct explanations.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow73_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1547791&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1547791</span>\n                        1547791\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1547791</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The lecture was not engaging and I found the textbook to be unhelpful.

She is very reachable and is always happy to answer questions and help her students. \r\n\r\nAnother strength of this course were the take-home exams. As we had all week, it greatly reduced the stress and we could take our time and and go through all our notes and handouts to solve the problems. Although these were challenging, the answers were always somewhere in the lectures notes.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course were Prof. Mooseker and his lectures. He began this course by saying that people often complain that he uses too much jargon and goes too fast. He then continued to use too much jargon and go WAY too fast. I would say that half the class was lost during lecture and had no idea what was going on half the time. Although we could clap if we wanted him to slow down, that wouldn&#39;t slow it down enough and we cannot clap the whole lecture, even though we SHOULD because he simply zooms through every slide.

Lectures went through a relatively thorough outline of each cellular process studied and discussion sections were helpful in understanding key concepts each week. The course grading is formatted to emphasize problem sets and does not include closed-book, sit-down exams; the process of completing a complex problem set each week was instrumental in fortifying and internalizing content from the course. Two problem sets were non-collaborative &quot;take-home exams&quot;, and having days to do these assignments while reviewing notes and making critical connections between concepts was more helpful to truly understand cellular processes than would have been memorizing cursory information for an exam. The content in this course is generally pretty interesting and researching cell biology seems like a compelling field to explore in the future. Enrichment, discussion sections, and office hours mean that course professors and the teaching team are available to students for smaller-group and one-on-one discussions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While lectures are theoretically organized by concept and process, the way that content is covered during each lecture can be somewhat confusing, as steps are often not clearly laid out or labeled (sometimes the focus is primarily on proprietary methods or interesting facts which seem tangential to the processes themselves). Thus, lectures can be somewhat hard to follow and significant energy is sometimes required when reviewing lecture slides after-the-fact to fill in all of the gaps. Reviewing content between lectures and while completing problem sets is really helpful, but just attending lectures without more review can leave students a bit behind in terms of conceptual understanding. Sometimes the grading on problem sets felt a bit uneven between graders, but professors were incredibly available and willing to hear questions and concerns. BIOL 102 is definitely more challenging than BIOL 101 in terms of conceptual difficulty and thought organization, but there are tools available to further understanding.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow95_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1548211&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1548211</span>\n                        1548211\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1548211</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>A strength of this course was how we covered very specific topics in depth rather than covering general information about cell bio.

The organization of the course was good, and instructors were always happy to receive feedback.\r\nCons: organization of lectures. There was one lecture that I vividly remember, around Week 5, that almost everyone walked out confused after. I didn&#39;t like that, because many lectures were like that. I wish lectures were crystal clear in their content and the expectation of knowledge for each slide. The lectures also had too much content, where not all of it was entirely relevant. I&#39;d also say that the monotony of psets reached its peak quickly. I would appreciate more ways to engage with the material. Finally, I did NOT like how long it took to get back PSET grades, because you didn&#39;t get your grades back before the next PSET was due, meaning that it was really hard to incorporate feedback or get a sense of your grade for a while in the course. TO my knowledge, there were a very small amount of graders, and I wonder if that could change in the future. I would appreciate seeing more resources for each module beyond the textbook to facilitate understanding after lectures.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow101_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1548437&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1548437</span>\n                        1548437\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1548437</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The problem sets were engaging and challenging, but the discussion sections felt like little more than verifying we&#39;d read the papers and clearing up any confusion therein.

There seemed to be too much information to cover, such that the professor claimed we were behind on just the second day of class. We were even forced to skip Unit 2 at the beginning of the course and then most of the last unit towards the end of the course. We were expected to learn information that was completely new and also gain a very deep understanding of it within just a few days before we were asked to take quizzes on it each week. There were enrichment classes that were offered in addition to the course for anyone who felt they were unprepared for the material being taught in class, however this seems to defeat the purpose of BIOL 102 being and introductory biology course. By the end of the course, even those who had taken AP and IB biology courses in high school were wishing they had taken enrichment because the course material was too much to keep up with. The amount of information we were expected to learn made it difficult to really retain any deep understanding of the concepts after we had submitted the weekly quiz and PSET. The course also included two non-collaborative PSETs that accounted for a large portion of the final grade. Rather than being an effective tool for assessing knowledge obtained throughout the course, these only put honest students at a disadvantage against the large number of students who collaborated despite the warning, the same holds true for the non-collaborative lecture quizzes. \r\n\r\nI think this course could be improved by limiting the level of detail we are expected to know about each concept we are taught, and instead focus on developing an understanding of the various biological mechanisms work and the importance of their function. This would allow the course to still be challenging and teach all of the concepts that are necessary to gain an understanding of cell biology, while giving students a manageable amount of information to learn. Making all of the PSETs collaborative while maintaining the non-collaborative lecture quizzes could also help remove the large advantage many students gained by collaborating on assignments that were worth a large portion of the final grade.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow107_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1548773&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1548773</span>\n                        1548773\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1548773</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strength - loved the professor. \r\nWeakened  dont feel like I god great feedback and the grading system was different per TA.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow108_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1548842&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1548842</span>\n                        1548842\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1548842</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: teaches you that science is open-ended; teaches you to think for yourself\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures can get a bit long, especially considering that it overlaps with lunchtime.\r\nImprovements: change the lecture time</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow109_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1548887&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1548887</span>\n                        1548887\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1548887</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Prof. Mooseker is the strength of the course.

Much of the content was interesting, but the lectures moved quickly and were nearly impossible to keep up with, especially because they used lots of jargon that I was unfamiliar with. As an introductory class that assumes no background in biology, I wish there had been a more thorough explanation of the terminology used in lectures. Though I appreciated Professor Mooseker letting students ask questions during the lecture, only a very few students actually did so, and their questions were (from my perspective) usually not indicative of the average student&#39;s understanding of the material - often, I and many students I knew did not understand the questions themselves, let alone their answers. While I&#39;m sure such complicated and leading questions were interesting, regularly hearing them discouraged me and other students from asking more basic questions. \r\n\r\nThe content itself was impressively detailed for a class of predominantly underclassmen, but I think I would have gained more from a less detailed, slower, and more broad overview of cellular biology, especially because this is an intro class in the fundamental biology sequence. Even after taking the class, I don&#39;t feel that I have a strong grounding in cellular biology as a whole; instead, I have a shaky understanding of a couple of topics in detail.\r\n\r\nThe problem sets and quizzes were also very complicated and difficult. Though I paid close attention and took thorough notes in lecture, I struggled on the quizzes that often had questions hinging on subtle differences in vocabulary that I missed despite paying attention. For the problem sets, I spent a lot of time reading directly from the lecture slides, as that was the only way I had a potential of answering the questions, but I didn&#39;t fully comprehend most of the content they were dealing with.\r\n\r\nThe strongest part of the class, to me, was the use of biology papers for the discussion section. Though at first I felt overwhelmed with reading actual scientific literature for the first time, I ultimately improved a great deal at reading and comprehending papers even when I was unfamiliar with the subject. This was made possible though the help of my Teaching Fellow. One suggestion regarding the papers is that the very first one we were given was one of the hardest to understand, while some of the easiest were read later. It might be a smoother introduction to scientific literature if the first assigned paper were easier.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow121_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1552978&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1552978</span>\n                        1552978\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1552978</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>During lecture, there is a lot of information given to us, but sometimes it feels like a lot of it is unnecessary and can be condensed or simplified.

The weakness is just how fast we have to move through the material, which is hard to remedy without sacrificing other important material. Also, though the lecture slides are extremely helpful when it comes time to review for the quizzes and problem sets, during lecture it is a little overwhelming having so many slides and content on each slide.

It was really hard to keep up with the content because it seemed like if you didn&#39;t immediately grasp one small fact at the beginning of the lecture, the entire rest of it would not make sense.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow125_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1556090&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1556090</span>\n                        1556090\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1556090</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course covered important lab techniques in cell biology.

I wouldn&#39;t say it was the most enjoyable experience because the class is advertised as an introduction to cellular biology, but you are expected to know things significantly beyond the scope of what I would consider a general understanding of cellular biology. In fact, the class focuses heavily on teaching students cellular biology through experiments, which makes the process even more confusing for students that haven&#39;t gotten the basics down. I personally took more than one biology course in high school, which made it easier to work through the course, but I had several classmates who understandably felt that the course expected you to know way too much, and I&#39;m not sure why an introductory biology course is so heavily focused on experimental techniques rather than thoroughly giving students an understanding of the biological concepts. I think the experiments were interesting and undoubtedly reinforced several of the course&#39;s concepts, but they should not be the only medium for introducing important concepts. In other words, your experience with this class will vary heavily on how much biology you already know.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow72_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1547791&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1547791</span>\n                        1547791\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1547791</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would recommend it if there was a different lecturer.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow73_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1547799&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1547799</span>\n                        1547799\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1547799</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yeah</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow74_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10145&amp;evaluatorId=1547802&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1547802</span>\n                        1547802\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1547802</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>If you want a harder bio class, sure.
