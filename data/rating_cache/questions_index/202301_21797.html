It was also very meaningful in how it made me reflect about my new life, changes, and philosophical reflections.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow52_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1675339&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1675339</span>\n                        1675339\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1675339</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Paying close attention to word choice and sentence length; how to use different techniques to maximize the impact of a piece and have it resonate with readers; how to be concise in my writing/storytelling</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow53_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1675383&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1675383</span>\n                        1675383\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1675383</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>You get a lot of practice writing quickly and at a regular frequency (once per day). I enjoyed exploring similar themes in my writing, going deeper into the same topics over the course of several weeks, writing about similar things multiple times. I found that it&#39;s very helpful for me to constrain the writing: a prompt with specific guidelines, like &quot;use only one-syllable words,&quot; would lead to better writing than the &quot;free prompts,&quot; most of the time. Similarly, I would crank out a great theme on the days when I waited until there was only an hour left before the deadline, compared to the days when I had all day to write slowly and chip away at it. I also found that it helps immensely to try to form a full theme in my head, or at least the general feeling of one, before starting to write. To make sure that I don&#39;t just have one good sentence in mind, but rather a few sentences, the rough sketch of the ark of the theme, how it starts and ends, how it ties together, and best of all, when it connects to something strange and unexpected, that&#39;s when I would enjoy the writing most. Lastly, I found it extremely helpful to speak out loud while writing. Either reading my writing, or treat the exercise as a dialogue, where my writing is in response to a question a friend has just asked... These are some of my main insights from the course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow54_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1676804&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1676804</span>\n                        1676804\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1676804</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I became a much better writer through daily practice.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow55_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1679769&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1679769</span>\n                        1679769\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1679769</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>What writing styles suit me well and which ones are more challenging.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow56_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1681194&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1681194</span>\n                        1681194\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1681194</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I really improved my writing, got to explore lots of different styles and developed my own style.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow57_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1681295&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1681295</span>\n                        1681295\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1681295</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>How to write in different, new, and better ways</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow58_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1682341&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1682341</span>\n                        1682341\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1682341</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I became better at picking good ideas or experiences to write about and piecing them together.

No other class of which I am aware has a 1 hr 50 min lecture--and for good reason. It is hard to make that an productive experience sitting and listening. I wonder if the class could meet multiple times a week for shorter times, or if there might be time in lecture for tutors and tutee groups to meet and discuss things in smaller groups?

The class must be radically improved to increase student learning and enjoyment in order to retain students next year.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow31_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1669338&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1669338</span>\n                        1669338\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1669338</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: consistency in assignment expectations\r\nWeaknesses: boring professor and few creative prompts</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow32_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1670037&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1670037</span>\n                        1670037\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1670037</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I did what it set out to do: teach quick writing skills and help build discipline.

The fact that it is an hour and fifty minute lecture is an insane waste of time. Lectures were redundant and unhelpful. Because of how terrible lecture is, the quality of the class rests far too much on the quality of your tutor and if you, like me, have a terrible tutor, then this class becomes terrible. The prompts of this class might just be the worst part. Prompts were not in any way, shape, or form prompting. They were simply small constraints (if constraints at all) to put on the form of your pieces. This class requires an immense amount of creativity on the part of the writer. I had heard amazing things about the lectures in years past that helped bolster creativity when you were at home writing but the version of this course of this year (2023) is completely devoid of that. The deadline is also terribly unflexible. For some some reason to reach the goal of habit in your writing, every one is required to submit by 9 AM instead of being able to set their own deadline that would work the best with their writing and their own schedule. If the emphasis is on forming a habit, there&#39;s no reason students shouldn&#39;t be able to set their own deadline.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow36_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1673497&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1673497</span>\n                        1673497\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1673497</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Great format if youre into it, can be hard to come up with what to actually write about though</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow37_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1673502&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1673502</span>\n                        1673502\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1673502</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Some of the prompts were great but others felt like they were looking for a trick/performance rather than good writing</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow38_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1673505&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1673505</span>\n                        1673505\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1673505</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I thought the prompts were good - flexible while also encouraging us to try new things.\r\nThe X-Themes chosen seemed to conform to a type; I would have liked to see a wider range of students&#39; writing.\r\nThe lectures could have been more succinct.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow39_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1673507&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1673507</span>\n                        1673507\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1673507</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course could use better lectures that try to give specific pieces of advice on writing rather than offering examples.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow40_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1673516&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1673516</span>\n                        1673516\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1673516</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I wish this course was more easily accessible online.

Many were along the lines of &quot;Write a theme that includes a periodic sentence,&quot; or &quot;Write a theme that includes a catalogue of negatives.&quot; This wasn&#39;t all of the themes - others asked for a character sketch, or a monologue, or something more nebulous - but most of them asked for some particular structure related to the focus of the week. I think these kinds of prompts were helpful, they pushed me to think about different aspects of writing, but I wouldn&#39;t have minded a few more content-focused prompts, maybe pushing me to write in different genres, or just allowing for an easier time coming up with ideas.\r\n\r\nThe lectures were helpful in that they highlighted various examples of the techniques we talked about, but at times I felt like I could just read the lecture handout without the lecture itself and get almost as much out of it. I don&#39;t really have a suggestion for something to do differently, though - having a professor talk for two hours about a general topic in writing might just be a bit awkward regardless of how it&#39;s done. The guest lectures definitely felt more focused, though, I think because the professors had particular theories or ideas they wanted to get across, rather than, for example, a general understanding of metaphor.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow56_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1674592&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1674592</span>\n                        1674592\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1674592</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: You write every day.

I usually ended up only having 3 or so pieces I was proud of a week, and around 2 that I just phoned in cause I needed to write about something. Maybe it was just a heavy workload semester for me already and people with lighter workloads enjoyed the 5 days a week, but I would have preferred less. Additionally, while I like that you can write about whatever topic for each piece, as someone who struggles to think of something unique to write about 5 times for 12 weeks, it would have been nice to have some optional prompts to get the gears turning on what I could write about. Strengths: It taught me to really appreciate what goes into writing and how to better read others writing. Not merely focusing on the content or meaning of the writing, but how to appreciate the style and form that the writing takes. The system of meeting with a tutor every week to go over your writing is amazing and has led to a greater improvement in my writing than any other course I have taken at Yale.

Weaknesses: The lectures were often not the most engaging (though I loved the guest lecture by Derek Green). While I appreciated Professor Ehrgood&#39;s emphasis on connecting the lectures to the prompts, during most lectures, we read excerpts from 10-20+ page packets, and not much explanation was given as to why the excerpts we read were good. I would have appreciated a more standard pedagogical lecture format like Professor Green&#39;s, in which the professor gave us clear tools to use in our writing and explained exactly how to incorporate them. More student engagement would also be wonderfulperhaps students could gather in smaller groups and read their pieces to each other, or the professor could give out prompts and have some structured time to write in class. We spent a long time reading X themes aloud as well, which often showcased only a sliver of students&#39; writing and had similar voices/subject matter; I think the time would be better served if students read the X themes on their own time. Lastly, perhaps having a break in the middle of the lecture period or hosting &quot;happenings&quot; would increase lecture attendance.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow60_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1675339&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1675339</span>\n                        1675339\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1675339</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: the 1-on-1 tutor meetings!

Tutor feedback varies significantly, so while some may be helpful, you cannot count on their feedback being at the level of feedback offered by any other Yale writing class. The biggest serious weakness I felt in this class is its lack of discrepancy regarding missed themes and extensions. In this class, late work = missed work. Beyond the allotted 5 skips and 3 late themes, you need a Dean&#39;s Extension for late work. This means that when life gets in the way, you need to think about whether your problem can be validated by a Dean within 24 hours to meet the deadline. For every theme you hand in late, you lose a third of the final grade for the class. Perhaps the allotted skips and late themes are designed for you to save for the whole semester until a disaster arises, although no one plans for that to happen and I don&#39;t feel that this was how they were advertised. When I became ill, a Dean&#39;s Extension didn&#39;t cover the entire time I was sick; in my case, while unwell, I grinded out the themes so that my grade wouldn&#39;t tank over the course of a single week. Because of the daily deadlines, after a semester of handing in themes, it would only take a week of illness to go from an A to a C+. In any other class, I&#39;d be able to talk to my TF and work out a suitable schedule.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow65_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1679734&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1679734</span>\n                        1679734\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1679734</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The biggest strength of the course is the writing tutors.

This is not to suggest that there can&#39;t be technical instruction in daily themes  there should be  but rather that the instructions were unclear and the weeks were repetitive in their prompts. Prof Ehrgood spent too long each class reading out the X themes and some of the excerpts rather than explaining why these things might fit what we&#39;re trying to achieve or what makes it a good literary device, for example.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow71_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1684706&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1684706</span>\n                        1684706\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1684706</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The structure of the course is really good in theory. My main suggestion would be trying to adjust the way tutors are assigned. I appreciate that they were random -- I think the random assignments helped it feel less competitive and intimidating. However, my tutor and I were so different in terms of our interests, writing styles, and personalities that it made working together difficult, and I unfortunately did not get much out of the meetings. I know other students had really good experiences with my tutor, and I know of other tutors who I think I would have gotten along much better with. I wonder if there could be a system where students indicate certain genres or subjects they especially like to write, or even certain writers they particularly like. Then maybe tutors could indicate generally what genres or subjects they&#39;d particularly like to teach. Even if the tutors could just request a few subjects they don&#39;t like teaching, it would help avoid situations like the one my tutor and I were in (where my favorite subject to write about was one of his least favorite to read). I&#39;m sure it must be really difficult to assign tutors in a way that is fair and non-competitive, and I appreciate the benefit of being taught by a reader very different from your usual readers, but I think it would help a lot of students if there were a way to assign the tutors just a bit more deliberately, or at least to try to avoid particularly opposing pairings.</td>\n            </tr>\n

So, if you&#39;re interested in taking the class, take the class -- it is really rewarding -- but know what you&#39;re getting into.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow20_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1658013&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1658013</span>\n                        1658013\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1658013</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes!</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow21_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1659286&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1659286</span>\n                        1659286\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1659286</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Take the course if you can commit to it.

Daily Themes relies on students to set their own goals for writing. &quot;Write a theme with a list in it&quot; is a constraint, and a useful constraint, but it doesn&#39;t tell you what your theme should accomplish (e.g. catch a reader&#39;s interest, convey a particular emotion, explain the concept of entropy, process emotions around a breakup). Students might want to take a more structured class before Daily Themes, to get an idea of what their goals are/can be.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow60_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1674592&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1674592</span>\n                        1674592\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1674592</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would, because of the writing by experience.

I think your experience in this course is really dependent on what tutor you get. I was very fortunate to have an incredible tutor (shout out to Rona!), but I had other friends in the course who hated their tutor and hated the course as a result. Also, the lectures are pretty boring and not super necessary to do well in the course. Even so, to me the course was about the writing not the lectures, so I really enjoyed it!

I would say, though, that if Prof. Ehrgood is teaching the course again, maybe wait for a different year. He is not the most engaging lecturer, and most people I knew taking the course did not enjoy lecture/did not find it worth going to. I&#39;ve heard much better lecture experiences from students who took the course other years with other professors (I have heard, though, that Prof. E is much better in a seminar, so kudos to him there).</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow68_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1676893&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1676893</span>\n                        1676893\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1676893</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would definitely recommend this course if you are willing to put in the work to take it.

It&#39;s hard to get a lot out of the class when you have a bad match with your primary teacher.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow76_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=21797&amp;evaluatorId=1684812&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=aje2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1684812</span>\n                        1684812\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1684812</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n                                \n                            </div>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </main>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div id="yale-footer-bottom" class="no-print" role="contentinfo">\n    <footer role="contentinfo" class="yale-footer">\n        <div class="footer-logo row">\n            <div class="column small-4 large-3 columns">\n                <a class="y-icons y-yale y-mark" href="http://www.yale.edu/"><span class="show-for-sr">Yale\n                </span></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class="small-8 large-9 columns">\n                <p class="copyright spacer" style="font-size: .8rem;">\n                    Copyright &copy; <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear())</script> Yale University <span aria-hidden="true">&middot;</span> All rights reserved <span aria-hidden="true">&middot;</span>\n                    <a title="Yale Privacy policy" href="http://www.yale.edu/privacy.html" style="text-decoration: underline">Privacy policy</a>\n                    <span aria-hidden="true">-</span>\n                    <a href="https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility/accessibility-yale" style="text-decoration: underline">Accessibility at Yale</a>\n                    \n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </footer>\n</div>\n\n\n<script type="text/javascript" src="/ocedashboard/assets/app-64ec30218e4e8f6eca224a18684e4884.js" ></script>\n<script type="text/javascript" src="/ocedashboard/assets/jquery-ui.min-b0ba1d1ac5ef9706219d68b4ecfcd5b3.js" ></script>\n<script type="text/javascript" src="/ocedashboard/assets/jquery.multiselect-a52ab3a5ee20a1f9138c469e94241a1a.js" ></script>\n\n<script>\n    $(window).bind("load", function () {\n        var footer = $("#yale-footer-bottom");\n        var pos = footer.position();\n        var height = $(window).height();\n        height = height - pos.top;\n        height = height - footer.height();\n        if (height > 0) {\n            footer.css({\n                \'margin-top\': height + \'px\'\n            });\n        }\n    });\n    function loadingMessage() {\n        $("body").css("cursor", "progress");\n        $("#loadingMessage").show();\n    }\n    function clearLoadingMessage() {\n        $("body").css("cursor", "default");\n        $("#loadingMessage").hide();\n    }\n\n</script>\n<script>\n\n\n    (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\'GoogleAnalyticsObject\']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n            (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n        m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n    })(window,document,\'script\',\'https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\',\'ga\');\n\n    ga(\'create\', \'UA-100715343-1\', \'auto\');\n    ga(\'send\', \'pageview\');\n\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n'
