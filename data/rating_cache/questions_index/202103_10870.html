I think that the content could be more based on that idea and focus more on gen chem concepts that would be needed later for many students who want to take the MCAT. I think the organic stuff was good since it is a primer for next year, but I think quantum was unnecessarily challenging. I also think the exams themselves are a weakness.

In this class, we cover quantum, organic, and solid-state chem, which can be a lot for one semester, especially for a gen chem class. The strength of this is that prospective stem majors or pre-med students can get a quick intro into the different chem classes they&#39;ll need to take, which can help you decide if you want to continue on the track you&#39;re on. The weakness of this is that the final for this class is very rough considering the wide array of topics covered. The lectures are also not extremely structured, so it&#39;s very easy to get lost and off track. I would strongly suggest going to peer tutoring for this class (it&#39;s how I survived the course). The psets aren&#39;t too bad, especially since the peer tutors are phenomenal. I also loved my TA, so that helped keep me motivated.\r\n\r\nOverall: I love how much this class challenged me, and I feel like I&#39;m more set for the pre-med track than I ever have been. However, I had lots of moments where I had zero idea what was happening. I would not take this class if you have a really heavy schedule. This class can be extremely rewarding and enjoyable but only if you can dedicate the time to it.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow6_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10870&amp;evaluatorId=1533999&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jmm362&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1533999</span>\n                        1533999\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1533999</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I really liked that we had the chance to learn really complex topics and struggle with the ideas in class without worrying too much about our grades.

There were also enough tests that our grade wasn&#39;t dependent solely on one or two of our performances. Weaknesses of this course may be that the lectures sometimes were scattered or we would get hung up on an idea that we weren&#39;t going to be tested on, but there wasn&#39;t a concept that we couldn&#39;t approach the professor or the peer tutors with and get help on.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow7_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10870&amp;evaluatorId=1535466&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jmm362&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1535466</span>\n                        1535466\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1535466</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: The amount of help this class offers is great, but also much needed. There are many peer tutors who help so much with the problem sets, and the TFs are great because they are there to ask questions if asking Prof Mayer is too daunting. \r\nWeaknesses: This class was presented as a general chemistry course, but it really wasn&#39;t. I took AP chemistry in high school and thought this would be an advanced, more in depth version of that material, but about 90% of the material in this class was completely new. I also don&#39;t think the topics we covered are &quot;general&quot; since they are so unique to this class. The first unit was quantum mechanics, which is a topic most chemists do not learn about until their third year of undergrad.

In addition, classes were always organized and accompanied by Lecture Figures that were always accessible to students on Canvas. Practice exams, PSETs, and Achieve homeworks made it easier to understand what was emphasized in class.\r\nWeaknesses: I would say that the Achieve homeworks were not always necessary. PSETs every week were enough work in itself and Achieves often involved math-related questions which were never to be seen on exams. Also, sometimes harder concepts were quickly taught in class whereas it would have been better at times to go through these areas more slowly and just skip over easy sections that we all already knew.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow10_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10870&amp;evaluatorId=1537180&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jmm362&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1537180</span>\n                        1537180\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1537180</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Stengths:\r\ndetailed and organized coverage of material\r\nextremely well timed to match with exam dates\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nhas a midterm the week before the final exam</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow11_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10870&amp;evaluatorId=1538103&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jmm362&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1538103</span>\n                        1538103\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1538103</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course covers a lot of information, which makes it really interesting but also really overwhelming at times.

I felt that a weakness in the course was that the I didnt feel like I was tested on my ability to understand a taught lesson but whether or not I can extrapolate correctly and think in a certain way. Another weakness was that the course covers a lot of material, much of which is not standard general chemistry knowledge. While I do think that a strength of this course was its uniqueness and the way it challenged people, it was very hard to learn the material in the right way.

Also, some of the topics taught in this class go beyond what&#39;s considered general chemistry which can also be seen as a pro since the class is meant to be challenging, but for those that planned to learn general chemistry at a faster pace, this is most certainly a con. This class was also taught at a very fast pace, which made it exceptionally hard to keep up with the information taught in the class, and led to many students quickly trying to understand all the concepts just days before the midterm exams. This class could be improved by narrowing down the topics taught in the class and teaching those topics more in depth and slower so the students can have a better grasp on fundamental chemistry topics.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow26_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10870&amp;evaluatorId=1540573&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jmm362&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1540573</span>\n                        1540573\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1540573</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>psets reinforce understanding without being daunting in work amount, discussion section is very useful; no obvious weaknesses other than maybe you could sometimes see in Gradescope which problems of the pset were going to be graded versus which weren&#39;t (only some of the problems were to be graded each week plus a completion grade) and I think the idea was that that was supposed to be unknown</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow27_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10870&amp;evaluatorId=1540618&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jmm362&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1540618</span>\n                        1540618\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1540618</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The workload was very time-intensive, but it did help significantly with learning the difficult material.

The problem sets were challenging but made possible by really supportive and helpful teaching fellows and peer tutors. The exams were difficult, and perhaps my only suggestion is a little bit more preparation for the final, which I found more difficult than I was expecting.

The organic chemistry section awkwardly spilled past the organic chemistry midterm and the last day of classes was extremely stressful because it felt like a whole new unit was quickly taught in one day.

That said, if you are deciding between Chem 163 and first-year Organic Chem, I think it is more worth it to take Organic because you place out of two semesters of general chemistry and two semesters of lab. I think the class serves a very small niche group of students and it would be more beneficial to encourage more students to take the first-year organic chemistry class (and maybe develop an advanced/non-advanced first-year organic chemistry class).</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow1_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10870&amp;evaluatorId=1524441&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=jmm362&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1524441</span>\n                        1524441\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1524441</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, especially if you want to learn a lot of chemistry in a short amount of time.

Our tests are essentially not timed, calculators are never used, and problem sets cite current chemical research applications.

But if you&#39;re sufficiently prepared, want to learn a lot, and have time in your schedule, this course can be really cool (also make sure you can accept lower grades than you&#39;re used to).
