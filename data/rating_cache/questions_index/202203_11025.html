The long quizzes were a little brutal. Discussion section is absolutely useless. No one knows what is happening in the papers and they don&#39;t foster any kind of growth because we don&#39;t have the skill sets to read them. Choose better papers or model discussion section after enrichment. As mean as it might sound, this is an intro level course.

It would probably be better if we just covered all the material in lecture instead.\r\n- Practice test released too late, answer key provided way too late\r\n- Review session for midterm was way too close to exam\r\nHandouts:\r\n    - Could be more organized. Especially since we do not have assigned textbooks for the course, we have even more need for a definitive handout.\r\n    - do not reflect actual material taught in class (some concepts are on the handout but werent taught in class and vice versa)\r\n    - It would be better if they were provided at least half a week before lecture so we could preview them\r\nSlides:\r\n    - Not enough material was covered in lecture, then the slides were just modified/deleted to match our lecture pace. That doesnt seem right.\r\n    - Some slides are skimmed over\r\n    - Many slides are repeated they could be cleaned up. The structure of the lectures could be improved / more organized. For example, ER translocation is split over unit 3 and part of unit 4.\r\n- Discussion section: I suppose this is harder to improve because it greatly depends on the other classmates, but many do not read the assigned papers, making it a bit difficult to engage in meaningful discussions about them. On the other hand, one gets practice from explaining the concepts to others, but it would probably be more stimulating if we all read the papers and tried to understand them before coming to class. The discussion section papers could also be released earlier. Also, one of the papers was not annotated, which perhaps disincentivizes people from reading it.\r\n- Typos in psets, quizzes, handouts, slides, and exams</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow16_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11025&amp;evaluatorId=1623359&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=rch33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1623359</span>\n                        1623359\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1623359</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course has a lot of support; there are many people you can reach out to for help.

Also, the lecturer would prepare more content than she could cover which moved around due dates and assignments and made everything  more confusing. I would suggest that the class try to properly estimate the amount of material that can be covered from each class. I did appreciate how the lecturer didnt have a textbook and only required the students to know the material she taught instead of teaching some material and expecting us to know other things. Another suggestion I have is that the in-lecture questions could be moved to the end of lecture instead of in the middle. That way, if we run out of time we still had the lecture content covered but we can still review the content comprehension questions on our own time.

Slides were copied and pasted from week to week and then skipped through very briefly so the content order was confusing. 2) there were very many diagrams and images on each slide so that it was imposisble to know what was important 3) the structure was bad. Highlighting/bold/italics was used intersperdedly without explanation which was confusing and it was difficult to know where in the course we were\r\n-A lot of the course content was cut because the professor mistimed the lectures.

Another qualm I have with the course in general is that a the general flow of the class does not seem to relate to previous material. I felt like each slide was introducing a new and unrelated topic. I feel that if the class had a bit more of a structure to it in the sense that each concept built off and related to one another in some way with a natural flow, it would have helped me and many other students better understand the content of the class.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow41_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11025&amp;evaluatorId=1637894&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=rch33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1637894</span>\n                        1637894\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1637894</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: very manageable workload\r\nWeakness: lectures go very fast and you definitely need to spend time outside of class to go over course content more</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow42_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11025&amp;evaluatorId=1637903&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=rch33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1637903</span>\n                        1637903\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1637903</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The lecture material was very specific and felt disconnected at times.

It would be great if the course included some hands-on work with these experimental techniques, but I think that the only feasible way to do that with so many students taking the course would be to have a lab that goes along with the course like the introductory chemistry courses.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow67_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11025&amp;evaluatorId=1638163&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=rch33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1638163</span>\n                        1638163\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1638163</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The material makes sense and is well taught, but I felt like the stuff I was learning was not helpful to what I want to do or learn about and it made me question why it is mandatory to take cell biology in order to take BIOL 103-104.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow68_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11025&amp;evaluatorId=1638172&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=rch33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1638172</span>\n                        1638172\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1638172</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Professor Hartman is a great lecturer and I especially appreciated how open she was to suggestions from students throughout the course although I do wish the exams were out of more points so that more partial credit could be awarded and each deduction on, for example, a multiple choice question, would factor less into the grades on exams.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow69_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11025&amp;evaluatorId=1638176&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=rch33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1638176</span>\n                        1638176\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1638176</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Fix method of lecture so that it isnt just reading off of a slide and information can be absorbed better</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow70_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11025&amp;evaluatorId=1638182&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=rch33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1638182</span>\n                        1638182\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1638182</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Professor was reading off the slides and was not really engaging in material.
