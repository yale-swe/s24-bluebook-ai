A lot of the topics felt random and disjointed. For example, we learned about neurogenesis before gastrulation, so it was not in chronological or thematic order. It was also unclear the concepts we were expected to know. There seemed to be little conceptual organization of the slides, and they often used experiments to illustrate a concept without actually explaining it. It was also unclear when we needed to know details for quizzes and when it was more a general idea, for example, the specific protein residues modified is very specific. Also, we usually did not get to the last slides, forcing us to learn them on our own. It also felt that the concepts covered in class had little to do with what was discussed in section, and section did not provide a space to go over questions from class. The research proposal homework also felt like it had nothing to do with what was discussed in lecture.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow2_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18330&amp;evaluatorId=1691260&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691260</span>\n                        1691260\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691260</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strength: quizzes every week forced me to study and stay more engaged.

The sequence in which topics were taught was confusing to me, particularly with development. Lecture slides were nearly incomprehensible, and it would take me hours just to understand the general ideas from the slides even after attending class. Very very specific details from neuroscience were used as examples for broader ideas in development, which made it harder to understand rather than easier. We were consistently told not to focus on the minute (neuroscientific) details, but were consistently quizzed on them and expected to know them. We were told that the slides and quizzes weren&#39;t to trick us, but again, the lecture slides were very disorganized and difficult to interpret, and quizzes were nearly impossible to complete in time.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow3_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18330&amp;evaluatorId=1691269&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691269</span>\n                        1691269\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691269</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This is a difficult course whose concepts are hard to grasp, and so I wish we had more opportunities to ask questions during lecture or do interactive activities (talk with a partner, discuss problems, etc.).</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow4_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18330&amp;evaluatorId=1691292&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691292</span>\n                        1691292\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691292</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think the quizzes are unnecessarily difficult considering the 15 minute time allotment given to take them.

I also think the key concepts are not very illustrative of what should be the main takeaway of lecture. \r\n\r\nOn the flip side, I really enjoyed section with Liqun.

They&#39;re consistently organized and easy to sort through. I appreciate that he made them available to us.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class is organized into lectures with weekly quizzes, psets, and discussion sections. These three have nearly no overlap in content outside of being related to genetics and development. This makes BIOL 103 feel like three mini-classes, all of which you need to stay on top of and prepare for. I think a great improvement would be to homogenize the content between the three so that the class feels more cohesive. The quizzes were also very difficult to prepare for, as they were often confusingly worded and many questions required students to remember minute details from the very long lectures. I thought the short-answer questions on the quizzes were a great way to assess our deeper understanding of the content, and would like more of the minute-detail oriented questions to be replaced with questions similar to the short-answer questions. A simple, but very helpful change, would be to have someone go through the quizzes, carefully read each question, and then rephrase the confusing questions to be more clear. Lastly, I wish that Prof. Zhong would go back through the slides, decide what the most important concepts are, and then focus on teaching only those concepts and slowing down the lectures. We were often pressed for time due to the many extraneous details he elected to teach us about, which were fun and insightful, but ultimately took away from the fundamental concepts that were at the core of the class. Often times, it felt like he would wave away questions and clarification so that they could be posted EdDiscussion. Although EdDiscussion is a valuable tool, I feel like it should not be relied on in place of the professor themself clarifying a concept. Lastly, students should have more time on the quizzes, so they may actually demonstrate their higher understanding of the material without being too stressed by the 15 minute time limit.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow8_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18330&amp;evaluatorId=1691339&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691339</span>\n                        1691339\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691339</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>A strength of the course was that it used actual experiments to teach the concepts which helped me to conceptualize how they actually apply to biology.

I understand that writing a research proposal is an important skill to have, I just think that it should be taught separately, in a lab class perhaps, and the homework should have been problem sets that would help us to understand the material we were being tested on.

I also felt that my TF did a good job leading/sustaining class discussions about scientific papers that we read for discussion sections. Other than that, I felt that this course could be improved in many ways. Lectures were taught poorly and did not start from the basics, but rather gave super-specific examples without providing students with definitions or general explanations of those concepts in the first place. Also, I thought that the assignments for this class could be improved. Specifically, the weekly writing assignments culminating in a research proposal did not seem relevant to the actual course content. It was good practice searching existing literature and writing in a scientific voice, but I think for an intro biology class (especially one that is not taught very clearly) it would be much more helpful to have homeworks that reinforce actual class concepts and  ask us to apply our knowledge in a way similar to what we are asked to do on quizzes.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow10_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18330&amp;evaluatorId=1691409&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691409</span>\n                        1691409\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691409</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The strength was that is covered a tremendous amount of material.

Instead of having patience, the professor was quickly frustrated with student inability and fervently defended his teaching style. He accused students of writing bad evaluations for their own lack of understanding and made everyone in the lecture feel uncomfortable. The quizzes he gave had questions (particularly the T/F ones) that were poorly-worded such that it was always ambiguous, leading students to lose points not because they did not know the answer but because they did not understand the question. They also couldnt ask for help because the quizzes were only 15 minutes long. The quizzes should be at least 25 minutes long or be shorter in length as it takes time to read through and understand the experimental design questions. Also, much of the lecture content was marked as only for information, not tested on but then still appeared in vocabulary questions and throughout other quiz questions, causing students to spend an exorbitant amount of time memorizing details of experiments that were poorly explained during lecture. Additionally, TFs for the class were essentially absent; only one TF ran the Review Session. Lastly, the homework assignments on writing a research proposal were ridiculous. It was set up like a Gingerbread House in which students build a premade proposal. Each step was delineated in a way that restricted student freedom and made it very difficult to meet all their criteria. This is also unrealistic as, in reality, it takes a very long time to review literature, design experiments, and craft an eloquent research proposal.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow17_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18330&amp;evaluatorId=1691581&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691581</span>\n                        1691581\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691581</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: Prof. Loreng is helpful and well-organized.

The homework involving a research proposal should come with much more instruction and explanation. The quizzes are very difficult and I believe students would fare much better if they were provided with practice exams or problem sets.

I think it would really help students if the information in the lectures that was actually on quizzes would be prioritized instead of the non-tested material. Spending even a few more minutes on these key concepts would help students fully comprehend the core material of the class. Another weakness would be how slow the quizzes would get back to us.

Also, the structure of the course was ridiculous.

The professor did improve my general insight into biology, but I felt at times that they were too quick in dismissing questions (sometimes interrupting the question and as a result misunderstanding it). I did appreciate the weekly quizzes as they kept me on track with the class&#39;s content, but again, they often cut the lecture short. I like that the professor highlighted specific information on the slide, but sometimes it could be extremely confusing as sometimes the main points were expressed too briefly/out of context.

I understand that nearly all students who take this course are doing so to fulfill a major prerequisite. That being said, this is hands-down the worst course I have taken thus far at Yale. This institution should be embarrassed that this is their introductory biology course. For a school that is aiming to bolster their STEM department and attract more STEM-focused students, the impression is that the faculty dont seem to care about effective teaching in biology. The course was a set of lectures heavily skewed towards development, even more so towards neurodevelopment with a few key concepts at the beginning and end of lectures, and a jumble of incomprehensible experiments sandwiched in the middle. Students were always confused. Peer tutors tried their best to help. The strictly-timed quizzes didnt match the content taught and the professor was in a world of his own. Everyone couldnt wait for it to be over.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow12_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18330&amp;evaluatorId=1691581&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691581</span>\n                        1691581\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691581</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No. But you&#39;re probably taking this course because you have to. The prof has terribly confusing and outdated slides and does not explain concepts well in lecture. The grading varies by TA but some TAs are awful at their jobs. TA Raghav had a massive ego and continuously flexed how many publications he had in large journals while neglecting to teach us anything. Ed Discussion was also provided as a resource but the instructors and TAs had very slow or no responses. While this course was terrible in pretty much every way, I don&#39;t entirely blame the teaching staff, as I think the half-semester length of the bio sequences courses is set up to fail. It is simply impossible to teach such a broad scope of information in such a short amount of time. Hopefully, Yale can fix the bio sequence soon.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow13_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18330&amp;evaluatorId=1691596&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691596</span>\n                        1691596\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691596</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I wouldn&#39;t recommend this course to anyone who wasn&#39;t required to take it.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow14_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18330&amp;evaluatorId=1691608&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691608</span>\n                        1691608\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691608</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes and no. I believe it is a class that teachers you a lot of valuable skills in terms of working under a lot of pressure and absorbing a large amount of information. However, this class is incredibly difficult and I would not have made it through if I did not have a strong passion for biology. If you need to take this class, of course take it, but if its not a requirement I would not recommend this course. There are plenty of other biology courses that would be less stressful and would be a lot easier to succeed in.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow15_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18330&amp;evaluatorId=1691618&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691618</span>\n                        1691618\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691618</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>If it&#39;s required for your major</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow16_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18330&amp;evaluatorId=1691633&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691633</span>\n                        1691633\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691633</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would recommend this course to any student interested in majoring in a biology-related field.
