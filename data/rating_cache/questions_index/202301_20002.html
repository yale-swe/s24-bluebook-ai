Every topic we studied this semester was something I had no previous awareness of, even though I&#39;ve spent a lot of my life learning about civil rights and black struggles.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow99_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20002&amp;evaluatorId=1679361&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=cer63&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1679361</span>\n                        1679361\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1679361</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned how to effectively learn and take notes in a lecture class, this being my first ever large lecture.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow100_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20002&amp;evaluatorId=1679376&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=cer63&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1679376</span>\n                        1679376\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1679376</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>How our entire medical system in the US was built upon the exploitation of black bodies, in so many ways that you could not even imagine until taking this course. should be required for all students, but especially pre-med.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow101_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20002&amp;evaluatorId=1679448&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=cer63&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1679448</span>\n                        1679448\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1679448</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I was extremely lucky to be able to take this course.

We wrote three participation reflections, a final project proposal, and a cover page reflection on our final project. While I totally understand and agree with these assignments, I sometimes felt like I was being a little repetitive simply because there were a lot of opportunities for written reflection. I wonder if there is another way to get to the core of this assignment because I do feel like the reflection component is very importantmaybe instead of a written reflection at the midterm, future students can meet with their teaching fellows and talk through their participation goals in a more casual format (I&#39;m not sure this is possible given how large the class was this semesterbut just a thought). Or maybe instead of writing a final reflection and a final project reflection, future students can combine those assignments into one? I&#39;m not sure.

While it was a well-intentioned effort to eliminate student worries about grades, this meant that many people in the class skipped the required readings, treated attendance at lecture as optional, and sometimes failed to complete their discussion section assignments/posts. This is not a class where a lenient grading system should be so wrongfully abused. The lecture and reading material is too important and I feel it didnt get the respect from all 500+ students in this class that it deserved this semester. By proxy, I felt that Professor Roberts did not receive the respect as an educator that she deserved.

Professor Roberts carefully curated this course in both content and structure to emphasize community building and personal growth.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow130_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20002&amp;evaluatorId=1680600&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=cer63&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1680600</span>\n                        1680600\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1680600</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No weaknesses</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow131_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20002&amp;evaluatorId=1680634&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=cer63&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1680634</span>\n                        1680634\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1680634</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>There were only strengths and no weaknesses to this course.

Ive been incredibly fortunate to have had more than my fair number of fantastic teachers - but Ive never experienced a more positive, enthusiastic, thoughtful, and deeply caring teacher than Dr. Roberts. To say she is encouraging, supportive and accessible would be an understatement of epic proportion. Dr. Roberts care, respect for and support of her students is an integral part of what makes this course so important and powerful  she is the ultimate, most qualified guide to take students through a 400-year journey into a very messy, painful past (i.e. Sickness and Health in African American History). Her noble objective is that the course  and the discussions and thinking that it provokes  stimulate all of us to come together, as a learning community, to imagine a different kind of future.  Dr. Roberts is a great lecturer and she goes out of her way to bring in expert guests who share their perspectives and voice with the entire class. Grading is beyond fair and straightforward  and students are provided with tremendous flexibility and options when it comes to major grade components. Not only is Dr. Roberts truly awesome, but she has thoughtfully put together a team of TFs that are deeply invested in the courses mission as well as in the students in their discussionss success and well being. This past semester (Spring 23), I was super fortunate to have Charlie Tran as our section leader  hes in his final year of his MPH &#64; the Yale School of Public Health after receiving his Yale BA in History of Science, Medicine and Public Health. Charlie was beyond awesome - facilitating and encouraging meaningful discussions, deeper dives on course material and always, providing helpful and actionable feedback on submitted assignments. He felt like the best kind of coach which feels in line with Dr. Roberts overall course ethos. \r\n\r\nSo again, this is easy: AFAM 170 is a critically important, topical and powerful course that every Yale student - no matter their major  could and should benefit from taking. IMHO, its also a course that should be ***required*** for any and every student interested in pursuing a career in healthcare - either clinically or at an administrative or policy level. \r\n\r\nI am beyond grateful that I was lucky enough to score a seat in this semester&#39;s course -- and have had the opportunity to learn so much from Dr. Roberts, her guest lecturers, her TFs and the course material. Im 100% confident that Ill carry and use the learnings and insights I&#39;ve gained from AFAM 170 with me for the remainder of my life.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow41_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20002&amp;evaluatorId=1655665&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=cer63&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1655665</span>\n                        1655665\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1655665</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, it was by far the most interesting and the most different course that I have ever taken at Yale.

Quite frankly, I was in a class with a lot of white people who seemed to be in the class for an &quot;easy A&quot;. Those people are racist. I watched as they ignored Professor Robert&#39;s lectures in favor of whispering amongst themselves, they laughed when we discussed the disproportionately high rate of maternal mortality among Black people. I cannot stress this enough, please don&#39;t enroll in this class if you are not going to pay attention, not going to honor the voices of vulnerable and hurt people who have decided to share, not going to honor Professor Roberts and Kenya who put their all into every class. \r\n\r\nBut on to the positives, this class is truly life-changing. I almost cried at the end of every lecture. The class made me a better student and classmate, a better (future) teacher, and a better friend.
