Just a great class, especially for incoming first-years who haven&#39;t taken a big lecture before.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow24_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1527890&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1527890</span>\n                        1527890\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1527890</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course was an incredible introduction to microeconomics with an emphasis on thinking in an economic framework.

I got a lot better at note-taking, time management, finding a study group, studying, and pacing work.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow45_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1536843&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1536843</span>\n                        1536843\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1536843</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I did not know about economics before this course, but it gave me a good insight into what I want to major in.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow46_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1537040&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1537040</span>\n                        1537040\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1537040</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned more about how the economy works, and how everything has a reaction.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow47_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1537089&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1537089</span>\n                        1537089\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1537089</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned the basics of microeconomics, as well as how to best think like an economist</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow48_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1537436&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1537436</span>\n                        1537436\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1537436</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Knowledge: producer/consumer theory, market structure/oligopoly, basic idea behind welfare theorems, game theory\r\nSkills: interpreting graphs, connecting math to graphs to qualitative explanations</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow49_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1537502&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1537502</span>\n                        1537502\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1537502</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>microeconomics.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow50_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1537525&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1537525</span>\n                        1537525\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1537525</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This class was a great introduction to the world of economics.

One small weakness is just that it was hard to get through all the material covered in class during section, so. if you needed help, you had to tackle asking for it on your own.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow48_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1536843&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1536843</span>\n                        1536843\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1536843</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>There are a lot of people, and that can be either a strength or a weakness for some.

There was never any lack of clarity about when assignments were due and where different documents (problem sets, practice problems, lecture slides, etc.) were located. The lectures themselves were also highly organized, and it was easy to find a particular topic within a lecture when rewatching them. Office hours were also very organized, and it was also easy to log on at a time that was convenient for me. \r\n\r\nI suppose one of the weaknesses of this class, though not really the fault of the class itself, is its size. Due to how large the class was, I felt very anonymous, and it was hard to engage with the material when it felt like no one in particular cared how I was doing in the class. The class requires you to be pretty much teach yourself a fair amount of the material, as there are so many other students in the class that you can&#39;t really find any individualized help from TAs or peer tutors. I think another weakness of the class was the sections. I think the section problems themselves were helpful to use when studying for exams, but my TA never really furthered my learning in the section, and most people viewed sections as being optional and thus would just skip, so it felt like a waste of time all around.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow74_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1541344&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1541344</span>\n                        1541344\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1541344</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The professor is a very skilled lecturer and can deliver course content in a way that is concise and engaging.

Basically just practice problems, not answering any questions of reviewing lecture material. Also there was not a ton of engagement with the lectures. The pollEV was definitely a strength because it made students apply what we were learning, but many times it was learning things and basically just writing it down without comprehension. Also a lot of the terms would be abbreviated rather quickly, so instead of saying the full term and learning what each curve was etc, I could get lost just because I didnt know what a certain abbreviation stood for. Also many times I was very confident in my answers, and believed they were correct on midterms etc (even sometimes seemingly the same as the answer rubric) but would be marked wrong with no explanation, and even after regrade requests were still marked wrong without ever knowing the reason.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow78_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1542618&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1542618</span>\n                        1542618\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1542618</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths were the professor, speed of the class, consistent workload structure, access to recorded lecture materials, access to teaching fellows, and open lines of communication between the teaching staff and students.

Also, it was a very large course, as is the nature of ECON 115. I didn&#39;t go to the in-person lectures at all, but watching the video recordings of the lectures was just as good (and in some cases, even better so I could pause the lecture and take a break).

Sometimes office hours for teaching assistants are not the most helpful or well-explained - it might be easier to have a source to send questions to before meeting them.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow216_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1546406&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1546406</span>\n                        1546406\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1546406</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths - love that there is a lecture and discussion section, that is incredibly helpful\r\nWeaknesses - discussion sections should be longer so we can actually cover all of the information we are setting to cover</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow217_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1546503&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1546503</span>\n                        1546503\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1546503</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Very strong class with good in-person lectures.

It wasn&#39;t a transcendent learning experience, but it did provide a lot of context as to how the economy functions as I continue to critique and question systems of power and wealth.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow64_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1537841&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1537841</span>\n                        1537841\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1537841</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes.

It teaches important fundamental skills that are extremely applicable to real-world settings. I would highly recommend this course to anyone.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow114_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1545178&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1545178</span>\n                        1545178\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1545178</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>yes I would, odea was an amazing professor</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow115_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1545179&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1545179</span>\n                        1545179\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1545179</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, I would it is a great introduction to Microeconomics.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow116_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1545180&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1545180</span>\n                        1545180\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1545180</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>If someone is looking to get a taste of economics to see if it interests them, I would recommend this class.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow117_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1545183&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1545183</span>\n                        1545183\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1545183</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>yes. beneficial as introduction to economic concepts</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow118_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1545186&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1545186</span>\n                        1545186\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1545186</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would as this was a good way to learn introductory microeconomics.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow119_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1545188&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1545188</span>\n                        1545188\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1545188</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow120_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1545206&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1545206</span>\n                        1545206\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1545206</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes.

By the end of the semester, ECON 115 was one of my favorite courses, as it helped me develop a new way of thinking that is useful in both academic and everyday life. For these reasons, yes, I would recommend this course to other students.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow205_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1545931&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1545931</span>\n                        1545931\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1545931</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>If you like are wondering whether or not to major in econ, yes.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow206_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1545934&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1545934</span>\n                        1545934\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1545934</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, great intro knowledge for econ that everyone should know</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow207_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1545943&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1545943</span>\n                        1545943\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1545943</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>yes it is helpful to get a basic understanding of economics</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow208_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1545947&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1545947</span>\n                        1545947\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1545947</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes if you are not interested in participating/ don&#39;t mind learning in a big class.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow209_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1545949&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1545949</span>\n                        1545949\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1545949</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I encourage anybody and everybody to take this course.

I got that and more. The material is difficult but genuinely interesting and relevant -- I&#39;m shocked how much the frameworks I learned in this course have already shaped the way I process the news I read and the world I see around me. I also found that it was very possible to succeed and do very well given an appropriate amount of effort, and that the coursework is truly intelligible without any particular background in or aptitude for economics. \r\n\r\nIf you have the chance, take this class with Cormac O&#39;Dea. He is a very clear presenter and obviously cares for the wellbeing of his students. I credit my good experience to him.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow210_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=12146&amp;evaluatorId=1545954&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1545954</span>\n                        1545954\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1545954</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would recommend this course to another student.
