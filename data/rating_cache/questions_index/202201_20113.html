There was also a lot of focus on research methods for discovering certain things, which is really helpful for people to understand how to conduct effective research.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow5_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20113&amp;evaluatorId=1564190&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1564190</span>\n                        1564190\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1564190</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>none. this class is horribly taught providing very little information and support for students. the lecturer uses vocabulary that most students literally have no clue what any of what he is saying means. most students don&#39;t have the technical training/vocabulary to even understand half of the words he says its way to high level and dry vocabulary for an intro class.  how are you teaching about &quot;life&quot; on a freaking powerpoint slide show and charging 5000 for a  class. no type of interaction or anything or ways to apply understanding all we get are packets and frantically looking for answers in the slides. terrible experience all around. usually huge gaps in class. some ppl are getting 100&#39;s and others are getting 50&#39;s so it looks like the average is a 75 but that is a wrong representation. overall terrible all around.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow6_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20113&amp;evaluatorId=1564334&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1564334</span>\n                        1564334\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1564334</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think I gained the skills of being able to work together with peers to discuss complex topics.

The course is focused on research methods and experiments primarily, with very little focus on the basic explanations. I often found the material to be difficult to understand from a beginner perspective, and I think that maybe these research methods should be held off for higher level bio courses. The teaching was also not super clear, especially in discussion sections. I think the quality of the TAs varied greatly, and so did their grading styles which I found to be unfair. I think the TA grading should rotate so different TAs grade your PSETS each week to make it more fair.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow10_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20113&amp;evaluatorId=1564403&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1564403</span>\n                        1564403\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1564403</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: I was able to take away a lot of new experimental techniques that have since aided greatly in a laboratory setting.

If that was the goal of the course, then it has succeeded. \r\n\r\nAnother thing I noticed was the wild grading discrepancies among TAs when it came to the psets. Even when I collaborated with peers, I would sometimes get double the points off for making the same mistakes as they did. I often felt like there wasn&#39;t a rubric, or if there was, it was being applied haphazardly. It is a shame to think that, at lease to some degree, my results in this class were dependent on the TA that I got. An easy solution to this would be to switch the TAs that grade the psets for each section or to have one TA grade a single question so there is continuity.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow13_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20113&amp;evaluatorId=1564590&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1564590</span>\n                        1564590\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1564590</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The main strength of the course was that all of the assignments were open-note (quizzes and problem sets).

Furthermore, the slides were often very wordy and the images difficult to understand at times. Professor Mooseker seemed to fail to approach the class at an introductory course. It seems bizarre to me that an introductory cell biology course did not spend nearly any time on prokaryotic cells, plant cells, or mitochondria. Huh? If the course were a second year or later cell biology class, I&#39;d think differently, but as an intro course, it was not an appropriate level of instruction or feedback. The teaching fellow was very helpful, but our &quot;journal sessions,&quot; were essentially presentations on the papers we read during the week requiring no preparation or participation from class members. Finally, the professors were very curt and often unhelpful in Ed discussion posts resulting in students not using the forum (and subsequently the professors complaining we didn&#39;t use the forum enough).</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow14_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20113&amp;evaluatorId=1564871&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1564871</span>\n                        1564871\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1564871</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Entire grade is based on psets, if you mess up one you are in trouble.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow15_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20113&amp;evaluatorId=1565697&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1565697</span>\n                        1565697\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1565697</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: The workload is very manageable and predictable.

The packets are very useful and provide a good summary of the week&#39;s lessons.

In comparison, BIOL 102 felt highly disorganized. In every lecture, it felt like there were segments that assumed prior knowledge of biology that hadn&#39;t been taught in BIOL 101. Many students in BIOL 102 have taken biology in high school, but for those who hadn&#39;t, it was extremely difficult to discriminate between what course material was important to learn and what course material was extraneous. For example, there was a lot of unknown terminology used in lecture that hadn&#39;t been taught in the course. Every time a new term was used, it made my brain panic for a second- &quot;I don&#39;t know this. Should I know this? What does it mean? Do I need to copy this word down? (etc).&quot; There was so much unnecessary information in every lecture, which frequently distracted me from the core concepts the course was trying to teach.\r\n\r\nHaving reached the end of this course, I actually feel that I couldn&#39;t describe a single &quot;core concept&quot; of this course, unlike in BIOL 101 which made the key concepts very clear. Yes, Professor M. showed the &quot;learning goals&quot; and &quot;course outline&quot; on a slide at the beginning of each lecture. HOWEVER, he wouldn&#39;t show the slide for long enough to process information. This made the lecture MORE stressful, not less confusing, because it was one example among many instances in which too much information was presented to the class at once, and we weren&#39;t capable of processing everything in time before the next slide was shown.\r\n\r\nGiving students access to slides at the beginning of lecture is NOT a solution. Psychology experiments have shown that students learn new material best when taking notes on a blank notebook, not when taking notes off of lecture notes / printed slides (maybe you can ask Laurie Santos for the proper citation). \r\n\r\nTo improve this course, I propose the following:\r\n1) that this course adopt the same strategies as BIOL 101: make it extremely clear to students what the core concepts are.\r\n2) to solve the problem of students being presented with too much information at once, instead of showing students powerpoint slides chock-full of dense text that they won&#39;t have time to read or copy down, use powerpoint slides ONLY for showing images / graphs. Anything that the professor wants students to write in their notebook they should write by hand on a blackboard - it&#39;s not fair to expect students to read through huge blocks of text on the powerpoint slides while listening to a lecture, discern what information is the most important, and write down all the important details before the slide is changed. Having the professor hand-write the most important information will ensure that students also have enough time to write down everything important. \r\n3) don&#39;t make quiz questions extremely specific / trick questions / that focus on the granular details of some data set. I would rather take quizzes with more limited time, but that give me a clear idea of what concepts I need to study, instead of quizzes that require me to command-F through slides to find the exact number I&#39;m looking for.\r\n\r\nThere are other things I could propose, but these are the main ones.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow19_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20113&amp;evaluatorId=1566782&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1566782</span>\n                        1566782\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1566782</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The class covers a lot of very interesting information.

The lectures could be improved by including a summary of the key points of the unit in concise lecture outlines after going through the material because the current lecture outlines are filled with text, do not concisely summarize nor highlight the key points of the unit, and simply throw terms at the student before we discuss the content. Furthermore, I felt that lectures included many instances in which too much information was given to us for instance, if we were talking about a protein, Prof. Mooseker might mention what researchers thought the protein did, what we know now, which university the molecule was discovered at, how long it took them to discover the protein, the secondary structure of the protein, what other molecules the protein interacts with, etc. In most cases, this much detail was not necessary for me to understand the protein&#39;s function and the assays used to discover/test it, but rather, confused me because I didn&#39;t know what was important.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow27_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20113&amp;evaluatorId=1570894&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1570894</span>\n                        1570894\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1570894</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course was very very complicated and the lectures just didn&#39;t connect with me and I know I am not alone in that.

The journals were way out of our league and even if they weren&#39;t, we could have done 1 or 2 journal clubs. Section really could have been a place to supplement the lectures not getting through to me and a lot of others. This small environment could have been a great place to ask questions and it was disappointing that instead it was just a place where the disparity of understanding grew larger. Those with the foundation and the time to go to tutoring could understand the concepts well enough to decipher the papers but those of us who had no prior foundation with biology and no time to go to tutoring due to being in-season athletes got nothing from section.

The course could definitely be improved by spending more time on building the foundations of cell biology before expanding into the niche and complicated topics.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow52_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20113&amp;evaluatorId=1589792&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1589792</span>\n                        1589792\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1589792</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course was fairly well organized; however, the transition from the asynchronous bio101 format was not great.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow53_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20113&amp;evaluatorId=1589793&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1589793</span>\n                        1589793\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1589793</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I found that this course was extremely dense, with a lot of content thrown at students without being explained.

You would think that 102 builds on 101, but it actually doesnt (in my opinion). I also had a huge problem with the way grading worked in the course. Nothing is standardized. If you dont want to compare from semester to semester, fine. But why is there no rubric? People are walking away from the course with the exact same understanding as each other but two completely different grades. Some TAs are more difficult than others but the class average was based on everyones performance? The only way to justify the grading is if the class average and therefore, your final grade was based on section scores where students are being evaluated solely on how their TA graded. I also think an 11 AM deadline is strange, but thats just me.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow55_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20113&amp;evaluatorId=1589795&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1589795</span>\n                        1589795\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1589795</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course covers a lot of material which was difficult to keep up with and understand fully.

Professor Loreng in particular holds enrichment sessions which are quite helpful, while Professor Mooseker holds sessions on Sunday which are beneficial sometimes if you can attend them. Likewise, the TAs are great and are very helpful for problem sets. Lastly, despite the material being confusing, I think the course might have a reasonable curve and it is certainly more forgiving than some other STEM classes (like Chem Lab I + II).\r\nWeaknesses: This still is a very difficult course. The material can be very difficult and dense, and the lectures can be very confusing; often I wasn&#39;t sure what the main points of the each slide and the lecture overall were (despite learning goals being periodically mentioned). While quizzes can take a while, they can be time consuming. However, problem sets can be extremely confusing and difficult; though TAs can help, the take home problem sets are extremely difficult.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow105_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20113&amp;evaluatorId=1597605&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1597605</span>\n                        1597605\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1597605</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: as much as I disliked preparing for them, reading the papers helped clarify the weekly content much better.

The problem sets are really difficult; each problem often feels like a really tricky riddle, and solving them either require a lot of experience in biology or time, patience, and perseverence.
