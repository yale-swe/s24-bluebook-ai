Attending office hours also helped bridge these gaps.

We also had very cool discussions about values and how different people can have different views on the economy based on what they think is important - aka inequality, gov interventions, efficiency, etc.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow74_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1715291&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1715291</span>\n                        1715291\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1715291</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned how to be an economically-minded citizen.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow75_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1715450&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1715450</span>\n                        1715450\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1715450</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned how to apply new concepts, rather than just memorize them.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow76_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1716063&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1716063</span>\n                        1716063\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1716063</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I developed skills in critical thinking and reasoning.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow77_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1716182&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1716182</span>\n                        1716182\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1716182</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned the basic understanding of the world of economy through different lenses.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow78_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1716499&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1716499</span>\n                        1716499\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1716499</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned more about how to use algebra to represent economics.

The content is fairly simple and the grading is very generous but i think it exposes people to the basic mathematical parts of economics. The focus much more focused with graphs, formulas, and math than traditional micro economics courses are. Theory is very briefly mentioned throughout the course and this is reflected in the tests and assignments which will at most ask a definition or a very brief explanation of a result. Even if, you have taken economics in high school (i took IB high level) I would still advise to take this course instead of the intermediate because there is still a lot of new content.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow97_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1722292&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1722292</span>\n                        1722292\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1722292</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Introductory microeconomic skills like markets, market equilibrium, competition, risk, and marginal analysis.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow98_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1722303&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1722303</span>\n                        1722303\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1722303</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Knowledge about markets, trade, taxes, relationships between producers and consumers, etc. (and how to depict and understand various concepts on/with graphs)</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow99_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1722553&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1722553</span>\n                        1722553\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1722553</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course sufficiently introduced me to the important microeconomic concepts, including profit and utility maximization and other analytical skills.

Also, some of the questions on the tests were harder than any of the practice problems we had or anything we were instructed on, especially in the second midterm. Additionally, I think it is important to explain the concepts in words that aren&#39;t just econ words, and Prof Berry didn&#39;t do that. He would define something, and then later define the words in the definition, instead of building up on things we already knew. Also, many of the TF&#39;s aren&#39;t great and should have more instruction on how to make an engaging discussion session that actually teaches people things.  Overall, I have decided I&#39;m not going to take an econ class at yale again.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow46_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1706045&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1706045</span>\n                        1706045\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1706045</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>strengths: you meet so many first-years, you get to take a class with many friends. weeknesses: the lecture isn&#39;t engaging, the pacing of the class accelerated so much in the middle</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow47_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1706519&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1706519</span>\n                        1706519\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1706519</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I mean it&#39;s a fine course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow48_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1707367&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1707367</span>\n                        1707367\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1707367</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Very helpful with the peer tutors and I thought the review sessions up to the final were particularly helpful.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow49_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1707846&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1707846</span>\n                        1707846\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1707846</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: PSETs were well-applied and helpful for learning content, and exams were generally pretty fair (with some surprises thrown in there).

The lectures did not typically go over applications of the concepts, so the sections were vital for the completion of the problem sets. Professor Berry is a nice, funny guy, and his jokes were always a plus. However, this course did regrettably have many weaknesses. The problem sets were extraordinarily time-consuming, as they tested us on material we didn&#39;t go over in class, and oftentimes applications that we did not quite learn in section. The textbook and office hours were lifesavers. Also, I think the lectures would have been much more useful and engaging if they focused more on applications of concepts, rather than just the concepts themselves. The exams were difficult (more so because of the nature of curved classes) but fair.

Finally, online access to lecture slides and old exams was additionally helpful. \r\n\r\nDue to the size of this course, I think a weakness was that there wasn&#39;t much collaboration with other students. In section and office hours, students were mostly silent and there wasn&#39;t much mutual problem-solving. I think student collaboration can be achieved by forming individual study groups, but I felt that some of the smaller spaces for learning (section and office hours ) did not facilitate collaboration. I also felt that it was sometimes hard to engage with lectures because there was such a large group of people in one hall and there wasn&#39;t much direct connection to Professor Berry.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow78_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1713356&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1713356</span>\n                        1713356\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1713356</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Lectures should be uploaded</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow79_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1713724&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1713724</span>\n                        1713724\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1713724</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course has a lot of resources to learn, and the material is very relevant.

In particular with section, most people stopped showing up because it can feel like another unproductive lecture, and thus a waste of time. I think section would benefit from a less rigid structure. For example, it could be used to help re-explain the concepts introduced in a given week rather than restricted to only the practice problems. Overall, the work load is consistent each week and, in general, is not very time consuming.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow81_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1713871&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1713871</span>\n                        1713871\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1713871</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>A main weakness of this class was the variability in TA quality.

I also loved Prof Berrys lecture style; even though economic concepts are not always that interesting for everyone, I feel like he did a great job in bringing the topics in an entertaining way, sometimes with very random jokes and pop/historical references. He was also very open for anyone to ask questions during lecture! Lastly, I think the course organizers did a really good job at separating the discussion of how economics works from a discussion of VALUES and how the world SHOULD be, so I never felt like I was being imposed a world view or another. Only weaknesses are maybe that its still hard to ask questions in a lecture of 400 people and even though discussion section offers a good chance to do so, it would be great to have the ease of just asking your professor whatever is in your mind during class.

While obviously annoying, these sections prove to be very helpful in gaining a larger appreciation for the material, and I believe that making them mandatory would improve the entire classes learning experience. Additionally, the fact that the whole class is curved creates a type of negative competition that I believe can be toxic at times. Through this system of the whole class being curved, it makes it so that all my peers are my competition, which I did not enjoy and believed that it fosters this negative competition instead of collaboration.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow110_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1721504&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1721504</span>\n                        1721504\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1721504</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I wish there were more guided practice sessions, i felt as thought the content in the lecture did not 100% help me solve the problems in homeowrk and exams.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow111_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1721576&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1721576</span>\n                        1721576\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1721576</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The engagement with the professor during lecture was minimal, and the coherency of the explanations could have been better.

His teaching was very engaging (for me, at least) and interesting for kids who like economics. The course teaches many useful and intriguing concepts that I use almost daily. I love economics though, it was very different for many of my peers. Steven literally acted out the Princess Bride to illustrate game theory. He did a stand up comedy routine to talk about Pareto Improving Trades, which made so much sense. He did a rap on the very first day of class. He is not a lecturer, he is a performer and an excellent teacher. I always left class thinking about something interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses  THE TFS AND PEER TUTORS. They get things wrong all the time. In one of the FINAL review sessions, the TF got so many things wrong (according to the solutions and basic economic concepts) that I just left. They cancel sessions randomly and when they don&#39;t, all the peer tutor does is just give answers and occasionally quickly run through the math without giving you the chance to figure it out or teaching you anything. I never went to a session that got everything right either. Sections are inconsistent in quality and many of the TF&#39;s were just confusing. My Pset scores dramatically improved when I quit going to section and peer tutor sessions, that&#39;s how bad they are.\r\n\r\nThere are too many people in this class. 452 students with this curve is INSANE. And this also puts a strain on resources, sessions are always full and you never have the chance to get 1 on 1 help. Also because of the curve, students don&#39;t help each other much. People are slightly competitive. When reviewing, I worked with a group of friends, but that was rather uncommon. People also talk a lot in lecture and it&#39;s distracting.\r\n\r\nThe math is weird. I get it, no calculus because not everyone knows calculus. However, calculus would have made more sense to explain some of the concepts. It wouldn&#39;t have hurt to just do a sidebar for the kids that took calc when explaining the concepts. Additionally, he doesn&#39;t explain the math too thoroughly in lecture because he has a lot of information to go through which is reasonable. I think sections are meant to teach us the math side of it? But they do such a bad job that you kind of just have to figure it out yourself.\r\n\r\nImproving  Interview TF&#39;s more thoroughly please! They were terrible!! And it would be handy if they all attended lecture because clearly some of them didn&#39;t as they had no idea what was going on. More peer tutors too please so that we can have more individual help from them and they don&#39;t spend their tutor sessions just giving answers. Something like how the physics department does their peer tutor sessions. Maybe split up the class into smaller classes. It&#39;s too big. Better TF&#39;s will fix the math and if he just really quick translated it into calculus when he introduced a concept that could be better explained with it.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow123_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1723624&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1723624</span>\n                        1723624\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1723624</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The lectures are often difficult to keep up if the student is trying to take notes, as sometimes the professor will go briefly over dense slides.

My ultimate assessment is that many of the concepts taught actually do help you see the world within an interesting economic framework -- whether it be in relation to firm pricing, insurance, societal loss via taxation, etc. -- it is ultimately a microeconomics class taught on a curve, where the people who understand the material prior to the class will do the best. In this manner it is not the most accessible introductory course, however it is generally well known that this is a course where you will simply have to ensure you can perform better than others in order to succeed. In order to best accentuate this curve, many of the exam questions will be difficult permutations of concepts that you were taught in class -- often exact opposite scenarios or economic ideas than what is taught -- so that people who have a generally strong analytical mind compounded with a good understanding of the material should do well.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow64_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1711439&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1711439</span>\n                        1711439\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1711439</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, this course is a good foundation for not only other economics class, but other QR classes.

You have to be willing to do the work and put in effort  yes, it&#39;s just algebra, but it&#39;s harder than you would think when it&#39;s combined with econ. \r\n\r\nWARNING ON THE FINAL/GRADE STUFF:\r\nI would only recommend this course to a student who is willing to study effectively or is willing to credit-d-fail or get a B. I was so stressed about my grade and the final, especially because of the curve and the lack of support for this class, that I legitimately went to the McGivney church (he invented? insurance) and prayed regularly about this grade and I&#39;m not even catholic. I needed an act of God to get an A in this class and he blessed me in the form of Microeconomics by Goolsbee, Levitt and Syverson. USE THE TEXTBOOK, DON&#39;T TRUST YOUR PEER TUTORS OR YOUR TF&#39;S OR THE UPPERCLASSMEN THAT TELL YOU THE TEXTBOOK IS USELESS!!!! I got a B on the first two midterms because I just went over my notes and the review problems and nothing else. The textbook explains things so well and there are so many excellent problems in there so you can get lots of practice in. I spent reading week in the library going through the entire textbook and it was so helpful I got a near-perfect final which brought my grade up to A-. Had I reviewed like that for the midterms and psets, I wouldn&#39;t have had to spend over 70 hours dying in the library about econ and I maybe could have gotten an A. Lastly, I would highly recommend getting a whiteboard and a little dry erase marker for reviewing and doing the math. It was so much more helpful than a notebook for some reason I loved it. If you don&#39;t make the same mistakes I did, you will slay this course and learn so much.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow120_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=19462&amp;evaluatorId=1723624&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=steveb&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1723624</span>\n                        1723624\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1723624</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, it is a very helpful course for students looking to pursue Econ or if they are interested in the subject.
