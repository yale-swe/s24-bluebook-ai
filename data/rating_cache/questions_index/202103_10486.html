I personally felt excluded in most if not all of the topics we covered in class, and I found plenty of other students who found the same problem and dropped the class or certificate because of this reason. They were not relevant to me, as I am interested in going into education outside the US. The course and the assignments are not designed for students who are not interested/will be a part of the US educational system, yet it is a requirement for the certificate or the program (there is an assumption that all students in the program will stay in the US). I find it ironic that in this class we learn about how education can be filtering out certain students from certain opportunities, and that that is exactly what this class is doing with students with an international perspective/interest, and that we were learning how to be inclusive in the classrooms but I was myself feeling excluded from this community. Facts speak for themselves: there is only 1 international student in the EDST program. I wanted to give it a chance, especially since Dr. Debs seemed really receptive to feedback. However, when I brought this up, the response I got is that these have been comments that theyve heard in the past (yet there is no change) and that theres no solution (while there is, clearly ). I felt and still feel really frustrated/sad/mad about this.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow7_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10486&amp;evaluatorId=1528641&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1528641</span>\n                        1528641\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1528641</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: so much information in a light, digestible way\r\nWeakness: wish we could have more formally engaged with the texts!</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow8_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10486&amp;evaluatorId=1528794&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1528794</span>\n                        1528794\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1528794</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The strengths is the student engagement in this course, the discussions both in section and in class, the reflective component in the class, and the insightful content, curriculum, and essays assigned!

I think one weakness was that the readings were often very long and included anecdotes that were very personal to the author, while the lectures went by very quickly and we were always running out of time. Honestly, I think adding at least 20 minutes to the lecture time would allow for Professor Debs to effectively teach the lesson and also allow for more student interaction/participation during the lecture. I also think that some topics were approached without enough nuance and that multiple perspectives should have been provided aside from just oversimplifying a topic to say that one thing caused another or that one thing was good or bad when these topics (especially about educational inequality) are much more complex and deserve to be treated as such.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow18_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10486&amp;evaluatorId=1536702&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1536702</span>\n                        1536702\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1536702</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Loved that discussion sections made content taught in lecture digestible</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow19_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10486&amp;evaluatorId=1537315&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1537315</span>\n                        1537315\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1537315</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>strengths: engaging readings, helpful professor and tfs, ample time to reflect on your work and its effects, good introduction to course material at breadth\r\n\r\nweaknesses; a little disorganized, readings were thoroughly integrated but felt as if they could have been used more pointedly, set-up of lecture was a little awkward as it was sometimes split between discussion and lecturing which sometimes left lecture material uncovered</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow20_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10486&amp;evaluatorId=1537773&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1537773</span>\n                        1537773\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1537773</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: there&#39;s something powerful/special about learning about education in an inherently educational space as both the teacher and students are critical about the ways we&#39;re engaging in learning, Professor Debs&#39; generosity with students and their learning styles/needs, the interesting topics covered, the division of graded assessments (not placing a significant weight on one final exam, for example); Weaknesses: lecturing pedagogy throughout the whole semester, wish Professor Debs&#39; teaching had more of a critical theory-oriented and anticolonial lens, wish Professor Debs acknowledged and addressed her own positionality in the beginning of the class (how does her own identity impact how she teaches these topics?), a lot of readings</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow21_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10486&amp;evaluatorId=1538763&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1538763</span>\n                        1538763\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1538763</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>though i somewhat wish it had been a seminar instead of a lecture, it was one of the most engaging lectures i&#39;ve had! really interesting material and engaging lecture format. assignments were pretty straight forward and interesting to complete.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow22_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10486&amp;evaluatorId=1538979&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1538979</span>\n                        1538979\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1538979</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>It is a broad overview, so you learn about a lot that you can potentially explore in your papers, in future courses, or on your own.

Though I think sections provide more intimate opportunities to discuss the readings and lectures, giving space for a class-wide forum will allow students to interact with one another across sections (this also would complement the learning circles that sometimes we did in class).</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow52_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10486&amp;evaluatorId=1552729&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1552729</span>\n                        1552729\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1552729</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: well-organized, very interesting material, engaging\r\nWeakness: scope of course focused mainly on American education and less on international</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow53_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10486&amp;evaluatorId=1555982&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1555982</span>\n                        1555982\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1555982</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think a big strength of this course is the number of topics that we were able to touch and discuss in only a semester. I was definitely too naive before taking this class. I also think the discussion sections were the highlights of this class. I really appreciated the recordings as there were some days that going to class (none specific) felt really impossible. Very adaptable and always looking for feedback from the students. It would have felt nice to have more conversations where my peers spoke about their experiences and their knowledge. I felt that was sometimes more valuable than just reading research about it.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow54_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a

Although the breadth of topics might be a negative for some, I found it to be liberating as I could choose which readings/topics I wanted to dive into further. I&#39;m more of a STEM person, so I appreciated the readings that took a more quantitative approach. I guarantee there is something on the syllabus that will interest you and may draw you to a specific EDST elective later on. In its current state, the syllabus has a lot of reading for each class, but the graded assignments aren&#39;t very long or difficult. I think most students earned at least an A- if the TFs could see that you invested at least some time and effort. Definitely a low stress environment.
