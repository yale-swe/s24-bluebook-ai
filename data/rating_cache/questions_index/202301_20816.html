TAs were absolutely invaluable and there were plenty of office hours to attend (at least 5 hours a day).  It moves at a pace that is reasonable -- fast enough to cover content, slow enough that you could catch up if you missed a lecture or two.  Also it seems like pretty much everyone is going to get an A in the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I will preface this by saying I am sure the class will improve as Ozan teaches it more regularly.  But this class was a mess, especially for the first half.  The workload was very asymmetrical, ranging from weeks with no assignments or exams to a pset crunch the week before spring break that achieved campus-wide notoriety.  The lectures were hard to follow especially with Alan.  The psets are too infrequent for us to really grasp the material -- we literally had only done 1 real pset before the midterm.  Ed is cluttered and honestly unhelpful.  The autograder often didn&#39;t work until right up to or even after the due date.  This entire class felt very unprofessional and honestly an embarrassment for a school like Yale.  Then again, I&#39;m sure it will get refined over the years.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow1_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20816&amp;evaluatorId=1646303&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=adw58&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1646303</span>\n                        1646303\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1646303</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course was very disorganized, which makes sense since it was the first semester Ozan and Alan were teaching it.

I also think that there could be a guide of some sort for all the data structures at the end of the semester (to prepare for the final).</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow4_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20816&amp;evaluatorId=1646665&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=adw58&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1646665</span>\n                        1646665\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1646665</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: grade weights, psets oriented to content, overall practicality of content, active Ed Discussion made it easy to ask questions, quick exam grading, weekly sections/pset walkthroughs by ULA Ben Goldstein\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could be much more directed on content and less focused on examples, ULA office hours were inconsistent and sometimes ridiculously overcrowded, pset specs were unclear (but only at the beginning of the semester)</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow5_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20816&amp;evaluatorId=1646693&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=adw58&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1646693</span>\n                        1646693\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1646693</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: \r\n- Not a super difficult course for people who already have CS experience (especially compared to previous iterations of 223)\r\n- Office hours were very abundant\r\n- Review sessions were hosted every Wednesday.

Alan and Ozan put a lot of work into making the course accessible for everyone and adjusted accordingly when something didn&#39;t work. \r\n- I really liked C++. It gave me an introduction into object-oriented programming and I saw how it fit well with learning the data structures after dealing with the intricacies of memory and pointers in base C.\r\n- Plenty of opportunities to earn bonus points, which helped me focus on learning the concepts instead of just worrying about my grade. Students received up to 5% bonus for attending lecture and up to 3% bonus for answering posts on Ed. I thought this was a great way to encourage attendance and community without punishing those who chose not to.\r\n- Shoutout to TA Ben for his weekly sections, which would go over the concepts of each week, live Q&amp;As during lecture, and pset walkthroughs. Should be a model for the rest of the CS department. \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES:\r\n- General lack of organization. Resources were kinda all over the place, and Ed became the unofficial hub for the course which was somewhat strange. \r\n- I think the class could&#39;ve been a bit more difficult overall. I am a bit worried for 323. With the bonus points in place, I&#39;m hoping that the profs can make things a bit more challenging.  I would&#39;ve liked maybe more full programs where we start from scratch in order to gain a better handle of C and C++. \r\n- Maybe too much time spent on certain topics. I feel like we spent too long on the very basics of C and dynamic arrays. If you took CS50, the first half of the course is mainly going to be review for you. Meanwhile, we glossed over topics like heaps and aspects of graphs. There were many concepts that I only understood when I was reviewing for the last exam.\r\n- Adding on to the above point, lectures were somewhat unengaging. Alan&#39;s lectures mainly involved live coding, but he often spent too much of lecture answering tangential questions. Ozan&#39;s lectures felt more applicable since he would often tie it into real world applications, and I preferred his slide-based approach, but he would often spend too much time on a single point.\r\n\r\nMany of the weaknesses improved over the course of the semester, and I think Alan and Ozan are working hard towards improving 223 in the future. This was their first try with the class and they implemented sweeping changes to the way it was taught (including introducing C++), so it was expected for there to be hiccups. I&#39;m confident that future experiences in the course will be better than mine.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow7_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20816&amp;evaluatorId=1646922&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=adw58&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1646922</span>\n                        1646922\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1646922</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course covered many useful topics for Computer Science majors.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow8_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20816&amp;evaluatorId=1647014&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=adw58&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1647014</span>\n                        1647014\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1647014</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course is decently well-taught and a lot of thought was put towards making the course rigorous and also accessible to newer students.

In the second half of the semester, the lectures were engaging and informative, the homework assignments were clear and manageable, and the grading was a lot more streamlined.  While the professors made some mistakes in the beginning of the year, I am willing to excuse those errors because it&#39;s their first time teaching 223, and they had to completely rehaul the curriculum and attempt to rebuild it from scratch with little support.  And as I said, the second half of the semester was extremely smooth, well-organized, and engaging.  I have no doubt that in future semesters, Alan and Ozan will make this course the best in the CS core curriculum.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow10_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20816&amp;evaluatorId=1647274&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=adw58&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1647274</span>\n                        1647274\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1647274</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>organization is the main weakness, strength is lectures are good</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow11_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20816&amp;evaluatorId=1647715&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=adw58&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1647715</span>\n                        1647715\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1647715</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: pretty easy, Ozan using slides in the latter half made content and class much easier to follow\r\nWeaknesses: professors didn&#39;t seem to really know what they were doing.

Often, the provided test cases, autograder, or reference implementations (or even, at times, the spec itself) would contain errors that would have to be fixed later on by the instructors, which was very disorganized of them. The autograder also had many errors, especially in the first half of the class, and was very opaque because often, students would have a correct or almost correct makefile, but their code would not compile, and they wouldn&#39;t know why due to the opaque error messages from the autograder. It therefore forced students to spend many hours trying to figure out this problem on their own, which I see as a massive weakness to the course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow20_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20816&amp;evaluatorId=1653603&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=adw58&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1653603</span>\n                        1653603\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1653603</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths include the well structured PSets however there were a few weaknesses too.

Nearly every assignment was posted later than we were told it would be, and edited multiple times due to errors. This resulted in hours and hours of wasted time, especially for those who were not procrastinating and started the assignment early. Throughout the year policy changes were made, including allowing people to drop the lowest pset grade. This was not announced until right before the deadline, making it very unfair for those who had already done the extremely difficult and poorly designed assignment at the expense of work for other classes. There were also regularly errors in grading the psets and the expectations were not clearly communicated or consistent.

Ed Discussion had way too many posts and it was hard to find anything. Since Ed Discussion participation was encouraged via bonus points, lots of people really wanted to post as many things as possible, which resulted in repeated questions and several new posts a day near problem-set deadlines. \r\n\r\nProfessors Weide and Erat mentioned several times the struggles teaching the class because it is their first time teaching it and they are changing the course curriculum. However, many CS students that I talked with previously loved the old CS223, so I do not know why it was necessary to change the syllabus in the first place. I can understand the difficulties for the new professors to teach a new class, but at the same time, I do not think that the students should be penalized for it. I am not a Computer Science major, but I am curious to see how CS323 will be next semester given how this course was structured.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow58_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20816&amp;evaluatorId=1672491&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=adw58&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1672491</span>\n                        1672491\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1672491</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>i think the structure could be improved - a lot of time was wasted so we definitely got an abridged version of the course. i think the lectures could be more prepared, sometimes the professors seemed to trip over themselves in class.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow59_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20816&amp;evaluatorId=1672493&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=adw58&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1672493</span>\n                        1672493\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1672493</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: Unique psets that seem to be helpful in applying what is learned during lecture\r\nWeaknesses: Still less defined course due to new faculty</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow60_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20816&amp;evaluatorId=1673109&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=adw58&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1673109</span>\n                        1673109\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1673109</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>strengths: the professors!

For the future, I would recommend not using Ed Discussion as a place for announcements and instead using it as just a forum for students and professors to communicate. Browsing through several Ed Discussion forums to find important announcements was not ideal. Both Professor Weide and Professor Ozan are passionate about the subject, however, and always willing to make changes for the benefit of their students.

In turn, the material and assignments severely lacked rigor and much less content was covered. Furthermore, lectures earlier in the semester were somewhat disorganized and not thought out.

Additionally, i didn&#39;t like that some exams had major errors, its important to thoroughly  check exams before distributing them. You chose a good set of TA&#39;s, they were an amazing and integral part which helped me complete the psets. Certain TA&#39;s went above and beyond what was required of them . TA&#39;s should be paid for overtime and you should regulate the amount of TA&#39;s who can sign up for specific slots baseed on attendance data, so that there is a lot of help, especially the week before a deadline. At t HG e beginning, it was the understanding  that there woukd be 3 midterms, however, due to not making it thru lect materials, they reduced them to 2 which id something  i wrote the first exam unaware(partly my fault but also the instructors fault for not making this known from tge beginning)  of..this is really unfair bcz instead if the sxam being 10% it was now worth 15%.  Releasing exam practice materials a week or more ahead of time like the 2nd exam would also help absolve you of blame when students don&#39;t do as well. Lastly, a strength was that the profs realized their shortcomings, our stresses and frustrations as students and did their best to compansate for them in attendance points, bonus points, adjusting the late policy etc  They were more than understanding  of student struggles, God bless their souls for that. If they teach the course again with what they hv learned this semester, they&#39;ll do great - look to professor Slade, professor JDRS, for additional  material in organizing large lectures.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow73_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20816&amp;evaluatorId=1678777&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=adw58&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1678777</span>\n                        1678777\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1678777</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Very disorganized, bad problem sets and bad exams and bad lectures</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow74_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20816&amp;evaluatorId=1678803&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=adw58&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1678803</span>\n                        1678803\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1678803</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I found the course material quite interesting and lectures were engaging.

Later on, slides presentations helped alleviate this issue, but it was still not completely clear (the slides were a bit cluttered). I think there could be more emphasis on which concepts are most important, like the Data structures, their functions, and their respective runtimes. Due to organization issues, we might not have covered as many data structures as we were going to.

I should have been able to see this supplement in courses.yale.edu so I could register and prepare space for it! I would have done much better in the class I think if I knew ahead of time of this resource before class selection deadlines. Supplement classes should be visible to students well ahead of time and/or have the option to register for. \r\n\r\nI will say both professors were very receptive to student feedback and gave us extensions, curves, advice, and help in ways that went above and beyond my normal classes. They do care, I just think they got some things wrong that should be improved.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow119_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20816&amp;evaluatorId=1685020&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=adw58&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1685020</span>\n                        1685020\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1685020</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>While the course staff were all very helpful and supportive, the overall structure and pacing of the course could be a bit disorienting at times.

I would recommend 223 to anyone who potentially wants to go into tech after graduation.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow10_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20816&amp;evaluatorId=1647274&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=adw58&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1647274</span>\n                        1647274\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1647274</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>If you&#39;re a cs major you kinda have to, it&#39;s like death and taxes.

This course was extremely disorganized, but I don&#39;t really blame the professors since it&#39;s their first time running it. PSETS were made on the fly, and test cases were released either late or broken. PSETS almost always have bugs that instructor needs to fix. By the last two psets, instructors didnt even release test cases, covering up with &quot;well a good programmer should be able to think of their own test cases.&quot; Exams are hard, no curve.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow11_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20816&amp;evaluatorId=1647588&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=adw58&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1647588</span>\n                        1647588\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1647588</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Would not recommend the class in its current form.

Hopefully, the professors that taught this class in the previous years will teach it again, but this was the most disorganized course I have ever taken at Yale. It was the first time that both professors were teaching this class and they also wanted to change the curriculum to add C++. Initially, I was excited about the idea, but even before entering the C++ part of the content, the class started to become a mess. Since Ed Discussion participation was rewarded with bonus points, several posts a day with repeated information were made, especially near problem-set deadlines. Not only that, but it seemed like most problem sets were not properly reviewed by the professors, given that some of them had multiple announcements with changes and updates. For example, one of the psets stated that we should not use dynamically allocated memory when that was the only way to solve it. Professor Erat later sent an announcement correcting it and provided bonus points for students that did the pset using both dynamic and static memory. Furthermore, one of the codes provided in the *exam* gave segmentation fault, showing that they could have done a better job reviewing the exam before giving it to the entire class.\r\n\r\nCompared to students that took the class in previous semesters, I noticed how much more they learned and how much more they were satisfied with the class. I strongly encourage students to wait until someone else is teaching it. I also believe that the Computer Science department should do something about this core cs class. CS223 represents one of the main classes for the department and it was turned into a mess. One of the best things about this course was the ULAs. Many people went to their office hours for assistance and from my experience, they were incredibly helpful. I also wanted to give a huge shoutout to Ben Goldstein. My experience with the course would have been so much worse if it was not for him. Ben held a walkthrough for each problem set and exam review sessions, which were essential for me to better comprehend the contents of the class.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow51_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=20816&amp;evaluatorId=1672491&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=adw58&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1672491</span>\n                        1672491\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1672491</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>it&#39;s required for CS majors, and a pretty big part in coding interviews so yeah.
