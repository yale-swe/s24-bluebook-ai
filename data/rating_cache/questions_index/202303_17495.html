I think this is a fantastic intro statistics course. WEAKNESSES: This course had very weird pacing. We would spend a very long time hammering down one detail in lecture that didn&#39;t seem all that complicated, and very little time on actually important conceptual understandings. Also, I understand that JT doesn&#39;t include theory in slides because he wants you to come to lecture and pay attention, but it made studying for exams and doing psets very uncertain because you had to rely on your notes of JT&#39;s (sometimes inconsistent) wording from lecture. Psets were also incredibly tedious and repetitive, often asking the same questions over and over again rather than testing different angles or different kinds of concepts. Grading seemed inconsistent across friends in the class and I was often confused as to why I had points deducted from psets.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow11_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17495&amp;evaluatorId=1703558&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jlt63&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1703558</span>\n                        1703558\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1703558</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: the professor is a great lecturer. \r\nWeaknesses: before the midterm we did not get really far or nearly as far as we should have gotten. Therefore after the midterm we were on times 2 speed and had long psets due every week. Furthermore, the class needs like an extra TA. But the only office hours available to meet with TA&#39;s were during my class times. Furthermore, the professor holds Zoom office hours but they are 15 minutes and he is usually 5-10 minutes late to them. Another weakness, that stems from not having enough TA&#39;s is not getting work back in a timely manner. There was one pset that we did not get back/did not have solutions to that the next PSET was related. If I had gotten the first pset back on time, I would not have made those mistakes on the second one. Furthermore, things he barely covers are on exams, in lecture he never gives concrete answers and it is all wishy washy. He always tries to have a class in which the students engage/guess answers, but that is so confusing and especially when he is introducing new material he needs to be concise and precise.

I think this class tricked a lot of people with its pace/content at first. I also think this class is too big to have only 2 TFs. The problem sets took forever to get graded (the few we had), and with so few grades in the class, this also made it hard to know how I was doing with the material.

One way to improve the physical and health-related accessibility of this course would be to record lectures and release the recordings to students who have a Dean&#39;s Excuse.

He is really great as are the TFs. I like the structure of this class with a large lecture and a discussion section. Weaknesses: the timing of the discussion section compared to when the psets were due. I had section on Thursday, and psets were often due Wednesday, but some of the info we learned/reviewed in section would have been extremely helpful on the pset I had turned in the day before. This was quite frustrating. I liked it much better when psets were due Friday, because we had a chance to compile our questions and go to section to get them answered. Although there is always office hours, sometimes you don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t know, so office hours wasn&#39;t always the best option. Additionally, I wish section notes were posted BEFORE section, as were the lecture notes, because I had a Thursday section and the section notes were not posted until after the section on Friday, which slowed me down in reviewing/working on psets. It would be fair for everyone if they were posted before all discussion sections for that week began. Additionally, I would like psets to be graded before the next pset is due. In this class, concepts build on one another, so it is extremely important to know what one is doing wrong so that we can improve. However, grading was quite slow, so every week I wasn&#39;t sure that I was doing it correctly. Is feels unfair that half of our psets were graded in the last two weeks before our exams.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow19_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17495&amp;evaluatorId=1708357&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jlt63&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1708357</span>\n                        1708357\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1708357</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think the strengths are the time taken to go over complicated concepts in class.

The PSets not even being graded until like 3 weeks later makes it worse.

The discussion sections were a lot of help when it came to reviewing concepts but they would often run through very quickly. The grading was also very specific but they accept regrade requests for specific problems which I think was very useful. The format of the exam is pretty straightforward, but I would not necessarily say that the exam itself is easy. I thought that the exams were significantly harder than the problem sets. They would mostly ask about concepts that we discussed, but not in the way that we learned them. From my experience in this class, lectures and discussion sections are not enough for you to be confident in the concepts asked on the exams.

This is by far the most disorganized class I have ever taken or heard about at Yale. You might think I&#39;m exaggerating, but we were literally a month behind in lectures and problem sets, grading took forever (we didn&#39;t have half of our problem sets back before the deadline for Credit/D), and JT was consistently inconsistent in his announcements and putting things on Canvas. Furthermore, it is way, way too much of a focus on theory and being scientifically exact for an intro stats course for the GLBL major. Grading is a crapshoot based on whether you use the specific wording that they want to see, so good luck with that. JT is funny for sure, but he definitely needs to do some introspection on how his class runs. Like dude, there&#39;s probably a reason that no one in your 100 person class is jumping at the opportunity to answer the question you asked about a topic that we&#39;ve been talking about for half an hour. It&#39;s so mind-numbingly tedious that the entire class would be counting down each minute to lunch. Absolutely laughable that this is the best Yale can do. Me and several others are dropping the GLBL major because of this class, so I guess it&#39;s a good weed-out class. Only take it if you are fine with learning the most meticulous statistical theory over and over without really applying it except on problem sets. Oh, it&#39;s also crazy that they are still using Stata and forcing us to get a subscription to a software program that I&#39;m pretty sure was created in the 1980s. Absolutely ridiculous waste of tuition money.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow4_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17495&amp;evaluatorId=1700983&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=jlt63&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1700983</span>\n                        1700983\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1700983</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would not recommend this class unless you are required to take it for the Global Affairs major.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow5_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17495&amp;evaluatorId=1701923&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=jlt63&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1701923</span>\n                        1701923\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1701923</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Only if required</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow6_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17495&amp;evaluatorId=1702071&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=jlt63&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1702071</span>\n                        1702071\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1702071</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I am not considering Global Affairs students in this response as GLBL 121 is a requirement for the major.

Before you read other reviews please hear my diatribe. \r\nWhen you think you have a really nice professor who makes every effort to appear that they care, but they advertently or inadvertently sabotage your ability to perform in the class, you have a case of Stockholm Syndrome. That is the case with GLBL 121 with Justin Thomas. \r\nThis is the most useless class I have ever seen. First of all, Justin Thomas was completely and utterly useless. The man goes the speed of molasses through lecture. Its perhaps worse than watching paint dry, because at least when the paint dries you have a product you are proud of. With Justin Thomas, you stare in confusion at the board attempting to crack a smile so as to match his enthusiasm, wondering what is for lunch and questioning when you will ever need to use any of what you learn in this class in your life. Justin Thomas goes so slowly, in fact, that I wrote a number of poems throughout my time in the classthis was a newly discovered ability of mine. I think the mind can really wander when there is 0 substance to actually take in and when you so badly want to be somewhere else.\r\nNow you could just say wow, but isnt stats just boring - thats exactly what Justin Thomas says. His solution? Not to power through material and to show us actual cool real world examples, but rather to spend 10 minutes at the beginning of class telling a seemingly funny, unrelated story to keep people engaged. The class is so boring, in fact, that he has implemented policies such that if two or more students are sleeping in class, everyone has to stand up and recite a cult like speech telling him that they will never again fall asleep in class. \r\nNext, lets talk about the Justin Thomas give you a zero on the assignment if it is a second late policy. This is the nail in the coffin for Justin Thomas lovers. I struggle to process the mental gymnastics required to love your professor and say he is so fun and to simultaneously accept their policy to give you a zero on the assignment if it is a second late. Justin Thomas may claim to have his justifications for how late work becomes even later work, but it is difficult to reconcile his insistence on assignments being turned in on time with his a) repeatedly moving back psets because he went more slowly, and b) TAs failing to grade PSETS for close to a month after they are turned in. Why have a give you a zero if your PSET is a second late policy if it will not be graded for a month? \r\nNot to mention, the PSET and exam grading is horrendous. Some of the questions are all or nothing - i.e. if ONE word in your explanation is wrong, you get 0 credit. On my midterm, I got full credit on everything until the last three questions which asked us to describe terms/concepts - in each, the TAs thought something was slightly off and no cap deducted 15 points. \r\nTo make matters even worse, all of the problem sets are completely and utterly useless. Ive done Math 120 and intro econ courses - my experience is that those PSETS are actually intelligent even if occasionally annoying - you actually learn from them. Oh no, not here. Justin Thomas will have you do the same problem no cap 3 or four times BY HAND, specifically stating that you CANNOT use a statistical software to do the calculations, and if you miss even the slightest part of an explanation, POINTS OFF. It makes you wonder how mickey mouse the class is that Justin Thomas acts all laddy da during lecture and proceeds to have his TAs destroy you on grading and hell give you the most useless PSETS to complete. Its almost like he hates his students but Justin Thomas couldnt hate his students?!\r\nReally, then lets talk about how he literally has you learn STATA and not R, which everyone tells me is far more powerful and useful. No one uses STATA. So much for his speech at the beginning of the of the year where he says this class will actually be useful in your real life. \r\nSave yourself, don&#39;t</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow10_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17495&amp;evaluatorId=1702555&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=jlt63&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1702555</span>\n                        1702555\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1702555</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Take it if you need it for your major (global).
