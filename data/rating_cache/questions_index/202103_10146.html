The content of the course was very interesting and engaging, but I do feel that the order in which the lectures were presented was confusing. We would switch back and forth between lectures on neural development and other processes, and I felt that it just wasn&#39;t a smooth way to connect our learning. I feel that it would have been smoother and simpler to remember if we had learned the early lectures in their current order, then learned about patterning and gradients such as in the limb bud, then sex assignment and chromosomes, and finally spent the last several lectures on neurulation and neural cell development as a cohesive unit rather than sprinkling neural cell lectures in with the rest of the course.

I would say that a weakness of this course would be the lack of communication about what is expected of students for both the research proposal, in which many found themselves to feel completely on their own, and the quizzes wherein students were frustrated by the fact that points were taken off despite having what appeared to be detailed responses.

There was basically no guidance on how to write a research proposal (we did not read a research proposal, or learn how to write one; the instructions for the homework were very vague and did not provide concrete advice on how to go about answering the questions. It would have been helpful if there were problem sets that reinforce course content and also give practice for the quizzes. With so much course content and so little quiz time, I always felt overwhelmed by the amount of content that had to be studied for each weekly quiz. I think that problem sets would help to narrow the focus for studying. If anything, I wish that the last lecture on biotechnology happened earlier, so I could use those techniques in writing my research proposal. Additionally, if the writing component wishes to be kept, perhaps a literature review or an in-depth analysis of a paper (for example, like a journal club where each student prepares a presentation on a paper) would better reinforce the course content. I also wish that time in the discussion section was used more wisely. Reviewing a dense paper that was only tangentially related to course content did not help my understanding of genetics or development. The time we did a p&#39;set in section was much more helpful.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow17_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10146&amp;evaluatorId=1518487&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1518487</span>\n                        1518487\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1518487</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Researching the details about our chosen genes and using the information of the course in our scientific writing was very useful for our future as aspiring scientists.

I get 8 hours of sleep but would often find myself dozing off during lectures because they were not engaging. professor Irish was not very good at presenting the information in an understandable way, and when people asked clarifying questions, she would struggle to answer the questions in a clear way, often leaving us more confused. the quizzes were ridiculously difficult -- if the average grade on a quiz is an F, then that is the fault of the professor, not the students. the exam was also pretty unreasonable, but more reasonable than most of the quizzes. also, there was very little support in terms of doing the research proposal, and it was very difficult to do, but thankfully they graded pretty leniently on it so it ended up being a nice grade boost. there was also very little help in terms of preparation for the quizzes and exam. it would have been nice to have practice questions for both, even if it were just past quiz/exam questions. \r\n\r\nalso, sometimes they wouldn&#39;t even tell you what the correct answer on a quiz was, making it difficult to study for the final, since the quizzes were basically all we had in terms of practice questions. \r\n\r\nthe quizzes and exam were also worded pretty poorly. they were often looking for a very specific answer, but the wording of the questions was so vague that it made it difficult sometimes to understand what they were looking for. there were often dangling and misplaced modifiers within the question that made it difficult to understand what the question was asking. \r\n\r\non ed discussion, the answers we received were pretty awful sometimes. sometimes a teaching fellow would link a scientific paper in response to our question, rather than answering the question himself. scientific papers are pretty hard to follow in general, so I don&#39;t see why a link to one was considered an acceptable answer to our questions. additionally, sometimes what was said on ed discussion contradicted what was said in class. there was one time in particular that I remember when a teaching fellow or someone drew from a scientific paper to answer someone&#39;s question; however, what was in the paper was new research that contradicted what we had learned in class.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow23_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10146&amp;evaluatorId=1518556&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1518556</span>\n                        1518556\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1518556</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think the course could be organized better to make it easier to follow especially when it comes to development; we kept on jumping between genetics topics and development that it made it hard to really understand either, especially for development where there are a lot of processes to understand. I of course realize that the two are connected, but I feel like there definitely is a better way to divide the topics to make it make more sense.  Also, some of the quizzes were wildly unfair; there were questions that we did not learn about in class at all, not even in the sense that we had to apply things we had learned, there was simply no way for us to know the answers. While it wasn&#39;t a huge deal because everything is curved relative to the rest of the class, it was just frustrating. There also was very little feedback on the quizzes so we could not even go back and understand it afterwards, since all of the provided answers were very vague.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow24_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10146&amp;evaluatorId=1518559&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1518559</span>\n                        1518559\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1518559</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Lectures have a bunch of random information.

Dr. Irish is a very caring professor who took the time to answer our questions and even attend our final presentations! The TAs and peer tutors are also so, so passionate about teaching difficult topics.\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n1) The quizzes. Dear god, the quizzes. Practice problems / concepts that are reflective of what we may see on the quizzes should be integrated more into lecture and/or section. Perhaps my mindset is not cut out for STEM, but I do not understand how the quiz questions were helpful in any way for students to understand concepts. The difficulty and formatting of the quiz questions would have been better applied in a discussion format rather than a timed quiz. This is not how you teach students to be concise. This is how you teach students to be terrified of whether or not their answer is &quot;correct&quot; rather than why the &quot;correct&quot; answer is what it is.\r\n2) TAs were not allowed to share their slides?? This blew my mind. I was told that the reasoning behind this was &quot;fairness for all students&quot;, since some students may have TAs who make different slides (or not at all). If this is the case, then why not have all the TAs share the slides so all students have access regardless of their section? Perhaps one might then argue that students would not come to section, but then the easy solution would just be to have TAs take attendance. Maybe there&#39;s another reason, but at the moment I believe the restriction of sharing seems like gatekeeping. I had the most amazing TA in this course who created slides that paired very well with how I learn best, and while I did take good notes, I was disappointed to learn that my TA was not allowed to share those slides.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow34_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10146&amp;evaluatorId=1518588&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1518588</span>\n                        1518588\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1518588</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>NEED BETTER LECTURE SLIDES</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow35_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10146&amp;evaluatorId=1518589&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1518589</span>\n                        1518589\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1518589</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Weaknesses\r\nThis course would have been better taught from recorded lectures, since an overwhelming amount of material is covered and the lecture slides and study guides have minimal explanation on them. The lectures didn&#39;t explain concepts well enough, and I feel like I didn&#39;t understand them until going to peer tutoring hours. Late into the semester I found out from classmates that the lectures had been recorded. This information would have been helpful to know earlier.\r\n\r\nThe weekly quizzes were way too hard, yet the poor class performance on quizzes was barely acknowledged by the teaching team, nor were tips given on how to improve our performance. Despite being told that we would be tested on the application of concepts, quizzes also seemed to test minutiae and details that were not relevant to understanding the overall concepts or were badly worded to almost feel like trick questions. \r\n\r\nThe homework assignments took extremely long to complete since we were tasked with finding the equivalent of a needle in a haystack. The homework directions were also poorly worded and resulted in confusion and then points being deducted. Each week in discussion, the TA would go in-depth into what we SHOULD have done on last week&#39;s homework...this was very frustrating since the TA&#39;s directions cleared up a lot of the confusion, but it was too late to change last week&#39;s assignment. These directions should be included, from the beginning, in the homework instructions. \r\n\r\nBecause of the amount of content and level of challenge in this class, discussion sections would be better used to reinforce topics from class. We are already interacting with scientific papers to do our homework assignments and I don&#39;t think reading more papers for discussion is useful.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow36_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10146&amp;evaluatorId=1518590&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=tdl32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1518590</span>\n                        1518590\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1518590</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Very much a self-taught course.

This way, students will be able to better assess their understanding of the material and be better adept to answer these difficult application-based quiz questions.

The homework did nothing to reinforce the content; it seemed very disconnected to what we were learning. The discussion section pset was more helpful in learning than the gene homework.
