Perhaps a final review session (especially since the exam is cumulative) would have definitely helped. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nIn the ways that it could be improved, I think it was little difficult to stay engaged with the subject especially because Marlyse would sometimes go off topic about certain things when lecturing on lecture material. I also remember when I was studying for the midterm, I hopped on office hours for a TA, but he was not able to answer questions about the lecture material and just referred me to the slides instead. It was a little hard communicating with everyone in our forest group to meet in person and to discuss the scientific articles, but I also liked the leisure to do that compared to mandatory discussion sections. Mandatory discussion sections make it a little difficult to engage with the material and have fun / get to know classmates in a more relaxed manner.\r\n\r\nOffice hours was also only held Mon-Wed, although my TA (Grace) was really good and responsive with her emails and even met up with me one on one to discuss feedback on the midterm.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow8_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=13426&amp;evaluatorId=1613810&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=mcd3&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1613810</span>\n                        1613810\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1613810</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No improvements, I loved this course.

Course content is super fun and interesting; especially if you don&#39;t have any forestry background, taking this course will totally change the way you look at forests. I had a really positive reading group experience (although not everyone did), and I think establishing a culture of &#39;everyone will do the reading and be engaged&#39; in the first couple weeks is really important. The readings are scientific articles, which were tough for me, but knowing that everyone else would do the readings and knowing that we would have interesting, meaningful discussion about them kept me motivated to read as the course went on, and I got busier. The reading group is so easy to blow off, but your experience of the class will be so much better if you take it seriously.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow15_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=13426&amp;evaluatorId=1618647&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=mcd3&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1618647</span>\n                        1618647\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1618647</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course just wasn&#39;t for me.

I felt like there was often too much of a disconnect between what we learned in lecture, what we read, and what we discussed in our groups so it was just kind of hard to know what I was supposed to be learning/what knowledge was the most crucial. For example, I felt like some questions that were on the midterm were just testing if I remembered a small fact that was briefly mentioned in lecture once. This was mostly an issue just because of the great breadth of the course. It would have been great if we had like a list of specific key concepts that we could use to center our learning. I don&#39;t mean this in a &quot;I&#39;m a baby and need the course concepts spoon-fed to me&quot; type of way, but rather a &quot;this class covers so much content and concepts that I don&#39;t know where to begin&quot; type of way.

I enjoyed my discussion group, but I suspect that my experience would have been negative if our group members had not been as responsible as they were. I appreciated that the final exam was take home and open notes. Both the midterm and final should be take home in the future.\r\nWeaknesses: My friends and I felt that Dr. Duguid often spoke too fast during lecture. I understand that professors must go through presentations quickly, but I just felt that I did not have enough time to process what was being said (and I did not have time to look at the recordings later). I wish that the weekly reading response and field journal assignments had been worth more points because I put a lot of time and effort into them but only got one point for each. Even though I had already prepared two drafts of the annotated bibliography prior to finals week, it was very stressful to do the final project and the final exam. Despite the extensive work I had done for the final project prior to finals period, the annotated bibliography took me a ridiculous amount of time to finish (and I therefore had less time to prepare for the final). It would have been helpful to have had access to the answer key when we got our midterm grades back. I did not know why I got questions wrong and had to go to office hours to get answers during a very busy time of the semester. Finally, I did not like that we were asked to evaluate our discussion group members at the end of the semester.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow27_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=13426&amp;evaluatorId=1630232&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=mcd3&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1630232</span>\n                        1630232\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1630232</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The lectures were engaging and fascinating and the professor funny and lively.

The final project is also a pretty hefty assignment that was added on top of a normal final. You will leave the class so excited about trees, and it really did change how I see the world when I walk down the street (what Professor Duguid said was the goal of the course at the beginning of the semester).

There is so much to learn and enjoy.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow51_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=13426&amp;evaluatorId=1640374&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=mcd3&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1640374</span>\n                        1640374\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1640374</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think you really have to care about the subject to enjoy the class so I would recommend it to anyone who is passionate about forestry</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow52_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=13426&amp;evaluatorId=1640391&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=mcd3&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1640391</span>\n                        1640391\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1640391</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Absolutely!!
