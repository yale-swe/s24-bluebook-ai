I will keep this research style in mind when it comes time for writing my senior thesis.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow120_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18705&amp;evaluatorId=1691832&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=el377&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691832</span>\n                        1691832\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691832</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned about biochemistry as a whole , as well as how to read and comprehend scientific papers/info.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow121_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18705&amp;evaluatorId=1691833&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=el377&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691833</span>\n                        1691833\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691833</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I have learned a lot about how to study effectively and retain information.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow122_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18705&amp;evaluatorId=1691882&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=el377&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691882</span>\n                        1691882\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691882</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Based on how this course was run, I developed better note taking skills</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow123_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18705&amp;evaluatorId=1691967&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=el377&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691967</span>\n                        1691967\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691967</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned how to apply biological concepts to our body systems!</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow124_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18705&amp;evaluatorId=1691970&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=el377&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691970</span>\n                        1691970\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691970</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned about many mechanisms related to biochemistry and biophysics.

At the discussion sections, since we were challenged to approach the material through application-based problems, I felt that I better understood what I had learned that week. Although I didn&#39;t attend any due to schedule conflicts, I have heard from friends that the peer tutoring sessions were very helpful. \r\n\r\nThe quizzes were quite difficult sometimes, though. I felt that the weekly homework helped prepare me for the writing portions of the quizzes, but the multiple choice questions were occasionally confusing. I think it would be nice to have access to multiple choice questions, along with an answer key, for students to practice throughout the week and force them to truly understand the material tested on in the practice problems.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow1_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18705&amp;evaluatorId=1691229&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=el377&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691229</span>\n                        1691229\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691229</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The major strengths of this course is that the lectures are asynchronous meaning that students can rewatch lectures at any time to review class material and content as well as having lowest quiz grade and homework assignment dropped.

You do get a comprehensive understanding of the course material. In addition, the Ed Discussion forum helps to clarify any questions that students may have without the need to go to office hours.\r\n\r\nI think some weaknesses include the number of meetings with the mentors. As there are four benchmarks, I feel like there should be four meetings with the mentors.

I liked the information we learned. \r\nWeaknesses: I did not like how the course was structured. It felt like there was never a break, as every week there were multiple things due at 3-4 different days/times throughout the week. It was made even more stressful/confusing by the fact that each week the timing of one or two assignments changed. The overarching calendar on the canvas page did not always reflect the actual timing of assignment due dates throughout the week. It was confusing that some weeks the HW video quizzes were due on Wednesday at 11:30 and other weeks at 7:30. Some weeks, I had a pset and a benchmark due on Saturday, then a quiz due on Monday, and then the next pset due on Wednesday (when we were discussing specific papers in section.) This felt like way too much work due around the same time. I wish we had either few assignments or had the same amount of assignments but with a more consistent timeline. There are so many documents explaining what to do each week or how to format thingsI think the whole system should be simplified so their is more focus on the actual bio material. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the recorded lectures by Dr. Kabeche were difficult to follow especially in comparison to Prof. Koelles&#39;. I did not get much out of them. I had to look up the information she taught on my own.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow10_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18705&amp;evaluatorId=1691246&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=el377&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691246</span>\n                        1691246\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691246</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: The course was relatively low-stakes, which fit my expectations for an introductory course into biology, especially for students who have never taken a biology course. I also liked the fact that lectures were made available online, alongside other materials to aid students in their studies. My favorite part about the course is its discussion sections because that is where you can get the chance to actually talk with others and collaborate. I think collaboration is key and the discussion sections help to explain things that may not have been covered in the lecture. It also gave students a chance to talk to their TAs and get some questions answered/clarified. I also thoroughly enjoyed the Ed Discussion option, which came in very handy when you are wondering about something. The Final Project/Benchmark was also helpful, in my opinion, because you were able to look at real life proteins and connect them to the concepts you learned about in class. I found that the concepts that I had applied to my protein, were the concepts I understood more in the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I did not enjoy the entirely asynchronous aspect of the course. Needing to dedicate time to watching the lectures, while also preparing the other assignments often was too much for many students and many people ended up doing the mini-quizzes first just to finish before the Wednesday deadline. It felt like a lot of work at times, especially for those who had discussion section on Wednesdays. Another weakness was getting grades back on time --although I understand that it is difficult to grade everyone&#39;s responses in a timely manner, it is frustrating when you do not know what your previous score was on a quiz in order to gauge whether or not your methods of studying/understanding are working. Having that score can help students know if they need more help and need to attend more office hours or continue doing what they&#39;re doing.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow11_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18705&amp;evaluatorId=1691250&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=el377&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691250</span>\n                        1691250\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691250</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The flipped class format makes one feel small and isolated, since there is no opportunity to interact with the professor or other students.

It feels as if we are constantly jumping to and fro from topic to topic, instead of gaining a solid grasp and then moving forward.\r\nThe assignments themselves, especially the course-long molecule project, were intellectually stimulating, engaging, and significantly enhanced my understanding of the material.

The class is very nice in terms of accommodations to people&#39;s learning. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the timeline is very strict and extremely fast-paced. Each week, there is an in-person quiz on Monday. Weekly lectures are released the Sunday before and due on Wednesdays at noon. Homework and Benchmark (final projects that you work on throughout the semester) are due on Saturdays at 11:59 p.m. Some of these deadlines don&#39;t make sense to me. I wish that we had more time to do the weekly lectures/mini-quizzes. They should either be released before Sunday or not due on Wednesday. Releasing it on Sunday doesn&#39;t make sense since people will be studying for &quot;last week&#39;s&quot; quiz on Monday. I also believe that Homework and Benchmarks should be due on Sundays since it is appropriate to do all of that week&#39;s work on that week. The rigid deadlines make the course very hard to learn at an appropriate pace. \r\nAnother weakness is the ambiguity and unclearness of quiz questions. It causes people to interpret the question incorrectly and lead to incorrect responses. It&#39;s unfair for students when the problem is not their learning but rather the way questions are worded, not precise, not concise, nor clear.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow25_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18705&amp;evaluatorId=1691286&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=el377&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691286</span>\n                        1691286\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691286</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The lectures for this course were clear and easy to follow!

I like that we can kind of work at our own pace but I think making the lectures due at a later time is a decision that should continue to be implemented. Journal club with the annotations at the end of the article were extremely helpful. I loved the study sheet every week and our to do lists. I appreciated the emphasis on learning rather than worrying about the grade. I also really liked EdDiscussion. I think that the 1-1 meetings with advisors for our benchmark can be useful, however I did not like the benchmark project. I understand the idea behind it and the exposure to scientific articles / independent research outside of the provided materials, however I found myself each week struggling for hours and hours to understand anything about my protein. I&#39;m not one to shy away from hard work, but it felt like I was thrown in the deep end and required to write a lot about something I couldn&#39;t comprehend. It is good that these benchmarks are graded based on your education level in an effort to make things more equitable, but I could still feel the education gap very strongly. When I did stumble across concepts we learned in the course, I found it so difficult to conceptualise them in relation to my protein because the rest of the reading was too advanced. Although it did force me to understand the concepts on a deeper level, I felt like most of the time I didn&#39;t understand what was happening and hoped I sounded correct so I wouldn&#39;t fail. I appreciated the support from enrichment and the intention behind it, but I feel like there needs to be a better management of time for these sessions. There are a lot of things to cover and often times I feel we didn&#39;t get to the most important parts due to time. The worksheets were good, it would be better if we could take them with us though. This session would benefit from more student voice in what we feel we need to go over in the session. From attending peer tutoring and completing the quizzes, I found that some questions were put in that we barely talked about and felt that I wasn&#39;t prepared for. I also wish HW sessions were offered at another time during the week, I wasn&#39;t able to attend it and would&#39;ve really liked to!</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow28_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18705&amp;evaluatorId=1691296&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=el377&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691296</span>\n                        1691296\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691296</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The class format of watching lectures each week and only being in person to take a quiz does not allow students to be truly engaged or ask questions.

Discussion sections were the most helpful part of the class, but the topics discussed were either irrelevant to the quizzes or did not go in-depth enough to fully aid in answering quiz questions.

The TFs are busy and don&#39;t have enough time to properly help each student with their project so feedback wasn&#39;t very helpful. The quizzes also made the class more stressful with very little benefit. Yes, we were forced to study the material and not having a proper midterm was nice, but it was hard to study material that was only presented in an online lecture. Instead of having the quizzes it would be better to take some time out of in-person lecture to go through the HW p-set, allowing students to interact and ask questions then. The class did have some tutoring hours and homework sessions, but they would sometimes conflict with other classes which is why utilizing the actual class time is something that should be done to improve the class. The professors and TFs are all extremely nice and willing to help, it&#39;s just hard to ask questions about things you don&#39;t understand because you don&#39;t even know how to phrase a question or what to ask. I would recommend switching to in-person lectures, reducing quizzes and getting rid of the final project, extending the p-set to compensate, as that is what helped me learn a lot of the concepts.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow35_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18705&amp;evaluatorId=1691310&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=el377&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691310</span>\n                        1691310\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691310</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Ed discussion was a major strength for this course.

Overall, I think for being an online class I though the discussion sections were very engaging and helpful and that responses from professors when I did have a question were very fast and helpful whether though email or Ed.

This meant much more time reviewing these online lecture videos than the time that was actually allocated for lectures had it been taught traditionally.

This enabled me to take notes as I watched the lecture at my own pace (without worry of the professor moving too quickly and not being able to finish writing down notes), and I could rewind the lecture in case I didn&#39;t understand something and wanted to better comprehend the topic. \r\n\r\nOne improvement could be releasing the weekly material more than one week before hand. In this way, I can know in advance what assignments I have to do and how to plan out my week.

I do understand that we are notified if there are any assignments due earlier in the week than usual, but with the material releasing only on Sunday and having 2 days to complete it is still a bit stressful.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow80_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18705&amp;evaluatorId=1691572&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=el377&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691572</span>\n                        1691572\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691572</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think the asynchronous class method is very beneficial and useful to students who have good discipline, but I would not recommend the course to people for their first semester because many have yet to build those skills.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow81_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18705&amp;evaluatorId=1691583&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=el377&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691583</span>\n                        1691583\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691583</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Every homework was due on Saturday.

In my opinion, it would be beneficial for this course to either go in person or make the quizzes less difficult (or less weighed in the final grade) so that the material being tested accurately covers what is being learned by the students. It would also be beneficial to hold the homework help/office hours at a different time because the time slot on Thursdays often conflicts with other class meeting times and office hours.

Also would be helpful if the lecture slides in the files section on canvas were bigger; the text is so small and partially hidden by a thick black border.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow90_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18705&amp;evaluatorId=1691667&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=el377&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691667</span>\n                        1691667\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691667</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I did not enjoy online lectures.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow91_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18705&amp;evaluatorId=1691677&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=el377&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691677</span>\n                        1691677\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691677</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>quiz questions were sometimes too ambiguous/not covered in lectures.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow92_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18705&amp;evaluatorId=1691679&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=el377&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691679</span>\n                        1691679\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691679</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The async format of course was weird at first, but I think I quickly got used to it and I think I actually prefer it now.

It also allowed to finish all the lectures early so that I could get started on the homework earlier in the week. This course could definitely be improved by adding more opportunities for office hours with the professor, and peer tutoring. The collaborative homework office hours is only held once a week, late in the week, and during a time when a lot of people have class. And considering the large class size, I think a lot of us would have benefited from having more days and times where office hours were held. Also, peer tutoring only being held on the weekends was not always great because I felt that it enabled me to procrastinate studying since I wouldnt be able to get help and review for quizzes in person until the weekend.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow110_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18705&amp;evaluatorId=1691755&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=el377&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1691755</span>\n                        1691755\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1691755</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I did not like how it was online.
