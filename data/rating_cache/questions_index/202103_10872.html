Without putting in this effort and actually reading the textbook chapters, however, this class is impossibly hard. I learned a lot during this semester, with topics including a general chemistry review, acidity/basicity, stereochemistry, retrosynthesis, and reaction mechanisms. As a pre-med and non-chemistry major, however, I question how useful this class actually is for my future. A lot of the information that the instructor went over definitely was not retained by my mind, and it was difficult to always understand both the steps to solving a problem and the theory behind it. Taking organic chemistry with no previous experience in my first semester is a decision I regret; however, it definitely taught me a lot about time management, stress, and study strategies. I definitely know how to approach other difficult STEM classes in the future much better, but taking this class was certainly a trade-off: many hours of my time for very little reward.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow3_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10872&amp;evaluatorId=1521923&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1521923</span>\n                        1521923\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1521923</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Being fluent with organic synthesis!

Honestly, truly understanding chemistry makes your life so much easier. Instead of having to memorize everything, you will be able to rationalize what you&#39;re doing. This skill is applicable to so many different aspects of chemistry. When presented with a reagent you&#39;ve never seen before, you&#39;ll be able to make an educated guess as to what it will do to your starting material. Learning to do retrosynthesis problems is another thing that helps you develop your problem soling skills.

It can be demotivating in class to never know what is going on. The readings for each class are also sometimes very long and require much more time than given to fully understand.

I personally would have preferred a lecture style, especially since this was my first ever difficult STEM class at Yale. It definitely showed me an alternate teaching style, but I&#39;m not sure this is the best method of introducing a science subject to first years. I would have preferred more guidance and lecture-type teaching. Discussion section, however, was incredibly useful and one of the most helpful parts of the course. My discussion section, which started at 8pm and was meant to take until 8:50pm, often took until 10pm or 10:30pm. The TAs were very willing to help us and stay for hours to make sure we understood the material. The course could be improved by switching to a lecture style and also adding in additional review sessions before each midterm. The reviews were always amazing, but it would be better to have at least 2 of them, and more spaced out before the midterm (rather than the night before).</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow2_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10872&amp;evaluatorId=1521637&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1521637</span>\n                        1521637\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1521637</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>There&#39;s a lot of collaboration, which is good.

The drawback of the flipped classroom, however, is the fact that it does require you to put in more effort than a lecture. Learning to read the textbook and understand new topics before going to class is definitely challenging at first, but once you get the hang of it the course gets much easier workload wise. The TAs of the course we&#39;re absolutely amazing. They were super helpful in clarifying whatever might have been left unclear during class, always answered your questions, and were generally really supportive with whatever problems you had, whether it be a specific retrosynthesis problem or your motivation to study chemistry. Occasionally, I felt that the class went too fast. In some classes, I just felt like I was simply trying to copy down whatever Tim was writing on the board, but did not have time to actually think about what I was writing.

Our understanding might be increased if the lectures were a little slower, but overall Id say that this is a fairly minor weakness.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow38_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10872&amp;evaluatorId=1540003&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1540003</span>\n                        1540003\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1540003</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: Achieve is only graded on completion and makes the pre-class assignments less stressful, and Tim stresses MO theory, which allows you to not memorize everything but instead understand why it is.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Due to the flipped classroom design, you basically have to teach yourself everything or hope that you have a good TA. This leads to this class being a ton of work. Lectures mainly go over practice problems, but sometimes the problems felt unnecessary to what we had learned in the reading and weren&#39;t explained well. Also, I dislike the grading system since you can only drop either the first or second midterm, but not the third, which I felt had the most difficult content. This means that you are severely disadvantaged if you do poorly on the third midterm, even if you have done well on the other two. Meanwhile, others who bombed the second or first midterm are completely fine. In addition, the final is only worth 10% of your grade whereas midterms are worth either 20% or 30% depending on whether or not you drop one. It feels like the final is worth nothing in comparison.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow39_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10872&amp;evaluatorId=1540050&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1540050</span>\n                        1540050\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1540050</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>strengths: emphasized reasoning and de-emphasized memorization, fun and created sense of community among first year students\r\n\r\nweaknesses: required a learning curve to acclimate to flipped classroom model, required a lot of self learning and teaching</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow40_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10872&amp;evaluatorId=1540057&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1540057</span>\n                        1540057\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1540057</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The primary weakness of this course was the flipped classroom model.

I like the way the homework and problem sets are through achieve and graded for completion because it allows you to learn from your mistakes. Out of all of my classes, this one had the most collaborative environment. The classroom is set up with tables of people that you sit with for the entire unit. The study halls also help foster this collaborative environment. The practice tests were immensely helpful and probably the most valuable resource for studying for the exams. I think the exams for this class are fair and reflect what we have been taught. While the practice tests are definitely helpful, the answers to the practice tests are never posted and you have to get the answers the night before the exam at the review session. This makes studying the correct information difficult because you are given such a short amount of time to look over it. I also think the practice exams should be posted sooner. I do not think the textbook for this class was very helpful. The textbook just had so much information that we were not held responsible for knowing. This made reading the textbook often feel like a waste of time. I think I learned the most just by repeatedly doing the practice problems the TFs provided. I think an improvement to this course would be if the instructor provided practice problems for everyone. The textbook being unhelpful is definitely an issue in this class since the format is flipped classroom. I think flipped classroom would be much more effective if we had a better means of learning the material on our own. If flipped classroom continues to be used, I think it would be beneficial if the instructor posted explanatory videos or supplemental materials that taught the concepts in depth.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow45_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10872&amp;evaluatorId=1540358&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1540358</span>\n                        1540358\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1540358</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think the variety of options available to get extra practice/help (study halls, discussion sections, and office hours) are really valuable, and it&#39;s also nice to have a cohort of freshmen who tend to be taking similar classes to form study groups.

Although sometimes I wished that this course was a lecture rather than flipped classroom style, the flipped classroom style and small-table seating allowed me to meet so many people, and even some of my closest friends!</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow31_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10872&amp;evaluatorId=1539960&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1539960</span>\n                        1539960\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1539960</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>It&#39;s a great way to learn ochem, you need to put in a ton of work though and don&#39;t expect to rely on Tim if you&#39;re having trouble.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow32_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10872&amp;evaluatorId=1539969&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1539969</span>\n                        1539969\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1539969</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Defintely!</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow33_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10872&amp;evaluatorId=1539971&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1539971</span>\n                        1539971\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1539971</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, if the student is interested/has to take organic chemistry.
