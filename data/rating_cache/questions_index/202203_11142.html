It is a very interesting intro course that taught me many facts but not many methods or new patterns of thought.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow27_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11142&amp;evaluatorId=1622337&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=bs265&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1622337</span>\n                        1622337\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1622337</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>A general but comprehensive understanding of what is cognitive science and the disciplines that fall within it.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow28_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11142&amp;evaluatorId=1622380&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=bs265&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1622380</span>\n                        1622380\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1622380</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>a general introduction to different fields in cognitive science\r\nbetter note-taking skills \r\nchanged the way I think about perception</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow29_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11142&amp;evaluatorId=1622714&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=bs265&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1622714</span>\n                        1622714\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1622714</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned how to avoid instinct blindness in my daily life.

PSYC 130 was one of the most unaccommodating classes Ive taken at Yale by far, and I wish I had known that it would be so at the beginning of the semester. After taking challenging PSYC courses, like the Human Brain, as well as PSYC 150 and a higher level Research Methods is Psychotic Illnesses, I know that to understand course material may take some new adaptation and strategy on my part, yet I still never had to worry about failing any of these classes. This is not the case with Brian Scholls lecture, and it&#39;s not because the material is harder, I actually found the lectures talked about similar topics I learned about in PSYC 110 and PSYC 150 in the past.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow31_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11142&amp;evaluatorId=1623394&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=bs265&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1623394</span>\n                        1623394\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1623394</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>knowledge of different cognitive science disciplines</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow32_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11142&amp;evaluatorId=1624036&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=bs265&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624036</span>\n                        1624036\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624036</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned lots about the interdisciplinary study of the mind.

I think that it would be helpful to have improved slides for the class. I also think that sometimes the readings for some days can take a long time. I think that those who assign readings should pay attention to the word count of each reading rather than page count (as some readings have very small font and take much longer even though the page count is low).</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow1_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11142&amp;evaluatorId=1607745&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=bs265&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1607745</span>\n                        1607745\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1607745</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths - lecture is interesting and the course is very much a rehearsed production\r\nWeaknesses - the course would be much easier to engage with were it to use Canvas and were Prof. Scholl to upload the slides without transitions.

I love Brian Scholl (he reminds me of my dad lol). Even though I had this lecture immediately after another lecture, I could still stay focused because of the interactive and engaging material. Some lectures were more boring than others, but overall I enjoyed them. The biggest weakness of the course is how we are tested. The point of testing is to make sure we understand the material, but with a real sense of what an exam will look like, it is easier to prepare correctly. Other classes (one people compare to this is Psyc 110) have much more straightforward exams, so knowing definitions/concepts is more than enough. Scholl&#39;s tests are much trickier than this. Definitions can be enough for some questions, but a lot of questions combine subjects in a way we haven&#39;t seen before. I would change the course by having more smaller quizzes (e.g., on canvas even though Scholl hates canvas) throughout the course so that students can test if they understand the material or not. This could be worth little to nothing, so students can choose how much they get out of them, but I think they would be super super helpful. Moreover, the singular essay does not allow students to improve their &quot;thought paper&quot; writing skills. I think the course should 100% have two essays, or at least students should be required to submit an initial draft for their essay for a first grade, and then be able to make corrections for the second grade. Not being able to improve on the first (and also not even getting the grade until after anyone would care to improve on what they did poorly) seems dumb to me.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow3_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11142&amp;evaluatorId=1608101&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=bs265&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1608101</span>\n                        1608101\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1608101</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths was the material was very interesting.

Like it took forever to get our midterm grade back and never got our essay grade back. So I have no clue how I am going to do in the class. The professor is kind of a strength and weakness. I think he teaches cognitive science well and knows his stuff, but tries to set up the class in a way that can be very annoying at times.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr

This led to some strange points where we would have to understand specific and technical concepts without spending much time learning about them and with no other training in those fields (Turing machines and case assignment).

You feel like you just have to read the instructors mind.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow29_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11142&amp;evaluatorId=1620588&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=bs265&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1620588</span>\n                        1620588\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1620588</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: Interesting topics and the professor was pretty fantastic.\r\nWeaknesses: if you missed class, it was quite difficult to catch up as the lectures were not recorded and the slides posted after class only really made sense if you were in lecture.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow30_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11142&amp;evaluatorId=1620625&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=bs265&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1620625</span>\n                        1620625\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1620625</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: interesting topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I never knew what was happening in the class or what was important during the lectures.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow31_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11142&amp;evaluatorId=1621047&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=bs265&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1621047</span>\n                        1621047\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1621047</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The class covers a lot of interesting material, but does not go into depth with it.

I felt like a lot of the lecture talked about certain beauty standards and explained why they were universal due to evolution, and I feel like not enough attention was given to dismantling the idea that people should aspire to certain beauty standards (even though this was explicitly stated by the instructor, it still felt like he was unintentionally promoting the beauty standards). Also, when he referred to certain faces in studies as &quot;attractive&quot; and &quot;unattractive&quot;, assuming that we would all agree with him, it just felt like we were upholding and naturalizing conventional beauty standards, which is harmful to people who do not fit into those beauty standards.

I felt like I didn&#39;t know how to study for the midterm, and so the outcome didn&#39;t reflect the amount of work I put into the class day to day. This would be fine, but the two exams make up 60% of your final grade, which seems really high for an intro class. I didn&#39;t get any feedback on any work except the midterm, which was frustrating when trying to navigate the requirements of the class. Weighing the exams less, giving more feedback on reading responses, or providing even a handful of example questions could make this class a lot better.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow47_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11142&amp;evaluatorId=1627285&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=bs265&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1627285</span>\n                        1627285\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1627285</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: I liked the topic matter itself and I liked having to respond to the reading response questions so I would stay on top of the readings.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Having office hours immediately after class was not helpful because it would not give me enough time to reflect on the lecture and ask questions. I also would be tired after the hour and 15 min long lecture so would not want to stay back. The lectures are not recorded and there is no Zoom option so if students are sick or cannot attend class for a personal reason you have to rely on others to get the notes. The lecture slides are also not posted in their entirety so it is hard for students to catch back up. I also was not really entertained by the lectures and would get annoyed by the random interludes of random jokes and corny videos but that is just my frustration with the teaching style. There also is not a practice exam so it is hard to study for the tests.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow48_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11142&amp;evaluatorId=1627634&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=bs265&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1627634</span>\n                        1627634\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1627634</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>It is super engaging, but not giving us the full slides was quite mean.

Further, even when I had COVID, I couldn&#39;t access any lecture recordings since the lectures aren&#39;t recorded, and I had to wait an extra week for Professor Scholl to post the bare templates which were unintelligible to someone that couldn&#39;t listen to the lecture. This harsh treatment also extends to missing exams if you miss an exam because of a legitimate reason (illness, religious holiday, anything covered in a dean&#39;s excuse), Professor Scholl punishes you unfairly by giving you an exam entirely different and much more difficult than the rest of the class (no multiple choice, no short answer, only long responses, no skips). \r\n\r\nI understand Professor Scholl&#39;s worries about students taking advantage of the system, but there are many instances where students can&#39;t help but miss lecture/exam, and it is his responsibility as a professor of a large lecture course to provide fair exams and slides/recordings.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow60_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11142&amp;evaluatorId=1631452&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=bs265&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1631452</span>\n                        1631452\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1631452</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths were the cool reading assignments, the low workload, and the way complex concepts were explained.

That&#39;s THE strength of this course, an opportunity to be introduced to many, many ways cognitive science is used in many fields, of which you are then free to choose whichever you enjoy! Embrace learning about so many different things that may not appeal to you at first, and pick the parts of cogsci that you like most to study in the future because it is an absolutely fascinating field! Also, professor Scholl, in my opinion, is an absolutely amazing professor in what he does - the structure of the lectures is great, and he keeps you engaged throughout the hour and 15 minutes. The material is amazing too, the way he has picked the readings is just challenging enough so you&#39;re always learning a lot, but also not stuck on any new themes he introduces. Moreover, I am a big proponent of learning in class instead of just from the slides right before the exam, so a lot of criticisms about being difficult to study for exams I did not experience at all. I couldn&#39;t make it to 8 lectures in total but still got a good grade on all exams by virtue of asking friends what he talked about in the lecture and going through the slides together.\r\nWeaknesses: Not many for my style of learning, that is, little cramming, much utilization of lecture time.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow64_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11142&amp;evaluatorId=1633810&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=bs265&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1633810</span>\n                        1633810\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1633810</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Be careful when deciding to take this course.

The criticisms about the breadth of the course and the hate on professor Scholl&#39;s slides I find confusing. It&#39;s THE point of the course to serve as an opportunity to be introduced to many, many ways cognitive science is used in many fields, of which you are then free to choose whichever you enjoy. Also, the exams are very easy to study for, if you take a one-second look at Scholl&#39;s presented research on studying - take paper notes, engage with the lecture, spaced repetition for terms if needed and the course is easy from there on. I even missed a lot of lectures, and still just by talking to a friend for a bit about the content that was presented, in conjunction with the readings, I could catch up on the material easily. Also, professor Scholl&#39;s teaching style is great, very engaging and the material presented is super fascinating! Definitely do take the course if you have a remote interest in cognitive science, or any of the fields related to it!!!</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow70_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11142&amp;evaluatorId=1633810&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=bs265&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1633810</span>\n                        1633810\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1633810</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No unless needed for cog sci major.

I found that this course required intense focus and attention 100% of the time because despite the exams being based on the lectures, the lectures were never recorded and posted, and the lecture slides that were posted had almost no useful information. The only way to do well in this class is to try to write down every word that Professor Scholl says and predict what he might think is important material for the exam. I don&#39;t mind sitting through a huge lecture or taking a survey course, but when the course requires you to try to piece together incoherent notes because the in-person lectures are the only thing you have to go off of and they move too fast, it becomes unenjoyable.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow76_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11142&amp;evaluatorId=1636657&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=bs265&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1636657</span>\n                        1636657\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1636657</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course is fun but if you can&#39;t C/D/F it then be wary because the grading is arbitrary and unpredictable.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow77_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11142&amp;evaluatorId=1637099&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=bs265&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1637099</span>\n                        1637099\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1637099</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No, only if they must take it for their major.

I am not a Psych/CogSci/etc. major, and it was the most interesting class I took this semester.

Every lecture felt like a Ted Talk, and I genuinely came away from each one feeling like, Wow, thats so fascinating! Our minds work in such a weird way! Because of the interdisciplinary nature of Cognitive Science, and because this is an intro class, the content sometimes felt like a bunch of random facts about different topics, but it all ties back to the same CogSci themes, and because its so interesting, I didnt mind. Yes, its hard to know how well youre doing in the class until the midterm, but if you actually do the readings, pay full attention during lectures, follow the studying advice he gives you, and dont wait until the last minute to study, youll be fine. Its harder than Intro Psych, but way more interesting in my opinion. Id also recommend staying after class to just listen to him answer peoples questions in a smaller group.
