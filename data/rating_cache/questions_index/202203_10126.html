One of the major facts that will stick with me is that the kidneys need 25% of cardiac output? This fact is amazing to me, and is something I did not know before the course; basically how connected all the organs are. The course definitely builds on itself; you learn general processes like action potentials and by the end are able to describe in a clinical case study what is happening with cardiac output, the kidneys, and even the respiratory system, all at the same time. This is an aspect of the knowledge I learned. This course also sharpens the skills of time management, navigation of the material, and productivity: you need to pick out what is the most important (ends up being basically everything) and must be able to describe those processes in an efficient and accurate manner; i.e., you need to know how the system works. While not ecstatic about my midterm exam grades, I was very invested in this course, and hope to use both the knowledge and skills from this course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow5_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10126&amp;evaluatorId=1618431&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=ws74&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1618431</span>\n                        1618431\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1618431</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned about the cardiovascular system, endocrine system, respiratory system, renal system, and many more!

Some quiz questions were a small paragraph long and maybe could be deciphered more easily with maybe parts a, b, c, etc. in bullet points. 2) If you could please double-check spelling before launching quiz-I am all about detail and put a lot of effort into the quizzes, but sometimes I had to reread a quiz question because a word or two was not spelled properly and I had to determine what the question was asking because it was a long question. 3) If you could please schedule send emails something along the lines of 7:30am-9pm from Canvas so that they are not sent on a Sunday into Monday at 12am, this would be so helpful. 4) I think Ed discussion is good, could still be kept, but maybe I didn&#39;t look at it the last month or so of the course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow4_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10126&amp;evaluatorId=1618431&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ws74&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1618431</span>\n                        1618431\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1618431</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Course was great!

Not only is it great preparation for the MCAT, but it also reaffirmed my passion for biology and medicine. I think this class does a great job of teaching students how to intuitively think about physiology rather than just memorizing molecules, transporters, etc. (though there is a fair amount of that). I also think the course does a great job of helping students to remember high-level themes (specifically with the triangle of knowledge shown in the first lecture), and the learning objectives at the end of every lecture do a great job of emphasizing this. Professor Campbell&#39;s and Saltzman&#39;s OHs were also a tremendous resource. Not only were they willing to answer our questions, but they also traced down the answer to any questions they did not know the answer to, which I admired and respected deeply. The exams are also challenging, but fair, and truly test someone&#39;s knowledge of the content in more ways than rote memorization.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A few of the learning objectives near the end of the course were needlessly wordy and could be condensed to better help students understand the biggest takeaways (especially the endocrine lectures). I also think that the course would greatly benefit from practice exams. Because of the weighting in the course, students need to do fairly well on the first midterm to do well in the course, but I think there is a bit of an adjustment to taking these tests under the 50 minute time pressure. To recognize students&#39; adjustment to these questions, I think the course could benefit from weighting one midterm lighter than another, or releasing practice midterms.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow6_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10126&amp;evaluatorId=1620355&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ws74&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1620355</span>\n                        1620355\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1620355</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>strengths: amazing course material especially for pre-meds, TA&#39;s very helpful\r\nweaknesses: an overwhelming amount of content, and sometimes we&#39;re tested more on minute details than we are on the overarching picture. this course is NOT for the faint of heart.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow7_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10126&amp;evaluatorId=1621308&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ws74&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1621308</span>\n                        1621308\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1621308</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: There was a lot of interesting information to gather. Thanks to Professor Aronson I&#39;ve gained a new-found appreciation for the kidneys. The TFs were also generous with their time and put in a lot of effort to help us prepare for the exams.\r\nWeaknesses: We were told at the beginning of the semester that this course involves a lot of &quot;critical thinking.&quot; That&#39;s not really true. Most of it is just straight-up memorization, and if you&#39;ve got a bad working memory like I do, you&#39;ll be at a disadvantage. The professors were also a little too ambitious in their lectures, meaning they often rushed through the slides and left little time for questions or effective note-taking. Looking through the slides after class didn&#39;t help either, because most of the important information was often not on the slides, but mentioned in passing by the professor. In light of this I really think they should record every lecture -- that would take a lot of pressure off of us to record every single word they say, freeing up headspace to ask questions. I also don&#39;t think that in-class midterms are the right format -- 50 minutes is too tight, and the instructors are limited in the material they can test you on. Given how much we have to memorize, it would be a win-win if we sat a 2-hour evening exam instead -- that way we wouldn&#39;t feel so rushed, and we can be tested on a wider range of topics. I wish there were practice exams to help us prepare, but there weren&#39;t any... plus you can&#39;t take your midterms home after they&#39;ve been graded, which is a little bizarre -- it&#39;s not as though they use the exact same questions for the exams each year!</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow8_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10126&amp;evaluatorId=1621773&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ws74&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1621773</span>\n                        1621773\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1621773</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This class has some really clear upsides: (1) lectures are amazing. Each and every lecture was intense, short and super engaging. I got a little lost during the exocrine section with the guest lecturer but otherwise it was perfect in this regard. (2) the application of the content felt clear and meaningful. I really enjoyed going to class and chatting with people about it&#39;s content. My girlfriend couldn&#39;t stand my random anatomy tirades by the end...but I think thats still saying something. \r\n\r\nSome downsides of this course: (1) Group work was lackluster. This class was almost entirely individual. I know some people like that impersonal, results based course and if so, this course is for you. For me, our TA couldn&#39;t wait to finish discussion sections and always tried to send us home early as though we learned everything by the end. Also, little was done to integrate grad students with undergrads. (2) This course does not account for bad TAs. If you get stuck with a certain TA...im sorry Saiti... but you perform way worse than classmates. This is partially because each TA makes their own materials and some could care less. By the end of this course, my friend had almost 3x the notes and diagrams I did from his TA. I didn&#39;t realize how much of a problem this was until the final. If Carissa and Ilhan and Anna have discussion sections for you, go to their sections pls....the class is wayy harder otherwise. (3) Quizzes in this course were supposed to indicate how well you were doing with content and help you identify where to study. Everyone gets 100% no joke....so this is literally useless. Plus, the questions given for the quizzes were either minor points of the lectures or led you down unrelated rabbit holes.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow9_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10126&amp;evaluatorId=1621779&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ws74&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1621779</span>\n                        1621779\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1621779</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Its an intense amount of information to absorb in one semester.

One weakness I think that exists is that the way that the lectures were structured made it so that the body systems were treated rather separately, even though in reality they all end up influencing each other. I think it would be useful if these connections could be pointed out during lecture a bit more. \r\nAdditionally, although there is already so much content for this course to cover, I would have liked to have seen at least one lecture about the blood or the immune system, because it is often very involved in disease states.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow11_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10126&amp;evaluatorId=1621788&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ws74&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1621788</span>\n                        1621788\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1621788</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I enjoyed the content, but I feel like the exams felt so far from what was given.

They are the main reason you succeed in this class! SO kind and helpful and explain things in a way that makes sense. They really truly want to see you succeed in this class and it shows from hosting multiple additional review sessions/office hours to connecting topics across lectures, to making up practice problems and scenarios to help us practice!!\r\n\r\nI really like the lecture slides when they are fully annotated before class, so I can focus on listening to the lecture and take notes on what is being said instead of being rushed into copying the entire diagram while important things are being said. However, this is not always the case especially during the cardiac unit when a whole diagram was missing from the slides and we were rushing to copy everything down while trying to listen and take notes simultaneously. I also really appreciate the learning objectives after each lecture which help focus and organize my studying. \r\n\r\nThere are also moments where pace of the class during some lectures is quite fast and it does not allow enough time for me to process and write down the necessary information that is crucial to succeeding in this class. It is very frustrating when we rush through over half the lectures in 10 minutes as everything moves so quickly that information is not being communicated well. Both of these issues could be easily rectified and mitigated by releasing the already recorded lecture slides since this would allow me to go back and review certain parts that were confusing and clarify things enough for me to formulate questions to fully understand the topic.  \r\n\r\nIt would really help to linger over some of the more confusing/complicated aspects and providing practice questions/practice tests to help prepare for the exams would be extremely beneficial. I&#39;m not sure why they never released lecture recordings for review even though the class was recorded. \r\n\r\nTo focus my textbook readings on the lecture content since the textbook is really dense and I find that it oftentimes covers a lot of material that is not talked about in class.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow13_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10126&amp;evaluatorId=1621821&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ws74&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1621821</span>\n                        1621821\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1621821</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>strengths: very interesting/applicable topics, instructors are super knowledgeable, powerpoints are pretty comprehensive, quiz questions are helpful for focusing on the important topics. weaknesses: some topics are hard to grasp if you have no experience learning physiology, the material is so dense and they go through it so quickly, it would be really helpful if we got our exams back!</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow14_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10126&amp;evaluatorId=1621825&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ws74&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1621825</span>\n                        1621825\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1621825</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>There was simply too much material in the class to absorb anything.

Perhaps I am a bit biased, but the course was fascinating and engaging in its approach to understanding the mechanisms that allow for the bodily function of human beings. I also enjoyed every interaction I had with professors and teaching staff during this course. All of them were so knowledgeable, and it was an honor to be taught by individuals who demonstrated great care for the content about which they were lecturing. \r\n\r\nIt was clear that all of the teaching staff wanted to best facilitate learning, in spite of the very ambitious scope and depth of the course content. While this is not as greatly appreciated on exams, I also greatly enjoyed the depth of the content taught. At times it would feel like there was an overwhelming amount of content, but between the efforts of instructors and those of the TFs, it often seemed much more manageable than one would expect from reading the textbook. I enjoyed most of the painstaking details. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course was the pacing (at times). In some cases, topics would be glossed over for the sake of finishing a lecture within the 50-minute class period, to the detriment of student learning (i.e., one would need to go back and study a given pathway / system more closely on their spare time in order to actually understand what had been cursorily discussed in class  or at times not discussed at all).  Even though the TF-led discussion sections remedied this to some extent, it seemed like a great level of detail was still expected on exams for topics that received less attention during the actual class. (And this did not always fix the problem, as the discussion sections were also 50 minutes to an hour long...)\r\n\r\nOn a separate note, I think that this course also had a tendency to write overly long exams (given the constraint that they were expected to be completed within the 50-minute class period). I believe that my performance was at times impacted by the fact that I felt rushed and concerned about not finishing the exam, as well as the fact that I was unable to check through my answers and correct any silly mistakes.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow20_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10126&amp;evaluatorId=1621925&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ws74&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1621925</span>\n                        1621925\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1621925</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The learning objectives model is very helpful.

The lecture notes were easy to access and helped a lot with the exams.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow30_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10126&amp;evaluatorId=1625033&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ws74&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1625033</span>\n                        1625033\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1625033</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The lectures were not nicely organized, always rushed and the slides have zero information.

This course is required for BME majors, but aside from that, anyone with an interest in medicine should take this course. The systems are taught by some of the best professors in the world, frankly, which makes studying for the MCAT significantly easier. Additionally, the content is enjoyable and well-delivered, and the TFs for this course are an amazing support system. Professors Campbell and Saltzman are also tremendous resources, and are reason enough to take this course. I would caution students that this will be a very time-consuming class. I took it along with physics and biochemistry on a 5 credit schedule, and it was overwhelming at times. Be prepared to put in a lot of work, but you truly do get out what you put in. Following the final exam, I was genuinely impressed with how much physiology I had learned in this course. For pre-meds, I would also recommend taking this with biochemistry if possible--there is a little overlap between the two courses which makes learning a little easier and more rewarding when going a layer beyond the material during OHs.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow10_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10126&amp;evaluatorId=1620355&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ws74&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1620355</span>\n                        1620355\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1620355</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes if you like physiology, want to pursue medicine, or are a bme major and this is required.

To borrow an expression from Saltzman&#39;s alma mater, taking this class is like drinking out of a fire hose. Every class you&#39;ll be bombarded with way too much information that you&#39;ll find really interesting but never have time to think about and fully appreciate. Intellectual rigor is of course important, but I&#39;m not convinced that the fire hose method is particularly effective -- I doubt most people in the class will still be able to remember concepts like the Frank-Starling mechanism a year from now. Another helpful analogy to make is that this is like a boot camp course for BME majors: a brief but arduous training course that will set you up for more advanced topics later on. While the class is fairly well-taught and the material endlessly fascinating, it caused me needless anxiety, and my GPA took a hit. Yes, the weekly quizzes bump up to 100%, but the midterms/final are pretty harshly graded. The curve, if there is one, is also quite punishing given that most of your peers are hyper-competitive pre-meds. I don&#39;t recommend anyone take this during their sophomore year; if you&#39;re a BME major in particular I advise waiting until junior year because there are a lot of prereqs needed for this course (Gen Chem + Physics + Bio sequence), and it&#39;s a little unreasonable to expect students to finish all of them during freshman year. Even though the SEAS website lists Physio as a class you should take during sophomore fall, don&#39;t -- finish the prereqs first (and then some). Trust me, you&#39;ll have an easier time. Overall, I didn&#39;t enjoy this class as much as I had hoped, which is a shame because it&#39;s still one of the better BME courses out there.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow12_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10126&amp;evaluatorId=1621773&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ws74&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1621773</span>\n                        1621773\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1621773</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This is a premed class, you&#39;ve been warned.
