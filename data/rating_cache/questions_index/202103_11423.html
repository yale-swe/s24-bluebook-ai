Finally, I learned how to abide by professional standards for writing reports and how to convey my results more directly.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow7_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11423&amp;evaluatorId=1522084&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=jp26&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1522084</span>\n                        1522084\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1522084</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned how to use a few new pieces of lab equipment</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow8_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11423&amp;evaluatorId=1522352&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=jp26&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1522352</span>\n                        1522352\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1522352</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned a lot about chemistry in general with the basic principles and theories that we supported in our experiments.

The Teaching Fellows were quite helpful in explaining basic ideas as we needed them for the lab reports, but at some points, and I believe most students I have spoken to feel this, it became a matter of not understanding what to say, asking one&#39;s TF, and then altering and writing down information based on that alone.

This course gave insight into many of the foundations of lab work that cultivates a strong foundation for continuing lab experiences outside of the classroom.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow82_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11423&amp;evaluatorId=1551793&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=jp26&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1551793</span>\n                        1551793\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1551793</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I got more comfortable in the lab</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow83_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11423&amp;evaluatorId=1552273&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=jp26&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1552273</span>\n                        1552273\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1552273</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The basics of the laboratory and how to work with chemicals in the lab.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow84_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11423&amp;evaluatorId=1552274&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=jp26&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1552274</span>\n                        1552274\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1552274</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Chemistry laboratory practices</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow85_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11423&amp;evaluatorId=1552276&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=jp26&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1552276</span>\n                        1552276\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1552276</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned laboratory techniques that included titrations and explorations of gas laws, among other Chemistry concepts.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow86_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11423&amp;evaluatorId=1552281&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=jp26&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1552281</span>\n                        1552281\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1552281</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned how to write a lab paper and analyze data and create graphs</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow87_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11423&amp;evaluatorId=1552295&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=jp26&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1552295</span>\n                        1552295\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1552295</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Basic Chemistry Lab skills and how to use different instruments.

However, my biggest qualms with this course are in regards to grading. Having raised a handful of grading issues throughout the semester with incomplete responses, I find myself frustrated that the grades I received were not comparable to classmates who submitted similar lab reports. Quiz grading is generous as are policies around re-opening assignments (Dr. Parr was beyond amenable here in re-opening closed assignments for students throughout the semester). I also think that this course is great for those taking CHEM 161, however, it does not line up at all with the curriculum for CHEM 163 and I don&#39;t think it added to my learning in that course at all. Perhaps a CHEM 163 specific lab section within the Gen Chem Lab umbrella would be more beneficial.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow5_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11423&amp;evaluatorId=1521844&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jp26&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1521844</span>\n                        1521844\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1521844</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Good class, I learned a lot.

You get to solidify your techniques and apply them to new experiences over the course of the semester. The pre-lab lectures and lab manuals are informative and often provide supplementary information to the topics at hand. The report-writing sessions at the end of the term were very helpful and took some of the stress off of the reports. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the weaknesses, the expectations of the first lab report were unclear. The course provided resources on writing reports afterwards, but they should have been available when all of us were writing our first reports. Also, this course and the chem lecture course were sometimes out of sync, so the lab expected us to know information we hadn&#39;t been taught yet. Finally, I wish the grading distributions were clearer because it made writing the reports unnecessarily stressful. Since the averages of the reports were generally high, it made you feel like if you messed up the slightest detail, it could move you down a grade level. Some more clarity about the grading scheme and overall expectations could have redressed some of these fears.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow7_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11423&amp;evaluatorId=1522084&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jp26&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1522084</span>\n                        1522084\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1522084</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I can honestly say that I understand next to none of the chemistry that we actually did in lab.

Simply having to learn from scratch after the first lab report was disheartening. Otherwise, I felt that it was arranged very nicely to facilitate learning. The curve is a little harsh - if they don&#39;t want so many students to get an A, they should alter the content or assessment methods, not make it so that getting an A requires a raw score of 98+.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow10_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11423&amp;evaluatorId=1525762&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jp26&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1525762</span>\n                        1525762\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1525762</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The labs are really interesting to do, but the grading is just so harsh on the lab reports that it takes away significantly from the overall quality of the class.

I would finish most of them in an hour or two, but then need to spend 5 going over again and again, because your grade goes down significantly for missing a single digit. I highly recommend going to office hours frequently, since the reflection questions are always vague but are looking for very specific answers.

A lot of times the TFs with office hours were not the same people grading the lab reports so they didnt know how to help.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow28_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11423&amp;evaluatorId=1534444&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jp26&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1534444</span>\n                        1534444\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1534444</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The time commitment was high when you account for the videos, lab reports, quizzes, and time spent in lab, and I feel that it is deserving of a full credit.

Second, I disliked that the labs were graded very harshly and that it is basically required of you to contact the TAs for lab regrading in order to succeed in this class when it was never mentioned to the students (personally found this irritating to find out as a first-gen student). Third, I disliked how the class is said to be &quot;curved down&quot; which makes this such a competitive course to take and overall it did not foster a sense of collaboration as I would&#39;ve like to have seen especially with the sheer amount of pre-meds taking CHEM 134L.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow51_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11423&amp;evaluatorId=1543098&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jp26&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1543098</span>\n                        1543098\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1543098</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>All the TFs were so helpful and friendly  they were always so patient with our many questions.

For example, one TA literally used a different set of rules for sig figs than I learned in Chem 161 or literally in any other class I have ever taken (or any webpage I have visited in my life). When I inquired about this, I was told that there were two different &quot;schools of thought&quot; for the sig fig rule for addition/subtraction. Also, in general, some graders graded much more harshly than others.\r\nAnother weakness: ambiguity in what we were expected to do for lab reports. I would ask my TA whether I should do a specific thing on a graph (like connect the dots between adjacent data points or include all 10 sig figs provided by logger pro) and they would say, &quot;maybe, I don&#39;t know, up to you&quot; or something like that, but I wasn&#39;t sure whether I would be docked points for choosing one way or another, and I would ask Dr. Parr and still not totally be sure, because it might seem to conflict slightly with what my TA said, or with what Dr. Parr had previously said in a pre-recorded lecture video, or with what the written instructions said, or what my friend&#39;s TA had said, etc.\r\nAlso, I was extremely worried about grades throughout the whole course, because the syllabus said that the B/B+ cutoff would be the course average grade, yet the average grades for the lab reports was consistently very high. So even though I was scoring really high scores, and I was above the average for most/all assignments, I wasn&#39;t sure if it would be enough to get an A once the curve was taken into account. It seems like this sort of class, where almost all students consistently score really high scores, is a terrible candidate for a curved grading system, because it would make people with high grades, like a 95% in the class (indicating high proficiency in relevant skills/understanding from an absolute point of view), still get a mediocre final letter grade because everyone else in the class also happened to do well from an absolute point of view.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow53_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11423&amp;evaluatorId=1544071&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jp26&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1544071</span>\n                        1544071\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1544071</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think that this course could be improved by increasing the credit given.

Definitely go to as many TF sessions as you can because that&#39;s how you&#39;ll best understand what they&#39;re looking for when they grade your lab reports.

One of the weakness of the lab is the learning curve of the reports that is not fully explained in the rubric. Since there are very disparate experiences of students within lab there should be more support initially rather than gradually throughout the course. The outside lab work is comparable to a full credit course; however, since the lab is only a half credit there was a considerable amount of time dedicated to the lab that seems disproportionate.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow82_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11423&amp;evaluatorId=1551793&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jp26&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1551793</span>\n                        1551793\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1551793</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The only weakness of this course is the way it is graded.

However, I felt as if the workload for this class was excessive for its credit. Even though 134L is a 0.5 credit course, I ended up working on it more than almost any other class. Lab reports seemed to have arbitrary grading standards at times and required a significant amount of time to calculate and completeoften due to redundancy and the need to type out calculation. For almost every lab, I noticed that there were &quot;hidden points:&quot; criteria which weren&#39;t explicitly stated in any rubric or instruction set, but upon asking my TF, were critical to the lab, and without which, I would have lost points. These points were confusing, and oftentimes, I found myself revising a lab report right before the due date because I just became aware of some other component or explanation that the labs required. Clarifying the grading criteria for each lab report would be very helpful and, honestly, make the course accessible for those new to STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThat clarity is also useful considering the near-obscene curve the class is graded with. The B/B+ average for the class was a 97.5%. In any other discipline or class, a 97.5% is rewarded and understood to constitute near-perfect understanding of the material. For 134L, however, a 95-97% was a B, and I&#39;d imagine that a grade highly regarded in another discipline, such as a 94%, would be punished. To grade the class on a curve where an A would be nearly a 99% only harms students, rather than aiding their learning. To curve students down and to set the bar at nearly 100% is illogical and harmful. Personally, I don&#39;t see the need for a curve in 134La student&#39;s grade should reflect a student&#39;s performance, and a grade range skewed upward does not. There&#39;s almost 0 margin for error in this class, far beyond the point at which error reflects lack of understanding.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow120_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11423&amp;evaluatorId=1553067&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jp26&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1553067</span>\n                        1553067\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1553067</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: well-organized, routine schedule, different experiments each week helped spark some interest, very helpful TFs.\r\nWeaknesses: Lab reports are graded along a very strict rubric (losing points for very small errors), which makes lab reflection and learning not enjoyable.

This could be improved by having more office hours available on the weekend.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow130_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11423&amp;evaluatorId=1554215&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jp26&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1554215</span>\n                        1554215\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1554215</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I believe the lab workshops that were sometimes held were a strength of this course.
