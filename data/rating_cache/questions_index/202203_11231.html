You&#39;ll have to find your own resources, watch videos, and read the textbook to learn.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow7_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11231&amp;evaluatorId=1613692&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=nh264&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1613692</span>\n                        1613692\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1613692</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>My problem solving and math skills were improved through this course and I learned more content regarding inorganic chemistry.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow8_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11231&amp;evaluatorId=1615197&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=nh264&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1615197</span>\n                        1615197\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1615197</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I gained a better understanding and appreciation for chemistry.

I learned how to efficiently apply countless equations ranging from the ideal gas laws to heat enthalpy of formation equations. Through the professor I also gained insight in how to become a better student in how I prepared to for tests and how I approach improving from where I am.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow83_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11231&amp;evaluatorId=1624288&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=nh264&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624288</span>\n                        1624288\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624288</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I developed knowledge and insight into chemistry and the general skills needed to excel in any stem course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow84_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11231&amp;evaluatorId=1624302&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=nh264&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624302</span>\n                        1624302\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624302</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Basic knowledge of chemistry and problem solving skills.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow85_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11231&amp;evaluatorId=1624378&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=nh264&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624378</span>\n                        1624378\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624378</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I improved my studying habits and skills by adapting to each midterm; I also learned how to effectively learn and apply conceptual and mathematic skills with regards to some complex topics in chemistry.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow86_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11231&amp;evaluatorId=1624423&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=nh264&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624423</span>\n                        1624423\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624423</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>By taking this course, I learned valuable information about chemistry that I hope to apply in my future STEM classes.

This would also make it easier to understand things in some of the more visual/3D aspects of chemistry.

The weakness of this course includes the idea that there could have been a little more individualized help, however these are means difficult to accomplish in a larger lecture.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow81_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11231&amp;evaluatorId=1624288&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=nh264&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624288</span>\n                        1624288\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624288</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>One weakness of this course was the discrepancies between the teaching assistants.

Some weaknesses of this course were that, at times, the vast array of resources felt overwhelming. There were some twenty different office hours from both the TAs and the peer tutors on top of the professors office hours. It was difficult to understand the differences between them and choose which to attend. Another weakness was that there was no check-for-understanding during lectures. Many times, the professor would begin talking about a new topic and some aspects would be confusing, leading all the students to be very confused for the remainder of the lecture and the entire unit. If there was some sort of checking question, either visually or with a short not-for-credit quiz, this would mitigate this problem. Finally, office hours with the professor were intense, unwelcoming, and stressful. You always had to bring questions to discuss and sometimes you felt that your questions were silly or a waste of time. This would require a significant change in attitude when answering student questions during office hours.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow89_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11231&amp;evaluatorId=1624697&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=nh264&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624697</span>\n                        1624697\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624697</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>It was very difficult to understand the concepts and lessons at first.

If you just need a science credit, look elsewhere. This course consists of three 50-minute lectures (in-person or recorded) and a weekly discussion section (separate from the lab CHEM 134L, which is an additional weekly commitment if you need to take lab). The graded material consists of a weekly online problem set, 3 midterms, and a final exam. Review sessions of varying helpfulness are offered before each exam. The averages can range between 70-84% on the midterms; this grade becomes an A, so complete mastery is not necessarily expected. The graduate student TA&#39;s play a large role in the course: leading the discussion sections, grading the exams, and holding review sessions.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow15_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11231&amp;evaluatorId=1621835&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=nh264&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1621835</span>\n                        1621835\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1621835</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes if you a) need to take it or b) enjoy chemistry.

As someone who took AP Chemistry in high school, I only felt that I knew about 50% of the material and I had to attend several hours of office hours to understand the rest of the material. Be aware that the vast majority of students in this class have already taken some amount of chemistry and feel comfortable with the basics. I highly recommend brushing up on the fundamentals if it has been a long time since you studied chemistry. Although the course is designed for anyone, including those without a background in chemistry, I believe it would be extremely difficult to jump into this course without some level of prior understanding. The curriculum moves fast and I would not have survived without the immense help of the peer tutors and teacher assistants. At the same time, I have heard that this is less work than the more advanced chemistry class and I definitely feel more confident in my chemistry abilities after taking the course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow91_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11231&amp;evaluatorId=1624697&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=nh264&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624697</span>\n                        1624697\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624697</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes as it&#39;s necessary for most STEM classes.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow92_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11231&amp;evaluatorId=1624703&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=nh264&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624703</span>\n                        1624703\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624703</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, not only were the topics fundamental they were also easy to learn with the help of Nilay and all the teaching faculty.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow93_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11231&amp;evaluatorId=1624714&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=nh264&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624714</span>\n                        1624714\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624714</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, this was a good chem course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow94_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11231&amp;evaluatorId=1624758&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=nh264&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624758</span>\n                        1624758\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624758</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would if it&#39;s a prerec to something they are interested in because I think it provides good foundations</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow95_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11231&amp;evaluatorId=1624903&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=nh264&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624903</span>\n                        1624903\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624903</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would recommend this course.
