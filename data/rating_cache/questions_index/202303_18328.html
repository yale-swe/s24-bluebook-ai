Although the professor seemed very nice, the lectures were not laid out in a way that was conducive to learning. It felt like we jumped wildly from topic to topic, and gained a very little information about a lot of topics, rather than honing in on just a few topics. This also made it difficult to review the lecture slides and notes following lectures (when studying for the midterm or final) because it felt like there weren&#39;t clear sections or topics to be learned. I think this course would benefit from following a more structured layout - even following a similar layout to an AP Bio course (as a lot of the topics covered were similar). As this course is now, though, it is very hard to learn.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, many of the quiz and PSET questions were poorly-worded and difficult to understand.

I find bio very interesting, but I just really struggled to find this class all that engaging. The professor read off the slides for the most part, which were always in these enormous pdf files that we would never manage to finish, so we could always see that there was content that we basically just skipped. It was nice that she answered questions in class, but that meant that we just never got to a lot of the content and she often didn&#39;t know the answers, even if the questions were relatively basic. Sections were a drag -- we had to read papers, which I actually did find interesting, but nobody ever seemed to read them and then the section itself would just be people discussing papers they hadn&#39;t read. The quizzes/homeworks/exams constantly had questions with errors that made them impossible to decipher so 75% of the time, the course was testing your ability to figure out what the question was actually asking rather than your actual understanding of the content. The grading of the class was dependent on your TF, too -- I said it was fair above, but that&#39;s just because the professor would be understanding when you emailed to ask why your TF docked a bizarre number of points off an assignment.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow8_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18328&amp;evaluatorId=1702255&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=vh2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1702255</span>\n                        1702255\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1702255</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: Its a half semester so it isnt that long of a push.

I also liked that all the lectures were recorded so that I could watch them again if I needed to reabsorb the material. The organization of the rest of the course was a severe weakness. There are several examples that I will mention. The week with the guest lecturer Professor Mogessie completely derailed the rhythm of the course and what he covered hardly corresponded with what was on that week&#39;s Pset. Additionally, for each week&#39;s slideshow, there were at least 3 iterations of the same slideshow posted on Canvas: pre-lecture slides, post-lecture slides, and a &quot;final&quot; version. This made Canvas hard to navigate and made it harder to study. I think they could have deleted past iterations of the slides. I also got the sense that not a lot of time was put into the assignments, quizzes, and tests that the teaching team made. Our quizzes were riddled with mistakes  typos, blank answer selections, missing word banks, repeat/ambiguous answers  that would cost us points that then had to be corrected later. The final exam was filled with sentences that were gramatically incorrect with ambiguous interpretations that changed the meaning of what was being asked. One question asked whether we would use a &quot;rabbit, hamster, or mouse&quot; antibody and then the answer selections immediately following were &quot;goat, hamster, or mouse.&quot; When Dr. Horsley &quot;corrected&quot; this mid-exam, she said we should choose between &quot;goat, hamster, and mouse,&quot; which presented two potential options for the right answer. I told a TF during the exam that there was no way to choose between &quot;goat&quot; and &quot;hamster&quot; and she agreed with me, explaining that Dr. Horsley had &quot;made a mistake&quot; in her correction but &quot;didn&#39;t want to correct herself again.&quot; There was also a  sometimes substantial  disconnect between the Psets and the lectures. In my opinion, Psets should build on and bring class material to a higher-thinking level, not go in a completely different direction. The peer tutors thankfully were able to help a lot with homework questions. One example of this disconnect that I remember in particular was when there was a question about the regulation of homologous chromosome separation vs. sister chromatid separation. The protein shugoshin was an important player in the process, which the peer tutors strongly expressed. When asked during our final review session if we should understand shugoshin&#39;s role in the cell cycle, Dr. Horsley laughed and said &quot;shugoshin? I don&#39;t know what that is.&quot; I find it concerning that Dr. Horsley did not know of an important protein that was part of one of the PSet answers. Also, the complex topics (for example: cell cycle checkpoints) explored on our PSets would rarely be incorporated into the tests. This course could be improved by more streamlining between Dr. Horsley, Professor Benavides, the peer tutors, and the TFs. Additionally, I think the use of guest lecturer was a mistake. If Dr. Horsley had to be absent for a week, I would have preferred pre-recorded lectures. We had gotten used to the rhythm and speed at which Dr. Horsley taught and the types of graphics she used. Switching to another lecturer for a complex topic was stressful (especially when the homework felt unrelated to his material) and we then had to review those topics again with Dr. Horsley. Another small change that would have improved the course a lot for me would have been to post the discussion section slides ahead of time. I like following along with the notes during discussion section so that I have all the material in front of me and can add my own comments or annotate the pictures.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow13_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18328&amp;evaluatorId=1703699&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=vh2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1703699</span>\n                        1703699\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1703699</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>As someone who just switched to pre-med, I wasn&#39;t particularly convinced by my peers who warned me about the issues they&#39;ve found with the intro bio sequence at Yale, but GOOD GOD were they right.

The lecture presentations were often very unclear, and students were constantly asking questions for clarification during lecture. Horsley&#39;s presentations tend to be pretty sparse of explanatory information meaning that studying outside of class is sometimes a bit of a struggle. The class was also very unclear in terms of what information was important to retain for exams, and the professor seemed to have issues following through with certain actionables like posting recordings of review sessions, etc.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow14_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18328&amp;evaluatorId=1703749&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=vh2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1703749</span>\n                        1703749\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1703749</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Good faculty support/clear lectures.

I think the class would be better as a 3 day a week lecture for shorter period of time like chem 161 instead of two longer lectures.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow18_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18328&amp;evaluatorId=1704713&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=vh2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1704713</span>\n                        1704713\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1704713</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths are different styles of assignments that allow you to learn in different ways</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow19_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18328&amp;evaluatorId=1704874&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=vh2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1704874</span>\n                        1704874\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1704874</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course was poorly organized.

Also, the weighting of each assignment category and opportunities for extra credit were very generous, and allowed for students to demonstrate their learning in different categories, whether that be on PSETS, quizzes, or other ways. Some weaknesses of the course are that there weren&#39;t many resources to get help with assignments earlier in the week. The only office hours with professor Horsley were on Thursdays at a time where I and many other students had classes, making it very difficult to attend. The only peer tutoring times were during the weekends as well, which made it so that many students could get homework help from the peer tutors was right before the deadline for PSETS and quizzes. I think offering more opportunities for peer tutoring and office hours, including earlier days in the week would allow students to get help and submit assignments earlier, considering how large the class size is.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow68_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18328&amp;evaluatorId=1724673&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=vh2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1724673</span>\n                        1724673\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1724673</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Lecture went well and I was able to learn a lot.

I would say that this course could be more organized.\r\nThere was always some sort of formatting issue with the quizzes. They need to be updated.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 different office hours hosted by the peer tutors for this course, and you can get the answers to all the problem sets from these office hours. There were offered in-person and on zoom, which made them pretty accessible. They helped out my understanding of application-based concepts so much. But even after getting the answers and wither correcting what I previously had, or incorporating the answers to what I already had, I would still get a lot counted off. Even though I attended the office hours, the answers we were getting were not always correct, which isn&#39;t cool. On top of that, we get counted off on the homework with no feedback on what was wrong on the questions that I missed. So, I had no way of knowing what to improve on.\r\n\r\nAnother weakness of the course is that most of the time, Dr. Horsley would get get behind every lecture. Her lectures were about half actually lecturing, and the other half was answering questions that students had because they were not made clear the first time. As a result, we would not get through all the slides, and this would throw off our homework and quizzes. To catch up, she had to speedrun through much of the content, which is not fair for the sake of our learning and comprehension.\r\n\r\nThere was one instance when Dr. Horsley did not know that a certain question was asked on our last problem set. We all got 3 points counted off for not mentioning a certain mechanism for a question on our last problem set, but we had not even learned about it. This proves that the quizzes and problem sets needed to be looked over, or even have the rubric updated beforehand to make sure that they are compatible to what was actually taught to us. Dr. Horsley would bot have known about this either if a student had not mentioned it during our final review session. Dr. Horsley said she would manually go in and give us those points back which was nice. But, it does make you wonder if the same thing happened beforehand without our knowledge.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n                                \n
