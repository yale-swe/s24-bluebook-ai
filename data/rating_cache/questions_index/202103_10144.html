both students who had never taken biology and those who had prior experience; many concepts were either far too watered down/oversimplified or were explained at too high a level for an intro class (i.e. lots of jargon, incomplete explanations of complex concepts). The quizzes did not seem to be designed to test our grasp of the material, but rather to see how well we could memorize the more obscure parts of the lecture. There were some questions on material not explicitly covered in the class material that were almost impossible to answer without a strong prior background in research/biology. There were also several logistical errors (errors on quizzes/assignments, unclear deadlines/assignments) that took away from the learning experience.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow1_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10144&amp;evaluatorId=1518365&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1518365</span>\n                        1518365\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1518365</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The lectures were asynchronous, which made them flexible but less interactive.

The homework and benchmark were usually well-designed and manageable, but the instructions were sometimes vague. There are weekly quizzes, but the final exam doesn&#39;t affect your grade any more than a quiz, although it covers more content. I usually received prompt feedback on homework, benchmark submissions, and quizzes. The discussion sections were very chill and usually not intellectually challenging.

This class is also pretty forgiving, which didn&#39;t put a lot of stress on grades and allowed you to learn without pressure.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the online lectures were not as engaging, and some of the discussion sections were boring at times.

The biggest weakness is that this course is not in person so students cannot ask questions and get in person feedback. If the course was in person with quizzes on Fridays, it would be significantly better in my opinion. Personally the three mentor meetings were not useful to me whatsoever. I felt like I was going through this class just to check off a lot of boxes and not actually learning anything substantially new from a high school AP class. Mentor meetings did not help me understand the content.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow7_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10144&amp;evaluatorId=1518400&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1518400</span>\n                        1518400\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1518400</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I mean, it&#39;s an intro biology course, so I think the class definitely fulfills its purpose. You need to put in the effort to do well, and the class is going to teach you the biology basics. I like biology, so I had no issues with the class (except it is very easy to make seemingly trivial errors on the quizzes, which will annoyingly have an impact on your grade). You&#39;re not going to be diving into too much detail (i.e. you&#39;re really only going to be exposed to the basic mechanics of biological processes), so don&#39;t expect to be an expert after this class. I don&#39;t think the class has any significant weaknesses, though. You&#39;ll just want to make sure that you&#39;re putting effort into all your assignments and not making foolish mistakes on quizzes because there doesn&#39;t seem to be much error when it comes to grades (I don&#39;t actually know the curve for my class yet, but a lot of people in the class are gunning for pre-med, so cutoffs will probably not be low).</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow8_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10144&amp;evaluatorId=1518403&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1518403</span>\n                        1518403\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1518403</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I really liked the course format in which assessment is spread over the various p-sets, quizzes, final paper, and miniquizzes much better than an exam format.

The downside of online lectures is that it&#39;s easier to procrastinate on watching them, and I spent way longer watching them than I would have spent in a lecture hall because of all the pausing to take notes and rewinding. But overall, I think the pros of online lecture outweighed the cons for this class, especially because it was my only class that had online lectures. If I had two or more classes that had online lectures, I think I would have disliked having online lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: during in-person quizzes, I was worried that people would easily be able to look at other students&#39; answers, and unfortunately this did turn out to be a problem. I personally care a lot about academic integrity so I managed to avert my eyes and didn&#39;t look at others&#39; quizzes, but I easily could have.

The Mini-quizzes embedded in the pre-recorded lectures were also helpful to check your understanding (and you have unlimited tried to get them right which is great). Enrichment is also helpful if you are struggling; Hartman really makes an effort to help students understand the material. Final project was interesting and it was really nice to have a take-home project be a fairly significant (30%) part of the grade, rather than just timed quizzes. Weaknesses: Often, the quiz questions seemed unnecessarily tricky -- they were asking for specific words in the short answer response that seemed like a stretch to include, especially when the short answers were limited to appx 60 words. Sometimes the Kabeche lectures (the course is split into lectures by a few different profs) were confusing and unclear.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow15_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10144&amp;evaluatorId=1518508&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1518508</span>\n                        1518508\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1518508</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I appreciated the structure of the course: the lecture videos were short and easy to comprehend, and the collaborative pset sessions made it much more easy to work on the homework.

It is difficult to improve or adapt studying habits for an upcoming quiz if you don&#39;t know how you did on the previous quiz and you have no idea what to change for the next time. I completely understand that there are lots of students taking the BIOL sequence and it&#39;s difficult to grade things very quickly, but if there&#39;s any way to get students feedback on homeworks and quizzes before the subsequent quiz or homework, it would be greatly appreciated by the students.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow16_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10144&amp;evaluatorId=1518511&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1518511</span>\n                        1518511\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1518511</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I enjoyed how the discussion sections were structured - they helped me apply the material and be able to ask questions about the content.

It attempts to be consistent, but as a side effect punishes completely correct answers just because they do not exactly match the requirements of the rubric. For example, I got many points off on the assignments just because I failed to mention the exact &quot;key concept&quot; number from the course along with a completely correct description. The syllabus says that the class focusses on &quot;higher-order concepts that underlie the complexity of life,&quot; but these concepts exist regardless of the arbitrary labelling used in this class. \r\n- the &quot;specificity vs. word limit&quot; paradox. In order to get full credit for a question, I must a) be within the word limit and b) use the exact right words from the rubric. It is extremely difficult no matter how precise the wording to describe the concept well enough to get the points while also being within an arbitrary word limit.\r\n-  I found, too, that even a synonym would not award me the correct number of points. I said &quot;function&quot; in one of my responses, which, given more words to explain in detail, approximately means &quot;mechanism,&quot; but I got points off that question because I neglected to say &quot;mechanism.&quot; These mean the approximately the same thing, I believe, and perhaps I had the incorrect word, but given more words to explain myself, I believe it would have been clear I meant &quot;mechanism.&quot;\r\n - I have found that at Yale my obedience and memorization are rewarded over understanding to a tragic degree. Grading based on understanding, and perhaps correcting our word usage occasionally without docking points, reflects the course structure and material better. \r\n\r\nThe strength of this course was Dr. Koelle&#39;s lectures, which were concise and logically organized. My TA was also very good, and they understood the type of understanding I described above which was not properly assessed in the graded assignments.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow32_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10144&amp;evaluatorId=1518687&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1518687</span>\n                        1518687\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1518687</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>There are no weaknesses of this course, I loved how it was organized.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow33_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10144&amp;evaluatorId=1518689&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1518689</span>\n                        1518689\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1518689</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The way the course did quizzes kept changing a lot, which made going at the right time less straightforward than having a quiz at the same time every week.

Assignments arent too time intensive. Enrichment (optional weekly review help with Hartman) is so helpful for people new to bio (like I was).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The quizzes are poorly worded and more dependent upon test taking ability than actual knowledge. That said, if you study, you should do well on the quizzes for the most part and lowest quiz grade is dropped. Sometimes I felt the course was far too easy and insulted my intelligence. The content taught went very in depth and was super interesting but evaluations were at best superficial, as indicated by an average grade in the course being nearly 96% (which to be fair also demonstrates that Amaleah is an exceptional professor at explaining everything in a way thats easy to understand). I was very happy that everyone performed well, but I found it slightly frustrating that you had to focus more on test taking than learning to get an A due to the exceptionally high average grade. To resolve the issue outlined above, I would get tide of 2/5 benchmarks which got very repetitive and boring near the end and replace them with more in depth evaluative assignments like discussing a lecture topic.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow59_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10144&amp;evaluatorId=1518739&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1518739</span>\n                        1518739\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1518739</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think that the videos were more than what a normal lecture would be and that was frustrating at parts.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow60_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10144&amp;evaluatorId=1518740&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1518740</span>\n                        1518740\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1518740</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would have preferred in person lectures, the virtual lectures were not as interesting to engage with.

I took 101 hoping to expand on my high-school biology knowledge and get up to a &quot;college level&quot;, but was thoroughly disappointed. The course provides a very shallow and somewhat poorly-explained overview of the subject that is less comprehensive than most high-school AP courses. If you are taking biology for the very first time then it&#39;s probably the right move, but it still will likely not be a pleasant experience.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow1_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10144&amp;evaluatorId=1518365&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=aah48&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1518365</span>\n                        1518365\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1518365</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Only if you need to take the sequence as a prerequisite to your major or other courses.

I thought some of the topics were interesting, but the workload is not necessarily low, but it is manageable depending on what your other classes are. Your enjoyment of this class will really depend on if you want an intellectual challenge and if you actually find the topics interesting, but if you&#39;re looking for an easy science credit to fill your distributional requirement, this might not be the class for you. Overall, I thought it was an enjoyable experience, but I wish the class itself was in-person because watching the lectures just became another homework assignment (it will most likely be in person in the future). You can easily do well in the class if you go to the office hours and collaborative p-set sessions. Ms. Hartman is also a very smart and kind teacher.
