I also gained observational and reflecting skills, improved my writing skills, and was able to easily tie together concepts.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow24_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17292&amp;evaluatorId=1710378&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1710378</span>\n                        1710378\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1710378</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Become informed about the education systems around the world.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow25_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17292&amp;evaluatorId=1711463&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1711463</span>\n                        1711463\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1711463</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned about many aspects of the US education system, but I also learned about the education systems in other countries as points of comparison.

If the head of the department teaches so poorly and is so close-minded, what does this say about Yales Education program as a whole? I learned relatively little about education and felt frustrated every day of class. She aimed to cover a range of topics, including the history of education, Brown v.

Another drawback is the fact that we had to purchase the textbook, which felt more like a side piece to the rest of the course, and it only made up a small fraction of all the readings we did, and was almost never referenced directly in lecture.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow1_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17292&amp;evaluatorId=1694373&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1694373</span>\n                        1694373\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1694373</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This is a very engaging courseit is easy to participate and learn even if you havent done all the readings.

It was implied that if I wanted to talk to the professor 1:1 itd have to be because you had some kind of problem. I also felt like this course was disorganized. Most lectures only covered about 30-%40% of the intended slides because half the time was spent engaging with the class (which was great) but it took away from the format. I think this class would have therefore worked best as a twice-weekly seminar. I really recommend that there be four sections of this class in a smaller format so a similar number of people can take it but it would allow for more integrated conversations. The sections felt unhelpful without the TFs actually sharing the same knowledge as the prof. I think Dr. Debs or whoever would hypothetically be teaching the proposed Foundations in Ed Studies Seminar should be the person to engage us in conversation, just like in lecture, in a way that would feel a lot more beneficial to our learning.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow27_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17292&amp;evaluatorId=1710378&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1710378</span>\n                        1710378\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1710378</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Readings can be redundant at times.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow28_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17292&amp;evaluatorId=1711463&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1711463</span>\n                        1711463\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1711463</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This is an intro course that is meant to give you a wide range of topics, which I think is a strength because you get to see a lot of different topics and how they intersect with one another.

I would not mind the reading, except that it was never mentioned in class aside from 2-3 sentences nor in discussion. Thus, I stopped doing the readings after the Midterm exam and suddenly had more free time in my life and faced no repercussions grade-wise. Most students in class dont do the readings. I recommend assigning ONE (1) reading of a reasonable amount (&lt; 10 pages) prior to lecture that everyone in class is expected to do. For example, assign a lecture-wide discussion post that everyone responds to. Have everyone write 1-2 replies on someone elses post to get students thinking about lecture content BEFORE class. This would be infinitely more beneficial than assigning some 50-100 pages of heavy educational theory reading that almost NO ONE does just to boost the ego of the professor and her colleagues. Still, the most frustrating part about this course was that not one single lecture focused on HOW to teach. The format of participation grades was also horrendous. Students were asked to complete not one, not two, but three separate participation reflections. These were basically writing assignments that asked students to self-evaluate their own participation (i.e., lie about personal growth). You could write anything on there, true or false, and no one would care. There was no incentive to be truthful besides ones personal integrity. As a result, participation was absent across the board except for a couple of loud-spoken individuals during lecture. Furthermore, no assignment asked students to design a lesson or teach a lesson. In my opinion, students should take what they learned and apply it in designing a how-to lesson of their choice. They should have to teach their lesson to their peers in discussion. What is the point of learning all this educational theory without practical application? Its no wonder that many public school teachers cant teach. The one lecture on Montessori education that was designed by a student was borderline ridiculous. There were Montessori activities for CHILDREN (e.g., scooping beans, mending a sock, reading childrens books). The suggested activities for ADULTS were checking your email, organizing your backpack, and making a to-do list. As someone familiar with Montessori education, this lecture was insulting. Real adult-level Montessori activities would be like building a chair, reading and comparing cooking recipes, and scrapbooking. Additionally, the literature review assignment was not a literature review. It specifically told students not to comment on the state of their chosen field and to instead only praise the fields published scholars. The whole assignment felt like a Google Scholar scheme that Dr. Debs set up with her colleagues to boost all of their citation counts (in fact, the lecture before she assigned the paper was about the importance of a high citation count). As a STEM major, I can affirm that real reviews include independent thought of the author and actually include something meaningful about the limitations in current understanding of the field. I also did not care for the structure of the literature review that forced me to find five sources and then write my introduction and outline. This is a writing form that was forced upon me in middle and high school. I would hope that my university professor of education would trust me to make my own decisions about how to write a paper. Providing a suggested strategy is completely alright. Making me follow it over the course of three weeks when I have already determined that this is not how I best write my papers is not. This ties into the central theme of the course that the students are naive and have much to learn about education. The only parts I liked about this course were the Classroom Observation, Dean Quinlans talk, and the Discussion Section Coffee Chat.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow46_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17292&amp;evaluatorId=1724541&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1724541</span>\n                        1724541\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1724541</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think the greatest strength of the course is definitely section.

Another strength of the course was definitely the classroom observation project, as it was definitely a valuable and unique experience to be able to sit in on and learn from observing the class of a New Haven teacher. In terms of weaknesses, I think there probably should be some sort of mechanism for holding students accountable for more of the material after the midterm because the level of seriousness and buy-in definitely dips off after that.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow47_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17292&amp;evaluatorId=1724787&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1724787</span>\n                        1724787\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1724787</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The largest strength of this course are definitely the assignments.

Dr. Debs and co make a concerted effort to foster community, and I have left the lecture with so many new friends and connections.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow16_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17292&amp;evaluatorId=1705702&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1705702</span>\n                        1705702\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1705702</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, it&#39;s a great learning experience with a tight community and strong support systems.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow17_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17292&amp;evaluatorId=1706442&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1706442</span>\n                        1706442\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1706442</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Id recommend this to anyone interested in education.

Do not take this course unless you are just looking for a Social Science gut or are a delusional Education Studies major who needs it for the certificate. Also note that this class is on education, not teaching. All you will be taught is educational theory, almost none of which directly translates to teaching others. For those that received good reviews about and recommendations for this course, seriously question the academic ideals of those individuals. This course teaches you nothing. This professor doesnt understand what is actually needed in the field of education. You are wasting your time. Take any other Social Science course. Dont say I didnt warn you. Having nearly all the assignments for a participation grade would also have been fine if we actually got substantial feedback on our work. Unfortunately, however, I never got more than a couple of sentences from my TA. It was usually all good. I felt like I made no improvement in my writing from this class and had no understanding of whether I was actually producing good work. As a result, there is no real incentive to work hard on ANY of the assignments. You basically just need to study hard for the midterm to get a good grade in the class. Lastly, the discussion section posts felt like a waste of time. Most people wrote them AFTER section. Plus, the discussion often went nowhere and felt superficial, likely because no one did the readings.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow48_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17292&amp;evaluatorId=1724541&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1724541</span>\n                        1724541\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1724541</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would.
