It teaches one how to analyze a building&#39;s features and derive a narrative for that building&#39;s importance within its respective urban fabric.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow56_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11016&amp;evaluatorId=1640550&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=ejr&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1640550</span>\n                        1640550\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1640550</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I have gained a good basic understanding of American architectural and urban history.

I looked forward to lecture and think Prof. Rubin does a great job of condensing an immense amount of material into memorable, bite-sized pieces that I will remember long after this semester. The main weakness of the class in my mind was communication with my TF -- we would often receive prompts for a weekly reading response less than 48 hours before our section, and I&#39;m still waiting to get back a paper submitted before Thanksgiving and have no sense of my grade in the course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow3_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11016&amp;evaluatorId=1608126&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ejr&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1608126</span>\n                        1608126\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1608126</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths of this course are that it is interesting and the instructor was very engaged in his teaching.

The readings were mostly extremely interesting but sometimes the amount of weekly reading was unrealistic.

Assignment 1 was also a strength of the course, as this sort of research project was very valuable to me as a means of exploring architecture in New Haven. The discussion sections were also a very comfortable space where we were able to engage in fascinating conversations. In terms of weaknesses, Professor Rubin&#39;s passion did not always translate into well-organized lectures, and the content of the course did not come across in a very systematic way. He also always kept us over time by a few minutes, making the lecture feel rushed. I know the prompt for Assignment 2 was meant to be broad, I think it was too unclear, which made it hard to know how to complete the assignment in an effective way. The final exam was another weak spot of this course. For the slide comparison of the exam  which involved identifying the name, date, and architect of 12 total images  we were given more than 150 images from which the 10 slide comparisons would be selected. It felt really tedious and pointless to memorize that much information for only 12 identifications on the exam. I had to spend a lot of time memorizing this information, and it did not enhance my understanding of American architecture or urbanism.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow21_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11016&amp;evaluatorId=1617198&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ejr&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1617198</span>\n                        1617198\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1617198</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths - lectures are incredible and highly entertaining, readings are great.\r\nWeaknesses - little feedback</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow22_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11016&amp;evaluatorId=1617205&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ejr&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1617205</span>\n                        1617205\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1617205</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The lecture is very fun and engaging, like a Ted Talk.

Things started to make more sense during final review. I especially enjoyed the two assignments, in which we got to look deeply into buildings/topics we are most interested in.

The professor is highly engaging, and I think anyone would find it relevant and compelling. \r\nWeaknesses: the reading list for this class contained some of the most insane literature I have ever read  either incessant nitpicking about intricacies of race in the built environment, or incoherent sociobabble designed to make the authors feel smart and the audience feel clueless. The textbooks, while less insane, were just not particularly interesting. For the final exam, we had to spend way too much time memorizing dates and architects, and it frankly felt like a middle-school exam. The lectures tried to follow a chronological order, but this was often difficult to follow and most of the 20th century ended up as a blob in my head. \r\nImprove: the reading list needs to be overhauled in a major way.

Also, the final was worth 40% of our grade which was kind of overwhelming considering that we were only given insights into what the exam exactly looked like at (what felt like) the last minute. I think it would have been more helpful and beneficial to our learning if we had exercised the skills we needed for the final earlier/more throughout the semester in a way that was integrated into the curriculum.

Professor Rubin is more of a storyteller than anything else, and lectures felt like stories. They sometimes were a little disconnected, but overall you got the gist and they were wonderful to listen to. The two papers were really open ended and fun endeavors, and I enjoyed working on them. Readings were interesting. My two criticisms are that section frequently did not feel like a chance to dive into readings or topics from class, but instead just flirt around with different ideas. I would have appreacited if section was more tightly run and we did a deep dive into one pre-determind topic every week. Second, I think the final exam was much more difficult than necessary. The essays were good and open ended, which was nice, but I think a little bit more notice about their topics would be nice. Additionally, slide comparisons are a great exercise, but I felt the ID part was unfair and took away from reviewing the material. Everyone had to spend a lot of time memorizing date and architect for buildings that would have been better spent reviewing course material. Professor Rubin tried to remind us that slide comparisons were not a big part of our grade, but they were 15% of the grade on the final exam, making up 6 percent of your overall grade. This is not nothing, and felt like it was potentially penalizing people who paid attention in class but had busy finals periods or were not necessarily the best with memorization. I think just changing how IDs work, either reducing their significance, only requiring name, or reducing the number of things to ID, providing some slides with ID and some without may be a way to address this and allow us to focus more on the meat of the course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow30_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11016&amp;evaluatorId=1621360&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ejr&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1621360</span>\n                        1621360\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1621360</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Some of the lectures cover really interesting material and Proffesor Rubin knows a huge amount about what hes teaching.

For instance, giving a clear time line when Georgian (Colonial and Federal) style was, Arts and Craft, Streamline Modern, Art Deco, etc. Also, learning more about the intricacies like entablatures, cornices, etc. formally would be helpful too. The final suggestion is maybe having it more centered on New Haven and New Haven examples.

However, the professor and teaching team provide a lot of resources to make this easier, so you don&#39;t have to go too far off the beaten path to find information. You do need to set aside A LOT of time for these projects, however. Don&#39;t rush them! The final exam is also BRUTAL and involves a LOT OF MEMORIZATION, much of which students (or at least I didn&#39;t) don&#39;t know they need to be memorizing until the end. Flashcards are your FRIEND and you should start at least a week or so before the exam, as this is a LOT OF MEMORIZATION. Be warned!\r\n\r\nDespite the uneven workload, this was a FASCINATING class and I would absolutely recommend it to other students.

It is oftentimes hard to understand how everything in a lecture, or a week of lectures, tie together. He doesn&#39;t present information in a conventional way, and for some people that is good. Instead of presenting one building/place with a name, date, and other pertinent information, he uses photos with no text to contribute to a larger narrative he is crafting throughout a lecture. It makes you listen more to what he says in the moment, but it is a pain to learn all of the building IDs when it comes to the final exam, especially if you are not used to art history classes.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow60_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11016&amp;evaluatorId=1637155&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ejr&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1637155</span>\n                        1637155\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1637155</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, but only if you are truly interested in buildings and architecture.

I am far from an architecture or urban studies major, and I am so grateful to have taken this course. The structure of the assignments allows you to focus on matters that specifically interest you. For example, assignment two is literally to write a five page paper on anything you want relating to architecture, and I decided to talk about how billionaire&#39;s row is impacting the purpose of architecture, rather than analyzing some historical style of architecture or specific building. Now, I can take what I learned with that assignment and apply it to my future ventures in real estate or politics or even journalism. There are a lot of avenues that this class will be applicable to, and that&#39;s the beauty of it. In addition, the class is just interesting and teaches you a lot about American history through the lens of housing and architecture. Regardless of your major, I think you should take this class. It&#39;s also not stressful and has a pretty laidback work to chill ratio.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow66_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11016&amp;evaluatorId=1640550&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ejr&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1640550</span>\n                        1640550\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1640550</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would recommend this course especially if interested in any type of architecture or urbanism.
