The way that correlations and studies were generalized in the course to fit the needs of what the professor was trying to express (e.g. a 0.1 correlation being HUGE if it said that going to church made us happy, but SUPER SMALL if it said that social media makes us happy) HAS TO improve in my opinion.

No comparison or attempt at comparison between happiness strategies - I have no idea, for instance, how gratitude journaling compares with meditation. Also, the course mixed messages in counterproductive ways: grades are bad for learning but also you should study the psets because of quizzes; the rewirements are intrinsically motivated but also you get &#39;psychgold&#39; for doing them; you should credit-D this class but also it&#39;s a social science credit. The silly/arbitrary/graded parts took away from my intrinsic motivation to take the class somewhat. Of course, while this was a weakness for me it may not be so for others - perhaps I could have better sustained intrinsic motivation if I had taken fewer classes and been less stressed. The bottom line here is less that the class is poorly designed, and more that it will not hold your hand - if you want to learn from it, you will need to put in conscious time and effort beyond what is required of you. There will be quizzes, and they will be easy enough that you do not need to study for them, and this will distract you from the fact that maybe taking the class seriously means reviewing your notes every once in a while.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I found after-class discussions with friends as valuable as lectures. Perhaps this could be systematized? The lectures often felt repetitive, especially at the start of the course, and could maybe be cut somewhat in exchange for some group discussion (e.g. with the &#39;psychfam&#39; groups to which we were assigned).</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow92_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1568829&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1568829</span>\n                        1568829\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1568829</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The weaknesses of this course was the repetitiveness of some of the content.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow93_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1568832&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1568832</span>\n                        1568832\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1568832</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course gives a broad scope of different understandings of and techniques to improve happiness, at the expense of diving into the methodologies of and in-depth analysis of different factors or studies.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow94_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1568834&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1568834</span>\n                        1568834\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1568834</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course&#39;s biggest strength is the fact that it allows students to engage with the material on a practical, personal level (the final project is especially helpful for this).

She doesn&#39;t allow dean&#39;s excuses for quizzes which is ridiculous considering there are things such as illness. 3. She literally forces you to listen to her podcasts with loads of ads and continually advertises herself and basically only uses the class to make money/become more famous. There are more but it would be too much to write.\r\n- The grading of the course is actually awful because she tries to force you to credit D the class, which is stupid. She does this because she says grades don&#39;t matter but then assigns you 4 psests, a paper, a research project, and 2 midterms. \r\n- You learn actually nothing. Like straight up nothing. All she does is say stuff like &#39;take a deep breath and don&#39;t be stressed&#39;.\r\n- This class gives a bad rep. to psychology because literally all the correlation coefficients are like 0.1, which is essentially random and doesn&#39;t actually show anything, but she tries to say otherwise.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow107_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1568891&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1568891</span>\n                        1568891\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1568891</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think that the course would benefit from providing a more comprehensive pathway for students who are taking the course for a grade.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow108_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1568899&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1568899</span>\n                        1568899\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1568899</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>the course material was very jam packed and went by at lightning pace</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow109_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1568902&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1568902</span>\n                        1568902\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1568902</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>There should be more opportunities for students to improve their grades</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow110_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1568909&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1568909</span>\n                        1568909\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1568909</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: This course is great at accomplishing what it sets out to do, which is to teach students about happiness and help them change their daily habits for the better.

The length of the final exam isn&#39;t adjusted to take into account the fact that we need to write a research paper in a section of it (myself and many other students left questions blank since over half of the allotted time was taken up writing the research paper).</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow111_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1568922&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1568922</span>\n                        1568922\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1568922</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: Does give you actionable ways to improve happiness, low workload\r\nWeaknesses: Laurie Santos tries to force everyone to cred/d by making the midterm super hard.

I think there&#39;s a difference between a fleeting feeling of happiness vs long-term joy and it would&#39;ve been nice to learn about that and how to reach each one. Also the 75k point for happiness is from several years ago, so with inflation it would be larger. I liked that the course got us talking about this all!!

I understand it is reassuring to explain that our grades are not the most important things in our lives, but unfortunately they are still real. There are many students who took this &quot;popular&quot; course who needed a distributional requirement, or who needed the credit/d/fail for another course, or who did not have any credit/d/fails left or more importantly students who are psychology majors and could use the course for their major requirements. Thus, it is incredibly inconsiderate to not truly give students an opportunity to not credit/d/fail. The reason I say people did not really have an option is because we were given only 60 minutes to complete a 13 page final before reading week. An exam that was majority open ended questions that required a lot of writing to explain our thoughts. This is clearly unrealistic to anyone and I know of many students who had to credit/d/fail following this exam. Students who were concerned and reached out for advice were told not to worry about it because &quot;grades don&#39;t matter&quot;. This is an incredibly tone-deaf statement to say to a class of 500 Yale students when not a single one of them would not be at Yale if it were not for their good grades. If grades did not matter at all we would not be given grades.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow159_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1572937&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1572937</span>\n                        1572937\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1572937</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>There is a lot of memorization in the class for the quizzes and exams for the psychological terms</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow160_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1573484&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1573484</span>\n                        1573484\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1573484</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I did not like that we were so encouraged to take the course pass/fail.

She cited so many studies and put up data and graphs, but then explained none of the data, instead just telling us that this was good for you or bad for you, basically. \r\nIn terms of the content, I often found myself frustrated at the incredibly capitalistic, working-within-the-system mentality. For example, one concept she repeated over and over again is that money doesn&#39;t increase happiness past $75k, which shouldn&#39;t be a problem for any of us since the Yale median salary is 76k or whatever. But like...that ignores the millions of people who don&#39;t make that much. The climate change lecture was poorly done and the guest lecturer advocated for CARBON WRITE-OFFs, which I thought had been pretty much established as generally shitty for the world. \r\nIn addition, the information and data she presented was based on being a financially stable, neurotypical, mentally healthy white cishet individual, which doesn&#39;t apply to a significant proportion of Yale. There was no discussion about who is typically included in psych studies and how these biases skew results. Overall, it just felt like a well-intentioned self-help class, with no real intellectual curiosity or in-depth science involved. Lastly, the &quot;hack-yourself&quot; project was weird--framing it like a proper scientific study ignores the fact that it was not scientific at all, and there was no discussion of statistical analysis of results, or anything. Anyways, I&#39;m angry.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow162_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1576475&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1576475</span>\n                        1576475\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1576475</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I heard about this course upon my first visit to Yale as a senior in high school and I feel as though it was falsely advertised.

One particular strength of the course was the flexibility and option to watch the lecture recordings online, which allowed COVID conscious students to learn comfortably. Regardless, there wasn&#39;t much learning. I genuinely believe the course material is presented in a more difficult manner in order to get students to take the class Credit D Fail. While Prof. Santos stresses that grades do not matter, I think the statement is a little tone deaf given that grades do matter for first gen low-income students who are trying to pursue grad schools following their time at Yale. The exams were surprisingly difficult and grading was not standardized across the class.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow163_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1577613&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1577613</span>\n                        1577613\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1577613</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: Cool lectures and engaging course material\r\nWeaknesses: Some studies felt a little too disconnected from course material (wasn&#39;t relatable)</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow164_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1578822&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1578822</span>\n                        1578822\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1578822</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>A weakness I found in this class was that the content was not always engaging and I wish the class was more discussion based or there was more interactions in the class.

I understand why so many people want to take it. But the class has many serious issues that need to be discussed.\r\n\r\nFirst, the most glaring issue is the false pretense that grades don&#39;t matter or don&#39;t make you happy. This is simply not true. Yes, it is true that we would have happier student populations if grades didn&#39;t exist, or if they were heavily reworked, but that is not the reality. The reality is that all of us, especially Yale students, are operating within a system where success is very directly correlated to our GPAs. Saying that &quot;grades don&#39;t make you happy&quot; is NOT an excuse for being relatively opaque about how grading will work in the class. The preliminary information for the midterm and final was very vague. A friend of mine asked Prof. Santos if the exam would be curved, and she was told that she shouldn&#39;t be worrying about her grade. I witnessed one of my friends try to convince herself that she was happy because she was blindsided by a B when she thought she was going to get an A. I&#39;ve heard of many, many students who receive C&#39;s. In the happiness class. \r\n\r\nAlso, the major assignments (with, perhaps, exception of the midterm) were extremely stressful. I understand the idea of having 500 students design their own scientific study, but this class is not marketed to students with a scientific background. It is marketed to students of any background seeking to improve their subjective well-being. As an English major, I was excited to design my first own experiment. I followed all the instructions provided to me, and I took risks with my proposal and was probably over-ambitious. It was my first scientific proposal, and I was proud of it. You can imagine my dismay when I received a B- on it. My TA told me two things were wrong with it: it was not properly formatted for research, and it was over-ambitious. After that B-, my grade was unrecoverable, and I had to Credit/D/Fail the class. There was no opportunity to rewrite or to speak to someone about my grade, because nobody speaks to you about your grade, because that would shatter the notion that &quot;your grade doesn&#39;t matter.&quot; Besides, Prof. Santos wanted me to Credit/D/Fail the class anyway, because, again, &quot;my grade isn&#39;t going to make me happy.&quot; I know friends whose grade will forever drag down their GPA because they weren&#39;t expecting it to be so low. \r\n\r\nI have never seen a greater cohort of stressed-out students than the night before the final exam. Nobody knew what the format would be like, or how we would have time to be tested on over 100 terms and 12 weeks of lectures while also writing our FINAL WRITE-UP FOR OUR STUDY. We weren&#39;t even given reading period to prepare, because the final was taken during the last class, so we had to study for a final on top of all our end-of-year work. Plot twist: we didn&#39;t have enough time. Everyone had to rush on their final. Thank God I had given up trying on my study after receiving extremely discouraging feedback, because I would&#39;ve been extremely upset to see the culmination of my hard work be a rushed few handwritten essays on a test that was too long for us to only be given an hour. \r\n\r\nAll of this being said, I did learn many extremely useful tips and strategies that I will take with me. I think if there was much less pressure to memorize and a lot of my frustrations were reworked, this could be an extremely useful class that leaves much more students happy that they took it. There will always be students who check out and stop going to lecture. But what I cannot comprehend is why students who DIDN&#39;T check out, who WENT to lecture, were punished as well.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow182_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1590856&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1590856</span>\n                        1590856\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1590856</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths were that it was a cool class, Professor Santos is an amazing lecturer and personality, and the stuff we learned about was actually interesting.

I was so excited to take this class, and worked hard to get into it, but it might have been one of my least favorite classes at Yale (and I even ended up taking it credit/d/fail, as the syllabus recommended). Some of the concepts taught go without even saying, and the exams didn&#39;t test these understandable course concepts, they asked for regurgitating definitions, citing studies that prove a certain term (not the name of the researchers, but having to know what they did and how they carried out the study), and fill in the blank questions on minute stuff that was only mentioned once. The main takeaways that I would think Prof. Santos would want us to have from the class (such as strategies to make us happier in our own life) were not the things remotely close to what the midterm and final tested us on. The course material was interesting at times, but I wish I had used my credit/d/fail credit on another,  better structured class.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow7_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1562135&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1562135</span>\n                        1562135\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1562135</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes because I actually learned a lot of good ways to help reduce my stress increase my happiness</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow8_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1562175&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1562175</span>\n                        1562175\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1562175</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes!

You will learn about some interesting studies and actual ways to be happier. But you do have to brace yourself for a couple of things: Prof Santos makes the grading unnecessarily hard...I had friends score in the 80s on a research proposal...not even the final project just the proposal. It also makes no sense that there are so many assessments in this class. Prof Santos tried to say that Yale makes her give everyone a grade (which is true) but giving a grade absolutely does not necessitate exams (based on every humanity class I&#39;ve taken that&#39;s paper-based or the BENG class I&#39;m in this semester that just has a presentation and participation). So Prof Santos can be really hypocritical in the way she chooses to assess students - I think it&#39;s part of the tactic to convince people to take the class Cr/D/Fail when it could just be based on projects and assessments that people could do well on but not have to study for like an exam. I think it&#39;s a little overhyped as &quot;the most popular class ever&quot; at Yale and that&#39;s gotten to Prof Santos&#39; head a bit (ie taking the time to make slides with screen clippings of all of the news articles that have been written about the course...including in foreign languages) and it might be good to reassess the class and have a more humble attitude - leading by example. So with those downsides in mind, you can still really learn things from the content...I would say the content is solid but the external factors of the course are a bit suspect.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow17_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1562947&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1562947</span>\n                        1562947\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1562947</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>yes, if you want to learn some new ways to think about happiness and the psychology behind what makes us happy and how to be happier</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow18_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1564127&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1564127</span>\n                        1564127\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1564127</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No. Professor Santos is not a good teacher and the content is not interesting enough to put up with the bad teaching.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow19_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1564699&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1564699</span>\n                        1564699\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1564699</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>It was interesting, but grading very unclear and frustrating.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow20_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1564703&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1564703</span>\n                        1564703\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1564703</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>She say&#39;s it&#39;s not a gut, but it is.

What makes no sense is how Santos can be so aware of these issues and want to tackle them but feed into the issues just as equally, if not, more than other classes at Yale. The course unfairly and unrealistically assesses its students to the point that it makes all of the learned material pointless since you really will not feel any less stress or value on grades while taking the class. Although Santos will tell you that grades and hardships don&#39;t matter for your future happiness, she fails to consider an incredibly influential moment of one&#39;s life: the present. Honestly, this class presents itself like a band-aid to the problem that is Yale but really acts as further damage. So, I would not ever suggest someone take this course unless the models in which the material is examined change to match the mindsets that Santos is attempting to put onto her students.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow25_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1566506&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1566506</span>\n                        1566506\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1566506</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Aside from all the problems of positive psychology (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology#Criticism), the course content was just presented in a way that seemed really thoughtless, and at times it felt almost cult-ish.

Yes, Professor Santos is a fantastic lecturer. It&#39;s clear she knows and loves her subject, spends a lot of time preparing lectures and cares about us learning the material. I am incredibly grateful that I had the good fortune to secure a spot in PSYC 157. I learned a lot in this class that I genuinely think will improve my happiness. However, this is absolutely not a gutthe midterm and final were actually somewhat long and difficult. You&#39;d learn just as much listening to her podcasts, without stressing about what your grade might be throughout the semester. If you take this class you have to go in knowing you&#39;ll take it credit Dotherwise, there&#39;s too much stress and uncertainty.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow40_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1568605&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1568605</span>\n                        1568605\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1568605</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No. The class is too full of people c/d/fing it to work hard and get much out of it, and it is too much work to brush off.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow41_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1568608&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1568608</span>\n                        1568608\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1568608</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow42_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1568609&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1568609</span>\n                        1568609\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1568609</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, it is a gut</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow43_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1568613&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1568613</span>\n                        1568613\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1568613</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Don&#39;t take it.

Professor Santos is great. This is obviously the most famous class at Yale so it&#39;s gonna receive a lot of hate, but there&#39;s actually a lot of great science covered in the class. If you really focus on the rewirements you&#39;ll approach life in a much better way by the end of the class. You also get the being in a famous Yale class experience which is fun too. It&#39;s very little work (no need to take notes in lecture because immaculate lecture notes are posted) and there aren&#39;t many graded assignments (lowest 2/4 quizzes are dropped). However, just beware that Professor Santos wishes she didn&#39;t grade anything in the class, and wants everyone to Cr/D/F, so she curves very harshly to encourage everyone to do that. PSYC 157 is still very much worth it though; just Cr/D/F for a lighter course load and really try to work on yourself in the class. It helped me a lot while also teaching me a lot about psychology in a low-stress manner.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow74_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1568724&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1568724</span>\n                        1568724\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1568724</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>yes-it was very fulfilling</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow75_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1568726&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1568726</span>\n                        1568726\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1568726</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Take it as a fifth class, expect to put in some time around exams</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow76_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1568727&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1568727</span>\n                        1568727\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1568727</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No, because I think it is hard to balance learning the technical material and implementing the practices for real.

It just felt very counterintuitive to the classes values.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow190_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20568&amp;evaluatorId=1584644&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=lrs32&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1584644</span>\n                        1584644\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1584644</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, if you are Credit/D&#39;ing.

I half-jokingly called this course &quot;Psychology and the Bad Life&quot; during the semester since it was by far and away my greatest source of stress and unhappiness during this past semester. If you do not CR/D/F the class, the unpredictable grading of tests makes the final grade in the class a complete gamble, especially with the harsh regrading policy in the syllabus that requires a full course review &quot;where Professor Santos is likely to be in a grouchy mood&quot; even for objectively incorrect grades. The class aims to force students to CR/D/F it, even if they do not want to for their own personal reasons. Even if the class is taken CR/D/F (as I did), the class still has a multitude of problems.\r\n\r\nThe lack of any guidelines on what pieces of information are important encourages students to memorize the most irrelevant information (i.e. that the 24 character strengths are Creativity, Curiosity, Open-mindedness, Love of learning, Perspective, Honesty, Bravery, Persistence, Zest, Kindness, Love, Social intelligence, Fairness, Leadership, Teamwork, Forgiveness, Modesty, Prudence, Self-regulation, Appreciation of beauty, Gratitude, Hope, Humor, Religiousness), which in turn makes the students stressed to study and take away less of the truly important parts of the class (i.e. the general idea that finding a career which appeals to your personal character strengths will make you happier). The class is pitched as a way to improve your happiness, but in reality, it is simply a class based on rote memorization of useless facts that won&#39;t make you happier. Similarly, the class is oftentimes ironic in its teachings. While it teaches the G.I. Joe Fallacy during the first week or two of class, it fails to understand the significance of the fallacy. The G.I. Joe Fallacy, in this context, says that simply knowing how to be happier won&#39;t make you happier. You would have to take action to improve your happiness.\r\n\r\nHowever, the tests in this class simply test whether you know how to be happier according to the lectures in class. While the class attempts to patch this ironic failure through the &quot;Hack Yourself&quot; final project, the project&#39;s associated writing tasks shift it from an activity that should be increasing your happiness to an activity that relies on memorization and knowledge rather than implementation.\r\n\r\nI am confident that Professor Santos has excellent intentions with improving the mental health of Yale&#39;s student body. However, I firmly believe that her attempt at improving our health through this class is a failure for a significant portion of the students that take it, oftentimes having the opposite effect on mental health. While taking the class, I often had the impression that Professor Santos did not truly have the intention of improving student mental health. I heard other students who asked Professor Santos for help and received an extremely unhelpful response that made these students feel isolated in their problems with the class. The class, I&#39;m certain, could be restructured in a manner that would actually improve mental health. However, the current class design is very far from achieving this goal.\r\n\r\nWith a disastrous grading policy and an unhelpful teaching team, I would recommend that future Yale students avoid this class.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n                                \n                            </div>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </main>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div id="yale-footer-bottom" class="no-print" role="contentinfo">\n    <footer role="contentinfo" class="yale-footer">\n        <div class="footer-logo row">\n            <div class="column small-4 large-3 columns">\n                <a class="y-icons y-yale y-mark" href="http://www.yale.edu/"><span class="show-for-sr">Yale\n                </span></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class="small-8 large-9 columns">\n                <p class="copyright spacer" style="font-size: .8rem;">\n                    Copyright &copy; <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear())</script> Yale University <span aria-hidden="true">&middot;</span> All rights reserved <span aria-hidden="true">&middot;</span>\n                    <a title="Yale Privacy policy" href="http://www.yale.edu/privacy.html" style="text-decoration: underline">Privacy policy</a>\n                    <span aria-hidden="true">-</span>\n                    <a href="https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility/accessibility-yale" style="text-decoration: underline">Accessibility at Yale</a>\n                    \n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </footer>\n</div>\n\n\n<script type="text/javascript" src="/ocedashboard/assets/app-64ec30218e4e8f6eca224a18684e4884.js" ></script>\n<script type="text/javascript" src="/ocedashboard/assets/jquery-ui.min-b0ba1d1ac5ef9706219d68b4ecfcd5b3.js" ></script>\n<script type="text/javascript" src="/ocedashboard/assets/jquery.multiselect-a52ab3a5ee20a1f9138c469e94241a1a.js" ></script>\n\n<script>\n    $(window).bind("load", function () {\n        var footer = $("#yale-footer-bottom");\n        var pos = footer.position();\n        var height = $(window).height();\n        height = height - pos.top;\n        height = height - footer.height();\n        if (height > 0) {\n            footer.css({\n                \'margin-top\': height + \'px\'\n            });\n        }\n    });\n    function loadingMessage() {\n        $("body").css("cursor", "progress");\n        $("#loadingMessage").show();\n    }\n    function clearLoadingMessage() {\n        $("body").css("cursor", "default");\n        $("#loadingMessage").hide();\n    }\n\n</script>\n<script>\n\n\n    (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\'GoogleAnalyticsObject\']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n            (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n        m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n    })(window,document,\'script\',\'https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\',\'ga\');\n\n    ga(\'create\', \'UA-100715343-1\', \'auto\');\n    ga(\'send\', \'pageview\');\n\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n'
