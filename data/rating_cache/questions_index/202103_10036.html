The first and third field projects are also interesting and engaging. That is the end of the strengths. \r\n\r\nThe second field project is actually one of the most inane and ridiculous assignments I have had the misfortune to complete at Yale. It feels like a parody of what conservative pundits think Yale or other elite universities do in their classes. The fact that Professor Barraclough acknowledges that there have been countless complaints in the past regarding the assignment as well as the current semester but refuses to amend or remove it speaks to the nature of the course itself. She is sending out nearly 200 Yale students to take up space on the public transit system within New Haven which as we learn in class is already underfunded, poorly maintained, and a utility used by a demographic that consists of a majority of low-income people, POC, elderly people, and those with disabilites. We are expected to go out and observe the riders of public transit and of the state of the transit system itself but it is impossible to avoid feeling like it is merely an attempt in cosplaying as a poor person especially considering the radically different demographic makeup of the Yale student body compared to the riders of CT Transit. It feels gross, weird, and invasive. \r\nIf that wasn&#39;t bad enough, Professor Barraclough also made incredibly insensitive comments that bordered on transphobia when she requested that in our observations students assume the gender identity of those that we saw. Along the lines of &quot;if they look like a woman, analyze them as a woman&quot; simply so we could make more general claims about those who rode the bus. This is inexcusable and just lazy teaching.&#39;\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the midterm exam was actually ridiculous. The course staff expected FAR too much from us in the short amount of time in one class for the midterm. It was just physically unfeasible for to write fast enough to write as much as they wanted during a class period  unless you were able to read the prompt and immediately know what you would write for the next 9-12 pages, writing non-stop. It was simply unnecessary stress and unreasonable expectations. It would have made far more sense to have us narrow our focus to fewer topics and elaborate further on those.\r\n\r\nLastly, it was not made expressly clear that our final exam would consist of a 7-10 page paper until the Friday night after the deadline to change the course to credit/D. This meant that students who suddenly learned that they did not have adequate time to prepare and write a 7-10 page paper among their other planned finals and papers were stuck with making time for the paper as well as taking the course for a letter grade.

We should know what the final will be like when we sign up for the class. Second, I appreciate the feedback on my writing, but this was not a writing course. A five-page reflection on a field project is not the same assignment as a well-crafted thesis paper. Third, I want to speak honestly about a serious qualm I had throughout the course. I have a deep moral problem pretending that I, as a white man, understand the struggles of a person of color or of a minority gender. Whenever I would make a comment expressing this concern, my TF responded that it was fine. Maybe it is. But this should be a significant point discussed in the class. Critical theory is a great tool, but I was in no way educated on how to craft a respectful and accurate narrative. All semester, I felt like I was just making things up; putting words in other people&#39;s mouths; pretending I knew what someone else&#39;s lived experience was despite the fact I had genuinely no idea beyond a 50-minute lecture.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow13_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10036&amp;evaluatorId=1533880&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lb627&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1533880</span>\n                        1533880\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1533880</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course was incredibly misleading, and ultimately disappointing. The content that the course covers is interesting, and the lectures were clear and easy to follow. What I did not like about this course was the assignments. This class is advertised as having three field projects, a midterm exam, and a final exam. All five of these exercises were just papers. Three five page papers instead of field projects, an essay-based midterm, and the final exam was not an exam at all, but rather a 7-10 page paper. This is a ridiculous amount of writing for a 100 level lecture, and a class with a WR credit. Also, the expectations for the assignments were really unclear. There seemed to be a major disconnect in what was expected by Barraclough and what was expected by the TAs. The final paper (exam) was completely open ended, and we were given no guidance on how to approach it. I expected this course to be at a similar difficulty of other 100 level lectures, and was baffled by the poor communication and extreme levels of criticism I and other students received in response to not understanding. This is very much an introductory course, but students are not treated like beginners. Nobody I spoke to in this course had a positive experience with their communication with Barraclough, and shared similar frustrations with the structure of the course.\r\n\r\nThis course has amazing potential to be something really uplifting and informative for students, but there needs to be serious changes made to how assignment instructions are written. This class seemed to suck because of poor communication between the professor, the TAs, and the students. Or maybe it just needs a better professor.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow14_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10036&amp;evaluatorId=1534878&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lb627&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1534878</span>\n                        1534878\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1534878</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>weakness: the assignments. the assignments were awful, they were essays not field projects. they expected you to somehow read their minds and understand that the way the assignment instructions were written was not actually how they wanted the essay to be written. also the &quot;take-home final exam&quot; was actually a 7-10 page paper that was announced 45 minutes after the deadline to credit/d/fail the class which i found to be incredible unfair. also given that this is an intro level class and i barely learned anything new in the class, the assignments were truly asking you to go above and beyond in a way that was impossible given the course material and really required a lot of outside research to get a good grade on assignments.\r\n\r\nstrengths: professor barraclough was an engaging lecturer and office hours with her were very easy to schedule</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow15_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10036&amp;evaluatorId=1536051&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lb627&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1536051</span>\n                        1536051\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1536051</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The material and content was really interesting and the delivery of it through the lectures was efficient.

The TF&#39;s stressed high school-like criteria for writing style that detracted from the creative and critical nature of fieldwork. The &quot;take-home final exam&quot; was also a 7-10 page argumentative paper, assigned on the last day of classes. The expectations for writing and work were really not clear at many points in the course. I thought the material, both in lectures and in readings, was very interesting and well-presented. The opportunities to respectfully engage with New Haven communities and public transit were also very valuable. I think the syllabus and the content were the course&#39;s main strengths, and communication and workload were its main weaknesses.\r\n\r\nOne content-related weakness I will add is a lack of discussion about trans and nonbinary experiences in cities. For a class with &quot;gender&quot; in the name, basically all of the gender-related content was about the cisgender women&#39;s experience. I think this class could grow by including more readings and discussion on how cities reproduce the gender binary.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow19_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10036&amp;evaluatorId=1537373&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lb627&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1537373</span>\n                        1537373\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1537373</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Some good readings and lectures tended to be engaging</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow20_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10036&amp;evaluatorId=1537849&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lb627&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1537849</span>\n                        1537849\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1537849</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Course was great.

For one, the professor herself is a white woman whose academic interest in race stems from the fact that she went to school in a predominantly POC high school. Moreover, the assignments are incredibly problematic. One of the assignments was to get on a New Haven bus and take notes on the &quot;racial and socioeconomic demographic changes&quot; on the bus. Essentially, it required that Yale students get on a bus and treat poor people and POC living their everyday lives as lab rats. The second assignment required that we essentially take pictures of gentrification in New Haven, again having Yale students going and taking pictures of people&#39;s houses. To improve this course, I think the person teaching needs to be more cognizant of Yale&#39;s role in New Haven and more respectful of low-income and POC experiences.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow22_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10036&amp;evaluatorId=1538940&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lb627&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1538940</span>\n                        1538940\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1538940</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I loved the field assignments that got us out in New Haven and had us engage with and learn more about the urban community outside of Yale.

Grading made it seem like it was a writing credit, but it is NOT and the TAs really did not treat it that way.\r\n- Field project 2 was framed in an incredibly problematic way - making assumptions about race, gender, and class-based on people&#39;s appearances, having 180 people ride the bus with no other options if people didn&#39;t feel comfortable (due to COVID or because of the necessity to make observations about people without their knowledge, or the premise of the assignment in and of itself)\r\n- Professor was very defensive when students had critiques of the assignment, stating that it&#39;s been done for 20 years (which does not justify anything continuing ?) and that we should all check our own privilege. \r\n\r\nStrengths: \r\n- I liked field project 1 because it allowed us to explore the history of our hometowns and contextualize what we see in the present.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow27_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10036&amp;evaluatorId=1541260&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lb627&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1541260</span>\n                        1541260\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1541260</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I thought this class was so good!

We were told that it would be a take home final, but it was announced on the last day of classes that it was actually going to be a 7-10 page paper, and this announcement was only made after the deadline had passed to credit D the class. I also was hoping to talk more about queer issues in lecture, since it really intersects with a lot of the topics we focused on. \r\n\r\nAnother area for improvement in the class I think would just be making the expectations a lot clearer for the assignments. This improved with later assignments, but receiving feedback our first assignment was really jarring because a lot of the expectations had not been included in the page-long assignment description, which I had assumed was comprehensive. It was not clear that we were going to be evaluated on the strength of our argument, since all the description said was offer a gentle thesis and that if you dont feel comfortable trying to explain the relationships between past and present, you might pose a set of questions that came up for you. For an assignment in which we were told primarily to summarize your findings and reflect on their possible meanings, it really sounded much more like a reflection than an assignment where we were expected to have a really strong argument. The assignment description also read that you are not expected to cite any sources beyond the Mapping Inequality website, so it was also kind of a shocker to find that we had been marked down for not using any outside sources? I really appreciate that it was made clear in following assignments that few ere expected to incorporate the readings, but I really wish this had been clearer for the first assignment as well.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow28_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10036&amp;evaluatorId=1542236&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lb627&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1542236</span>\n                        1542236\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1542236</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I thought the lectures were extremely engaging and enjoyed the field projects.

Had I not essentially memorized my responses I definitely would not have had time to finish even though I understood the concepts. I think that more thoughtful and fully developed responses could be generated through a take-home exam, and memorizing my responses felt like a waste of time.

Overall, communication of assignment expectations between the professor, TAs, and us was really poor. The professor had detailed instructions and wanted things done as assignments (which many of us also wanted) whereas the TAs expected (and graded) assignments as papers. I think having more open-ended assignments (like the actual assignment descriptions would have been helpful). Additionally, the midterm was designed to make our lives easier but it was similarly frustrating. A lot of people just chose a few terms and practiced writing prompts for those, and I didn&#39;t think my overall knowledge was really being tested. We also all ran out of time which was hard. And it was really frustrating to have written so many papers for the class and then our &quot;take-home final&quot; at the end was just a 7-10 page paper. It was a really great class and I learned a lot which was why it was so much more frustrating that assignments and logistical elements took so much of my joy away from the work.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow30_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10036&amp;evaluatorId=1543319&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lb627&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1543319</span>\n                        1543319\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1543319</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The biggest weakness is the lack of clarity between the course and sections.

The other field projects involved us going out into different areas of New Haven to study transit mobility and gentrification, which sometimes felt a little bit strange. Like, on the bus trip, I didn&#39;t feel 100% comfortable observing passengers and intellectualizing my perception of their mobility struggles.

Everything is in the context of men and women, which neglects to acknowledge the ways in which trans demographics are also not well-served within a heteropatriarchal system. The same type of nuance could be added for racial capitalism around the idea of colorism. Who is most well-served and who is least well-served by these systems? It seems to me that everything is on a spectrum, because race and gender are not binary systems; therefore, these power-based systems should not be discussed in binary language (black / white; men / women) either. Most importantly, when considering intersectionality and the ways in which the three ideologies of this course interact with each other, is seems remiss to exclude trans women of color, who are most underserved by every one of these systems shaping our society.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow44_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10036&amp;evaluatorId=1550587&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lb627&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1550587</span>\n                        1550587\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1550587</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Weaknesses: the final was announced super late and there was way more writing in this class than I originally anticipated.

This class is not a writing credit or an English class and should not be treated as such.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow51_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10036&amp;evaluatorId=1553384&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lb627&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1553384</span>\n                        1553384\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1553384</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Lectures and slides were quite unorganized</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow52_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10036&amp;evaluatorId=1553861&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lb627&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1553861</span>\n                        1553861\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1553861</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I really enjoyed our in-class lectures - I felt that Professor Barraclough did a good job of explaining complex concepts and providing illustrative examples in relatively short amounts of time and without condescending to the class.

It was not totally clear to me what form the field projects were supposed to take, and my classmates and I sometimes got conflicting feedback on assignments (e.g. whether the field projects should be more fluid/narrative or more segmented/scientific). In the future, it might be helpful to provide rubrics and example papers before the very first assignment and coordinate between TFs as to what the expectations will be for assignments and discussion section formats.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow53_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10036&amp;evaluatorId=1553898&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=lb627&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1553898</span>\n                        1553898\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1553898</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Lectures were interesting, and I appreciated the flexibility of courses being recorded.

Similarly, I wish the format of the final had been more clear earlier on. as it was repeatedly referred to as a take home final, I had planned to study for something similar to the midterm when planning for reading week, only to find out after the deadline to drop the class that it would be a 7-10 page paper, which for me takes a lot more time.

The content of this course was fantastic. The reading load was manageable but also substantive, probably the best reading load of any of my courses this semester.

The only real weakness in my opinion was section  the section for this course felt like a complete waste of time and was consistently the hour of my week that I dreaded most.

Oftentimes, one thing would be written on the assignment and then the grades/feedback would reflect an altered expectation that was not clearly communicated. It was often unclear the extent to which we were expected to draw from course material and or outside sources, and balance that with personal reflection. The midterm exam was structured in a way that made it extremely difficult to actually show an understanding of a topic because the time we had to complete a large amount of writing was quite short. We were asked to write on a topic and show our understanding and also bring in course readings, and connections to larger issues for at least 6 topics in under 50 minutes, which left little time to organize thoughts and plan a response, even if we did know a considerable amount about the topic. Finally, the syllabus was incredibly unclear about the nature of the final for this class, and made it seem like it was going to be an exam i.e. NOT a paper/essay. It was labelled as take-home. In the last week of class we were informed that the final was indeed a longer form writing assignment, and we were first told that it would be two essay questions each a few pages long. The final prompt was not released until the evening of the last day of class, after the Credit D deadline, where we were informed that it would be one 7-10 page essay. I felt completely blindsided by this announcement because no where in the syllabus had it ever said we would have a final paper. By releasing it during reading period essentially, it also left little time to plan out a well developed response because by that time I was already busy completing other final assignments. I think that the final either should have been released well in advance, or at least the format of the final should have been a LOT more clear from the beginning. Additionally, the excuse for waiting to post the prompt was to wait and make sure that the final only asked about material we covered in class. However, the prompt was so vague it would not have made a difference if it was released a week earlier, and we had more time to plan.  \r\nAnother of this courses main weakness stems from the fact that a critical intersectional viewpoint or approach was often disregarded for simplicitys sake which really made the class feel pointless a lot of the time. For example, during our bus field project, we were asked to just put aside the fact that peoples experience and identity around gender is not something we can assume from their physical presentations. Instead we were asked to make assumptions about peoples race, class, gender, and identity based on solely observations of them during a short time period, and then draw larger conclusions about the bus system. Overall, this project was a negative experience and did not contribute to my overall understandings of the bus system or peoples experiences. I think this project should be removed from the class. Additionally, in lecture, we had few discussions about gender that acknowledged trans experiences and the non-binary nature of gender. Additionally, our discussions of sexuality in lecture really only went as far as talking about middle and upper class gay men and their role in gentrification. I think there are many interesting histories of queerness that tie into the topics we discussed but we largely did not talk about them. \r\nThe documentary we watched about gentrification also seemed slightly outdated and the fact that it was made by a a white woman in Brooklyn was slightly odd, I feel like there are more important perspectives we could have watched/read about too.</td>\n

Like, I literally slaved away at writing a paper worth 15% of my grade and my TA was even like &quot;wow you blew me away and this goes above and beyond&quot; and she didn&#39;t give me the full 15/15 points like. Isn&#39;t an A supposed to be above and beyond? Idk maybe I haven&#39;t faced failure before but this hits different like. I&#39;ve never been given such positive feedback and still gotten a grade I wasn&#39;t happy with. This class is absolutely not a gut but it is really interesting if you&#39;re interested in cities and urbanism (which I was, thankfully). \r\n\r\nAlso, on the last day, Dr. B was like &quot;Oh I haven&#39;t even written the final exam yet because I want to make sure it encapsulates every element of the course&quot; and...

This is a class that encompasses a lot of information into one, so you don&#39;t need to take several classes to gain the information that she shares. Through this class, you&#39;ll learn all about how American space and history has shaped racial, class, and gender disparities that exist today. You&#39;ll learn about the underpinnings of systemic racism, grasp how sexism has created gaps in what women are able to accomplish, and understand how class and race are deeply intertwined. You&#39;ll develop a new language about how to speak about these things, so that you can go out and talk about them with other people and engage in real conversations with the context necessary to develop your own opinions. The workload is very low yet extremely rewarding. The assignments from this class are by far my favorite that I&#39;ve done at Yale, and I gained experiences and insight that go well beyond the academic aspect of assignments.

But past that, it&#39;s a pretty interesting overview that definitely changed how I view the built environment around me.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow47_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10036&amp;evaluatorId=1553159&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=lb627&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1553159</span>\n                        1553159\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1553159</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes with a caveat.

It felt invasive for me to be a part of the 150 students from the class taking up space on the city&#39;s bus system to study people and make assumptions about their socioeconomic status and how they are using the bus system for a grade. As Yale students riding the bus for an assignment, we are took up space IN A PANDEMIC, made judgements and assumptions about people, and then left to never engage with the space again. The assignment is even more questionable in my opinion when considering that we are calling out the city of New Haven for contributing to transit inequality but not doing anything to change transit inequity in New Haven or at the very least directed to support existing projects in New Haven that are working to solve transit inequity. We criticized the ways that New Haven buses are set up without actively questioning how Yales relationship to the city of New Haven is a direct cause of the lack of funds that limit bus accessibility for those who depend on public transit,. Yales monetary contributions to New Haven compared to how much it should give in taxes is a huge revenue stream that, if given to the city, could provide necessary funds for New Haven transit to become equitable. I wish that these connections were considered more when making the bus transit assignment. I enjoyed the other two field projects and learned a lot from them, but the transit inequality field project needs to be changed in my opinion.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow57_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10036&amp;evaluatorId=1555748&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=lb627&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1555748</span>\n                        1555748\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1555748</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Good introduction to the social and spatial production of race, class, and gender inequalities, and how they were built through the interaction of racial capitalism, settler colonialism, and heteropatriarchy.
