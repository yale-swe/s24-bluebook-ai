Beyond this, you gain skills in effective problem solving by yourself (which I personally believe is really important in one&#39;s ability to adapt to Yale&#39;s curriculum), methodical thinking, problem decomposition, and so much more. In essence, this class will teach you how to find the solutions to problems that nobody else can because often in computer science you will get errors that the T.A.s may never have seen. I think you&#39;ll also quickly learn that, like with all classes surrounding innovation and problem solving, learning how to program is a process and can&#39;t simply be taught in lecture. You need to practice programming and keep working at it until you have developed your own identity as a programmer and personal approaches to problems. If you&#39;re someone like me who wants to know exactly what to do the second I see a problem, you will find it annoying to program at the beginning because there are a lot of errors in computer science and so many ways to approach problems. You&#39;re going to need to develop enough mental fortitude that you can grind through a problem even when your first few tries lead you nowhere.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow15_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11086&amp;evaluatorId=1528426&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=jpl65&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1528426</span>\n                        1528426\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1528426</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned the basics of coding in different languages.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow16_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11086&amp;evaluatorId=1529768&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=jpl65&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1529768</span>\n                        1529768\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1529768</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>basic programming skills, greater comfort with the concepts of CS in general</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow17_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11086&amp;evaluatorId=1530643&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=jpl65&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1530643</span>\n                        1530643\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1530643</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned how to program.

It was also a bummer that it&#39;s taught at Harvard because watching online isn&#39;t as fun.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow14_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11086&amp;evaluatorId=1527670&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jpl65&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1527670</span>\n                        1527670\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1527670</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: Very informative lectures covering a wide array of topics, in addition to labs that helped go over concepts needed for PSETS.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there were a few PSETS where it felt like the content discussed in the lecture didnt correspond to the information needed to complete the PSET.

It can be really difficult, especially if you&#39;re a beginner, but I really hope they don&#39;t change this because you walk out of this class with skills that I don&#39;t think any other class will teach you. The truth is that there really isn&#39;t an introduction into computer science. Sure, you can slowly learn individual aspects of programming, but the challenge of computer science is not actually learning the code, but how to implement that code. I could write 100 &quot;for loops&quot; that print my name, but if you want to learn how to write unique programs and solve ambiguous problems, you need to jump into the deep end and stay afloat. There is plenty of support at office hours and the great thing about computer science is that there are so many online resources. CS50 will provide you with knowledge on decomposing errors and you should always practice your problem solving by applying that knowledge, but also know that you can see if people have had similar errors online when writing their own programs. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don&#39;t think there are many weaknesses to the class, but be warned: THIS CLASS HAS A LOT OF WORK. I disliked this at the beginning but eventually realized that you need this much work to actually learn about effective programming and problem solving because it&#39;s something that comes with practice. I would recommend taking this class concurrently with classes that have a lighter course load because if you actually want to learn how to program, this class will take a big chunk of your time. I definitely found myself sitting down for hours each week testing multiple approaches to problem sets. This class is also not tailored to the &quot;weak-willed&quot;, especially for beginners, and I&#39;m not saying this to be rude. I think that if you have a combination of a lack of interest in computer science and a tendency to give up when faced with seemingly unsolvable problems, you will not make it to the end unless you change your mindset. Fortunately, this is possible (I like to think that I was one of these people). I was not highly motivated at the beginning and was frustrated that I was struggling only 3 weeks in. I even considered dropping the class, but I&#39;m glad that I didn&#39;t. Sometimes, you want the computer to do something, and it just tells you NO. You have to accept that, realize that programming takes a lot of individual critical thinking, and approach your problem once more. Also, getting an understanding T.A. is a lottery ticket. Fortunately, my T.A. was very kind and would even meet with me outside of class to help me with problem sets when I couldn&#39;t make it to office hours, but there are other T.A.s who derive pleasure from sliding a nice 0 for grading into the design portion of your problem sets (ok, maybe not to this extreme, but I have heard of some T.A. horror stories). I also wish we had a little more time for our final project because I was having a lot of fun with it, but I understand that it&#39;s already difficult enough to fit in all that this course teaches you in such a small time window.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow16_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11086&amp;evaluatorId=1528426&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jpl65&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1528426</span>\n                        1528426\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1528426</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>It gives a broad overview and an introduction to coding, so it is a good way to get introduced to programming.

I still find it funny that every time I tell a CS major that we learned flask in one lecture, they would be absolutely shocked ...... but I think professor Malan is truly a great lecturer and makes most of the concepts very accessible - there&#39;s no way I could have listened to a three-hour lecture if it wasn&#39;t for his engaging, concise style. I also appreciate how we have a lot of support for the class material: some of the CS50 TAs are just angels - intelligent, funny, and patient. The course heads have also been very attentive to students&#39; feedback to make sure everyone is following along. Moreover, even though sometimes the concepts are (really) challenging, I&#39;ve felt the psets (and even exam questions) are actually pretty fun, because they are application-based and feature real-life scenarios where you can see what you&#39;ve learned manifesting into a concrete result, which is really rewarding and provides huge motivation to move on to the next topic, not to mention how I&#39;ve been cheered up more than once by the CS memes featured in our weekly updates - &quot;it doesn&#39;t work - why? it works - why?&quot; In general, although I do feel this class is challenging and at times stressful, there are a lot of attempts to make it fun and engaging and it ends up worth the effort.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I do feel we are moving a little bit too fast at times. When we are just starting to get the hang of pointers (or maybe we are not), we have to move on to something else already. Maybe taking the time to consolidate what we&#39;ve learned would make us feel less disoriented at times. Also, this might be part of the nature of the course, but i feel it would be hard for one to discover the joy of programming in this class, unless one is really set to find it (or one just really needs the credit). That is, this class might have gone a little too far on the &quot;challenge&quot; axis and could be prohibitively difficult for someone who just wanted to dabble in CS to test the waters - as is often the motivation when people take an intro class. I was lucky enough to have really supportive TAs who are willing to go out of their way to help. But without them, I would have felt disheartened pretty quickly, even if I know I&#39;m trying my best, as is the case with some of my other friends who dropped the class halfway. I feel that just lowering the level of difficulty a little bit more would make the joy of programming accessible to more people - especially given the course&#39;s already coherent and engaging design.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow18_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11086&amp;evaluatorId=1530643&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jpl65&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1530643</span>\n                        1530643\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1530643</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think the lectures were outstanding.

They were generally pretty fun to complete, especially the Fiftyville one. There was a great deal of resources to obtain any help you needed with any of the assignments throughout the semester. Office hours with the TA&#39;s were outstanding. The class does require quite a lot of time (around 12-15 hours a week including lecture time). However, I do not think this is a weakness as you very much get out of the course what you put in.

If you are interested in spending time on two or three other courses, it will become almost unmanageable.

Workload is incredibly high - therefore take this class during a light workload sem.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow29_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11086&amp;evaluatorId=1537002&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jpl65&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1537002</span>\n                        1537002\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1537002</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Best class I&#39;ve taken.

I appreciated that at certain points in the semester the course tried to force us to become more independent by changing the amount and kind of help we were given at office hours. The only weakness I can think of is that the quality of TAs is extremely variable. I personally felt that my section was not as useful as it could have been because the TAs were not in so strongly in command of the material at many points. They primarily read off of slides and were slow and unsure in answering questions. At office hours, there were many TAs who were much less willing and seemingly able to help than others.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow39_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11086&amp;evaluatorId=1542535&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jpl65&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1542535</span>\n                        1542535\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1542535</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>It is a lot of work.

I especially like how office hours are so available, and even after they end theres also the ed discussion page, so there was always a place to look to when I got really stuck. I think this course benefits from being so high energy and engaging; the problem sets are difficult, but its rewarding and interesting to work through them. This course is also wonderful for people with different programming backgrounds, so there were parts of problem sets for those less comfortable (like me) that were still challenging and more challenging ones that sometimes I would even attempt after trying the less comfortable one. I think the quizzes, labs, problem sets, and final project were all very fair; I think my only difficulty was I felt a little overwhelmed with the final test and would have possibly liked more discussion section exercises like the one we did with problems of a similar nature to those on the exam.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow93_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11086&amp;evaluatorId=1553353&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jpl65&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1553353</span>\n                        1553353\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1553353</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: This class does a good job of taking what can potentially be a very dry subject and injecting fun and life into it. There are always fun demonstrations, visuals, and problems every week. There&#39;s also a lot of support, and I really appreciated that Yale&#39;s CS50 course, instead of following Harvard exactly, had more generous academic policies (a one-time extension, 2 dropped labs and quizzes, a later due date for the final project). The course also built up difficulty in a (mostly) reasonable way. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course becomes VERY web-development heavy at the end, and as a result they suddenly squeeze an overwhelming amount of content in the last couple weeks in a way that didn&#39;t feel very effective. Like, supposedly this class &quot;covers&quot; Javascript, but it was done so quickly I definitely don&#39;t feel like I could code anything in Javascript without basically starting from the ground up and teaching myself. Also, the weekly workload felt a bit excessive. Each week there was a 2.5 hour lecture, a ~1.5 hour section, a quiz, and a problem set that could take up to 10+ hours, (and a lab but that didn&#39;t really feel like extra work). This felt like a bit too much of a time-suck. I basically didn&#39;t do any extracurriculars this semester and also took easy classes aside from CS50, so I was able keep up just fine with the work, but I can&#39;t imagine having to do this class in tandem with extracurriculars and other work-heavy classes. Also, this might have just been because of COVID, but it felt very weird that every lecture was at Harvard and we just had to watch a live-stream or recording. It kind of felt like I was just taking an online class at the Harvard Extension School or something.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow94_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11086&amp;evaluatorId=1553674&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jpl65&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1553674</span>\n                        1553674\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1553674</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>virtual format was hard to follow and the lectures were too long in one sitting.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow95_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11086&amp;evaluatorId=1553876&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jpl65&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1553876</span>\n                        1553876\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1553876</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: The depth of the course and skills gained in such a short period of time is the main strength of the course.

Also, the variety of problems and resources available to students make it the perfect environment to learn to program and be exposed to the wonderful world of computer science. Weaknesses: One weakness of the course is the ambiguity when it comes to grading. There are no rubrics beforehand for the problem sets or projects, which can result in points lost that could have been avoided with a rubric available to the student.

Office hours also facilitate a strong community bond over difficult psets, and all the amazing TAs are what truly made the class; they were really dedicated in helping each student grow and understand. However, the weekly workload may be difficult to manage on top of other classes and draining.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow98_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11086&amp;evaluatorId=1555210&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jpl65&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1555210</span>\n                        1555210\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1555210</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The obvious weakness is that there&#39;s no in person lecture, which inherently makes it less engaging.

We had a take home test one week and the TAs said expect 40+ hours of work on this across 5 days - which I think is unreasonable.
