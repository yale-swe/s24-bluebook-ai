The best course BY FAR I have taken at Yale--PLEASE take this class, it does an incredible job of providing history and context to topics that are incredibly relevant to understanding our world today. Prof HoSang is truly amazing, and I cannot recommend him more highly. I only wish I had taken this class earlier during my time at Yale. If you are reading this, you should add this course to your schedule immediately--you won&#39;t regret it.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow2_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20159&amp;evaluatorId=1565278&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=dwh39&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1565278</span>\n                        1565278\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1565278</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Learned about the racial history of America and how the law has been involved in systemic racism</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow3_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20159&amp;evaluatorId=1565942&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=dwh39&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1565942</span>\n                        1565942\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1565942</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>i didnt learn anything i didnt already know as a black woman</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow4_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20159&amp;evaluatorId=1567433&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=dwh39&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1567433</span>\n                        1567433\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1567433</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>So much that it&#39;d be hard to spend time trying to recount all of it, but definitely included critical thinking and broader intersectional analysis</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow5_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20159&amp;evaluatorId=1571261&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=dwh39&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1571261</span>\n                        1571261\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1571261</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned how to read legal scholarly writings, how to be concise in creating arguments, and how to think critically about societal issues.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow6_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20159&amp;evaluatorId=1571453&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=dwh39&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1571453</span>\n                        1571453\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1571453</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>a better understanding of liberalism, racial formation, colorblindness, what whiteness means, the prison abolition movement, sovereignty, and how to envision a new type of freedom</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow7_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20159&amp;evaluatorId=1573781&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=dwh39&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1573781</span>\n                        1573781\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1573781</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The history of racial relations and dynamics and how they have been shaped by and continued to shape laws.

I was especially moved by our study of non-hierarchical collective organizations like the Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance (KIWA) and the Asian Immigrant Women Advocates (AIWA) in Southern and Northern California. The course informed my understanding of the urgent need to reject hierarchy in all its forms. It also pushed me to reject the piecemeal process of incremental legal reform that fuels the myth of racial progress in the U.S. with the idea that laws can outlaw discrimination and that a post-racial contemporary society is on the horizon. With this move beyond rights-based, law-expansionist freedom, I feel a deep commitment to the collective, to arm-and-arm freedom and bold reimaginings of what that may look like based on the branches of our predecessors.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n                                \n                            </div>\n                        \n

HoSang and his TFs were very passionate about these issues, and their energy and positivity influenced the rest of the class in a way that few other lectures or courses have been able to do for me. The only weaknesses I can pinpoint are that the readings tended to be on the longer side, which was an obstacle to student engagement with them, but since they were each so important, I wish we were able to engage with them for a longer period of time or make them more manageable. Second, there was a spotlight on black communities and especially black women in the class, which was super important and eye-opening, but I wish that we could have spent the same amount of time discussing issues and theory as they related to other minority communities in America, especially Indigenous, Latino/a, and AAPI communities.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow41_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20159&amp;evaluatorId=1591748&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=dwh39&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1591748</span>\n                        1591748\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1591748</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: Professor HoSang was an amazing lecturer.

The readings were also very interesting  I especially found interesting Killing the Black Body by Dorothy Roberts.

Even if you don&#39;t agree with Professor HoSang, I think you will respect him and understand what he is arguing -- coming from somebody who is often dismissive of leftist ideas I find to be poorly thought through, nothing Professor HoSang says is poorly thought through. Yale is lucky to have Professor HoSang and you should absolutely hear whatever he has to say.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow60_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20159&amp;evaluatorId=1598412&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=dwh39&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1598412</span>\n                        1598412\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1598412</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Absolutely.
