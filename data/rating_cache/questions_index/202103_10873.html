To that end, the PSETs were usually on the shorter side (usually ~1-3 hours) and the readings, though a bit long, were definitely manageable. The exams were on the harder side, but out of three midterms the lowest is dropped, and that helps a lot. Also, the TAs were very helpful and (mostly) chill.\r\nThat said, the administration of the class could definitely have been better. The class could be very qualitative at times, and I think knowing that more at the onset would have been nice. Additionally, the way that exams were handled throughout the class was not always the best. The first exam was remote, and when the staff found out that people cheated (shocking!), it almost seemed like they took it out on the rest of us.  The next two exams were in person and more difficult, which I personally didn&#39;t have an issue with (although one was scheduled on Diwali and that wasn&#39;t great), but the *remote* final exam was cancelled (probably due to that initial cheating), and we were forced to either take our current grade or take an ABX and the final in spring. That felt very unfair, especially because final grade distributions were not calculated yet.\r\nAll of that said, I think this was a valuable class and I am very glad to have taken it.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow13_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10873&amp;evaluatorId=1529183&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=sbh5&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1529183</span>\n                        1529183\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1529183</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course facilitated an unwelcoming environment in many ways.

Organic chemistry demands full attention from its students, and the truth is that this isn&#39;t feasible at 9 am. Students will do better in the class with an incentive to come to class and waking up early is a deterrent, not an incentive. Not everyone loves organic chemistry itself, and that should be accommodated and not punished. The professor lectures well but only by keeping up with the textbook readings will students learn the course material. That must be made clear. An oversight of a student is a lost opportunity. Weaknesses come from the approach and rigor of the class. A class that demands a lot is not organized well and flawed. I think the course could take a different approach -- a philosophy of instilling discipline in students in order to succeed. You need to encourage students now so that they feel prepared, rather than warn only of the difficulties ahead (i.e. organic chemistry being a cumulative course). This is why the TFs are a great strength. I learn more from review sessions than lectures because of the practice problems that were given and the simplicity of the TFs&#39; explanations. Their patience and passion for organic chemistry is admirable and inspiring. The TF handouts are great resources and provides good practice for exams. Posting answer keys for some of the handouts would be helpful so that we don&#39;t have to email with every question.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow24_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10873&amp;evaluatorId=1535196&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=sbh5&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1535196</span>\n                        1535196\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1535196</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The material of the course was interesting, but very difficult and thus the way that the material was taught was in my opinion, not sufficient.

Even if you study for hours and hours and feel like you have a solid grasp on the concepts, you can leave the exam feeling like you failed miserably. It seemed like the TAs and professors tried to think of the trickiest, most difficult questions to put on the tests. Some of the TAs seemed to enjoy watching students struggle during exams. During the second midterm, they pointed and laughed while flipping through each exam that was handed in and denied to answer questions during the exam even if the questions were completely within reason.

The system of assessments as also bad. Achieve was fine for some basic practice, but problem sets were badly run as they were both too short and we were forced to do them in a group which is not how many people work. They also completely consumed every discussion section so instead of having a chance to ask questions we only worked on a short worksheet. These worksheets would have been better as discussion section practice with additional assignments outside of class that we could receive feedback on, even if they were just book questions. There was an absence of instructor provided practice which made it unclear what we needed to know; the GAs supplied everything and that was not completely their job.

The worst part was that the midterms were written by TAs. The second midterm contained material that was covered in the week AFTER the exam, which was completely ridiculous. We were explicitly told that some material would not be on any of the exams, but then it was. There was also a lot of content that was not covered in lecture then dropped on us in an optional review session a few days before the exam, which was then a significant part of the exam. It was overall incredibly difficult to study for any of the exams, as it was unclear what would/wouldn&#39;t be on it. Another big issue was that the syllabus explicitly stated that all the midterms + finals would be take home exams and then they were all switched to in person after the first one. In addition to all this, there seemed to be a lack of communication between the professor/preceptor/TAs. We were told conflicting information about exams; it was unclear whether or not the take home one was open notes.

They also worked fairly hard to create and distribute handouts that went more in-depth on material presented in-class and material that was more reminiscent to what would be tested on exams. \r\nWeaknesses: This class was highly disorganized, from the student perspective. It seemed like no one was ever on the same page about anything (as was evident starting from the first exam, when conflicting information about whether the exam was open/closed note was propagated widely throughout the class and not ever clearly-addressed by the preceptor or the instructor until the day of the exam). I found the problem sets to be too short, which I consider a weakness since it meant that not all important material from class was addressed on them. There was never any build-up in difficulty in terms of problems we were given (not enough material was given for us to properly build intuition on the types of questions that we would be faced with on exams).

A solid working understanding from lecture and assigned material was not enough to get an A. Some of the TAs (I honestly don&#39;t even know their names) would make fun of students behind their backs after they turned in tests (i.e. flipping through and laughing at students&#39; tests when they submitted them) or assume that things that were not yet taught were common knowledge. I did not feel like I could talk to someone about my mistakes without being judged or made fun of. Weekly problem sets plus online Achieve homework sets resulted in about two problem sets a week.

The content is interesting. The peer tutors are excellent. Mechanisms are interesting and I can appreciate the idea of developing a vocabulary to discuss organic chemistry--that organic chemistry is a language to be learnt gradually. However, I think many of the ways the class was actually run were counter-productive and it often felt like communication was inconsistent. (I will go in depth into my thoughts on classroom procedures but I want to say that some of these are based on my understanding of what was occurring behind the scenes, if I am wrong about any of this, I do not necessarily retract my point because clearly there is some disconnect but I would amend my point).\r\n\r\nFirst and most importantly, it was my understanding that TAs wrote each midterm and that it wasn&#39;t always the same TA writing the midterm. This made the midterms feel uneven and it can make it harder to prepare for each one when what is prioritized/how the questions are framed changes on each midterm. It also becomes a weakness when some TAs make the midterms much harder than others. For example, midterm 1 was fairly doable and I felt prepared for it. Midterm 2 included a question that it seemed many students in the class struggled with because we had never gone through a mechanism on that scale before. Simply having one person write every exam would alleviate some of this (again--if I am mistaken and the exam writers were consistent then I withdraw this point).\r\nSecond, at some points it didn&#39;t feel like the teaching staff were &quot;on our side&quot; so to speak. It felt like sometimes TAs enjoyed the anxiety midterms caused--with one laughing at students as they struggled during a particularly difficult question. Students also received an email about how the results of the second midterm reflected some lack of effort on the part of some students. This was extremely disheartening to read and I know several students talked to the TA about how this email was discouraging rather than the intended matter of fact but encouraging. The person who sent the email then proceeded to double down in an in-class lecture the following week. I know this person did not mean to be discouraging either time. But this cannot be how students are talked to after a difficult midterm. It does not make us more likely to seek the help we need. I&#39;m an adult, you can speak to me matter-of-factly and I&#39;ll deal with it. But I don&#39;t think that makes the learning environment feel particularly welcoming. I&#39;ll get over it but I shouldn&#39;t have to.\r\nThirdly--and I know future students will hate me for this-- PSets were a weakness. I don&#39;t think we should turn in one problem set per group, I think each person turning in a PSet even if we work on them in groups would work better. I know that turning in one PSet per group allowed me to shirk responsibility--I would fully complete one question and attempt the rest. But if I couldn&#39;t do it, no worries, another member of my group would attend peer tutoring hours and figure it out. But also, it often felt that PSets were overly complicated. There was one PSet question that my TA confessed to our section that he didn&#39;t know how to do until he looked at the answer key. I appreciate the idea of making the PSets more complicated than the exams but I think the PSets should still be doable.\r\n\r\nOverall, the teaching staff should consider what success in organic chemistry looks like. Are they teaching the people who learned some organic chemistry in high school? Because those are likely the people earning above a 100 on the exams. Or, are they focusing on us in the middle, with little to no prior exposure to the subject, the people who want to succeed but maybe don&#39;t know how? Those are the people who are earning average grades and maybe (initially) look like they&#39;re not putting in much effort. And regardless of who they decide to focus on, how do they talk to students? Do they sound aggravated in emails or are they welcoming?</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow42_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10873&amp;evaluatorId=1546384&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=sbh5&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1546384</span>\n                        1546384\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1546384</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course had great content that is essential to understanding the basics in organic chemistry.

Also, lecture moved at an incredibly fast pace; we would cover tons of material and concepts in a very short amount of time and not in-depth enough to truly understand things. All of my learning in this class came from the textbook and office hours (shoutout to the TAs and peer tutors!)</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow56_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10873&amp;evaluatorId=1553959&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=sbh5&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1553959</span>\n                        1553959\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1553959</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I&#39;m honestly really disappointed by the teaching of this class.

The weaknesses of the class was Professor Herzonn&#39;s live lectures this fall and the exams. I stopped going to lecture after October and just watched the lectures from the spring and I thought he did so much better of a job of explaining concepts in a way that was easily digestable. This probably had to do a lot with my own learning style, as it was nice to be able to pause and rewind and turn on captions so I could get a more engaging lecture experience. The textbook readings were great in supplementing  the lecture and the Achieve work was really great practice. Great practice for reviewing lecture but not really for preparing us for the exams. All of the past exams from the last few years were released and the exams that were given this year was just undeniably more difficult. I won&#39;t complain too much because in the end they weren&#39;t impossible and did make me think deeper about the concepts and probably improved my understanding overall, but it was just annoying in principle.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow60_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10873&amp;evaluatorId=1556184&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=sbh5&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1556184</span>\n                        1556184\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1556184</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Instructor never came to class or showed up late - very unorganized.

Switching to CHEM 220 (same content, but technically a sophomore class) was the best choice I made: Prof. Herzon prepares his lectures very thoroughly, explains every concept to its fullest extent, is always available after class for questions, and fosters a great class environment. The class is bigger than CHEM 174 (about 1.5x I think), but it doesn&#39;t hinder your learning- all of that depends on how much you want to communicate with professors/TAs etc. The latter are also incredible for CHEM 220- the content is very conceptually challenging at times, but TAs create great synthesis not-esheets about every topic for students which help a lot. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it is a difficult course with a lot of content and mechanisms to learn. What you&#39;ll find though, if you put time into understanding the foundations of the chemistry at the start of the semester, is that everything makes logical sense and you can eventually develop a problem-solving as opposed to memorization mindset.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow44_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10873&amp;evaluatorId=1547877&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=sbh5&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1547877</span>\n                        1547877\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1547877</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>If they are interested in the class, then yes I would.

It&#39;s kind of sad because I actually enjoyed the semester of organic chemistry that I took in high school, but the teaching and organization of this course was really not great. I think in theory, the organization of class makes a lot of sense - psets every week, etc. However, the way that Professor Herzon taught was so ineffective that I, and a lot of other students, often thought that going to lecture wasn&#39;t even worth it. All of us defaulted to the internet and the book when studying for examinations.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow56_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10873&amp;evaluatorId=1555354&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=sbh5&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1555354</span>\n                        1555354\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1555354</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student! That said, if you&#39;re not a STEM major that is required to take it, or a premed student who needs to take it, a lot of the work might not be worth it. The workload was never too much, but it definitely required a good amount of individual work to keep up with the fast-paced learning. Overall, it&#39;s a pretty solid intro orgo course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow57_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10873&amp;evaluatorId=1555405&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=sbh5&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1555405</span>\n                        1555405\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1555405</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes I thought it was interesting</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow58_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10873&amp;evaluatorId=1555800&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=sbh5&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1555800</span>\n                        1555800\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1555800</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Most people probably do not have a choice to take this class, but in the end its not really that bad.
