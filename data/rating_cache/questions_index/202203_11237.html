By taking this course in a flipped-classroom style, I gained independence in learning the material and doing practice problems in class.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow17_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1619651&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1619651</span>\n                        1619651\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1619651</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Lots and lots of molecular orbital theory, reactions of alkenes and alkynes, synthesis, etc. Exactly what you&#39;d expect from an organic chemistry class.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow18_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1619717&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1619717</span>\n                        1619717\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1619717</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned a lot about organic mechanisms and synthesis.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow19_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1620254&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1620254</span>\n                        1620254\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1620254</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>l learn a lot of topics associated with organic chemistry, as well as how to study for a chemistry exam.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow20_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1620476&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1620476</span>\n                        1620476\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1620476</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Intermolecular interactions, reaction mechanisms, stereochemistry, and putting together mechanisms in synthesis problems.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow21_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1620563&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1620563</span>\n                        1620563\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1620563</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Arrow pushing, mechanisms, and some other cool stuff.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow22_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1620630&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1620630</span>\n                        1620630\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1620630</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Through teaching myself, I have learned much about organic chemistry.

What guidance we did receive came from the TA&#39;s who were all really supportive and helpful. However, in general we had to fend for ourselves. Thus I had to learn quickly how to teach myself organic chemistry without anyone&#39;s help.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, I also developed my skills in synthesis reactions, and how to chain together many small reactions together into an overall process to get the product I desire. I found this part fun since it is like a logic puzzle. Again, I had to teach this all to myself (I am stressing this point because I and many others find it absurd that we are paying thousands of dollars to go to Yale and be told to teach ourselves the material).</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow77_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1624405&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624405</span>\n                        1624405\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624405</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned much about the foundations of Organic Chemistry and its use in our daily life.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow78_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1624483&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624483</span>\n                        1624483\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624483</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned organic mechanisms and organic reactions.

The homework was about 60-100 problems on achieve a week. I think this was flawed because they online so they didn&#39;t prepare us for the paper tests or give us practice drawing out organic structures, and because there were way too many of them to put in quality work on each problem. I think a classic paper PSET would be more effective in this class. 10 ish hard problems that we can go to tutoring for and work on is more tangible, better prep for mid terms, and more quality over quantity. \r\n\r\nThe flipped classroom model was done poorly. If Tim really wants to stick with it I highly recommend video lectures or guided problem sets instead of just outsourcing students to a very dense textbook. It is not realistic and not what we are paying for quite honestly! We are missing out from a very interesting lecture. Also, the combination of being expected to learn the material through a textbook and then do 60-100 problems a week is just not a successful recipe and will result in cutting corners.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow14_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1615381&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1615381</span>\n                        1615381\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1615381</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: offered extra credit\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: flipped learning style method (code for not having to actually teach us himself), numerous Achieve problems that were due thrice a week</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow15_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1616699&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1616699</span>\n                        1616699\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1616699</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course is flipped, which means that the professor will not teach.

There was heavy emphasis on learning mechanisms and applying molecular orbital theory which made predicting reactions easy rather than just memorizing a bunch of different reactions. I found the content to be very interesting and there were definitely moments in class that really fascinated me. Personally, I think the flipped classroom worked well for my learning style since I tend to learn better from reading rather than watching lectures. The TFs were always very helpful. It was pretty easy to get help since there were study halls pretty much every other day held by the TFs and peer tutors.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The flipped classroom format is definitely not for everyone and it definitely ends up being a lot of work. I felt like I had to read both the required and suggested textbooks to keep up. I felt pretty ambivalent about the group problems on the test. I think they are ok as long as everyone in the group gets to submit their own answer and as long as it isn&#39;t worth more than 10% of the total exam score. \r\n\r\nAlso the organization of the course could be somewhat confusing and it was often unclear what exactly was on the exam or how they would be graded. Professor Newhouse would lecture, but as far as I could understand Dr. Clark was in charge of all the graded aspects of the course (including writing/grading the exams) and there was often miscommunication or mixed messages about what we needed to know.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow20_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1618979&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1618979</span>\n                        1618979\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1618979</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I really hope they scrap the flipped class model for future versions of this course.

Myself and many others found that most times, the TFs and Dr Clark did a better job at teaching/explaining concepts than Tim.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow24_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1619294&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1619294</span>\n                        1619294\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1619294</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>i did not like the flipped class. organic chemistry is difficult to teach yourself. a lot of the textbook material and achieve material did not align well with what we did in class. i consider the workload very high because we had to spend so much time outside of class trying to teach ourselves the material</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow25_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1619472&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1619472</span>\n                        1619472\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1619472</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>strengths: By the end of the course I feel that I had a relatively deep understanding of the foundational organic chemistry concepts \r\nweaknesses: the flipped classroom format was difficult, especially at the beginning of the semester when the topics of organic chemistry were unfamiliar to us</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow26_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1619629&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1619629</span>\n                        1619629\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1619629</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>One of the most infamously difficult classes being flipped-classroom posed a challenge, since there was a lot of uncertainty about my knowledge of key concepts at times.

A strength of the course was discussion section, where I was generally able to reinforce key concepts taught in class, albeit a week later. I also thought some of the homework was not really relevant at times, and there wasn&#39;t adequate preparation for the ACS exam portion of the final.

I understand the intention behind it, but it just really doesn&#39;t work for this class. These concepts are so difficult to learn to begin with, and we are supposed to teach them to ourselves? The lectures often just made me even more confused than the book had because the professor expected that you&#39;d been able to grasp the concepts from the book already and proceeded to build upon them, rather than reviewing them. You were pretty much screwed if you hadn&#39;t had time to do the reading for that lecture yet. I want to be taught by my professor, not by my textbook. The textbook should be for reinforcement of, not introduction to, concepts. In addition, the homework assigned for each lecture was due BEFORE that lecture. If you were confused on something, you had to just guess your way through it because you hadn&#39;t actually been taught it yet. Again, I really do understand the intention behind flipped classroom, but it just does not work for this class and only makes the students feel stranded.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow28_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1619717&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1619717</span>\n                        1619717\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1619717</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course was ambitious but not unreasonable in what was covered.

Although I understand that it is meant to increase engagement in lectures and student retention of material, it fails to do that. I think flipped classroom is highly effective when professors provide students with materials to study outside of class that are comprehensive but also comprehensible (such as recorded lectures or videos). Having students read the textbook as their primary form of instruction is not an effective method of introducing the material. The textbook chapters are convoluted and include extra information that is not required for the course (yet, it is difficult for students to identify this as it is their first experience with the material). Most students do not retain information well from a 50-page textbook chapter that they have to get through quickly. Then, students are left confused in lecture because the textbook has not prepared them to suddenly attempt challenging problems, while Professor Newhouse attempts to teach by example, which does not establish a solid foundation of knowledge for students. I think having a lecture-based course with a thorough and challenging PSet would give students as much exposure to the material (since we really did only get through about 5 problems per lecture) while actually promoting the retention of information and having students learn the material well. I think Professor Newhouse and Dr. Clark are both great instructors, but I had a lot of problems with how the course was structured and designed.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow41_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1623920&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1623920</span>\n                        1623920\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1623920</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think the flipped format works great, and I got a lot out of doing challenging practice problems in class.

I think the flipped class method is overly ambitious considering that as Yale students we are extremely busy and have to balance the work of at least 3 other classes and extra curriculars, jobs if you aren&#39;t fully funded by your parents too. The amount of self-teaching that has to happen in this class in order to do remotely okay in the course is genuinely unacceptable and it honestly makes the professor, Tim, seem lazy. I would also say that even though Achieve is helpful for practicing general concepts, it is ultimately unhelpful for preparing for our exams as the question styles are different and Achieve oversimplifies concepts in addition to asking the same exact question multiple times between homework sets and problem sets as opposed to the same type of question so that you see a variety of starting materials/reagents. I would also say the amount of homework that we were getting from Achieve, while meant to be a supplement to the readings and serve as additional practice, was kind of ridiculous because -- rather than trying to actually learn something, I spent so much of my time getting answers from friends and looking up the answers online to get through our 40 question psets and 3 homework assignments in a timely fashion. I felt like I was wasting my time in lecture and that the lecture slides proved to be wholly un-useful as well.  So, to improve, I would suggest actually teaching in class, being realistic about how much reading can get done in a week, and shortening the Achieve assignments so that more time can actually be devoted to it. Regarding the length of the reading assignments -- I heard from several sources that we ended up learning the first month and a half of OChem 2, that should not be the case ever. It makes sense too, because I felt like my learning was being rushed the entire semester.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow50_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1623932&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1623932</span>\n                        1623932\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1623932</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think the TAs were awesome.

In general, I feel the biggest complaint for the course was the &quot;flipped classroom&quot; structure and although I get what it was trying to accomplish, I also would say it is one of this course&#39;s greatest weaknesses. Organic chemistry is notorious for being one of the harder pre-med courses so I didn&#39;t understand why the flipped classroom was chosen to teach the course. Personally, I skipped more than half of all the lectures because I couldn&#39;t keep up with the content so it ended up being a total disaster. However, if you keep up with the content the lectures were very helpful but it is hard to do so when you have long achieve homework assignments (usually 17-40 questions two to three times per week and when you have upwards of 20 pages to read per lecture). Although well intended, I would suggest teaching the content in depth first (still keeping MO in mind) so that discussion section could do the job of the &quot;flipped classroom&quot; (practice problems, examples, etc.).</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow52_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1623937&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1623937</span>\n                        1623937\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1623937</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I surprisingly liked doing more active learning in class; it certainly made the time go faster.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow53_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1623940&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1623940</span>\n                        1623940\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1623940</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The strengths of the course were the tutoring opportunities available and the chances we got to improve our grades and knowledge. \r\n\r\nA weakness of the course was having to do a substantial amount of self-teaching.

In class, we focused on doing practice problems, which defeated the purpose of having discussion sections, since we would also spend those doing more problems. If we had a traditional lecture, it would have been much more efficient because we could focus on learning what was expected of us and then use the discussion to practice. Flipped classroom was a poor way of learning. We were told that it would help for exams by not having to cram, but what ended up happening is that we had no practice problems for the exam, leaving us with very few resources to study with.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow70_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1623977&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1623977</span>\n                        1623977\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1623977</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I really appreciated all the TFs and Peer tutors that held lots of office hours to help me improve my skills.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow71_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1623979&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1623979</span>\n                        1623979\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1623979</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths are that the TAs were really great.

Overall, there was a lot of support for students through office hours and study halls. A weakness of this course is that it is taught at 9 am on science hill, which is brutal for a lot of students to go to. On top of this the structure of the class worked best if more students went to lecture. The combination of these two things just really was not pretty and I don&#39;t think any class that actually wants students to show up should be scheduled at this time especially all the way up on science hill. Also, since the time slot is an hour and 15 minutes, I think they could keep the &quot;flipped classroom&quot; aspect of the course while also including more of a lecture-esque style maybe towards the start of class, or at least an overview of the content students were supposed to learn before class. This way the practice problems done in class will make more sense coming after a brief overview, and the lecturer can make sure we are learning the material in a way that emphasizes the most important takeaways and prepares us for exams.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow75_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1624003&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624003</span>\n                        1624003\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624003</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths were I learned a lot.

I found it very difficult to keep up with the material and often fell behind and was left confused in lecture. I personally was only able to actually learn the course material by attending discussion sections every week. In addition, the assignments that we were required to do before coming to class didn&#39;t really help me understand what was going on in lecture.

The flipped classroom model was ineffective; it would be much more effective to be taught principles of organic chemistry than to come into class without much of a conceptual understanding and learn every concept through youtube or organic chemistry websites. The professor was clearly not engaged with the class; the burden of the class&#39;s logistics (grading, making exams, teaching support) fell onto the course preceptor and the TF team; in fact, he was in Hawaii during our final exam. And despite the flipped classroom model&#39;s requirement to self-study, the amount of homework problems on Achieve could be an overload. 20-30 questions were due every 2 days, with a 45+ question PSET due on Fridays. With other classes, studying for the class AND completing homework assignments of that quantity was overwhelming and forced many students to prioritize completion of the Achieve questions without conceptually understanding concepts. Not to mention, the Achieve questions didn&#39;t test the same conceptual understanding as exams, and the professor explicitly told us to ignore Achieve questions during exam preparation. \r\n\r\nThe pacing of this class was also too rapid; concepts were learned in haste, and there were often periods between when exam content finished in lecture and exams themselves that would be filled with new content that wasn&#39;t learned. Exams were difficult and felt punitive. Lastly, the professor&#39;s emphasis on molecular orbital theory felt unnecessary; rather than clarifying concepts, it often obfuscated them. It was also difficult to find resources about MO theory independently considering most organic chemistry classes nationally do not utilize the MO framework.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow84_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1624084&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624084</span>\n                        1624084\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624084</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Great teachers.

I also thought a lot of the collaborative aspects of the course were very well done, as it made it easy to make friends and understand concepts by both talking about them with others and learning in a group setting.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow93_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1624209&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624209</span>\n                        1624209\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624209</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This exam should not be a flipped classroom, but the rest of the teaching and support was fantastic.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow94_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1624222&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624222</span>\n                        1624222\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624222</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Weakness = flipped classroom</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow95_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1624244&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624244</span>\n                        1624244\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624244</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: because the topics were very challenging you learned a lot.

It was taught as a flipped classroom, which is a fancy way of saying that the teacher assigns us work and we have to teach ourselves before the deadline. The very first class was spent trying to present us &quot;statistics&quot; about the success of a flipped classroom, but upon careful inspection all the data presented was faulty and biased towards the teacher&#39;s point of view (i.e. that flipped classrooms are good). I tried to be in lecture every day, but I always ended up getting nothing out of it because lecture time was spent by watching the professor draw molecules and sort of aimlessly talk about how to solve the problems. By the end of the course, only a small fraction of the total number of students actually showed up (the class was in Marsh hall, the biggest lecture hall available, and it was packed on the first day, but by the end, the hall was mostly empty). To compensate for the minimal lectures, the professor assigned an unreasonable amount of work: every single day there was something to do, and the assignments could take hours depending on how fast you are at solving the problems. Overall, I learned nothing from lectures, and got all my knowledge of organic chemistry by doing problems and learning tricks there, talking with friends, and by going to websites like Khan Academy, chem.libretexts.org, and others, which I could have done without going to Yale and spending thousands of dollars on my education.\r\n\r\nThe one good thing about the course were the TA&#39;s. When the professor did not teach anything, the TA&#39;s came through and put effort into their discussion sections. They always made clear and straightforward lectures and slides with supplementary problems that were simple and captured the important concepts. They were also always there for discussion via email if needed. Anything I did not learn from my own efforts, I learned from them. Those TA&#39;s deserve recognition for their excellent work this semester, especially given the poor overall organization of the class.\r\n\r\nI am saying all this in such strong words as a sign of respect. I believe the professors and the university should know how students truly feel so that positive changes can be made for everyone&#39;s benefit.

They did this even though we did not cover the complete books or all the topics in the sections related to the books.\r\n\r\nWorkload is insane. there were weeks were we had 5 assignments, and some going up to 60 problems each. I will not lie to the reader, if you want to succeed, a big part of organic chemistry with Newhouse will involve googling most of your psets and learning with YouTube.

As an international student, I sometimes question myself why I came to the US if I could have download the textbook and read it myself at home.\r\n\r\nStrenghts: The teaching assistants are a great resource, and most of them are available to help you understand.

I believe that the flipped classroom style can be successful, but not in this way. Flipped classroom is successful when the students are given structured materials to learn from, like pre-recorded video lectures or worksheets. On the other hand, when expected to navigate entire chapters to read during the little time in between lectures and basically self-teach, many students get lost and are completely confused when asked to do a problem in the given lecture time. Additionally, the lectures themselves were confusing and used terminology that many students didnt quite understand yet, and many of my peers and I were left extremely discouraged after every lecture. I believe that organic chemistry should not be an extremely intimidating course and should instead be an opportunity to learn and challenge oneself, but the way this course was taught did not foster this positive environment.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow111_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1624827&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624827</span>\n                        1624827\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624827</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The strengths of this class is the conceptual aspect of the class.

A lot of my peers and I felt we never adequately learned the content outside of class and thus were unable to learn in class, which assumed knowledge that would traditionally be delivered in lecture. But even if the instructors feel the instructors feel wedded to the flipped classroom approach (which is understandable because it&#39;s a cool idea), there is a lot they can do to make sure they aren&#39;t leaving so many students to fend for themselves. \r\nFirst, the out-of-class work shouldn&#39;t consist solely of readings. Most STEM classes already assign pre-class reading, and it is understood that students need to see content again in class (in an audiovisual, as opposed to textual, way) to fully understand it. Math 120 uses a flipped classroom, and we watched lectures the instructor made before coming to class each day. But there were no pre-class lectures in Organic Chemistry this semester, so it was like we were trying to teach ourselves the content instead of learning from someone who I&#39;m sure would be a great lecturer.\r\nSecond, the instructors should make the Klein textbook required and the Loudon textbook optional (instead of the reverse). The Klein textbook made so much more sense and was so much better for looking at content for the first time. Instead, a lot of students never learned that they should use the Klein textbook simply because they weren&#39;t friends with the right people.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow126_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1629427&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1629427</span>\n                        1629427\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1629427</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The weakness of this course was the lack of instruction from the lecturer- Timothy Newhouse. His theory on &quot;backwards learning&quot; sounded great in theory, but we were rarely provided resources outside of the textbook that matched what we would be assessed on. The homework on Achieve rarely lined up with what was being discussed in class or in the reading. Learning about MO theory, a huge basis of this class, is something I have found to be quite helpful in doing organic chemistry. However, it was rarely mentioned in the textbook and barely exists in online resources. This would have been fine if we were provided a strong foundation of MO theory in lectures. However, this was not the case.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow127_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1635483&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1635483</span>\n                        1635483\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1635483</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I believe this course has no notable strengths and that anything positive is severely outweighed by how horrific this class was. \r\n\r\nThis course is obviously meant to be challenging but the way it was structured and run meant that everything was made more complicated than it had to be and students spent hours a week doing busy work (online Achieve problem sets that Tim himself said were not useful for our tests).\r\n\r\nAs bad as this class is, it really wouldn&#39;t take much to improve it. All this LECTURE course needs is LECTURING. Class periods are solely devoted to problem-solving which is difficult to do without having a strong grasp of the concepts (which can be hard to achieve merely from a textbook). If teaching ourselves organic chemistry simply through a textbook and online videos were really the best way to learn, I think we would have forfeited typical class structures a long time ago. \r\n\r\nOrganic chemistry cannot be self taught. At least not in any sort of efficient fashion. I really don&#39;t know what I paid for. Tim placed a very unfair burden on the TAs who had to explain virtually everything. \r\n\r\nIf you need to take orgo, DO NOT do it with Tim. I have heard that other professors make this course bearable.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow128_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1635609&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1635609</span>\n                        1635609\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1635609</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The weakness is that learning is likely not universal because level of engagement, success, and leaning is dependent on how much he student puts into the class and engages with their instructor and Teaching Fellow.

The difficult part of the class in knowing how exactly to draw the structures, knowing which this go where, and how the different structures are visualized, change, and are described. If you are not a big fan of gen chem because of the math, Orgo will be much easier to learn since there absolutely no math. My biggest piece of advice would be to do a lotttt of practice problems. Do as many retrosynthesis/synthesis practice problems with your friends and soon enough you&#39;ll know all the reactions you need to know along with their reagents, regiochemistry, and stereochemistry.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow45_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1623940&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1623940</span>\n                        1623940\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1623940</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would recommend this course to another student if it is a requirement.

If one is capable of learning independently, then this class is very manageable.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow114_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11237&amp;evaluatorId=1636672&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=trn2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1636672</span>\n                        1636672\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1636672</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>If you&#39;re reading this, it&#39;s because you have to take this course and you&#39;re scared of how bad it&#39;s gonna be.
