This contrasts with the problem sets, where the actual learning takes place, but is loosely touched upon in lecture often after the problem set is actually submitted.

It was annoying because Prof. Piskac would always be like its for you to learn yourself, but it was really just her excuse for not teaching us the appropriate content. Also, the timing of the lectures and the psets was so off  the pset specs were super long and you spent a lot of time reading them and learned new material (ex. how the shell worked), and then a week later it would be covered in class, but by then it was pretty ineffective because the pset was already due. If they shifted the psets back a week, we would actually understand what we were doing before we started working on them/struggling to read the spec. tl;dr the class was very poorly organized and we could have gained the same knowledge with less work if they had organized it a little better from the start.\r\n\r\nStrengths: I guess ultimately I did end up learning all the content because I had to figure it out myself for the two exams, and now I understand how my computer works a little more than before.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow26_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11093&amp;evaluatorId=1543187&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=rp476&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1543187</span>\n                        1543187\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1543187</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>It could be split up into two courses?

This leaves you to self figure out many of the concepts whether it be through peers, self-study, or TAs. Then when you went to class you already knew all the topics because you had to learn them to do the pset that was already due. In general, I wish that the material was shifted to be taught 5-7 days earlier to actually aid in homework assignments which count for 60-80% of the grade. Also, if you start psets early, it&#39;s often a pain because when you go to Office Hours the TAs are not yet well versed in the pset and a lot of time is often wasted and it makes me question whether it was even worth my time to start early.

Otherwise confusions arise and some people feel like they have been forgotten by the TA.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow34_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11093&amp;evaluatorId=1548804&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=rp476&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1548804</span>\n                        1548804\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1548804</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>logistics were a bit disorganized</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow35_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11093&amp;evaluatorId=1548906&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=rp476&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1548906</span>\n                        1548906\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1548906</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Good course content lectures could better align with psets</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow36_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11093&amp;evaluatorId=1552504&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=rp476&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1552504</span>\n                        1552504\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1552504</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The strengths were the help from TFs and TAs and the few lectures that Jay taught.

Some of this cant be avoided because the concepts and programming can be confusing or difficult, and you have to work through it to come out as a better programmer on the other side. I genuinely feel like the projects gave me a better understanding of CS principles and made me a more confident, competent programmer. I also appreciated learning and getting really good at C, because it makes learning and understanding other languages way easier. However, with 5 projects, (each taking 20+ hours to compete), 2 exams, and a final project, this class felt like a huge amount of work, and my stress often detracted from my ability to fully understand or appreciate what I was doing in the moment. One suggestion I might have is to actually split 323 into a 2-term course. People take lighter course loads during the semester they take 323 anyways, because its at least double the amount of time that other courses take in most cases. Splitting the course into 2 terms might make the time management better and actually give students more time to appreciate and enjoy what theyre learning, which Im afraid is overshadowed by stress in the current iteration of 323. Another solution may be to eliminate exams and find another (less stressful) way to test theory, like weekly canvas quizzes that are lower stakes.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow40_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11093&amp;evaluatorId=1555451&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=rp476&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1555451</span>\n                        1555451\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1555451</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: OS and systems architecture are important topics, and I&#39;m glad I have an introduction to them.

Professor Ruzica is a kind professor that cares about what how her students are doing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there was not always alignment of project topics/knowledge required to do the project and the topics of lectures. There were two instances were a project was due, and then the next lecture, we finally got to talking about fundamental ideas that would have helped in understanding or completing the project. I still give Professor Ruzica and team credit for taking on the giant task of learning the curriculum and teaching 323 after the late Professor Eisenstat passed away last year.

Psets were much longer than necessary, building in extra steps and parts that did not add much to our learning but instead ate time.

The psets additionally get worse as time went on (especially with WeensyOS), going from achievable on one&#39;s own to ones that almost require TA help. This is discouraging and hurts our ability to learn on our own terms. Additionally, the fact that it took months for us to get our grades back when an autograder is used is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe content is clearly important to really understanding the rest of CS...but there has to be a rethinking of how the course is structured and what work is involved.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow44_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11093&amp;evaluatorId=1556404&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=rp476&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1556404</span>\n                        1556404\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1556404</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: Ruzica!

Otherwise, I would spare yourself the time and effort because it is only applicable to certain fields. This class is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Although the course is grueling, the material is genuinely interesting. You will learn so many new things about computer and feel so accomplished by the end of this. Here I am going to write what I wish I saw reading other people&#39;s course table reviews to ease your stress a little. I came into the first day of class literally trembling and feeling uneasy due to the reputation this class has, but now that I am at the end of it, it is truly truly not that bad. While building your class schedule for the semester, take into account that this class will consume most of your time. PSETS will take about 40-50 hours to complete, but you have two weeks which is more than ample time. My best piece of advice is to start right away and GO TO THE **IN PERSON** ULA HELP SESSIONS. ULAs are some of the most amazing people on this planet and they make this class wayyyyy easier than it would be doing it on your own. My strategy with 323 PSETS was spending the entire weekend after the assignment was assigned working on the PSET and attending every ULA session available... I would always end up completing the assignment by next Monday with an entire week and a half left before the due date. Also, the Professors and TAs are beyond flexible, so talk to them!! They will address your needs and be more than reasonable with giving extensions, etc. Also, don&#39;t worry about the grade, I promise you will get the grade you want if you complete every assignment in the class and do fine on the exams. At the start of the course Professor Piskac said that only one student in the history of Yale CS completed this course and didn&#39;t major in CS. So keep that in mind. Stay on top of everything, don&#39;t let time get away from you, and you just might actually enjoy the class like I did.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow4_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11093&amp;evaluatorId=1521620&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=rp476&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1521620</span>\n                        1521620\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1521620</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Absolutely, course is important to computer science overall, and it teaches you lower level concepts that many cs majors usually ignore altogether, which shouldn&#39;t be the case.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow5_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11093&amp;evaluatorId=1522000&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=rp476&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1522000</span>\n                        1522000\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1522000</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Not if you don&#39;t have to take it.

Frankly, this class likely does not yield much practical knowledge for the majority of CS majors, and is instead taken simply because it&#39;s a requirement. The main skill development from this is just from the practice of doing a substantial amount of coding and debugging, which improves your overall problem solving abilities and coding independence, but this could also be obtained by doing similar volumes of work on projects with applications with real-world relevance which you can actually have something at the end to market to others, instead of spending over a hundred hours working on problem sets and the final project that are difficult to present to others.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow10_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11093&amp;evaluatorId=1531409&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=rp476&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1531409</span>\n                        1531409\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1531409</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Only if you have to for the CS major.

You will learn a lot about computer architecture and system programming by taking this class. Unfortunately, this does not imply that the class is well-organized and well-taught, merely that you will have to learn a lot about those topics to complete the projects and exams, whether through class material or not. To be fair, I thought Professor Piskac was a very engaging and knowledgeable lecturer, and always did the best she could (and beyond!) to breakdown the material for us. But I don&#39;t understand why the department picked a professor interested in higher level software development and verification to teach a class that is so heavily about hardware and low-level programming. The fact that she, like us, were trying to learn the material had its advantages, sure, but as Professor Piskac herself often admitted, she&#39;s not the most best person to ask questions about systems and hardware stuff, which is what this class is about. I want to make clear that I really, really appreciate the job Professor Piskac has done for us, but I don&#39;t understand why the CS department asked her to teach this class, given that her specialty is so different from the course material. Is the department this underfunded?\r\n\r\nAnd seriously, this class needs to be better organized. The quizzes almost always contain a good number of questions about topics we haven&#39;t gotten to in class, and the TF&#39;s don&#39;t seem to know what we are supposed to have learned. The projects don&#39;t match the lecture material -- we designed payload headers for malloc in project 2 at the beginning of the semester, and it&#39;s covered in lecture the week before finals? Professor Piskac uploads a lot of very useful material to Canvas, but someone needs to be curating and organizing the files: many files are repetitive or unnecessary. So yes, take the class to learn about systems programming, but know that it is far from perfect.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow18_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11093&amp;evaluatorId=1537616&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=rp476&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1537616</span>\n                        1537616\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1537616</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Only if you want to get a CS major but it is a really interesting and important class to take if you do.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow19_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11093&amp;evaluatorId=1538467&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=rp476&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1538467</span>\n                        1538467\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1538467</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>For students pursuing the certificate, I highly recommend it.

If you&#39;re not a CS major, take this class if you want to learn how computers work and are willing to put in the time to it. The class as it was taught this semester was honestly not taught super well. Ruzica is not quite a systems expert as Stan and Abishek are and it reflects in how she teaches. I felt like a lot of the lecture material was not super well explained and a lot of time was wasted, leading to certain topics being overcovered and others undercovered. By the latter half of the semester, I began to mostly read the class notes and slides instead of watching lectures. Jay is decent but he only had a few lectures to shine and wasted a good amount of time ie. I remember. a 75 minute lecture that could&#39;ve been condensed down into 15 minutes. Richard has been leading the PSET portion of the class now for a while yet the spec is still often confusing as well as some of his walkthroughs (thinking of his explanation of the expansion stack for PSET 1). However, the material that is covered is indubitably integral to any Computer Science major and thus I am glad I was forced to bash my head against the wall to learn this material that I certainly wouldnt be motivated by myself to learn, mostly through the PSETS. The things I learned. Programming wise: how to build a comprehensive C program from scratch (PSET 1: TeX editor) as well as chunky C programs with an existing code base (PSET 2: DMalloc, PSET 4: Bash, FINAL: Malloc). This class had a lot of code to read, much of which was very difficult to do due to the sheer number of lines and confusion surrounding towards what it aimed to accomplish (thinking of PSET 2: obj2exec, PSET 3: Binary Bomb, and PSET 5: Virtual Memory Allocator) but an argument can be made that this is very much like what a SWE job will be like. I feel like the main two focuses of the semester were on operating systems (role of the kernel, processes, the fork-exec model) and memory (virtual vs physical memory, memory organization, memory debuggers, and malloc) with some related concepts sprinkled in such as handling of data types and assembly code.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow21_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11093&amp;evaluatorId=1539076&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=rp476&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1539076</span>\n                        1539076\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1539076</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>dat shid hurted.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow22_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11093&amp;evaluatorId=1539209&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=rp476&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1539209</span>\n                        1539209\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1539209</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>For CS majors, take this early since you need to take this anyway and so that you have an understanding of computer systems.\r\nFor non-CS majors, taking this high workload course is probably not worth it.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow23_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11093&amp;evaluatorId=1539331&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=rp476&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1539331</span>\n                        1539331\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1539331</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I&#39;m really not sure why you would take this if you aren&#39;t a CS major and don&#39;t need the requirement.

The experience roughly 150 classmates and I just had would&#39;ve been a fantastic three-month intensive program where we went on leave to master the essentials of professional programming. However, as a Yale course, it was simply too much. This isn&#39;t the fault of the course staff: in fact, Ruzica is the nicest, most supportive teacher I&#39;ve ever had. But no one is above this course - not the professor, not the TAs, not the ULAs, and most certainly not the students. It&#39;s hard to strive for the same success as in other classes when everyone on all levels suffers through it. The ghost of the late, great Stan Eisenstat is ever apparent in this class: having been his for decades, he uniquely knew how to make it (borderline) manageable as a course. This model worked with his brand of teaching, but it needs to be reworked substantially now that the class is taught in a more traditional way. That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean making it any easier (though on behalf of future students I hope so), but the content needs to come before the projects involving them and while I greatly appreciated how liberal they were with extensions, there should&#39;ve also been more guidance during the projects because one-on-one time with ULAs was hard to come by due to the high demand. In the end, I don&#39;t plan to major in CS (even though I did very well in 201 and 223) and gave absolutely everything I had in this class, yet it found new ways to break me every single time I sat down to do work. 323 taught me there&#39;s a limit to how much I like programming and how much I can tolerate pain. To all aspiring CS or joint-CS majors preparing to take this class: godspeed, it&#39;ll be a wild ride but you&#39;ll make it out on the other side with probably a lower GPA but also new knowledge, new friends, and a whole lot of relief that it&#39;s over.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow45_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11093&amp;evaluatorId=1556483&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=rp476&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1556483</span>\n                        1556483\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1556483</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n                                \n                            </div>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </main>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div id="yale-footer-bottom" class="no-print" role="contentinfo">\n    <footer role="contentinfo" class="yale-footer">\n        <div class="footer-logo row">\n            <div class="column small-4 large-3 columns">\n                <a class="y-icons y-yale y-mark" href="http://www.yale.edu/"><span class="show-for-sr">Yale\n                </span></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class="small-8 large-9 columns">\n                <p class="copyright spacer" style="font-size: .8rem;">\n                    Copyright &copy; <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear())</script> Yale University <span aria-hidden="true">&middot;</span> All rights reserved <span aria-hidden="true">&middot;</span>\n                    <a title="Yale Privacy policy" href="http://www.yale.edu/privacy.html" style="text-decoration: underline">Privacy policy</a>\n                    <span aria-hidden="true">-</span>\n                    <a href="https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility/accessibility-yale" style="text-decoration: underline">Accessibility at Yale</a>\n                    \n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </footer>\n</div>\n\n\n<script type="text/javascript" src="/ocedashboard/assets/app-64ec30218e4e8f6eca224a18684e4884.js" ></script>\n<script type="text/javascript" src="/ocedashboard/assets/jquery-ui.min-b0ba1d1ac5ef9706219d68b4ecfcd5b3.js" ></script>\n<script type="text/javascript" src="/ocedashboard/assets/jquery.multiselect-a52ab3a5ee20a1f9138c469e94241a1a.js" ></script>\n\n<script>\n    $(window).bind("load", function () {\n        var footer = $("#yale-footer-bottom");\n        var pos = footer.position();\n        var height = $(window).height();\n        height = height - pos.top;\n        height = height - footer.height();\n        if (height > 0) {\n            footer.css({\n                \'margin-top\': height + \'px\'\n            });\n        }\n    });\n    function loadingMessage() {\n        $("body").css("cursor", "progress");\n        $("#loadingMessage").show();\n    }\n    function clearLoadingMessage() {\n        $("body").css("cursor", "default");\n        $("#loadingMessage").hide();\n    }\n\n</script>\n<script>\n\n\n    (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\'GoogleAnalyticsObject\']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n            (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n        m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n    })(window,document,\'script\',\'https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\',\'ga\');\n\n    ga(\'create\', \'UA-100715343-1\', \'auto\');\n    ga(\'send\', \'pageview\');\n\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n'
