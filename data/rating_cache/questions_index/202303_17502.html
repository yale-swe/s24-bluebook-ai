The Professor is also too ambitious, trying to cover too much in a single course. For example, he tries to teach R (which he really shouldn&#39;t) but has no idea how to.

Readings were well designed to reinforce class material, although my favorites were when readings included research papers or case study specific books such as the Stearns reading on the DRC civil war  in those cases I really felt as if the readings complemented the lectures rather than merely acting as repetitious content.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow22_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17502&amp;evaluatorId=1712821&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=jcs266&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1712821</span>\n                        1712821\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1712821</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned about international security, theories of war, and different types of peacekeeping and intervention measures.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow23_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17502&amp;evaluatorId=1712842&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=jcs266&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1712842</span>\n                        1712842\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1712842</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Knowledge about how international security issues arise and how they can be contended with.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow24_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17502&amp;evaluatorId=1713318&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=jcs266&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1713318</span>\n                        1713318\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1713318</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>How to approach global peace building and understanding why we (humanity on whole) resort to violence.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow25_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17502&amp;evaluatorId=1716256&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=jcs266&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1716256</span>\n                        1716256\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1716256</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Familiarized myself with a framework to look at how and why international crises/events occur, previously I basically just saw each individual international event as separate and tried to think of reasons as to why/how it happened, but in this class we learned about a structure to view it and also some intricacies between different types of crises: genocide vs. war, international hierarchy vs. realist lens, nuclear weapons and democratic peace, etc. Also tried a little bit with data analysis and learning &quot;R&quot; as the coding language, but that wasn&#39;t entirely successful.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow26_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17502&amp;evaluatorId=1720661&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=jcs266&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1720661</span>\n                        1720661\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1720661</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Overall survey knowledge of security plans.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow27_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17502&amp;evaluatorId=1722893&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=jcs266&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1722893</span>\n                        1722893\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1722893</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned so much about the causes of war and how to apply that framework to current situations in international relations.

Also, the readings were super long, and often, I felt, did not really add anything to my learning experience.

The course is also an arguably less rigorous (or at best equivalent) version of PLSC 111: Intro to International Relations.

There are three main categories of weaknesses: the curriculum, the course&#39;s structure, and the instruction. Regarding the curriculum, the issue is that the course is extraordinarily surface-level, focusing almost entirely on broad and general claims about international relations and very few thorough explorations of an example from history or modern-day situation (I don&#39;t think that there was a single case study or example that we discussed for more than 10-15 minutes).  The net result of this is that I struggle to think of a single useful or actionable insight I gained that would help me in any future work in international relations. The course is also poorly structured: meeting for three lectures plus a discussion section each week felt like way too much of this class, and the discussion sections never felt like they had a clear purpose. Finally, regarding the instruction: while I think that most of the issues with this class stem from the curriculum set by the department, I do think that the lectures themselves tried to accomplish too much without going sufficiently in-depth into any one topic. For example, instead of trying to explain a broad theory, discuss several examples, and understand several articles in one 50-minute lecture, it would have been much more helpful to do one (or maybe two) of those things. Additionally, especially in the first half of the semester, the course felt overly dependent on the main book we were reading. Using the readings can be helpful for organization, but it really felt like there wasn&#39;t anything from lecture that I couldn&#39;t have gotten by just reading the book. Overall, the course did not feel valuable or particularly enjoyable.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow5_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17502&amp;evaluatorId=1700984&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jcs266&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1700984</span>\n                        1700984\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1700984</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: very organized, geared towards students and student learning, received good feedback on papers, plenty of office hours, student feedback was implemented throughout the semester, professor obviously cares so much about the students and content\r\nWeaknesses: poor communication regarding grading standards or expectations for exams</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow6_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17502&amp;evaluatorId=1701460&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jcs266&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1701460</span>\n                        1701460\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1701460</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>A strength of this course is that Professor Sundquist brings in interesting guest speakers.

However, for a course that meets three times per week plus a required discussion section (in addition to the other amounts of work given), this amount of reading is hard to get through. Several speakers were brought to class, and I did find these talks very interesting.\r\n\r\nA glaring issue I have with this course is the amount of work and time that is expected for one credit (and for a required class that many are not interested in). As mentioned above, the course meets three times per week, has a required discussion section, has quizzes on the readings on Fridays, two 4-page-minimum reading responses, a data visualization project (even though there is 0 coding instruction in the course) and the instructor has mentioned adding PSets to that load, as well. Frankly, I wasn&#39;t interested enough in the class to feel that this amount of work was justified, and I did not feel the workload actually contributed to my learning. In many cases, the workload made me feel I was spread too thin and that I couldn&#39;t do any of the assignments well.\r\n\r\nThe deeper issue I had in this course was a weird disconnect between teaching, readings, and evaluations. Almost all evaluations (quizzes/reading responses/midterm and final) require an intense understanding of all of the readings to actually do well. I feel the instruction we received in class did not contribute to my understanding of those readings (as ought to be required if your evaluations are based on readings) but rather focused on illustrative examples and broad summaries which, though interesting and sometimes helpful, did not actually align with what we were then being evaluated on.\r\n\r\nI would end with a note on grading in the course: several classmates along with myself felt that it was often unfair, focused on understanding of the reading beyond what could be expected with the amount of readings we were assigned, and that the teaching team was not interested in giving us better grades for marked improvement that incorporates comments from earlier assignments. This was demotivating for myself and for many of my classmates and decreased my investment in the course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow17_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17502&amp;evaluatorId=1708857&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jcs266&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1708857</span>\n                        1708857\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1708857</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: You get to learn some basic IR theories.

This course requires mandatory section attendance, mandatory quizzes on Friday mornings at 9, essays, midterm, final, and kid you not, a coding assignment which is clearly beyond the Professor&#39;s teaching ability. Most of my peers and I both feel that we don&#39;t receive enough positive feedback and support from the instructor or the TAs.

He is very knowledge and intentional about the structure of the course, the information covered, and the student experience, so he is extremely open to working with students one on one to ensure their success. The course material itself is broad and a comprehensive overview of all aspects of conflict. It incorporates theory and quantitative information in easy-to-digest units which makes the content very straightforward. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Feedback on assignments isn&#39;t always the clearest, and it&#39;s hard to know exactly what kind of answers they&#39;re looking for on exams or reading responses. The feedback we received on reading responses specifically felt a bit nit-picky and less substantial. More explanation on these fronts would be extremely helpful. I think the course could have benefited from a more general introduction to IR theory in the beginning to make sure everyone was on the same page and had the same language to discuss the case studies. Additionally, lecture could be made more engaging by asking students questions or incorporating small discussion periods. I wish there was more of a conclusion to the end where we are challenged to synthesize the information learned across the course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow19_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17502&amp;evaluatorId=1708958&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jcs266&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1708958</span>\n                        1708958\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1708958</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This class is certainly well-intentioned, but in practice, it is poorly executed. Sundquist is a nice person who means well. However, it is odd that the Jackson School would place an instructor with no security background in this role. The course puts aside grand theory  not only in security but pedagogically. As a result, students are left with the jumble of half-baked ideas that is Glbl 275  one of my least favorite classes Ive taken. \r\n\r\nThe lectures were simply not engaging. Sundquists reliance on attendance quizzes indicates that he understands this. The concepts presented in the lecture are extremely simple. Most lectures could be summarized in under five minutes. As a student with an interest in Security, I am usually extremely engaged in any course dealing with Security. However, by the fourth week of class, I struggled to make myself attend. There simply was no benefit to be gained from large portions of lectures. \r\n\r\nSundquist chose to lead all sections himself. Oftentimes, Sundquist was overly ambitious when choosing section topics. Frequently, wed end a section having started an activity that could take the whole section in the last five minutes. Discussion sections, as implied by the name, are primarily intended to be spaces to discuss the material, contrived activities took up a majority of section time. \r\n\r\n\tThe readings for this course were poorly chosen. For a supposedly foundational course, we read very few foundational texts. For example, we only read 1 chapter of Mearshiemers Tragedy of Great Power Politics. While Mearsheimer is certainly an extremely controversial figure in IR, its odd (and indicative of bigger issues) that we were not critiquing his work. In fact, Mearsheimer is the only IR scholar on Sundquists entire syllabus who was named in the last TRIP survey (a survey of IR academics) as a top influential IR scholar in the past 20 years. Nuno Montieros syllabus had seven of these scholars. Instead of engaging with seminal texts, Sundquist chose to ground large parts of the course in Christopher Blattmans new book, Why We Fight. Blattman is not a security expert, and, to put it bluntly, the books intended audience does not appear to be academia, making it an odd choice. \r\n\r\nAssignments: The exams for this class need some attention. I understand the necessity for exams in this kind of lecture course. However, these exams did not require serious thought but rather encouraged rote applications of buzzwords. Notably, rubrics explicitly penalized students for going beyond this. To succeed on the exam one must simply take every theory that Sundquist favored as scientific fact.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow20_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17502&amp;evaluatorId=1709089&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jcs266&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1709089</span>\n                        1709089\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1709089</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Course is not organized particularly well and lectures feel disconnected from one another</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow21_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17502&amp;evaluatorId=1709118&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jcs266&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1709118</span>\n                        1709118\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1709118</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I  really enjoyed the sections being taught by the professor instead of the TFs.

For example, I wouldve loved to spend more time looking at the academic papers and critiquing the correlations or conclusions the authors drew, and its implications on what we learnt  for example the data analysis part couldve been more specific to a conclusion that we all had to draw, and been more rigorous.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow26_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17502&amp;evaluatorId=1712821&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jcs266&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1712821</span>\n                        1712821\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1712821</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: The course assignments are clear and pretty straight forward - the exams are quite easy.

Super approachable and really wants to get to know his students. Relatively light workload, and since the class is still finding its role/structure and with a new professor, the assignments can sometimes be altered as the semester goes along. Compared to some other GLBL classes, I think this one actually delves a little bit into international relations theory, rather than just learning about current events. Also invited practitioners from Yale&#39;s World Fellows Program to help us see get more &quot;insider&quot; knowledge of how international groups work, and another strength was also a Friday section presentation led by one of our TAs Jason Hug (who is ex-military), and it was incredibly insightful to see everything from a military perspective. It isn&#39;t totally there yet, but sort of like a hybrid, definitely something I envisioned more from a GLBL class as opposed to a class like GLBL101 Gateway to Global Affairs, per se. \r\nWeaknesses: Because it just got a new professor, and has been having a higher turnover rate for some time now, the class is still struggling to find its place in the GLBL major, structure is not yet fully designed or agreed upon yet either, and because it has a relatively new professor, the students will be sort of learning along with the professor about what works and what doesn&#39;t. Additionally, in terms of content, it doesn&#39;t feel like I learned anything super extraordinary That being said, it&#39;s not a &quot;terrible&quot; thing, rather just a natural consequence of it being a relatively newer class and new professor. With time, I think these weaknesses will be smoothed out a bit.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow30_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17502&amp;evaluatorId=1720661&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jcs266&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1720661</span>\n                        1720661\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1720661</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>can see the professor cared, but sometimes difficult to stay engaged.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow31_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17502&amp;evaluatorId=1722893&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jcs266&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1722893</span>\n                        1722893\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1722893</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The main strength was how dedicated Prof Sundquist was!

Having the class three times a week early in the morning with an additional mandatory discussion section means you will be going to this course four times a week, necessarily rendering the course load to feel heavier than it should. Lectures felt scattered and not entirely useful to the ultimate goal of the curriculum. If you are a Global Affairs major and have to take this, I would recommend skipping Intro to IR because this course essentially repeats the content and readings such that it is so repetitive you will be bored. Jackson needs to fine tune this course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow33_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17502&amp;evaluatorId=1723859&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jcs266&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1723859</span>\n                        1723859\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1723859</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Not a great class to be honest, but he tries.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow34_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17502&amp;evaluatorId=1724091&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=jcs266&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1724091</span>\n                        1724091\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1724091</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course could have spent less time on bargaining theory at the beginning of the semester.

If this class is MWF with section and exams instead of essays, keep a wide berth. Professor Sundquist also took section over, so I had almost no interaction with &quot;my&quot; TA (I&#39;m not even sure who it was). This class caused an undue amount of stress for being an approaches/survey course, and I would not recommend it whatsoever. For some reason, this class was also a magnet for the worst kinds of global affairs majors, and somehow the same 6 people would speak 3 times each in lecture.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow4_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17502&amp;evaluatorId=1700772&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=jcs266&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1700772</span>\n                        1700772\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1700772</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course is not so bad or unbearable that it should make you decide not to major in Global Affairs - but don&#39;t go into the class expecting that it&#39;s going to be a favorite, or that you&#39;re going to learn much that&#39;s valuable for a future in international relations.

I think Professor Sundquist gets a lot of heat from some students for his quirky personality but he is a very nice person who is obviously very passionate about teaching. The workload for the class consisted of two response papers, weekly quiz (which were basically reading checks and only a few sentences) an in class midterm and final. The workload was very much doable and nothing that I really had to stress over during the semester. \r\n\r\nThe worst thing about this class by far was the fact that it met three times a week in the morning and the one class you could not miss was the Friday morning one (because of the weekly quiz).</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow18_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=17502&amp;evaluatorId=1708857&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=jcs266&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1708857</span>\n                        1708857\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1708857</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No. Absolutely not.

More importantly, James is utterly unqualified to be teaching this core class and it shows. His slides look like a middle schooler made them and the class felt like a mediocre middle school social studies class. The lectures were neither a mile deep nor a mile wide, they were just a mess. They were incredibly disorganized, with random examples/anecdotes unrelated to the topic and takeaways that barely scratched the surface of the topic. I don&#39;t think James really knows much about international security. I did not gain anything from the semester other than a massive headache of having to deal with a class that took up so much time.
