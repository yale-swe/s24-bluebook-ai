Her lectures are just an hour and fifteen minutes of her info dumping at an unreasonable speed, but she did make some minor adjustments (like adding page numbers to the slides) that helped to offset the consequences of the fast pace of her lectures. The few grades you get in the class are incredibly high stakes and do not set you up to properly absorb the material. At the end of the day, this is a traditional lecture. It&#39;s unfortunate because Dr. Kober knows what she&#39;s talking about and the content is incredibly interesting, but the educational pedagogy underlying the execution of the course leaves a lot to be desired. There are a few incredibly easy adjustments that can be made for this course to make it more engaging in the future, however. For one thing, allowing for the self-tests to be retaken as many times as needed to get 100% would encourage students to master the material. It would also be helpful if the self-tests had been on a consistent schedule, rather than being randomly announced and being given a small window of time to complete them. Giving a full 24 hours at the minimum to complete the self-tests would have been helpful. In general, having more opportunities to receive grades in the course that could boost your grade rather than praying for the curve to serve you well on the three exams you do would have made this course less stressful. One of the major successes of the course was the fact that the exams are uniquely structured to allow students to select which questions they want to answer from the question pool provided. Another thing that would have been helpful is if she would have left up the text-heavy slides longer than she would the slides that were filled more with pictures or less text to allow for students to catch up on the content they missed.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow28_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=23722&amp;evaluatorId=1670456&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=hk354&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1670456</span>\n                        1670456\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1670456</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths:\r\nReally interesting lectures and material.

Even though it is advertised as not requiring previous knowledge, it is very science-based and will be challenging. I do think that another improvement would be removing either the paper or a test. Currently, the course has many examinations, and it makes it challenging to study for the final while also working on the final paper. I also think that if a notecard was allowed on the exam, this would be very helpful and place a higher emphasis on the understanding material rather than memorizing specifics about certain drugs.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow34_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=23722&amp;evaluatorId=1676056&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=hk354&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1676056</span>\n                        1676056\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1676056</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Not a beginner neuroscience class, LOTS of new material to know after every class and professor talks very fast and does not provide slides before class</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow35_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=23722&amp;evaluatorId=1676059&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=hk354&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1676059</span>\n                        1676059\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1676059</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>One of the main strengths of the course is that even though its an intro class meant for non majors, it still gives you a ton of information and knowledge that you will apply to your life.

The material moves really quickly -- probably too quickly honestly -- and I struggled to study for tests because there&#39;s so much material it can be a bit overwhelming. Also the final paper, while meant to be a grade booster, just forced me to spend a few unnecessary hours during reading week when I could have been studying instead or doing work on more important assignments during reading week. I would have preferred a few problem sets over the course of the semester to 1. avoid having an essay and 2. so that each test mattered less (and so that I was forced to think about / review the material before the tests, which had so so much material on them). I feel like this class is farmed as an intro or accessible course when it&#39;s really not -- you&#39;ll probably end up enjoying the class since the material is really interesting, but you should be prepared to really grind or Cr/D it (which a lot of my friends did) if the tests don&#39;t go so well.

I think the expectations could have been much clearer. Even if the content we were being tested on could not have been shared, it would have been helpful to know the format of the exams beforehand. I also know that there were concerns about sending out lecture slides before the class, but it would have been helpful if the handouts that were sent out for 3 classes were more consistent so we could have a better frame of reference for what we were going over in class.  I also would have appreciated getting the prompt for the final essay a bit sooner than reading week when it was due, because there are many other assignments due at this time and not knowing what the expectations were made it difficult to plan ahead. While we were told that the paper would be simple/not take much time, different people have different strengths, workloads, and experience with this type of assignment and the lack of time couple with the assurance that the lack of time was fine, did not seem to acknowledge these differences. Also the lack of consistency with when/how self tests were administered made them less helpful than they could have been, especially because they died off by the middle of the semester, which meant they weren&#39;t as helpful for preparing for tests as I assumed they would be.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n                                \n

Unfortunately, several ended up either dropping the course or opting for a credit/d/fail option.\r\n\r\nThe administrative aspect of the course has been a significant source of stress. While the professor advocates for a learning-centered approach, emphasizing that grades are not paramount, the course structure seems to contradict this philosophy. The frequency of quizzes and exams, in conjunction with the requirement to write a paper and complete creative assignments, suggests a high-stakes, grade-focused environment. This disparity has created a sense of ambiguity and insecurity among the students.\r\n\r\nCompounding this issue is the seemingly arbitrary nature of how certain elements of the course are managed. For instance, a set of quizzes was abruptly removed from the syllabus without a clear explanation, and the feedback on our work is often delayed or vague. This lack of clarity has led to confusion and heightened anxiety about performance and expectations.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the classroom environment, both in-person and online, has occasionally felt uncomfortable due to certain behaviors exhibited by the professor. Instances in which the professor singles out students, requesting them to be quiet with the assertion that &quot;other students can hear them,&quot; have created tension, especially when the targeted students were not noticeably disruptive. Such experiences have unfortunately led to a sense of intimidation, deterring some of us from active participation despite our interest in the course material.\r\n\r\nA disproportionate amount of time is spent on &quot;questions&quot; slides than actual content slides. When questioned about her teaching methodology, the professor tends to respond defensively rather than taking it as constructive feedback. \r\n\r\nOn a brighter note, the Teaching Fellows as well as the professor hold many office hours to facilitate student learning.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow9_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=23722&amp;evaluatorId=1657355&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=hk354&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1657355</span>\n                        1657355\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1657355</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would reccommend if you find the lecture material interesting, however it is a lot of work when preparing for the exams so be able to manage that!</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow10_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=23722&amp;evaluatorId=1658409&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=hk354&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1658409</span>\n                        1658409\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1658409</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>NO NO NO!!! Do NOT take this class unless you are a neuroscience major. It is the farthest thing from a gut and really misrepresented on the syllabus. This is not at all an introductory class and without prior neuroscience knowledge, it will be incredibly difficult to keep up. The professor speaks so quickly in lecture and barely explains anything yet refuses to post the recordings so you only have her kinda confusing slides to study off of. Everything up until the first mid term is pure neuroscience and even after that, you only learn about drugs in the context of neuroscience which is so much less interesting than you would expect. I am not actually walking out of this class with a better understanding of if I should or should not take certain drugs, I know only know what neurotransmitters and receptors each drug affects. Her exams are so ridiculous, and she asks the most niche, specific questions of all time. It is an extraordinary amount of content you are supposed to know for each exam (most people&#39;s study guides were 40+ pages). You also don&#39;t even have weekly psets or homework which (surprisingly) I really wish we had. The only work outside of the three exams is a paper due during reading week (so yes you have a paper and final during finals) and you also never get to see your graded exams unless you want to wait in office hours to see it on her computer. There is no way to check your comprehension of the content week by week and it&#39;s super easy to fall behind. Moreover, you have no practice to really go off when studying for exams. She doesn&#39;t post past finals and only released practice questions for the midterms (she didn&#39;t even post any for the final) at like 6pm the night before. Your only way to study is memorizing her 100 slides per lecture.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow11_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=23722&amp;evaluatorId=1658592&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=hk354&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1658592</span>\n                        1658592\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1658592</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes!

However, I think it can be difficult. Usually workload is very low, but the exams require a fair amount of preparation. The TF review sessions were not helpful, there were study questions, but without answers, and study materials were not uploaded until a day or two before the exams. Professor Kober also speaks very quickly, so sometimes it was hard to get all the notes down, especially since sometimes the slides don&#39;t include all the information she says. However, there is a supposedly generous curve, and the content was pretty easy to memorize once you had it. I recommend the course if you don&#39;t have a difficult workload otherwise, especially if you already have some background in neuroscience.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow14_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=23722&amp;evaluatorId=1661165&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=hk354&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1661165</span>\n                        1661165\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1661165</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I&#39;m not sure I would.

Its just a lot to memorize and put together, but you can get a sense of what will be on the tests with the practice questions and not be blindsided by anything. Unlike challenging Econ or math tests, there wont be a question that you just stare at and have no idea how to start. It was a different way of using my brain and I really enjoyed the change up. Its just a ton of memorizing. I studied a ton for the first test; probably 12-15 hours of focused time, and did well. \r\n\r\nThe first 3 or so weeks of the class I was super overwhelmed with new content; genuinely 30-40% of the words said in lecture referred to parts of the brain I had never heard before and systems I didnt know existed. I walked out of every one of the first few lectures super lost. It got better as I reviewed more outside of class and as the semester went on. Its not a gut, but I was taking five courses and genuinely enjoyed this class a lot.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow28_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=23722&amp;evaluatorId=1672449&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=hk354&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1672449</span>\n                        1672449\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1672449</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would recommend this course to any student who has an interest in the neurobiology/science of drugs, and who isn&#39;t afraid of denser lectures with science-heavy terminology.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow29_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=23722&amp;evaluatorId=1672920&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=hk354&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1672920</span>\n                        1672920\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1672920</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No, unless you are good at memorizing small, specific details or are passionate about neuroscience</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow30_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202301&amp;crn=23722&amp;evaluatorId=1673030&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=hk354&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1673030</span>\n                        1673030\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1673030</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, if you want to invest a lot of your time into learning interesting things about drugs.

I actually enjoyed studying for the exams because I liked the content, but if this class doesnt interest you, studying would kind of suck. Dont take this class unless youre prepared to show up to lecture and pay attention, because lecture recordings arent shared with the class and Hedy talks so quickly that she sounds normal in half speed on playback.
