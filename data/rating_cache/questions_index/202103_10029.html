That being said I still thought it was a cool project and enjoyed doing outside research to contextualize my subject&#39;s specific life experiences.

The midterm required us to know the dates of various terms used throughout the lectures, but it was difficult to study for the test because the lectures jumped around a bit chronologically as we discussed different topics like immigration, economic exclusion, family formation, popular culture, etc. Secondly, I think we could have spent more time talking about modern-day issues. Thirdly, some of the essay prompts could have used more clarification. For example, it was difficult to understand what an &quot;argument&quot; looks like in the context of oral history. Also, I completed all of the requirements on the prompt for the midterm essay, but I got points taken off because I wasn&#39;t detailed enough. Also, the final essay asked us to connect five things (historical, cultural, social significance, and themes of migration and community formation) and I was confused what that was supposed to look like. I would have appreciated more clear and simple prompts for papers and/or examples for how to do what is asked of us.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow18_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10029&amp;evaluatorId=1539333&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ml374&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1539333</span>\n                        1539333\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1539333</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I wish there were recorded lectures!

This wasn&#39;t a problem for me since I usually came to class (and her lecturing is quite engaging) but I could see how one might appreciate these.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow21_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10029&amp;evaluatorId=1542766&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ml374&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1542766</span>\n                        1542766\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1542766</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course was extremely engaging and interesting at every lecture.

It was fascinating to learn about the role that Asians and Asian Americans have played in U.S. history and their unique position. \r\n\r\nThere were a lot more essays in this course than I expected to write. The take home exam, for example, is actually an essay. It seemed unnecessary and too much work to assign a ten page oral history and then a week later assign a final essay as the take home exam. I feel like a creative assignment would have been more engaging and rewarding. Also, the readings could be shortened and be more focused. Sometimes we were assigned to read an entire book every week.

I also think a more comparative and relational framework would have been useful. For example, we learned almost none about the history of Latinx immigration and while this was an Asian American History course, learning Asian American immigration without at least a brief understanding the broader scope of immigration felt incomplete.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow28_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10029&amp;evaluatorId=1547084&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ml374&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1547084</span>\n                        1547084\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1547084</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Very well organized, well taught, Prof. Lui is amazing</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow29_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10029&amp;evaluatorId=1547086&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ml374&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1547086</span>\n                        1547086\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1547086</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: very engaging and interesting\r\nWeaknesses: too east asian centric</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow30_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10029&amp;evaluatorId=1547095&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ml374&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1547095</span>\n                        1547095\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1547095</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The class was great.

Furthermore, although I was really interested in many of the readings, there were simply too many to really be fully engaged in each and every one of them.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow39_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10029&amp;evaluatorId=1547149&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ml374&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1547149</span>\n                        1547149\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1547149</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Perhaps more aids better ways to review past lectures and tie them together.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow40_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10029&amp;evaluatorId=1547153&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ml374&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1547153</span>\n                        1547153\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1547153</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The strengths of this class are the lectures, unit themes, and the reading selections.

While the class was taught in chronological order with regard to the historical record, the topics that were highlighted in a given week were always excellent and gave students the opportunity to learn a diverse history while being able to make connections to previous units. The reading selections were excellent as well, presenting both first-person narrative accounts of specific events or life histories, as well as presenting overall history. The only point for improvement for this course would be to spend some time guiding students through forming historical analyses. For students who do not have previous experience with history courses, the coursework for this class could prove challenging without that foundation.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow41_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10029&amp;evaluatorId=1547160&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ml374&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1547160</span>\n                        1547160\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1547160</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Loved the lectures</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow42_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10029&amp;evaluatorId=1547189&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ml374&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1547189</span>\n                        1547189\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1547189</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Sections could be more engaging; conversations often seemed repetitive</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow43_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10029&amp;evaluatorId=1547191&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ml374&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1547191</span>\n                        1547191\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1547191</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course workload was pretty heavy for me.

For weaknesses, people in section weren&#39;t always very engaged, which was frustrating and made it sometimes feel pointless to be there.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow58_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10029&amp;evaluatorId=1547679&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ml374&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1547679</span>\n                        1547679\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1547679</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: professor is very knowledgeable and passionate, my TF was amazing (the best TF I have had so far!), assignments (although not always easy) are really fun to do and make you really engage with the course material, and the broad themes were connected to real experiences and people which helped understand them historically. This has been my favorite history course at Yale. \r\nWeaknesses: none; TFs and professor are always willing to help, go over your grades/assignments with you, and everyone is more than willing to understand circumstances and obstacles you may be facing, so just communicate with them.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow59_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10029&amp;evaluatorId=1549572&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ml374&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1549572</span>\n                        1549572\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1549572</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This is an amazing and in-depth look into Asian American history, especially East Asian in origin.

Professor Lui covers so much Asian American history and so many different aspects of it as well -- different Asian populations, laws, representation in media, etc.\r\nWeaknesses: There was too much work. We had a midterm paper and an in-class midterm and a project paper and a final paper, but all of these assignments were not necessary. The assignments should be combined to just be one midterm and one final project -- we didn&#39;t need the extras. We could have demonstrated understanding of the material in fewer assignments. This course was also a bit East Asian-centric and Southeast Asian-centric. I definitely understand that she can only cover so much material in a semester so she has to choose what to include, but I think it would have been great to include more in variety.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow61_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10029&amp;evaluatorId=1552621&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ml374&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1552621</span>\n                        1552621\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1552621</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The subject matter and the lectures are pretty good. For how broad the course hopes to be, the sheer volume of primary source readings make it a frustratingly inaccessible to engage while entertaining any other coursework. The workload is assigned as if it is the only course a student should be taking (approx. 350-400 pages of dense reading per week, two midterms, and two final assessments). While insisting that students should not come to class if they feel ill, there is no infrastructure in place to make that easy. The professor refuses to share lecture notes and doesn&#39;t share lecture slides (because they &quot;wouldn&#39;t be helpful&quot;). The volume of material covered in each lecture makes it difficult to fit any review content in the lectures, so if one has a legitimate inability to come to class they are immediately behind.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow62_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10029&amp;evaluatorId=1552896&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ml374&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1552896</span>\n                        1552896\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1552896</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I thought that the course was accessible across disciplines and that the general themes were valid. However, there are a few qualms that I had with the course. In terms of course structure, I felt that there were far too many readings and assignments/assessments with surface level expectations of how deeply we understood the content. Lectures provided a broad overview of the history during a certain time period, and sections were intended for discussing the readings. And yet, the readings were so disparate and plentiful that we rarely discussed them in depth and I often left section not feeling as though there was a concrete piece I had learned. In terms of assessments, the midterm exam felt like a memorization assessment rather than a genuine reflection of our learning. And the final take-home &quot;exam&quot; was really a 6-8 page essay that we were expected to complete in a few days, with a prompt that unrealistically asked us to both analyze primary sources and provide a general argument about Asian American history across several decades within the suggested page amount.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow63_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10029&amp;evaluatorId=1553259&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ml374&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1553259</span>\n                        1553259\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1553259</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course was really interesting and Dr. Lui is a fantastic lecturer.

However, the workload made this class unbearable. I&#39;m sorry, but for a class that most people are taking as an extra class out of interest or passion for the subject, the amount of readings and back to back exams/assignments made this class difficult to appreciate.

The oral history project at the end was a bunch of work, but I really enjoyed interviewing my uncle and hearing his story. \r\n\r\nTL;DR of the course: the US is a gatekeeping nation, where Asians have been excluded from immigration, citizenship, economic life, and social life. And when Asians make gains, it&#39;s usually because of convenience for White America (eg. in 1943, the Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed and Chinese Americans gained the right to become naturalized citizens because the US needed to keep China as an ally during WWII).</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow19_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10029&amp;evaluatorId=1539333&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ml374&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1539333</span>\n                        1539333\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1539333</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes!

This is the kind of class that you go to Yale for. Professor Lui and the TAs do an amazing job situating the history of Asian Americans among both domestic and national contexts. I generally don&#39;t pay attention to lectures in other classes, but Professor Lui is a very engaging storyteller, interrogating assumptions about Asian Americans and encouraging us to craft our own narratives. The assignments, such as the oral history and primary source analysis, developed my skills as a historian and allowed me to tie in my personal histories with the greater themes of the course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow21_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10029&amp;evaluatorId=1542766&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ml374&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1542766</span>\n                        1542766\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1542766</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course is a must take for every Asian American student and everyone interested in Asian American history.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow22_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10029&amp;evaluatorId=1544120&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ml374&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1544120</span>\n                        1544120\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1544120</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes!

Asian Americans have been through a lot, like every other non-white group in America.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow56_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10029&amp;evaluatorId=1552621&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ml374&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1552621</span>\n                        1552621\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1552621</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Not for a grade.
