While the first week was useful in familiarizing students with the common lab practices, everything onwards felt like it could be ascertained from a 2-page reading. The EP&#39;s took hours of work and were mostly just copying and paraphrasing portions of SDSs, instructor videos, and handouts. Plus, the material on the quizzes was not covered in lab and not fully explored in the readings or review questions. This lead many classmates to cheat on the take-home quizzes and inadvertently punished students who didn&#39;t. Overall, the main problem is that this class has a disproportionately heavy workload for the material--something that discourages many non-STEM students from exploring the diverse course offerings outside their major.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow13_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11246&amp;evaluatorId=1613706&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1613706</span>\n                        1613706\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1613706</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: the first few labs focused on practicing various techniques, which was extremely useful before starting synthesis labs.

The profs and TAs are also really nice, helpful, smart, and friendly people who are great teachers.\r\nWeaknesses: the grading of this class was too formatting-oriented and it often felt like points were mostly deducted for aesthetics rather than content in assignments.

Still, by the time we got to doing actual syntheses, which involves many of those steps, I already felt much more comfortable performing them and I was more efficient as well. I also really like the video recordings of the experiments, and I think they were very helpful in giving me a solid understanding of what to do in lab. Dr. DeMeglio also gives very nice tips in them that aren&#39;t in the course packet.\r\nWeaknesses: I think there could be a little more transparency in grading, such as seeing rubrics after assignemtns, particularly the post-labs, are graded.

I really struggled with the quizzes throughout and found them difficult to study for. We are given &quot;readings&quot; but they are from a textbook that was not easy to access or listed anywhere in required course materials (was often referred to just as &quot;the textbook&quot; throughout&quot;).

Other than learning how to compose the chemical tables, the rest of the prelab and lab notes are straightforward and allow you to focus on developing skills in lab. For weaknesses, I found that the helpfulness of the post section questions in the handbook to be variable among my peers and myself for completing the quizzed. EPs were also graded with varying harshness which was somewhat annoying but ultimately not a major detractor since this is made up for in the final grade.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow48_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11246&amp;evaluatorId=1620729&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1620729</span>\n                        1620729\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1620729</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I like this course because it was more chill than gen chem and the staff was very nice.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow49_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11246&amp;evaluatorId=1620748&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1620748</span>\n                        1620748\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1620748</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think the organization of this course was well-structured.

I think this organization is better as compared to general chemistry lab. However, it does not always align with organic chemistry lecture (or the other way around), so there is extra effort needed. Thus, I think this course should be 1 credit instead of 0.5.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow50_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11246&amp;evaluatorId=1620798&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1620798</span>\n                        1620798\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1620798</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: Dr. DiMeglio is an absolute gem and I would be in this class entirely for her.

Weaknesses: the EPs, while helpful, were long and grades often felt arbitrary or entirely focused on the format rather than the content (e.g. you lose many points for a table with a cell that stretches across two pages). While I would understand TAs pointing out these formatting errors so that EPs may be slightly neater, losing points seems harsh and unhelpful for learning the content. I spent 3x the time making sure the formatting was right as I did actually learning material for the lab. Secondly, the quizzes are fast. Like really fast. I don&#39;t know why they are. Having slightly more than a minute per question would make these much better.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow51_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11246&amp;evaluatorId=1620914&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1620914</span>\n                        1620914\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1620914</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The labs we did each week built off of each other well and Prof. DiMeglio was very helpful.

There is an EP before the lab, lab notebook writing during the lab, and quizzes/post-lab assignments after the lab. The lab materials are easily accessible and the procedures are easy to understand through the course packet. The course packet was mostly organized and helpful towards the completion of this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- For one, there is no standardization of grading or rubric for EPs and Post-Lab assignments. I am not sure what freedom the TFs are given, but they can essentially cut off points for whatever they assume to be wrong and move on with that. For the EPs, you can be docked points for something you do this week, and then the next week you won&#39;t be docked for the same &quot;issue&quot;, or vice versa. Unless there was an ever-changing rubric throughout the semester, the grading scheme in this class is a big circus. Hence, you can never know what you are doing wrong, or right, or even what the proper way of doing an assignment was in the course. At that point, the only objective assignments that you could rely on are the quizzes and maybe participation? I think Christine should adopt a universal rubric in the course for all assignments to prevent these discrepancies between TAs and between assignments from the same TAs. Additionally, one thing I&#39;ve come to learn is that this course at least for CHEM 174 is not really tied to the lecture and what you learn in lecture. There are many techniques and concepts you only learn in lab that you don&#39;t learn in lecture or vice versa. I don&#39;t know if this is a curricular issue that can be fixed by the lab staff, but I thought my engagement was slightly lower because of that.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow53_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11246&amp;evaluatorId=1624027&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1624027</span>\n                        1624027\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1624027</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course was very well organized.

That being said, I liked this lab magnitudes better than 136L (2nd semester gen chem lab, it was truly the worst course I&#39;ve every taken).

This is coming from a first-year student that had not had any formal lab experience in the past. The information needed for pre-lab preparations are all laid out clearly and there are additional videos that can clarify anything from the procedure in the handbook. I also found the pre-labs (EPs) and during lab note-taking to be much more relaxed than expectation, and there were only two semi-cumulative post-lab assignments total, which were not bad at all.
