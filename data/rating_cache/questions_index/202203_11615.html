Sometimes, psets were graded harshly/unclearly, and I felt as if I had to attend office hours just to know HOW to word my answers for full points, but otherwise, this course was great.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow28_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11615&amp;evaluatorId=1617476&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1617476</span>\n                        1617476\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1617476</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths- very informative and interesting to learn about \r\nWeaknesses- not the most intuitive, very theoretical</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow29_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11615&amp;evaluatorId=1617577&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1617577</span>\n                        1617577\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1617577</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Getting taught economics in a lecture setting is very difficult.

I also feel that subtle nods to the calculus of the topics we are talking about every so often would certainly have helped with my understanding. Instead, this course ignored the existence of calculus and forced us to use a less comprehensive algebraic approach. While I understand that this course does not require calculus and focuses on high school level math, it would be very helpful to those who do understand calculus to see the relationship.

For economics specifically, this format was so helpful as I watched the online lectures many times: to take my original set of notes, but also to study for exams, or answer questions I had on specific segments that had been taught. A weakness of this class is, in my opinion, how the grades are calculated. As a first-year who took this class in my first semester, as many of my peers were as well, I was acclimating to the lecture environment, test format, and the consequence that the tests basically made up my whole grade. Based on the discussion I&#39;ve heard surrounding this class, it is most discouraging for first-time economics takers or those who don&#39;t have much exposure to the field. Considering the demographic of the economics study as a whole, especially at an institution like Yale, I think this is one of the places where the potential for diversity in future economists is lost, as many students in their first semester and first year take a grade (based on three exams) as a message about whether or not they should pursue this field.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow116_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11615&amp;evaluatorId=1632814&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1632814</span>\n                        1632814\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1632814</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The amount of resources this course provides in terms of office hours and past materials, complements the lectures and sections in a very helpful way.

On days I was sick or just felt wrong, I could decide not to attend the lecture and just take notes off the recordings. But attending lectures in-person is much better than recordings, however, for both understanding and paying attention to the actual topic at hand. Weaknesses are that sometimes it&#39;s difficult to apply theory (lecture) to application (psets/tests). Because the lecture mostly focuses on theory and not really application, sections with TF is used to supplement application. However, there isn&#39;t a clear connection from theory to application even then, and I recommend reading the textbook to supplement learning. If one has only a bit of knowledge of economics or less, the textbook is more important than emphasized in the class. If you read the textbook, do the lectures, and attend the sections, you&#39;ll be set. Otherwise, you&#39;ll probably struggle even if you attend all the lectures and sections. I emphasize this.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow121_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11615&amp;evaluatorId=1632847&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1632847</span>\n                        1632847\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1632847</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: support network from TAs/DS/ PTs and recorded lectures</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow122_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11615&amp;evaluatorId=1632850&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1632850</span>\n                        1632850\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1632850</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think one weakness is that the lecture format can be a bit distracting, because not all students are focused at all times.

One thing that could be added in following lectures is doing more practice problems in lecture, similar to the ones that appear on our problem sets.

With such a high percentage of our grade being based on exams, there were moments when I felt like my priority was memorizing and regurgitating rather than understanding and applying.

This made it so I never felt behind in the course or that there was material that was inaccessible to me throughout the difficulties of the semester. Something that I wish would be improved upon is the structure of the sections. I found my section to be rather drab in its instruction, with the teaching fellow walking through the section problems for us to just observe, really. We once had a substitute teaching fellow, who came in prepared with slides to review the topics the section material would cover. This TF also led the section by having us do parts of the question on our own then checking our work and walking through the questions themself. I found this model much more enriching and beneficial to my understanding of the material, and I would recommend some standardization of the sections so all of them are led in similar ways.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow201_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11615&amp;evaluatorId=1634193&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1634193</span>\n                        1634193\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1634193</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The amount of TF&#39;s and office hours provide for amazing/exceptional resources and tools to use when struggling.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow202_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11615&amp;evaluatorId=1634201&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1634201</span>\n                        1634201\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1634201</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths:\r\n- I really loved the interactive aspects of the exercises we did in class.

I also did not enjoy the amount of side chatter in the classroom, even though Professor O&#39;Dea repeatedly told students not to do so.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow203_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11615&amp;evaluatorId=1634393&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1634393</span>\n                        1634393\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1634393</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course is probably well-designed for the majority of the student body, with ample resources for self-learning and reviewing.

I wish there can be &quot;streamed&quot; sections with more advanced topics, instead of going over mathematics basics over and over again.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow204_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11615&amp;evaluatorId=1634435&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1634435</span>\n                        1634435\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1634435</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>One strength of this course is that there is an abundance of resources including TAs, ULAs, old materials for review, office hours, and more to help facilitate learning.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow205_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11615&amp;evaluatorId=1634542&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1634542</span>\n                        1634542\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1634542</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The lectures are a bit fast-paced, but the material is well organized.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow206_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11615&amp;evaluatorId=1634664&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1634664</span>\n                        1634664\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1634664</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Cormac&#39;s explanations are really really goos, and I like that there is an online option in case you missed a class, it allows everyone to stay on track.

It would be a tad more challenging for an individual who is indifferent about microeconomics because lack of passion may correlate to lack of attention or care which would subsequently make the class more difficult.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow138_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11615&amp;evaluatorId=1632884&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1632884</span>\n                        1632884\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1632884</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Good foundational course</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow139_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11615&amp;evaluatorId=1632887&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1632887</span>\n                        1632887\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1632887</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would recommend this course to another student because I feel that if students stay on top of the class and keep up with content, it is very doable.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow140_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11615&amp;evaluatorId=1632904&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1632904</span>\n                        1632904\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1632904</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No since I was unclear about a lot of concepts at the end of the course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow141_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11615&amp;evaluatorId=1632913&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1632913</span>\n                        1632913\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1632913</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes definitely - regardless of academic major - because student not only learn very important concepts that can be applied everywhere in life, but also a systematic and inquiring way of thinking through problems and settings that breaks down what seemingly may be a convoluted situation into fundamental principles and trends, but also with the caution of avoiding Econ 101ism.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow142_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11615&amp;evaluatorId=1632924&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=co337&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1632924</span>\n                        1632924\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1632924</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, if they want to fulfill requirements or are looking to get in touch with economic analysis.
