I felt like I learned so much from this class and much of that was due to the way the class was organized and the way Professor McCarthy lectured. I would definitely say this was my favorite course of the semester and the year, the content was really fascinating and it was presented in a way that was really conducive to learning while being relatively low stress. The only way I would improve the course would be to have a little bit more specific preparation for the final. I think even a couple of sample questions could take some of the pressure off the final; even though we have weekly quizzes and qsets it&#39;s hard to know exactly how questions will be formatted and where we should focus our studying, especially since it&#39;s a very content-heavy course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow5_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1565226&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1565226</span>\n                        1565226\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1565226</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course provides an intensive survey of neuroscience and got me interested in the field more than I was before taking the class.

It takes time to figure out what you actually need to pay attention to because the class is semi-flipped; previous lectures are on the course website and we are recommended to watch them prior to coming to the lecture, which essentially covers the exact same content and we are also expected to read the lecture notes, which cover the lectures but also go into far more detail than the lectures. The pre-recorded lectures occasionally have more content than the live lectures and vice versa, so you definitely miss things through the cracks if you don&#39;t do every aspect of the class. I definitely feel as if this course could be consolidated because it&#39;s just so much content in so many different spots. Additionally, I really disliked that announcements were made through Ed Discussion. It&#39;s very easy to lose those announcements in the thread!\r\nHowever, this is a very solid course. I feel as if you can really fall into a comfortable routine with the class and how you absorb the material, although it takes time to figure out how you should do so. The lack of pressure in terms of the grading makes the class way less anxiety-inducing, although it definitely doesn&#39;t set you up well for the final. I wish that the final reflected more of the style of the rest of the course, potentially being a final paper or cumulative final project as opposed to a recall-only exam, especially because the bulk of our assignments are open-note question sets. The question sets are amazingly structured and honestly served as a great way for me to fully process the work that I took my notes on. The grading breakdown on GradeScope was incredibly helpful when I wanted to go back and study the material later. There were some issues with the technology this semester, but once we had access to the answers for our quick quizzes and question sets, they became incredibly valuable tools to return to to study from. This is definitely a class that I wish I were more engaged in and had more of a capacity to engage in because I know that it was structured really well to be conducive to success and learning.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow7_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1567154&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1567154</span>\n                        1567154\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1567154</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No strengths, way too much content covered.

Weaknesses: I took this class as a requirement and was thankfully able to Credit/D it, but there is way too much information. The online videos add up to like two hours (which would be 4 hours per week) and the in-person lectures are like another hour and fifteen minutes. Additionally, even though Professor McCarthy said we would go more in-depth during in-person lectures, it was often just a repeat of the online lectures (down to the jokes), so I found these unhelpful.

The fact that you are expected to attend live lectures and watch several hours of recorded lectures each week is ridiculous. It makes this course a 2-credit workload at least.

This was unfortunate, because when I was taking the final I realized I had a much better memory for things that happened in class than things I saw on the recorded lecture. If I were to teach the course, I would center the lectures and not expect people to watch the prerecorded lectures in order to ensure that people come to class and take good notes. \r\n\r\nI found the written course notes quite helpful. \r\n\r\nAlthough I read that the point of the qsets was for us to study beforehand so we were studying the material throughout the course, I found that I could do the qsets successfully without studying beforehand, and just looking for information in my notes if I did not remember something. (In general, I read faster than average, so this might not be typical, though from talking to people I believe it may be). Given the volume of material in the course, and as a non major (I took the course to see if I would be interested in being a neuro major) I felt that the format of having everything open book made sense. I would strongly suggest, however, either making the final open book or having 3 or 4 closed-book in-class midterms like it throughout the semester (and teaching significantly less material), because the way the course worked, I memorized/studied no material during the semester and crammed all of the information the day of the final. The format of most things being open book suggested to me that this was how I was intended to take the course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow17_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1574375&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1574375</span>\n                        1574375\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1574375</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: lots of resources; Weaknesses: expectation to do 2hr+ of work outside of lecture time only for lecture time to repeat the same information, the final covered the entire semester so it was a lot of study for</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow18_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1575051&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1575051</span>\n                        1575051\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1575051</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think the class is super well organized.

I think that it would be helpful if perhaps the course videos were consolidated into thirty minute or, at the maximum, hourlong videos to watch before in-class lectures. It got harder to keep track of them as the semester progressed, because they were very time consuming. \r\nI also really liked the timed, open-note qSets, rather than having midterms.

I am not sure how feasible this is, but it might be good to have a 24-hour, take-home, open-note final.

There are weekly 3 hour question sets that you must complete in a one time sitting so also take that into consideration!

Being expected to watch over the lecture times worth of prerecorded videos, sometimes significantly more, then show up to class only to hear repeated information from the videos was not a great use of time. I stopped going to class in person and instead used the class time to watch as much of the prerecorded videos as I could in that time, which of course, was never actually enough time to watch it all.\r\nImprovements, all the content that we should be expected to know should be covered in the live lectures, the prerecorded videos should just be used to supplement our learning, not as a necessity on top of in person class.

The lectures basically said the same information. I enjoyed going to lecture, but could not always get the most out of it because I couldnt complete all of the pre-work the night before. I think that the class is good, but there is way too much pre-work. Also, it might be helpful if Professor McCarthy did a little recap each time of the general points from the last lecture. He would often mention the specifics of a brain area once and then just assume that you knew everything about it the next time he mentioned the part. This would lead to a lot of confusion for me.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow54_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1592266&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1592266</span>\n                        1592266\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1592266</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I liked that the Qsets were open-book; however, it felt very crammed for the closed-book final.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow55_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1592289&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1592289</span>\n                        1592289\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1592289</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strength: Professor McCarthy is very passionate about what he teaches\r\nWeakness: Assignments were fairly bland</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow56_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1592296&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1592296</span>\n                        1592296\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1592296</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Its so hard.

For example, at the end of week 1, there could be a qset on recorded lec 1-4, due before live lec 3, with some grace period for Add/Drop.  The quick quiz for week 2 then will be the last step after lec 4 to finally test how much we learned through lec 4. Then the qset for the weekend will be on lec 5-6, due before lec 5.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow59_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1592389&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1592389</span>\n                        1592389\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1592389</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: Instructor clearly cares, well organized material.\r\nWeaknesses: too much content.

These simply aren&#39;t engaging. But what made them most unbearable was the fact that that wasn&#39;t all, we were still expected to go to hour-long lectures that weren&#39;t that much more engaging. I don&#39;t know how, but they need to consolidate all of the requirements into something that is more engaging and doesn&#39;t take so much time outside of class, because it felt like an online class that didn&#39;t even require a professor sometimes, and then the lecture felt like supplementary material; I feel that is should be the other way around.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow88_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1596850&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1596850</span>\n                        1596850\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1596850</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I did not like the flipped classroom structure.

I also like the qSets because they allow you to understand the information in a lot more detail than you could remember on an exam. I think a weakness of this course would be the amount of material that is covered. Material is presented in a lot of detail, and although it is not required to remember all of this detail, it is difficult to discern what material we are required to know and what we are not. This can be improved by removing the detail that is not required.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow90_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1599750&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1599750</span>\n                        1599750\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1599750</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The strengths are in Professor McCarthy&#39;s organizational skills when it comes to the course and the low stress of quick quizzes and question sets, which are an amazing part of the course because I feel like my learning is really enhanced. However, a weakness is that we are expected to cram the entire semester&#39;s material to learn for a final that yes may not be worth that much of our grade but still is very difficult and therefore has the power to really influence our grade if we are significantly making errors in our explanations/partial credit (we still haven&#39;t been able to access exactly what grades we got on the final and how we did/where TFs took points off). It&#39;s not fair to have us be able to use open-note understanding of concepts throughout the semester and then have us try to cram this information without notes for more memorization-based testing.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n                                \n                            </div>\n                        \n

However, if you&#39;re someone who really doesn&#39;t enjoy the sciences, this might not be a wise class to take for a distributional requirement. You can definitely pass this class if you put in a consistent effort, but I know that if I wasn&#39;t interested in the topic I would have really hated the experience so much more. This worked well for me in terms of the structure of it, but I think that its structure would definitely not have worked well for some other students. I would be really careful in your consideration for this class. Know yourself and what you enjoy as a student because this class has a pretty upfront structure and courseload and if you have doubts as to whether you&#39;ll enjoy or be successful in this class, I&#39;d definitely trust your gut on it.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow7_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1567154&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1567154</span>\n                        1567154\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1567154</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No unless you really want to major in neuroscience.

Most people who take the course just watch the prerecorded lectures and never come to class (because in class you just hear most of the prerecorded lectures again). As a result, by watching the lecture videos you will learn all the things in class, but you will avoid having to do timed problem sets and a closed book final on all the material you learned but have not memorized (which is so much material that it can not fit into the in person lectures), because everything else in the course was open book.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow17_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1574375&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1574375</span>\n                        1574375\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1574375</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Only if you need it for your major, otherwise steer clear!</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow18_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1574544&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1574544</span>\n                        1574544\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1574544</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, if you are willing to have this be the center of your semester and/or be stressed about it (and especially the final) during the entire semester.

I really strongly disliked how the class was organized: you&#39;re supposed to watch 1h30min-2h worth of prerecorded videos before every class, but during class, he just uses the exact same slides and repeats almost verbatim what was in the videos. I stopped going to class because I didn&#39;t have the time to watch the same thing twice. Then, over the weekend, you have to take a TIMED 3 hour pset that are often challenging and always frustrating because of the timed nature (it&#39;s like taking the SAT every week). The final is extremely stressful because you feel like you&#39;ve literally been behind since day 1, and it&#39;s also pure memorization -- the questions are honestly too specific and really challenging because there&#39;s just too much information to memorize from the semester. That being said, after being forced to study for the final, it feels very rewarding to realize how much we now know about the human brain. You can really get a lot out of this class if you put the work in because the information is all there. I don&#39;t at all regret taking this class because the material about how our brain works is truly fascinating, but there was never a point in the semester where I was not stressed or overwhelmed about this class.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow19_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1575051&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1575051</span>\n                        1575051\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1575051</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes!!!

I feel a lot worse about the course after my experience with the final exam. Leading up to the final, I was confident that Professor McCarthy was adequately preparing us for the exam. He conducted a review session on the last 13 lectures of the course, and made sure to emphasize that he would focus on those topics and specifically focus on the last four lectures in the exam, since those weren&#39;t covered in QSets. The actual exam contained almost no questions on the last four lectures, and very few (maybe 20/100) on the second half of the semester. I spoke with several friends taking the class, and we all felt that we had been misled to focus our studying on content from the second half of the semester, when the exam in fact focused heavily on first-half-of-semester content. So in answer to this question, I would have to say: the material is good, but don&#39;t trust the instructors. Make of that what you will.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow32_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1586972&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1586972</span>\n                        1586972\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1586972</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes!!</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow33_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1587480&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1587480</span>\n                        1587480\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1587480</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>ABSOLUTELY!!!!! If you are interested in this material, please take this class. Prof McCarthy is a very knowledgeable instructor who cares about delivering the material in an accessible manner and will do anything to make sure his students understand the material. He uses psychology to actually structure his class, which I wish more professors of lectures would do. If you want to take this class, I suggest you look through the website and see if the lecture titles/content are interesting to you.\r\nTo succeed in this class, I made flashcards for each lecture and used them to review before every single assignment (this includes quick quizzes, qSets, and of course the final exam). I would say that consistent review helped me a lot in the course, and the fact that I love the material so much to begin with made studying enjoyable. I made sure to not treat qSets as an opportunity to review the material being tested for the first time, but rather took it as an opportunity to learn the DETAILS of the material and explain them cohesively. I loved the structure and content of this class, and while it was time-intensive, I loved every second of it (well, maybe not too much the visual system... but that&#39;s my preference).\r\nI also loved how Quick Quizzes took the place of actual assessments, and it really did help to prepare for the final exam. But yes, do not underestimate how much you will have to understand anatomy and step-by-step pathways. Last thing: do not fall behind!! Really do watch the pre-recorded lectures before going to lecture; they make all the difference.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow34_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1588122&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1588122</span>\n                        1588122\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1588122</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes I think the course was very interesting but unless it was a requirement I would recommend students take it credit/d/fail so they felt less pressure to sustain the workload and stress in falling behind and rather just get to be engaged and interested in the material</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow35_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1588237&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1588237</span>\n                        1588237\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1588237</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I definitely would recommend this course.

This is because the class isn&#39;t structured in an engaging way, and it is simply a lot of memorization which I understand because it is introductory neuroscience. Therefore, I think that this class would be a burden and take away from other courses unless it is required for your major, you are credit/d failing, or you just have an extreme interest in the brain that could not be quenched in any other capacity.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow81_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1596850&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1596850</span>\n                        1596850\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1596850</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow82_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1597627&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1597627</span>\n                        1597627\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1597627</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would recommend this course to another student because it was organized in a way that facilitates learning and really allows you to come out with more knowledge about the human brain.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow83_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20600&amp;evaluatorId=1599750&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=gm33&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1599750</span>\n                        1599750\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1599750</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would recommend because I feel I learned a lot of interesting information about the human brain and even other animal brains, and have learned an approach to thinking about the brain in an interesting way where we were able to see studies with fMRI and EEG to look at how different functions of the brain are connected to certain parts of the brain and see how they interact.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n                                \n                            </div>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </main>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div id="yale-footer-bottom" class="no-print" role="contentinfo">\n    <footer role="contentinfo" class="yale-footer">\n        <div class="footer-logo row">\n            <div class="column small-4 large-3 columns">\n                <a class="y-icons y-yale y-mark" href="http://www.yale.edu/"><span class="show-for-sr">Yale\n                </span></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class="small-8 large-9 columns">\n                <p class="copyright spacer" style="font-size: .8rem;">\n                    Copyright &copy;
