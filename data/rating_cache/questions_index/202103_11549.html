The readings also provided a lot of interesting context that is left out of traditional high school history classes. The writing assignments also taught me a lot. Each of the three assignments focuses on engaging with a different part of the Yale library system, and this taught me a lot about how to take advantage of library resources at Yale and how to write about different types of primary and secondary sources.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow83_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11549&amp;evaluatorId=1553644&amp;questionId=YC401-YCWR&amp;netIdFor=bfg2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1553644</span>\n                        1553644\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1553644</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned how to compile a lot of information into good study guides.

The three papers were all manageable lengths and fun research to do, and I enjoyed the emphasis on primary source analysis both in readings and in papers. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course was just more surface-level than I would have liked, but that&#39;s really unavoidable for a lecture course with such a broad subject matter.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow2_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11549&amp;evaluatorId=1521684&amp;questionId=YC403-YCWR&amp;netIdFor=bfg2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1521684</span>\n                        1521684\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1521684</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The strengths of this course are definitely the new ways in which you come to understand issues of twentieth-century America in an entirely new light.

Also, I enjoyed the chronological structure of the course, which helped me recognize patterns / recurrences of similar trends between different time periods in the 20th century and between then and now. Also, my TF was awesome and Prof. Gage is a great lecturer. I really enjoyed her lectures and the minimal words she put on her slides, which helped me better focus on what she was actually saying. \r\nWeaknesses: It was easy to get disengaged with the course as a whole sometimes. However, I would say that this isn&#39;t a problem with this class in particular, but with many lecture courses. Either way, the spacing out of assignments and midterm/final helped me get back on track without being disengaged for too long.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow5_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11549&amp;evaluatorId=1523788&amp;questionId=YC403-YCWR&amp;netIdFor=bfg2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1523788</span>\n                        1523788\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1523788</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: professor Gage, getting into the archives\r\nWeaknesses: a repeat of APUSH, too many assignments (3 essays and 2 exams)</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow6_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11549&amp;evaluatorId=1525808&amp;questionId=YC403-YCWR&amp;netIdFor=bfg2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1525808</span>\n                        1525808\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1525808</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>great course, no critiques</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow7_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11549&amp;evaluatorId=1527772&amp;questionId=YC403-YCWR&amp;netIdFor=bfg2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1527772</span>\n                        1527772\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1527772</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: Gage is a solid lecturer, definitely knows what she&#39;s talking about.

Also, for a gutty history lecture, there were way too many readings. There were a lot of weeks where it was pretty obvious in section that only two kids did the reading. The papers were kind of awful. As a first year, it might have been cool to use the archives for a paper, but as a senior it&#39;s just excessive.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow8_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11549&amp;evaluatorId=1527988&amp;questionId=YC403-YCWR&amp;netIdFor=bfg2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1527988</span>\n                        1527988\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1527988</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think this course is very well taught. Professor Gage is a very engaging lecturer and she manages to make the course interesting even to such a large number of students which is impressive. I think a weakness of this course in general is the structure of the discussion sections. While I think the lectures themselves are great, I think the experience in the section can be more variable. Sometimes I felt like my section could be chaotic and that it was too large to effectively allow people to share their ideas or actually get a deeper understanding of the lecture. In my personal experience, I dont find that the section helped me at all better understand the material or gain something unique from the regular lectures. Another related flaw I see with the course is just how variable grading is based on who your TF is. From my friends who were in the course yet in different sections, it seemed that some TFs were much stricter than others and had different grading policies. I understand the subjective nature of grading an essay, but I think the course could do a much better job in trying to at least centralize the grading methods as much as possible between TFs.

The teacher and the TAs have very similar political views so sometimes (perhaps unintentionally) they guide the discussion and present information in a way that portrays some groups as heroes and others as villains. I think history is a bit more nuanced than how it is portrayed in this class, but I still think it is a very interesting and enriching course in many ways.

But I know that our inability to spend a long time on individual events was attributable to how broad the class&#39; scope was, which is a good thing, since covering 100 years of American history requires some sacrifices in specificity. So I don&#39;t really consider this a &quot;weakness,&quot; more that it was the nature of the course to give a broader, but slightly shallower, understanding of America in the 1900s, rather than giving us a super in-depth understanding of one aspect of America in one section of this period.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow60_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11549&amp;evaluatorId=1551821&amp;questionId=YC403-YCWR&amp;netIdFor=bfg2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1551821</span>\n                        1551821\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1551821</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course was taught very well.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow61_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11549&amp;evaluatorId=1551824&amp;questionId=YC403-YCWR&amp;netIdFor=bfg2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1551824</span>\n                        1551824\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1551824</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The material covered at the end of lectures was very rushed.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow62_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11549&amp;evaluatorId=1551827&amp;questionId=YC403-YCWR&amp;netIdFor=bfg2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1551827</span>\n                        1551827\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1551827</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Professor Gage is a great lecturer and the readings are great.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow63_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11549&amp;evaluatorId=1551944&amp;questionId=YC403-YCWR&amp;netIdFor=bfg2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1551944</span>\n                        1551944\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1551944</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Improve clarity of the assignment on finals.

The readings provided really good primary and secondary perspective on the time that exposes you to influential people of the 20th century.

Professor Gage is an amazing lecturer and I&#39;m definitely going to try to take more of her courses just because of her.

All in all, I would definitely recommend it to any student who is seeking out a relevant and engaging history course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow68_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11549&amp;evaluatorId=1551821&amp;questionId=YC409-YCWR&amp;netIdFor=bfg2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1551821</span>\n                        1551821\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1551821</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow69_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11549&amp;evaluatorId=1551824&amp;questionId=YC409-YCWR&amp;netIdFor=bfg2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1551824</span>\n                        1551824\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1551824</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes if they haven&#39;t already taken a US history course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow70_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11549&amp;evaluatorId=1551827&amp;questionId=YC409-YCWR&amp;netIdFor=bfg2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1551827</span>\n                        1551827\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1551827</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, I think it&#39;s a great history course that does a great job of teaching history skills.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow71_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11549&amp;evaluatorId=1551944&amp;questionId=YC409-YCWR&amp;netIdFor=bfg2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1551944</span>\n                        1551944\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1551944</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Definitely take this course.

This class focuses a lot more on American domestic politics more so than its international role, which is something to keep in mind. Though the class briefly covers America&#39;s involvement in WWI, WWII, Cold War for contextualization purposes, the focus is really on the development of domestic conservative and liberal thought, parties, ideologies, and movements (which is extremely interesting and relevant to the modern-day btw). The course material is not difficult (the grading is fairly straightforward and relaxed), and the exams are extremely doable for anybody who attended lectures and at least has a baseline understanding of what the readings were generally about. There are a lot of readings per week, but many times its easy to understand the main takeaways without completing 100% of the reading. Professor Gage is a great lecturer, too.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow77_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=11549&amp;evaluatorId=1552339&amp;questionId=YC409-YCWR&amp;netIdFor=bfg2&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1552339</span>\n                        1552339\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1552339</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes!
