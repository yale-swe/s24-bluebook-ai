As a senior, I had not taken a math class since high school (except CS202, which I did rather poorly in). After putting in a tremendous amount of work, I came out with my mathematical foundation completely changed. My ability to think mathematically and algorithmically has been transformed for the better, and I feel like I can reason more cogently and solidly. The fact that this course forces you to generate proofs that are then rigorously checked by the TAs ultimately you think and articulate yourself more clearly. It&#39;s actually really cool to repeatedly go through the process of being completely stumped by a problem, to slowly figuring out, to eventually writing something that you think is far too complicated for another person to understand, and then ultimately being validatedor not!by an external reader. I would also add that my problem-solving confidence has improved significantly: on first read, every problem set was completely opaque, but with enough time and effort I successfully got through all of them.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow45_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18606&amp;evaluatorId=1724634&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=aw922&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1724634</span>\n                        1724634\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1724634</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Expect to learn many different strategies to solve problems in computer science and write rigorous proofs of their correctness.

However, you can expect the TAs to literally hand you the answer which teaches you nothing.  Then they grade the psets randomly and inconsistently, blatantly favoring LaTeXed psets and often not responding to regrade requests.  Even if you manage to solve the problems without the assistance of the TA, your solution will vary by a few words from all of the copy-paste office hour psets, and the graders are too lazy to read through and check that your slightly different solution is actually correct (and getting points back on regrade is a crapshoot).  This is a huge problem when 60% of the course grade is psets.  Also, staff was very selective in responding to Ed posts... and the grading delays are extreme.  We went into the end of semester Friday with 100% of the course done and 50% of the grades actually posted.  Pset 4 due nov 1 was not graded.

This comment however, is only reserved for the lectures and slides which were, for the most part, really great. The majority of the assignments and exams of this class were widely agreed to be extremely unpleasant and unreasonably difficult. Although they improved this slightly towards the end of the course, I felt like this class became an unwelcome burden that plagued my semester. Out of the all the 30+ PSET problems, I think only managed to solve maybe 3 without having to go to office hours multiple days in a row and this was a common sentiment for many people in the class, especially if this is the first algorithms class they were taking. Somehow, in spite of attending nearly every lecture, going to office hours multiple times every week, and investing a significant portion of my semester trying to get through this class, I still feel as though I&#39;ve learned very little, and have only learned how to parrot answers to very specific applications of the algorithms discussed in class. The disconnect between the lectures and the problems we were expected to solve were demoralizing, and I really wished they had made the problems less abstract and more connected to the lecture material (rather than tangentially). I didn&#39;t feel like I was being challenged, but rather, beat down with another extremely long PSET that would take at least 10-20+ hours with a course staff that was mildly condescending. I also found this attitude frustrating throughout the course in things like PSET or DQ problem solutions, in some of which they rated problems as &quot;easy&quot; and a &quot;piece of cake&quot;, the announcements on Ed/Canvas, and also through my experience getting help from some of the TAs. Additionally, PSETs were graded super late, so we never really got feedback on time. For instance, none of the PSETs that covered topics on our final were graded by the time we had to take the final (i.e over a month worth of material), and the practice exam came out like 2 or 3 days before the exam. I just really feel like if you expect the students in a class to go the extra mile, I think the course staff should hold themselves to a higher, more organized standard. I never leave really long comments like this for classes, but I really just had such a bad, unpleasant time in this class that it warrants this. The only thing I really enjoyed about this class were the lectures and the slides, which were very organized and flowed well into each other; I just wish I could say the same about anything else.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow11_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18606&amp;evaluatorId=1699018&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aw922&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1699018</span>\n                        1699018\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1699018</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The PSet problems are greathard but satisfying and fun.

The exams (particularly the first one) suffered from a similar issue. They were ever-so-slightly less challenging than the problem sets, but required much more time than was allotted - no one finished.\r\n3. Grading was entirely too slow.

Course was generally well-organized. The staff were very understanding and accomodating with the difficulties of the course (it seems as though it was ran a bit differently this semester) and things adjusted to feedback, especially after the midterm. Staff gave cohesive, in-depth feedback on problem sets.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: This course suffered from the issue of problem sets being so difficult that they were often unable to complete without help in office hours for (seemingly) the majority of students. This wasn&#39;t every problem of every problem set, but often, there would be 1 or 2 questions each (out of 4 or 5 usually) that would be particularly challenging. I feel like this undermines the learning process since it can be really discouraging to spend a lot of time on a problem by yourself only to get nowhere when you could take the much easier path of just going to office hours instead, knowing you have the correct answer, and spending less time trying to really understand the concepts. Feedback was generally too late to be super helpful. For example, the last 3 psets (out of 6 total) weren&#39;t graded as of taking the final exam, and, as of writing this, still aren&#39;t even well after the course ended.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow25_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18606&amp;evaluatorId=1709235&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aw922&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1709235</span>\n                        1709235\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1709235</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Some of the concepts, like DP, are really useful for technical interviews.

However, compared to previous iterations of the course, Fall 2023&#39;s Algorithms was *markedly* more difficult (as testified by virtually every single TA), and the course was a brutal slog. While this is not intrinsically a weakness, I would definitely say that given this level of difficulty, the course needed many more TAs and much more support earlier on, particularly for the students like me that did not have a solid foundation on proofs.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the TAs always took way too long to finish grading the psets, which sucked especially at the beginning because I had no way of knowing if I was thinking of the problems the right way. This problem was magnified given the difficulty of the course. However, this seems to be a pretty common problem at Yale at large/a function of all the graders being busy students themselves.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow50_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18606&amp;evaluatorId=1724634&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aw922&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1724634</span>\n                        1724634\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1724634</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: I was looking for a course to improve my proof writing and theoretical computer science knowledge, and this class fit the bill.

By the time the semester ended, we only had our first 3 of 6 problem sets graded. While it did not bother me too much, it is worth mentioning that you do not write any code in this class. This is a theory-first course, so code implementations of data structures and algorithms are not covered.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow51_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202303&amp;crn=18606&amp;evaluatorId=1724777&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=aw922&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1724777</span>\n                        1724777\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1724777</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course is well taught.
