This course taught me not only how to critique the systems I have been through, but also articulate these ideas in discussion with peers of very different backgrounds. Being able to hear about what other students have gone through during their academic experience has given me multiple lenses into different classrooms across the world. As silly as it seems, I did not realize that the only classrooms and learning experiences you know about are your own. Something as universal as education looks so vastly different as close as a few districts away. The emphasized control that local governments have to shape education makes the process of standardizing it very challenging and problematic.

This lead a lot of the conversation to be comforting to the White and privileged students, and simultaneously made all the non-White students be patient in learning about this topics. This also reflected in the peer feedback assignment: I was given a paper to read about discrimination and disadvantages a racial minoritized group faces which was written by a White student.

I really like how this course walked the walk in many ways. For example, we learned a lot about the downsides of high-stakes testing and also about renewed pushes for &quot;deeper learning&quot; in the classroom. I think the course requirements reflect this commitment to deeper learning by having us engage thoughtfully with course content rather than making us cram for an exam. I got so much more out of the take-home midterm than I would have gotten from an in-person exam. I enjoyed looking back through the texts and thinking through the scenarios presented. It was stress-free and allowed me to think creatively. I also enjoyed the literature review for both the freedom it gave me and the opportunity to learn a new form of writing. Reviewing and presenting the literature on a topic is a practical skill that I will use going forward. I appreciated the checkpoints that Dr. Debs gave to help us keep track of our progress. Lastly, the classroom observation was a fantastic way to engage with New Haven Public Schools and connect it to topics in the course. It was fun, rewarding, and should definitely be part of the course moving forward. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness that I can think of is that my engagement dipped during the second half of the semester when I completed my required reading responses.

The strengths of this class was the readings. I thought the readings themselves were super informative and were the most insightful part of the class. I also found sections to be productive discussions around these readings as well as full of meaningful personal connections that my classmates brought to the conversationand was guided by my lovely TF. The lectures themselves were a let down. After getting super excited by the readings, the lectures either were slow recaps of what we read, or disconnected completely. I wish the lectures were a site of synthesis with the readings that allowed for new insights or deeper understanding. Also, I know this class is a social science class so it makes sense that the readings reflect that, but I wish there was more of an emphasis on personal experience like the Suina piece we read at the beginning of the year. In addition, I thought the assignments were a bit half-cooked. Whether it was the lit review that was a bit confusing since it never actual resulted in a final research paper or the observation paper which I wish was more in depthwhether that was getting to observe more regularly or a greater page requirement that allowed for a more in depth analysis.

The timeline gave me a good amount of time/opportunities to talk with my TF, who was very helpful throughout the process. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Though I understand that this course is a survey course, making it impossible to cover every subject deeply, I do think the class missed opportunities to interrogate the structures that have created and continue to create injustice and inequity in the classroom. While the class dedicated a significant amount of time to sociologically proving that inequities in education exist, critical conversations on the historical structures and government policies behind these inequities were scarce. In our final class, we discussed briefly acknowledging past injustices as a means of improving education. While this class acknowledged past injustices, I felt it sometimes ignored that many injustices are not a thing of the past. While some of our discussions addressed the connection between past injustices and the present state of American classrooms, such as our discussion on school segregation, other conversations missed the mark. Our classes on higher education especially seemed focused on historicizing Yales role in maintaining inequity, eliminating the opportunity for nuance. Professor Debs lectures echoed Dean Quinlans statement that Yale is not the Yale it was 50 years ago. While true, this framing papers over the many structural inequities that still exist within the university system (lack of socioeconomic diversity, lack of support for FLGI students and students of color). Ive taken survey classes, such as HSHM 206, that cover a wide variety of subjects like EDST 110 that are also able to address structural inequity in appropriate depth. I think this would be possible for EDST 110, though it would require effort, creativity and a willingness to change.\r\n\r\nIts also worth noting that the majority of this class focused specifically on education systems in America, making the more general course title a bit of a misnomer.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow37_2">\n                <td>\n

If you are interested in education studies, political science, history, cognitive science, sociology, cultural studies, or even a STEM field, it is essential to understand how the education system works. Not only do you learn about contemporary debates in education, but you also learn a lot about the history of inequities in education, how education policy is made, and the impact of educational disparities on long-term outcomes. The pace of the course is very relaxed, with most of the work taking place before Thanksgiving. The only major assignment is the Literature Review  however, be sure to set aside a substantial amount of time to complete this assignment because although it is only 20% of your grade, it will take a very long time to complete. That said, Dr. Debs and the TFs are very understanding if you need an extension and provide a significant amount of support.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow3_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10165&amp;evaluatorId=1608289&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1608289</span>\n                        1608289\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1608289</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>YES.

I wouldn&#39;t say education studies is my top academic interest, but I was somewhat interested in learning about history/sociology/theory of education, and this course was so fun and interesting even though I am not an education nut. In large part, I think, because of the teacher, TA, and course structure. Especially at Yale, where so many professors are researchers first and professors just because they have to be, taking a course with someone who cares about the teaching aspect of their job is such a wonderful experience. Even if you don&#39;t take this class, I recommend taking instruction quality and style into account when choosing classes (you can learn a lot from about how a teacher will teach a course from their syllabus!). But this class really is awesome. Even the discussion sections were really enjoyable, we developed a real feeling of closeness with each other, and we had great discussions about the course content, including how it related to our own lives.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow23_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10165&amp;evaluatorId=1618978&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=mcd49&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1618978</span>\n                        1618978\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1618978</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.
