of view.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n                                \n                            </div>\n                        \n

Though the last third of the class and some of the beginning could have helped with improving not the biochem content, but rather their wording of sentences on slides.

The course was organized well, as the lectures flowed from one to the next very well. The PSETs provided very good practice and highlighted important takeaways from the class. The study guides posted for each lecture helped me focus on the main concepts. There were many opportunities to get help for the course, including office hours with the professors, office hours with the peer tutors, discussion sections, etc. WEAKNESSES: This course is time consuming due to the memorization required in learning nomenclature, structures, pathways, etc. The exams really tested our ability to apply concepts learned in class to new problems, which was sometimes quite difficult. Lectures move very fast and lots of material is covered.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow6_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11051&amp;evaluatorId=1617513&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ms2598&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1617513</span>\n                        1617513\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1617513</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Some of the strengths of the course was that students were able to rely on lecture handouts and attending lecture to learn the necessary concepts, as opposed to relying on a textbook.

Professor Simon was a great introduction to the course, and his office hours were far and away the most useful of the three professors. Professor Paulsen was also amazing. I felt that her lectures were packed with a little too much content, however, and it was unclear how much we were required to memorize regarding the examples she provided. This made the second part of the course a memorization-heavy portion, and I questioned the benefits of memorizing random facts about GPI-anchored proteins, for example, even though they are very cool! Professor Koelle&#39;s section of the course was also great. He cares a lot about making sure students understand the material (I asked many trivial questions during office hours, but he still treated me with dignity and patience, which I greatly appreciated). He also checked Ed consistently, which made it a great resource during the last third of the course and the final. \r\nWeaknesses: Class organization. I really did not enjoy that the course was taught by three different professors, even though they were all great. The class felt like three modules rather than a complete course, but this is more of a personal preference. The answers to some of the problem sets were also not available before the exam, making it difficult to study at times. The support system of professors and TAs were great, but the course overall felt disorganized.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow9_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11051&amp;evaluatorId=1619507&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ms2598&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1619507</span>\n                        1619507\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1619507</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: well structured &amp; well organized; helpful discussion sections\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: certain test/pset questions designed &amp; worded poorly--can be interpreted many ways, but only one is given credit; lectures are incredibly dense and hard to retain</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow10_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11051&amp;evaluatorId=1619786&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ms2598&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1619786</span>\n                        1619786\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1619786</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths include the clear explanations of concepts by each professor, problem sets (sort of) reflective of exams, the study guides (sort of) and the peer tutors were an excellent resource.

In addition, I appreciated the more conceptual/application written questions in the 2nd exam versus Yes/No style questions or questions that pinpoint one detail from one lecture, especially because the big picture concepts and integration of lectures was emphasized.

However, I appreciated the helpfulness of the teaching staff, and their (typically) swift responses to student questions. \r\n\r\nI think that the course could be greatly improved by making the exams longer (as in, out of more points). Missing more than 4 points would have a significant impact on ones score, and I felt as though partial credit was sparse in most cases (resulting in larger losses of points). I could never rationalize why the number of points per exam was always such a strange number, and I felt that the number of questions would prevent me from demonstrating my actual knowledge of the course content.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow18_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11051&amp;evaluatorId=1623674&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ms2598&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1623674</span>\n                        1623674\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1623674</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: I think a major strength of this course is that each portion of the lectures are focused into a specific faculty member that has high expertise in that area, so that they are more apt to teach on the subject. Michael Koelle definitely stood out as the strongest, kindest, and most engaging lecturer of the three. I think another strength of the course is that the faculty does truly care about student success, and that they do provide a lot of opportunities to do well. \r\nWeaknesses: I do think that a major downside of this course is that a large portion of the grade is focused onto three hours of exam time. It&#39;s extremely punitive, and if you end up doing poorly on more than one of them, there is not much opportunity to improve your grade drastically. I also think that the PSETS were really helpful in understanding topics, but with the amount of time spent working on them, they should be worth more of our grades. Also, the first two professors were not really present on ED discussions, whereas Koelle was, which led to him being confused as to why students weren&#39;t using it before (it&#39;s because there was a lack of engagement with the other two segments). The exams were also really specific topic-wise, and it was often not really what I found to be the biggest takeaway from lectures, and focused a lot on some random names/enzymes at times, though serious studying could help with that issue. I also think section should be mandatory and count towards your grade to encourage engagement!

The TAs I had were incredibly helpful and approachable. Lectures from Matt and Michael were very clear and cohesive so it made it easier make connections between each of their lectures (though they go really fast, so that&#39;s why recording the lectures was really helpful). Practice exams, although really helpful for understanding format, felt a little easier than the actual exams; though they usually asked one question on the exam that was straight from the practice exam. I didn&#39;t get to go to the professor office hours as much as I could for peer tutor office hours and TA sections, but my friends who went to office hours with Michael thought that he was incredibly clear (even helped clarify concepts from the lectures that he didn&#39;t teach) and approachable. Peer tutors were helpful for weekly PSETs and individual questions that I had about the material, but when it came to reviewing for exams, their review sessions didn&#39;t really help at all, as it was mostly just them regurgitating the slides. Exams were for the most part pretty fair and I could finish with a decent amount of time to check over answers, though sometimes there were questions that were pretty ambiguous, and unless you did a ton of studying and understand the material like the back of your hand, it was very difficult to answer in the manner they were looking for. The amino acid and glycolysis quizzes were a strength and a weakness (strength because they&#39;re basically free points and a weakness because memorizing the structure of each amino acid and each step in glycolysis steps felt pretty meaningless). Probably the biggest weakness was that as the course goes on, the need to memorize everything from the slides becomes very apparent, for the midterms seemed to test us more on very minute details. Candie&#39;s lectures, while also pretty clear, were very information-dense, and it was difficult to discern what was necessary to know and what was just details; I found myself needing to memorize the most from her slides more than being able to connect concepts between lectures. Also, please never have a midterm the week we come back from break ever again; it was very unfair that a lot of us had to study over break for that exam (and that reflected in the fact that it was our lowest midterm average). Overall one of the most organized courses I&#39;ve taken at Yale, and not much that I would change about the course other than the stuff I mentioned.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow24_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11051&amp;evaluatorId=1629649&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ms2598&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1629649</span>\n                        1629649\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1629649</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Its really well organized and have good assistance programs</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow25_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11051&amp;evaluatorId=1631656&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ms2598&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1631656</span>\n                        1631656\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1631656</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The approach that the professors and teaching team had towards this course was excellent.

The atmosphere of the class among students didn&#39;t feel great, perhaps because there was a lot of stress about exams and grades. There&#39;s not officially a curve, but after every exam there was a new post about what grade cutoffs were projected to be based on class performance, so it still felt like you constantly needed to do better than others to get a decent grade (and as of now when my final grades is posted, I still don&#39;t know what the cutoffs were or have my final exam grade released). I would also find it helpful if problems set grades and keys could be released as we complete them, because they were not released for a long time, which made it hard to gauge how I was doing with the material.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow33_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11051&amp;evaluatorId=1638731&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ms2598&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1638731</span>\n                        1638731\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1638731</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strength:\r\n- a lot of material to review to practice \r\nWeakness:\r\n- course moved very fast while being unclear in some topics</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow34_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11051&amp;evaluatorId=1638740&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ms2598&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1638740</span>\n                        1638740\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1638740</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strength - very collaborative \r\nWeakness - different instructors so it&#39;s hard to adjust.

On all exams, the first page of questions was composed of exclusively fill-in-the-blanks asking about factoids mentioned in perhaps one slide out of the hundreds covered on that exam. Many other longer exam questions also effectively boiled down to knowing one specific detail, with the explanations barely being considered in the grading. The questions even inform you of this, as they all restrict answers to a certain length limit (for example, two sentences or less). As much as this restriction is for convenient grading, it is also stifling for demonstrating actual knowledge of the material. I believe the course would be significantly improved if the exams were modified to involve more questions about experimental design and application of ideas. As the instructors themselves frequently mention during the course, biochemistry is a complex discipline with countless details and models, which cannot be fully understood by memorizing merely one biological system in its entirety. Exams in the format of trivia night feat. metabolic pathways do not capture these principles of biochemistry and reflect poorly on the course&#39;s title and goals.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow40_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11051&amp;evaluatorId=1640543&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ms2598&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1640543</span>\n                        1640543\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1640543</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think this class was organized in a standard STEM fashion with lectures, psets, midterms, etc...</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow41_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11051&amp;evaluatorId=1640557&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ms2598&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1640557</span>\n                        1640557\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1640557</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>From my point of view, there were not many strengths to this course. Most lectures, especially in the first two-thirds of the class, felt like raw information dumps. I felt like many concepts were not properly fleshed through due to the raw amount of information taught in the course and the relative lack of total lecture time through which each concept could be covered. Due to the structure of the class, it felt like each lecture covered a laundry list of topics to know, rather than building concepts from the ground-up using any sort of first principles. Even with decent note-taking practices, it was very difficult for me to retain anything from lecture. The problem sets were quite short, and as such, did not provide for a comprehensive engagement of the course material. Many of the examples that were provided throughout the course to illustrate biochemical principles actually made the subject material more complicated, as each biological example provided had its own set of complexities that were in themselves difficult to understand. As a result of all of this, it was difficult to discern what was actually important from lecture versus what was supposed to be extraneous information (but this was adequately addressed using the study guides released by the instructors, which is something I would consider one of the few strengths of the course). Additionally, it was difficult to build an intuition of much of the material since it felt like the emphasis in this class was on rote memorization of largely disjointed material. Of the three parts of the class, Prof. Koelle&#39;s was the easiest to build an intuition for, and that is because he provided a framework at the beginning of the metabolism unit through which an intuition for the material could actually be built. \r\n\r\nMy suggestions:\r\nThe sheer amount of lecture material becomes even more apparent when compared with the amount of material taught in MB&amp;B 275. Perhaps this is a radical suggestion, but I would think about shifting much of the enzyme kinetics over to MB&amp;B 275 to equilibrate the content load between all three of the core classes. I don&#39;t think MB&amp;B 275 would lose much this way, since enzyme kinetics is already covered in the course in arguably a more chemical manner, but I think MB&amp;B 300 would have a lot to gain, since it would allow for more time to comprehensively cover a smaller amount of material. Also, I would recommend using less examples and instead describing biochemical concepts in very generic terms without the complexities inherent to biological systems. I would also recommend making the problem sets longer and more varied. This would increase the workload of the class, but it will be easier to engage the course material this way. Additionally, many of the supplements were actually not very useful or pertinent to the course (and 5-10 minutes is not enough time to go through complex scientific experiments and conclusions), and I would perhaps forgo those to make more time in class for better pacing of the material.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n                                \n

The course is well-designed in the way that the necessary information is disseminated during lecture, as attending lecture and having the lecture handouts helped students have all of the necessary information for problem sets and exams, without having to rely on a textbook. The discussions helped solidify concepts presented during lecture, and the problem sets, instead of taking a long time, helped students practice the exam-style questions, which were often challenging, but helped students apply concepts learned in lecture. The course has a challenging workload and is memorization-heavy, so students intending to take this class should be prepared for these challenges.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow6_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11051&amp;evaluatorId=1617839&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ms2598&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1617839</span>\n                        1617839\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1617839</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, I found the material very interesting and the assessments were fair.

I imagine most people interested in this course are either pre-med or MB&amp;B/MCDB majors. This course, while tough, left me with a rigorous background understanding of biochemistry. The course requires a lot of memorization. The first half of the course is mostly memorization. We go over the basics, and that requires memorizing names and structures more than an intuition for biochem. The second half of the course is a lot more conceptual, and we study metabolic pathways and how they interact with each other. After taking this class, I have a better appreciation of the body as a holistic, integrated system. As a pre-med who works in clinical settings, I began seeing how my MB&amp;B 300 knowledge was helping me better understand certain patient conditions. I thought that the course was taught extremely well. The TF team was great. The lectures were dense, but I never felt overwhelmed because of how well the lecture slides were written. Overall, highly recommend to interested pre-med/biology students.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow13_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11051&amp;evaluatorId=1622951&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ms2598&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1622951</span>\n                        1622951\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1622951</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Overall this is not a bad biochemistry course.

I think that there are a lot of weaknesses associated with this course, that honestly led to me having some difficulty with it as a whole, but if you are interested in the subject, you will be just fine. You will need to study a LOT and memorize a bunch of fine-detail aspects of lecture slides that were hardly-discussed in class.

I can&#39;t speak on how MCDB300 was, but the MCDB course is only a semester whereas this one is an entire year, and I don&#39;t think you could fit in a satisfying level of detail within only one semester, so I&#39;m happy I chose this course (and if you do take MBB300 and hate it, you aren&#39;t required to take the second semester for the MCDB major). It does sometimes feel like you&#39;re learning more detail than you need or like exams will ask very specific questions, but overall, the details are used to illustrate broader concepts. While there is undeniably a small amount of rote memorization for exams, the vast majority of the questions use what you know or have memorized to answer questions that do test understanding and not just memorization.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow30_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11051&amp;evaluatorId=1638731&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ms2598&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1638731</span>\n                        1638731\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1638731</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, the course changed my perspective on biology and how humans operate.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow31_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11051&amp;evaluatorId=1638740&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ms2598&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1638740</span>\n                        1638740\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1638740</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Ehh - not the worst class, you definitely do have to put in the necessary hours to make sure you understand the material</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow32_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11051&amp;evaluatorId=1638849&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ms2598&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1638849</span>\n                        1638849\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1638849</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would, but not in a semester with a significant course load.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow33_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11051&amp;evaluatorId=1639093&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ms2598&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1639093</span>\n                        1639093\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1639093</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, super interesting.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow34_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11051&amp;evaluatorId=1639372&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ms2598&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1639372</span>\n                        1639372\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1639372</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>yes! great course to take for learning about biochem</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow35_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=11051&amp;evaluatorId=1639381&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ms2598&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1639381</span>\n                        1639381\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1639381</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, but be forewarned that the final third of the material (the metabolism section) is WAY harder than the first two!

But as it is, the course is not very organized academically/thematically and is not well-suited for a non-biochemistry major to get anything out of, in terms of principles that inform day-to-day life.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n                                \n                            </div>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </main>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div id="yale-footer-bottom" class="no-print" role="contentinfo">\n    <footer role="contentinfo" class="yale-footer">\n        <div class="footer-logo row">\n            <div class="column small-4 large-3 columns">\n                <a class="y-icons y-yale y-mark" href="http://www.yale.edu/"><span class="show-for-sr">Yale\n                </span></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class="small-8 large-9 columns">\n                <p class="copyright spacer" style="font-size: .8rem;">\n                    Copyright &copy; <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear())</script> Yale University <span aria-hidden="true">&middot;</span> All rights reserved <span aria-hidden="true">&middot;</span>\n                    <a title="Yale Privacy policy" href="http://www.yale.edu/privacy.html" style="text-decoration: underline">Privacy policy</a>\n                    <span aria-hidden="true">-</span>\n                    <a href="https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility/accessibility-yale" style="text-decoration: underline">Accessibility at Yale</a>\n                    \n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </footer>\n</div>\n\n\n<script type="text/javascript" src="/ocedashboard/assets/app-64ec30218e4e8f6eca224a18684e4884.js" ></script>\n<script type="text/javascript" src="/ocedashboard/assets/jquery-ui.min-b0ba1d1ac5ef9706219d68b4ecfcd5b3.js" ></script>\n<script type="text/javascript" src="/ocedashboard/assets/jquery.multiselect-a52ab3a5ee20a1f9138c469e94241a1a.js" ></script>\n\n<script>\n    $(window).bind("load", function () {\n        var footer = $("#yale-footer-bottom");\n        var pos = footer.position();\n        var height = $(window).height();\n        height = height - pos.top;\n        height = height - footer.height();\n        if (height > 0) {\n            footer.css({\n                \'margin-top\': height + \'px\'\n            });\n        }\n    });\n    function loadingMessage() {\n        $("body").css("cursor", "progress");\n        $("#loadingMessage").show();\n    }\n    function clearLoadingMessage() {\n        $("body").css("cursor", "default");\n        $("#loadingMessage").hide();\n    }\n\n</script>\n<script>\n\n\n    (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\'GoogleAnalyticsObject\']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n            (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n        m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n    })(window,document,\'script\',\'https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\',\'ga\');\n\n    ga(\'create\', \'UA-100715343-1\', \'auto\');\n    ga(\'send\', \'pageview\');\n\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n'
