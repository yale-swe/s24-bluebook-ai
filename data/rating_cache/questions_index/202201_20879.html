I think a major weakness of the class is the grading system where we are pitted against each other and graded on a curve -- much more collaboration and teamwork could have been achieved if all the pre-meds were not so focused on trying to do better than everyone else to get an A.

The lab reports were either way too long and took hours to complete, or they were super simple and left students wondering why the work couldn&#39;t have been more evenly split to avoid having too much workload in a given week. Also, many of my friends, including friends who had never done this before, had to stay up super late or even all night to finish the lab reports, especially the first lab report. We were expected to do really long and tedious lab reports with little guidance, and half way through the semester Dr. G made it so rubrics weren&#39;t available to TF&#39;s, so then we really had no guidance. In preparation for each lab we were required to read a multi page long lab manual and watch prelab lectures to understand what was going on and take. prelab quiz. The prelab quizzes were unnecessarily stressful and under strict time constraints. The post lab quizzes were under the same strict time constraints and on very specific material from the previous lab, sometimes taken weeks prior, that we were supposed to memorize without guidance on what specific part of the lab we were supposed to memorize. Most weeks many students bombed those quizzes. Dr. G would also at the start of the semester give lectures before the lab that were relevant, but extremely long winded which caused us to have to stay later to finish our labs which were already long and exhausting. In all, the workload for this class was entirely unnecessary, especially when considering that this is a half-credit class.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow49_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20879&amp;evaluatorId=1589185&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ng3&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1589185</span>\n                        1589185\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1589185</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths of this class was how it forced me to actually study my lab manuals.

Various times in this course we were tested on experiments from a month previous. Having to study for such a quiz in addition to completing a lab report, studying for the lab quiz, and preparing for the next lab, was overwhelming. The post lab quizzes were not always helpful because they quizzed us on topics we had already gone over and practiced by completing the lab report. This lab course is more rigorous than gen chem 1 lab.

I did not have time to relearn AP Chem because I am a spring season athlete so that resulted in me failing almost every single quiz. The quizzes are just ridiculous too, they are too heavily based upon memorization. I wish they had been more conceptual.

Also, Dr. G expected us to watch the pre-lab lecture before we came into lab, but then he gave basically the same pre-lab lecture when we came in - which I&#39;m glad he stopped doing mid-way through the semester after a student complained.

I often spent more time on work for this class than chemistry lecture. A lot of the assignments were very redundant. We were asked to watch pre-lab lecture videos before coming into lab, but then we would also be given an in-person lecture on the same information that lasted 30min-1 hour. This took away from the time we were actually doing work in the lab. A lot of the procedures we performed in lab required more trials than were necessary and sometimes seemed to combine two seemingly unrelated experiments into one. Both the pre-lab and post-lab quizzes were unnecessarily difficult and required thorough studying of the lecture videos and lab manuals each week, which often took 2-3 hours. The lab reports were graded very strictly and points were deducted for even the smallest mistake. This necessitated me spending about 2 hours just checking each lab report for minor errors after it was fully completed.

During the first week of classes, go to every TF&#39;s office hours throughout the week and figure out which TFs are most helpful in answering your questions. 2. Start the lab reports the DAY you get out of lab and email Dr. G. with any questions you have about how to do things. 3. Actually watch the prelab lectures and take careful notes -- anything that gets repeated more than once usually is important to know! 4. Study the lab manual the night before for the postlab quizzes. The class is not difficult if you manage your time appropriately and spend a little time each day throughout the week to spread out the workload. When you&#39;re not pulling an all-nighter to do the lab report (I never had to!) this class becomes so much more enjoyable and you get to focus on actually learning chemistry and can appreciate how much time and effort Dr. G puts into the class.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow7_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20879&amp;evaluatorId=1562419&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ng3&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1562419</span>\n                        1562419\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1562419</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No, it&#39;s a horrible course and a way to spend a ton of time and not learn anything that wasn&#39;t taught in general chemistry.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow8_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20879&amp;evaluatorId=1562607&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ng3&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1562607</span>\n                        1562607\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1562607</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, if it is required or you want to develop an understanding of basic chemistry concepts and laboratory procedures.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow9_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20879&amp;evaluatorId=1562672&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ng3&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1562672</span>\n                        1562672\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1562672</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yeah sure</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow10_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20879&amp;evaluatorId=1562975&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ng3&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1562975</span>\n                        1562975\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1562975</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>If you have a choice, no.

This needs to be prioritized because learning is sacrificed due to sheer volume of work.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow105_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20879&amp;evaluatorId=1596814&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ng3&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1596814</span>\n                        1596814\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1596814</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No unless you have to take it.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow106_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20879&amp;evaluatorId=1597249&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ng3&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1597249</span>\n                        1597249\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1597249</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes but only if they must (ie chem major or premed)... and are ready to be very proactive about their learning... do NOT take Monday lab (:</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow107_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202201&amp;crn=20879&amp;evaluatorId=1597617&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ng3&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1597617</span>\n                        1597617\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1597617</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No, I would not recommend this course to another student because it requires a huge time commitment for only 0.5 credit.
