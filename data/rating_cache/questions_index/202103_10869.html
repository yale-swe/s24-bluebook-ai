I used Khan Academy to learn much of the course content, as the Khan Academy lectures and exercises were set up in a way that made much more sense from a pedagogical perspective. Parts of Unit 3, molecular shape, helped me to understand content that I had struggled with in units 1 and 2, and I truly feel that students would reach a higher baseline level of understanding much sooner if the content were organized in a different way. There also seemed to be little communication as to what was expected of the Teaching Fellows in section - my TF was wonderful and very helpful, but I&#39;ve heard from friends that they had TFs that basically didn&#39;t care and would just sit silently while students did the quizzes. I understand that an introductory course might not be the most engaging thing to have to teach, but I feel that the structure of the course could use some attention, especially given that basically every STEM major at Yale has to take it.

Sure, we can ask questions in discussion, but I still believe that some portion of our discussion time needs to be devoted to a brief review of the subject. Additionally, I did not feel like all of the tests in this course were fair in their ability of testing our knowledge on the subject. For the first test and the final, the test was entirely to long to get through for most students. Additionally, for the same two tests, the questions we were given (specifically, free response) were like nothing we had seen before, which made it difficult to even approach in the first place. Not that a test should be easy, but a test for this class in particular is designed to test our knowledge on the subject matter, it should not be a speed test nor a test of how well we can interpret one&#39;s question-formatting. Overall, I felt ill-prepared for the tests because of this, no matter how hard I studied. The professor failed to prepare us for these types of questions, and initially was opposed to the idea of even providing any practice for us.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow13_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10869&amp;evaluatorId=1529314&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pdc38&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1529314</span>\n                        1529314\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1529314</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course did a good job of making sure we understood chemistry topics, but I wish that there had been more support in preparing for exams, which were very difficult.

Went straight to covering new material that would not even be mentioned in the upcoming material. Another weakness is there was not enough review material available that actually matched the format of the midterm and final specifically. I feel like study groups should be encouraged more and there should be a better system in place for that to happen (filling out a survey so people can get matched). This should be done at the beginning at the semester. There should also be answer keys for the midterms afterwards. This is more preferred than meeting with a peer tutor, because there is a chance that all the material will not be reviewed in the allotted time.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow23_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10869&amp;evaluatorId=1535169&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pdc38&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1535169</span>\n                        1535169\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1535169</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The only strength of the course is that everything was pretty straightforward in terms of how grades worked. In preparing for the exams, if you go through answer keys for the discussion section questions, half the answers for each packet were wrong and group work was not facilitated well. I also thought due dates for Achieve assignments were quite arbitrary. I think the course needs better material to work with so that students can actually prepare for the tests in more ways than just looking over past Achieve assignments and looking through notes that we don&#39;t fully understand. I think that the lecture slides were usually unhelpful since the bulk of the pertinent information was said aloud in class and it was very hard to access good notes because lecture was never recorded (which should be changed throughout the entire college and not just this course). Even if you don&#39;t start recording lecture next semester, it would be very beneficial if the annotated lecture slides were uploaded on canvas. In addition, the answer key to problems from the textbook were uploaded but some people could not afford the 6th edition textbook and worked with the 5th edition instead. However, the problems in the textbooks are different and it would have been nice to see an answer key to problems from the 5th edition. Lastly, for exam prep, I know a number of students who skipped lecture on exam day to study because they knew that the topics talked about in class would not be important for the test. If we spent like 10 minutes out of the 50 minute class generally summarizing concepts to study in our last minute review, I think you would have seen much better test scores.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow24_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10869&amp;evaluatorId=1535522&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pdc38&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1535522</span>\n                        1535522\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1535522</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course is obviously a requirement for many majors and for pre-med students, but for those of us (like me) who didn&#39;t see a need for chemistry in their major or careers, it didn&#39;t feel the most useful, and therefore my engagement was relatively low.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow25_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10869&amp;evaluatorId=1536323&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pdc38&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1536323</span>\n                        1536323\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1536323</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The class is very straightforward and not very stressful.

This could be improved by having practice problems in class and for homework that will resemble those on an exam, especially since exams are worth a significant part of the grade.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow55_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10869&amp;evaluatorId=1544193&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pdc38&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1544193</span>\n                        1544193\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1544193</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Not enough preparation for the tests, more difficult problems should be gone over in class</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow56_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10869&amp;evaluatorId=1544199&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pdc38&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1544199</span>\n                        1544199\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1544199</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The lessons could have definitely been more aligned with the tests.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow57_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10869&amp;evaluatorId=1544204&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pdc38&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1544204</span>\n                        1544204\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1544204</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: Engaging lecturers\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of recorded lectures</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow58_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10869&amp;evaluatorId=1544205&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pdc38&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1544205</span>\n                        1544205\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1544205</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I thought the pacing of the course was good.

The section worksheets were not organized and weren&#39;t helpful.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow74_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10869&amp;evaluatorId=1544255&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pdc38&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1544255</span>\n                        1544255\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1544255</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: mostly taught clearly, slides being posted early was helpful\r\nWeaknesses: online exams, no way to test out. \r\nI had learned every single thing we did the entire semester other than molecular orbital theory in previous chem or physics classes.

This meant you knew exactly what was coming and it was up to you to deal with it. I also liked that we had a Midterm so close to the final. That material was fresh in my mind and made studying for the final better.\r\nThe material was taught well and there was lots of options available for help if you needed it. I went to office hours many times and they were very helpful; all my questions were answered. \r\nHowever, I would organize more review sessions for exams and structure them better. I went to one review session before a midterm, and it was kind of a waste of time - people asked very specific questions and I left quickly. I therefore did not attend such a session again. It would be useful to have review sessions by topic, or themed peer tutoring hours. \r\nIt would also be cool to have more optional, exploratory links to how this relates to important things going on in the real world. The last two lectures of the course were interesting. But what about how chemistry applies now, not just when the universe started? Dr. Cooper and Dr. Lant - what chem related news are you reading? Share cool articles and papers with us! I know you love chemistry and want us to feel the same way. Show us how cool it is when applied to things that we can see happening around us!

I appreciate the fact that it went gradually, but it makes me even more confused by the feeling I had throughout the course that, if I hadn&#39;t taken chemistry before, I would not have been able to navigate the coursework. Lectures moved quickly without much review, and lecture recordings were never posted. The homework Achieve assignments were somewhat helpful, but often they felt rote and repetitive, and they didn&#39;t engage any critical thinking. There was never any practice material available outside of discussion sections, which made it very difficult to review or prepare for examinations. Review sessions for exams were sparse, if they even occurred, and overall I don&#39;t think that there were ample support systems to help students understand the material if this was brand new to them. Exams, too, were often baffling: expectations constantly varied, and we had no way of knowing how to prepare for examinable content. It seemed apparent that the professor&#39;s only goal was to establish a nice curve and &quot;weed out&quot; those who were struggling, rather than making resources available to help them. I think that this class could be dramatically improved if lectures focused on APPLYING material in more depth and academic support was far better. Discussion sections, though, were a saving graceDr. Lant was kind and extremely helpful, and working through problems with others helped synthesize content far better.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow122_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10869&amp;evaluatorId=1550188&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pdc38&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1550188</span>\n                        1550188\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1550188</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>strengths: lecture - engaging, packed with just the right amount of information, enough time for questions\r\nweaknesses: discussion section - not engaging at all, did not learn anything, just basically 50 minutes of us sitting there while the TF was on his phone\r\nimprove: section by making it more of a learning space than a review session where the TFs work through the problem with you</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow123_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10869&amp;evaluatorId=1550581&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=pdc38&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1550581</span>\n                        1550581\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1550581</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I wish there were more practice questions.
