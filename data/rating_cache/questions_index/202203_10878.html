The quizzes, however, are not always well-matched to the class content.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow18_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10878&amp;evaluatorId=1626930&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ab2973&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1626930</span>\n                        1626930\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1626930</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Material is difficult to comphrehend, but Abhishek does a good job in guiding you through it. The p-sets, although challenging were very well designed to test your programming abilities and mastery of the concepts. The ULAs and office hours were very helpful. This course really pushes your endurence in CS. \r\n\r\nMy only complaint is that the final programming project could be handled better. Yes, it was to test your individual programming abilities, but not having office hours for help really suck. Your whole implementation could be wrong the whole time and you wouldn&#39;t know where to start to fix it. It&#39;s hard to learn the material and coding it at the same time.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow19_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10878&amp;evaluatorId=1627202&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ab2973&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1627202</span>\n                        1627202\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1627202</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: Prof Abhishek is an amazing lecturer and very engaging, I liked how every lecture was recorded, time given for psets were fair, time to prep for exams were fair, ULA and TA staff were great, OH were great\r\nWeaknesses: I find that tests on Gradescope are very odd for a CS class, I would probably prefer pencil and paper, additionally, I think OH could definitely be more efficient in terms of conceptual help vs debugging help (because then the conceptual help could encompass a whole group of people). Also, not really a weakness but I find the exam before reading week then a final project due at the end of finals is a bit of overkill, given that many people (including myself) could only really pour time into the project after my last final because working on the project was very time consuming.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow20_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10878&amp;evaluatorId=1627754&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ab2973&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1627754</span>\n                        1627754\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1627754</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: Great overall curriculum, fun and engaging PSETs, Professor Bhattacharjee is a great lecturer.

The course has pretty dense content that is covered at a somewhat quick pace, on top of that the psets take extremely long. We were often given additional things in lectures to go through in our own time. Considering how time consuming the homework assignments are for this class, I&#39;m not sure if it made sense for us to be given additional work to go over the lecture content which at times wasn&#39;t super related to what we were doing in our psets. I honestly think this course is worth 1.5 credits and it would be worthwhile to think about how to reframe it to be the workload of 1 regular class if it counts as 1 credit. I think the course is a deterrent to a lot of people considering the CS major, which really shouldn&#39;t be the case.

Professor Abhishek is a gem and did his best to keep students engaged throughout every course. However, the class was incredibly fast-paced, and we jumped from topic to topic very quickly, and it was difficult keeping track of every little detail or topic covered. Furthermore, while I felt that the lectures were engaging and packed with helpful material, the five projects did not always directly relate to the material we were learning in class. In some cases, the projects even contradicted conventions covered in class (eg: the L1 page table meant the root level in lecture and the leaf level in the project).

I think the major would greatly benefit from having this class be broken into two different courses. There was so much material that I felt like we flew through in class and so often Abhishek would tell us to go through the rest of the slides or do additional readings he put on Canvas. But, on top of the PSETs that took 30+ hours per week and the quizzes that could sometimes take another couple of hours, there was no time for going through the rest of the slides or reading any additional material. I wish I would have had the time to take my time learning each topic well and there is just no possible way of doing this with how tough this course is now. I realize it is not a fault of Abhishek, but more of Yale and their inability to respond to students well being. I as well as my friends who were taking the class often felt so awful because of this class, and numerous reviews before mine have said the same thing. I also believe that the final project was a bit too much. I felt like I devoted most of my reading period/finals to working on the project, only to not finish it. I had to push off studying for other finals, and overall the final project put a bad taste in my mouth. I realize it was supposed to push us out of our comfort zone but I felt like it was so ridiculously long that I couldn&#39;t do anything else but work on it. I also feel like the no drop policy kind of sucks. I understand why it&#39;s there, but also I did not do so hot on the first PSET despite starting early and working my butt off on it, and I felt like it weighed on me the entire semester. Also there was no late days which also was a bit rough. Some weeks I just needed a few extra hours but didn&#39;t want to take the 10% off.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow47_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10878&amp;evaluatorId=1629943&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ab2973&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1629943</span>\n                        1629943\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1629943</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think all of the strengths of this course lie in Abhishek and the TAs. He is kind, attentive, thoughtful, responsive, well-prepared, and consistently enthusiastic -- absolutely everything you could want from an instructor. The TAs were much the same -- I did not have a single bad experience with any of them I saw this semester. However,,, this course is a pipe dream. 323 manages to be a weed-out course, a time suck, and frankly not that useful for developing programming skills, and I finish the semester feeling burned out and empty. Abhishek tries to give you some agency at the beginning of the course by saying &quot;use the first two weeks to evaluate if this is the right semester for you to balance this course alongside your other commitments.&quot; However, unless you are a CS bot who has no hobbies, desires, or interests outside of your schoolwork (which admittedly is about 20-30% of the class lol), there is NO &#39;right semester&#39; for you to take this course. You just need to choke it down as soon as possible, at the inevitable expense of having a balanced life. Abhishek detests the moniker &quot;weed-out course,&quot; but when the 180-person course drops down to about 120 by the end of the semester, and I&#39;ve heard of several students saying they&#39;ll have to change their major if they don&#39;t do well enough in the course, there&#39;s not many other things you could call it. The fundamental issue with 323 is that the idea of the course, apparently dreamed up by old CS faculty and handed down to Abhishek, has little to do with reality. The sheer amount of work was unbearable and unacceptable for a major req in a department that claims to care about mental health. There was a consistent disconnect between lecture/exam material and homework material (yes, you often have to relearn the content under different specifications and naming conventions for the homework), and Abhishek added &#39;optional&#39; supplementary material that was key to understanding the material and doing well on exams, but almost nobody had the energy for these on top of doing the psets. Frankly, you have only a few paths to make it through this course: 1) you&#39;re a bot who has no other meaningful coursework and will give half-assed responses to your peers on Ed to let them know that you&#39;re very smart and know more than them (about 20% of the students), 2) you live in the office hours and/or do the assignments in a group, which is prohibited by the course policies, but in practice happens laughably often (~30% of the students choose this), or 3) suffer a lot of late nights, stress, and frustration and consistently try your best only to get Bs and Cs, because you try have a life outside of the course and a moral compass and thus didn&#39;t choose options 1 or 2 (the other 50%). Sure, the &quot;grade doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; but considering that the course does not really teach practical programming skills and is actually less enriching from a C perspective than 223, what else are we supposed to get of the course except our grades for all of our hard work? The vast majority of the class does not want to be computer systems researchers, they want to be software engineers, and while I think the material in this course was on the whole pretty interesting and cool, it is absolutely NOT worth the insane amount of headache and arbitrary difficulty. If this course is so necessary to the major, it really needs to be split into a yearlong sequence of two courses with reasonable workload. The one saving grace, again, was Abhishek, who was always there for you if you sent him an email or talked to him after class. Hopefully he will recognize (based on the astronomical number of students reaching out to him for extensions and other help) that this course is simply too much.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow48_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10878&amp;evaluatorId=1629949&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ab2973&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1629949</span>\n                        1629949\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1629949</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: abhishek and the teaching staff are otherworldly in their dedication.

Either way, you are going to end up taking the course. Regardless, 323 is tough yes. It is notoriously viewed as one of the harder, if not the hardest non-grad class at Yale. Conceptually, 323 tests many topics that may seem abstract compared to previous programming classes, but Abhishek does a great job explaining these concepts. The important thing to take away from this is that the primary reason 323 is rated so harshly is because of the TIME COMMITMENT. If you do not think you have the brain capacity to handle 323, I recommend surrounding it with easier courses like I did. By taking 323 with guts or electives that fill your distribution requirements or anything that doesn&#39;t command a hefty workload, you can focus all your time and attention on 323. I truly believe that if you plan your schedule and courseload wisely, then 323 is not that bad of a course. It is just a lot of time and effort that you need to dedicate weekly to your PSETS, and what ends up happening is that people can&#39;t spend as much time as needed because they have too many other PSETS/commitments to do. Also, just show up to lectures. All my friends skipped the lectures and they were lost. The recording software at Yale is spotty and not guaranteed to work all the time. Every second of 323 is spent teaching a new topic, and often when I go on my phone to scroll IG for one second, I am lost. If you show up to lectures, pay attention and go to Office Hours, then 323 is very doable.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow10_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10878&amp;evaluatorId=1621322&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ab2973&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1621322</span>\n                        1621322\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1621322</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Absolutely. 323 was the best computer science class I have taken at Yale. You learn so much about the inner workings of computers, which was something I had never learned in my other cs classes. It is a lot of work, but it&#39;s honestly not that bad if you start the projects early and go to office hours. If possible I would definitely recommend taking it with Abhishek, he&#39;s by far the best computer science professor I&#39;ve had at Yale.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow11_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10878&amp;evaluatorId=1623220&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ab2973&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1623220</span>\n                        1623220\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1623220</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Best CS class here at Yale with this Prof. You&#39;ll regret it if you don&#39;t take it.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow12_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10878&amp;evaluatorId=1626181&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ab2973&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1626181</span>\n                        1626181\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1626181</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>yes, for CS</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow13_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10878&amp;evaluatorId=1626360&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ab2973&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1626360</span>\n                        1626360\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1626360</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>You have to take it if you&#39;re CS, but for anyone who is interested in how computers actually work on a very low level the material in this class is really interesting</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow14_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10878&amp;evaluatorId=1626768&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ab2973&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1626768</span>\n                        1626768\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1626768</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>yea pretty important for the CS major</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow15_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10878&amp;evaluatorId=1626797&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ab2973&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1626797</span>\n                        1626797\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1626797</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>If you are not a cs major, don&#39;t even think about taking this course.

The course is a trial by fire, but you&#39;ll have a lot to show for it when you make it out. It&#39;s a required class for the major, so you&#39;ll probably have to take it. If you don&#39;t, I&#39;d only take it if you&#39;re really interested in the material (if you are, it&#39;s a great class).

If you start early and put in the work, you&#39;ll be rewarded.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow48_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10878&amp;evaluatorId=1629918&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ab2973&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1629918</span>\n                        1629918\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1629918</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Only if you are interested in lower level programming and systems.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow49_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10878&amp;evaluatorId=1629927&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ab2973&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1629927</span>\n                        1629927\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1629927</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>yes</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow50_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10878&amp;evaluatorId=1629938&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ab2973&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1629938</span>\n                        1629938\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1629938</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>If you are a computer science major you have to.

If I wasn&#39;t working on 323, I was thinking about how behind I was on the project. I led for a pretty miserable semester where I felt guilty a lot of times because I wasn&#39;t spending 24/7 working on the projects or I did not start the minute they came out. It was pretty rough every class when the professor would tell us to start early (which felt like he meant as soon as they came out ) and I had mounds of other work to catch up on from putting them off to work on 323. I felt pretty awful about this course the entire semester. Even when I did well, the average was so high that it didn&#39;t matter. I felt like there was no way to gain traction after my first PSET being not so great, and it weighed on me a lot throughout the semester. If you are going to take this course then make sure you take the lightest workload you can, find friends that you can talk through concepts with, and make sure to go to office hours earlier on in the projects.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow51_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10878&amp;evaluatorId=1629943&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ab2973&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1629943</span>\n                        1629943\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1629943</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No, but you&#39;re only taking this as a major requirement anyway, same as the rest of us.

Its a particular kind of stress that I wish Id known about before beginning. The psets are dauntingly large in scope, and that makes it hard to assess how near to the end you are. There were times I was freaking out, feeling lost in the sauce, when I was only one OH session of focused work away from finishing it. But if youd asked me beforehand, I would have had no idea whether I was four hours away or four days away from completion. So the prospect of not getting it done is always looming, and that is tough. I dont know if theres away for this to be better handled in the course admin side, but its a common sentiment.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow53_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10878&amp;evaluatorId=1629967&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ab2973&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1629967</span>\n                        1629967\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1629967</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes.

He also clearly cares a lot about his students. CPSC 323 has a reputation for being a lot of work, and it is, but that didnt bother me. The projects are long, but they didnt feel like busywork and definitely improved my understanding. If you start early, you can finish without too much stress, and this class has more office hours than any class Ive ever seen. TLDR: I recommend taking a relatively light courseload along with 323, but if you have the time, it will be one of the best classes you take at Yale.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow67_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10878&amp;evaluatorId=1630991&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ab2973&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1630991</span>\n                        1630991\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1630991</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>No this was a terrible experience.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow68_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202203&amp;crn=10878&amp;evaluatorId=1634861&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ab2973&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1634861</span>\n                        1634861\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1634861</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I would recommend taking this class.
