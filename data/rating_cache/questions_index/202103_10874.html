I often found myself spending several hours drawing chemical structures in ChemDraw, writing up the experimental plan, or studying for lab quizzes (approximately 8 hours per week, in addition to the actual time spent in the lab). One of the reasons why I spent so much time on this course is due to the relatively meticulous/harsh grading of the TAs. Missing a date or a single step would often mean a 5% deduction from the assignment, and I felt like I spent more time making sure my lab report was perfect rather than actually trying to understand the concepts. Thus, writing the experimental plan became busywork, and I often conducted experiments by knowing the steps rather than actually understanding the theory behind these steps. This could be improved by placing more emphasis on comprehension. For example, I often couldn&#39;t even really think through the quiz questions because we only had 5-10 minutes to take each one. I also could never find the time to do all of the textbook readings because I was so focused on perfecting my experimental plan. Thus, the course could be improved by reducing the amount of unnecessary point deductions and increasing the time we have to take quizzes. With less busywork, I would have had the time to read the chapters and understand the theory underlying the experiment better.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow8_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10874&amp;evaluatorId=1521750&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1521750</span>\n                        1521750\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1521750</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>It is an extremely well organized course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow9_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10874&amp;evaluatorId=1522332&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1522332</span>\n                        1522332\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1522332</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This course was very engaging and it felt like enjoyable to work in the lab.

Additionally, Dr. DiMeglio is kind, understanding, and knowledgeable (and also the only person I&#39;ve ever seen actually use the emergency eyewash on themself in a safety video--lots of respect for that), and the course packet that we work out of is comprehensive--you can read the packet and have a very clear understanding of how to proceed in the lab. The video series that acts as a companion to the packet sections is helpful for any lingering confusion. I also really enjoyed the concepts we were learning and the hands-on experimental nature of it all, but I&#39;m also a chemistry major, so take that with however much salt you deem necessary. The one downside to the class was the workload. Spending anywhere from ~4-5 hours per experimental plan and 4 hours in lab for a half credit class is a lot, definitely comparable to the other 1 credit classes I took this semester.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow26_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10874&amp;evaluatorId=1528645&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1528645</span>\n                        1528645\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1528645</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: really self-guided.

All of the assigned labs were able to finished comfortably within the given time frame, and the inclusion of pre-recorded run-throughs of the experiment were extremely beneficial in figuring out how to apply each experimental procedure to reality and showing how new experimental techniques should be performed. This course was definitely organized more for our learning without having the stress of grades being a deciding factor. That being said, the course was largely not intellectually stimulating. Most of the experimental protocols were explained before we used them in lab, but there were a few, including reflux and extraction, where the purpose and their mode-of-action was not immediately clear from the start. For these experimental methods, we were just instructed to do them without considering whether they could be optimized. Instead, if the experimental result/yield was less than optimal, these methods and possible error in their execution would be considered. However, I don&#39;t think this is an optimal learning strategy, and I believe that it would be better for all experimental methodologies/techniques to be gone over in their entirety, especially at the molecular level, before applying them in experiments. Additionally, the two post-lab assignments throughout the semester largely involved rehashing/rationalizing experimental results and reinforcing lab safety principles. While these exercises were beneficial, other questions/exercises (perhaps some about experimental design) would perhaps have added a critical thinking element to the post-lab assignments.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow54_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10874&amp;evaluatorId=1538639&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1538639</span>\n                        1538639\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1538639</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>strengths:\r\n- helped deepen the knowledge i learned in class\r\n- clear format\r\n- very helpful staff\r\n-fair assignment and grading systems</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow55_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10874&amp;evaluatorId=1538894&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1538894</span>\n                        1538894\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1538894</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Not all things explained in readings</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow56_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10874&amp;evaluatorId=1540070&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1540070</span>\n                        1540070\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1540070</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>It&#39;s a solid, well-developed, well-organized course.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow57_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10874&amp;evaluatorId=1541012&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1541012</span>\n                        1541012\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1541012</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The course is extremely well organized.

It&#39;s one of the few .5 credit courses that understands that it&#39;s .5 credits. I spent maybe 4 hours outside of lab on this class every week. Plus, this work was intentional. By that I mean, for every assignment it was clear to me that thought had been put into the design of the assignment, how much time it would take, and we were never asked to spend time on arbitrary things. If it was assigned, I knew I would only be expected to spend as much time as it took to learn the content and the grading would be completely fair and focus on whether I had learned the material. We weren&#39;t graded on arbitrary things like the format of graphs or sig figs. And, in class itself, the work is fun. I think the way the class builds on itself works beautifully. I was never overwhelmed or unsure because my TA was incredibly helpful, the pre-lab work was thorough and clear, and most importantly techniques were introduced gradually over the course of the semester. So, by the end, you could come in and only need at the t few words to understand the set-up of the experiment. You could list a step just as TLC 80/20 or melt point or IR or recrystallize with this and this and--because the techniques had been taught clearly and slowly--I could easily do whatever was required of me. I honestly cannot praise this course enough. \r\n\r\nThis class honestly has no weaknesses from my perspective.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow65_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10874&amp;evaluatorId=1545382&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1545382</span>\n                        1545382\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1545382</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>This was a pretty good course to learn organic chemistry techniques, especially if the student does not have much experience.

The reactions and the rationale behind procedures was explained very well, so I actually understood why I was doing what I was doing in lab! Also, big plus, the workload of this course is very fair -  actually commensurate with a half-credit course (unlike gen chem, where I was drowning in work.) Submitting experimental plans was also helpful because they helped reinforce what I would be doing in lab that week, which helped me prepare for each experiment. Quizzes were only every other week (weekly quizzes are very stressful!). No lab reports were required; instead we only had two major assignments called post-lab assignments, which emphasized conceptual understanding of course material rather than simply repeating the procedure and doing calculations (like the lab reports from gen chem, which I honestly didn&#39;t learn a lot from).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - submitting lab notes (not really a weakness, just tedious and time-consuming).</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow85_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10874&amp;evaluatorId=1555385&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1555385</span>\n                        1555385\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1555385</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>well structured</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow86_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10874&amp;evaluatorId=1555453&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1555453</span>\n                        1555453\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1555453</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Weaknesses: The labs were definitely on the longer side, so after being in SCL for a while, it got a little draining. Keeping a lab notebook and writing down all of the procedure when you are following exactly what you already wrote in the EP was a little excessive, in my opinion. That said, I understand the importance of developing good note-taking skills.\r\nStrengths: This course was far more relaxed than CHEM 134L/136L, so that was a huge relief. I think Dr. DiMeglio was also a huge perk of this course  she was truly one of the sweetest and most genuine people I&#39;ve come across at Yale. The experiments were also really interesting, and it was great to develop skills in a relaxed and encouraging environment.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow87_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10874&amp;evaluatorId=1555917&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1555917</span>\n                        1555917\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1555917</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>The quizzing is very difficult and seemed to include many questions that tried to trick you instead of testing what you really knew.

Good pacing (heavily graded tasks like quizzes and post labs are less frequent and there is ample time to complete them).\r\nWeaknesses: Introductory lab class is not generally that useful as the skills are not developed or applicable in an actual project. Ambiguous gradings across TAs and discontinuities between rubric in syllabus compared to standards of TA. Graded assignments do not accurately reflect an understanding or competence of lab knowledge (feels like busy work).

I feel like we would get points off because we missed certain elements that we did not even know needed to be included. I also think that the quizzes were unnecessarily difficult and did not always reflect what we were taught during the labs.

Overall, this course was MILES better than general chemistry lab.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow90_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10874&amp;evaluatorId=1556194&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1556194</span>\n                        1556194\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1556194</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes if needed - better than gen chem lab</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow91_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10874&amp;evaluatorId=1556255&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1556255</span>\n                        1556255\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1556255</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes absolutely</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow92_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10874&amp;evaluatorId=1556261&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1556261</span>\n                        1556261\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1556261</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I recommend the course if you need to fulfill the lab requirement for your major or pre-med.

It does a good job of showing you the basics of how organic chemistry is applied experimentally. The labs themselves are not difficult if you watched the video on how to correctly perform them. The experimental plans are extremely detailed and take a lot of time to complete, but you do end up getting faster at them by the end. I think the midterm and final reports for this class are very manageable and reflect what we have learned. The hardest part of this class were the quizzes.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow95_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10874&amp;evaluatorId=1556468&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=cmd6&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1556468</span>\n                        1556468\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1556468</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Only because there&#39;s no comparable alternative.
