This course, though brief in its examination of each subfield within psychology, reinforced by desire to major in the field.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow104_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1546312&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1546312</span>\n                        1546312\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1546312</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I loved learning about the brain and where certain moral decisions come from.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow105_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1546458&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1546458</span>\n                        1546458\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1546458</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Knowledge about human beings and why we behave the way we do</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow106_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1547573&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1547573</span>\n                        1547573\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1547573</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>general knowledge of psycology</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow107_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1547742&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1547742</span>\n                        1547742\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1547742</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I learned a lot about psychology and how psychological principles are applied all around us.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow108_0">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1548824&amp;questionId=YC401&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1548824</span>\n                        1548824\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1548824</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I gained a greater insight on psychology because I had never taken a psychology course before.

I ended up with a very piecemeal understanding of psychology, without a good sense of the underlying tenets that make up the field. Additionally, lectures were unbelievably shallow; each class consisted of going over a few vocabulary terms, glazing over a few case studies, and watching a few video clips on the various topics. Although this is an introductory class, I would have preferred if the instructor picked fewer topics and went more in-depth on each during class. Also, the course readings were largely pointless--textbook reading were exorbitantly long, assigned articles and videos were loosely connected to the course material, and none of the readings appeared to factor into exams/assessments. Likewise the reading summaries we were asked to write were effectively busywork and could be done without reading a single page.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow6_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1521369&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1521369</span>\n                        1521369\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1521369</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Taught by a bad professor.

Additionally, Professor Holmes was extremely kind and engaging with students.

I also struggled with the reading responses; the feedback for them was very little, and even after emailing my TF for insights, I found that I didn&#39;t know how to improve.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow12_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1522057&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1522057</span>\n                        1522057\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1522057</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Very good course</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow13_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1522114&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1522114</span>\n                        1522114\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1522114</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>There could be a few more interesting topics but overall it was great.

For each of the assignments and tests in the course, we were provided with very clear guidelines on what to expect and how to best tackle the assignment/test. Overall, the support provided for this introductory class was great. The assignments and tests were also very straightforward and easy; I don&#39;t think I spent more than 1 hour on any particular reading response and more than 2 days studying for any particular test. To study for the tests, you basically had to rewatch the lectures and memorize the key terms and concepts for the exam; it was more of an exercise in recalling the lecture material during the exam than thinking about it abstractly and applying it. You can also get away with not reading the textbook in this course, since the exam barely asks about experiments/key concepts from the textbook and you can just write your reading responses on the outside readings assigned in the syllabus. (The textbook readings are very long, so halfway through the semester, I just stopped reading it).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I thought the summary part of the book report was an unnecessary component of the book report that just felt like busy work; the books were so long and contained so much material that it was impossible to adequately summarize everything with the level of detail that the rubric requires. I ended up skipping over 3 entire chapters of my book in my summary just to stay within the word limit. I felt that the reading responses suffered the same issue: the level of detail required conflicts with the required word limit. I often had to cut out a lot of the meat in my reading responses because it could not fit within 250 words. I recommend that the word limit be extended to 350 words to remedy this issue.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow26_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1532351&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1532351</span>\n                        1532351\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1532351</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think that weekly discussions with TFs would be beneficial.

The practice exams were very helpful in preparing for exams and the workload was very reasonable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The practice tests often had sections that were not covered in that specific section of the course, making it harder to study appropriately.

I thought it would be more applicational, but typically we were just tested on definitions and concepts. Also, I believe some of the assignments did not facilitate any academic engagement - the reading responses were not engaging and the application part of the Book Report did not seem useful or helpful in any way. The teaching fellows also did not really aid in my learning. When we had exams, we would only receive the score and no feedback/no papers given back. I understand that the class is large but I never knew what I got wrong on the tests. That was my biggest concern. Also, during the review sessions, sometimes the TA&#39;s did not know answers to the questions or only gave vague descriptions.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow35_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1537163&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1537163</span>\n                        1537163\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1537163</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Strengths: This course was very organized with the lessons/ homeworks matching the syllabus perfectly. \r\nWeaknesses: I do not know if it was the timing of the course or location in an auditorium with cushioned seats, but many of us felt very sleepy during lectures.

I had taken a bunch of other intro level social science courses so I was familiar with most of the material. Given that, my level of engagement was still surprisingly decent. The material for intro psych is inherently interesting, but it&#39;s still possible to mess that up with dry lecturing, but the material was well-presented. The exams are not bad at all. Reading responses are also pretty harmless.\r\n\r\nOnly thing that I did *not* like was the book review assignment. First, I&#39;ll cover what I did like about it: It forced me to read a really interesting book that I otherwise wouldn&#39;t have read, and the things I learned from that book will definitely stick with me. That&#39;s the end of the positives, though. \r\n\r\nThings I did not like about it: The timing. It was due the TUESDAY AFTER November break. I know the assignment was available all semester. That doesn&#39;t mean anything though -- people have other assignments to do at other points in the semester, and very very very few people are going to start on this more than a week before it&#39;s due. That week is November break. No assignment should force people to give up part of their well-deserved break to focus on school. That&#39;s not what a break is for. The due date needs to be moved -- one week later, or before the break.\r\n\r\nSecond thing: The mismatch between the assignment prompt and the rubric. You should know everything you need to do for an assignment from reading the prompt, plain and simple. That&#39;s not the case with this one. The rubric specifies ENTIRELY NEW SECTIONS of the paper that are not mentioned in the prompt. And that&#39;s not to mention the little things. Every single section of the rubric mentions things that are not mentioned in the prompt. If you do not read it before starting your assignment, you better be ready to do some significant rewriting (and if you did not read it at all...oof). Do some things go without saying? Yes. Obviously, they want a paper that flows well and is free of proofing errors. Other things, though, not so much: describing a book&#39;s value/contribution to the field in your intro (the prompt does not even mention an intro), placing the book within its context in the broader field of psych in your argument section (this is completely out of place in this section, also not mentioned in the prompt), and I could go on. The prompt needs to be updated so that students can know everything they need to do without cross-referencing the rubric.\r\n\r\nSaved this for last because I think it&#39;s pretty unlikely to change: the summary portion. Your summary has to be 1000 WORDS. This is excessive. The last time I had to summarize a book at length like this was middle school. It was tedious, monotonous, and despite all of the fuss they make in the rubric about &quot;doing college-level work,&quot; this did not feel like a college assignment. Any student here can give you the main arguments of a book in a paragraph. I can see the argument for this: requiring such a long summary makes it more likely that people have to actually read the book to complete the assignment. Fair enough, but I don&#39;t think this is necessary. The argument portion of the essay, where the student has to give their own original thoughts and use critical thinking, is far more interesting. If this were made more in-depth and the summary section was greatly shortened, I&#39;m sure who read and who did not would still show up in how nuanced the student&#39;s argument or application is, and would still distinguish low/med/high quality essays.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow69_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1540114&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1540114</span>\n                        1540114\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1540114</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Can be made more interactive</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow70_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1540215&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1540215</span>\n                        1540215\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1540215</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>A strength of the course was how each midterm tested the same amount of material since they werent cumulative.

I hope that next semester my econ course will have that but I doubt it will.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow76_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1540561&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1540561</span>\n                        1540561\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1540561</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Book review and very general</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow77_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1540662&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1540662</span>\n                        1540662\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1540662</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>For a large lecture class, it was very well\r\norganized.

The class was fast pace since there was so much material to cover, but as a result, we learned a lot - just not in depth.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow95_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1543223&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1543223</span>\n                        1543223\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1543223</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>half of test was not explicitly covered in lecture</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow96_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1543739&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1543739</span>\n                        1543739\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1543739</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I dont think that the book review really builds on any of the other skills in the course or is necessary.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow97_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1543823&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1543823</span>\n                        1543823\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1543823</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>I think the strengths are the material and that the topics were very engaging and Professor Holmes did a good job engaging such a large lecture and I think the weakness of the class was the lecture format because students can&#39;t ask questions or as the professor to repeat something if it didn&#39;t make sense or wasn&#39;t clear.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow98_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1543837&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1543837</span>\n                        1543837\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1543837</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Great lecture format and accommodations.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow99_2">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1543968&amp;questionId=YC403&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1543968</span>\n                        1543968\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1543968</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Prof. Holmes was generally engaging, and I enjoyed the book review final assignment.

The rest of the grade came from writing assignments which, in my opinion, were not useful for my learning.

I wish we were incentivized to engage with the material more and have exam questions like &quot;offer a critique of this theory...&quot; or provide an example that might disprove this theory&quot; that would incentivize us to stretch our minds a little more instead of just regurgitate what was said in lecture. It was super disheartening and pretty unmotivating to study for. \r\n\r\nProf Holmes is kind and offers to help  - but unlike many of my other classes there isn&#39;t anything to &quot;get help with&quot; really in office hours. The material is just straight memorization and there&#39;s nothing to understand. Like you just listen to the lectures and make a quizlet for the exam. \r\n\r\nI also don&#39;t like how you don&#39;t get the exams back to see where you made mistakes. How are we supposed to improve or learn otherwise?\r\n\r\nI did learn some cool things though which I will use in my life, but overall I wouldn&#39;t take this course if I could go back in time.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow62_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1539976&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1539976</span>\n                        1539976\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1539976</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow63_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1539983&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1539983</span>\n                        1539983\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1539983</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, this course gives a fantastic overview of many different topic in psychology, and Professor Holmes teaches it in an interesting and fun way.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow64_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1539993&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1539993</span>\n                        1539993\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1539993</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes, I really enjoyed sitting in this class and learning about psychology.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow65_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1540006&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1540006</span>\n                        1540006\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1540006</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Absolutely.

It is not easy to do well in this class if you don&#39;t regularly attend lecture, at least scan the textbook readings, and start preparing a few days in advance of the tests. This means that you have to be somewhat invested in the class to a degree which may take some of your time away from classes you might deem more important.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n            <tr id="answerRow92_8">\n                <td>\n                    <a class="no-print" href="/ocedashboard/studentViewer/evaluator?termCode=202103&amp;crn=10728&amp;evaluatorId=1541617&amp;questionId=YC409&amp;netIdFor=ah724&amp;source=narrative">\n                        <span class="show-for-sr">Navigate to all answers for Respondent Id 1541617</span>\n                        1541617\n                    </a>\n                    <span class="show-for-print">1541617</span>\n                </td>\n                <td>Yes!

If you think you have any interest whatsoever in psychology, this is such a great class to take to get a really good overview of the most important aspects of psychology. The course does go very fast and does not go super in depth with much specifics, but it introduces you to so many areas of psych that you can then do further study in the areas that interested you the most. Plus, it is a very manageable class, especially with Professor Holmes as the professor. 3 non-cumulative exams (non-cumulative for a reason - there&#39;s a lot of information to know for each exam but still manageable) and 6 reading responses.</td>\n            </tr>\n        \n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n                                \n                            </div>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </main>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div id="yale-footer-bottom" class="no-print" role="contentinfo">\n    <footer role="contentinfo" class="yale-footer">\n        <div class="footer-logo row">\n            <div class="column small-4 large-3 columns">\n                <a class="y-icons y-yale y-mark" href="http://www.yale.edu/"><span class="show-for-sr">Yale\n                </span></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class="small-8 large-9 columns">\n                <p class="copyright spacer" style="font-size: .8rem;">\n                    Copyright &copy; <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear())</script> Yale University <span aria-hidden="true">&middot;</span> All rights reserved <span aria-hidden="true">&middot;</span>\n                    <a title="Yale Privacy policy" href="http://www.yale.edu/privacy.html" style="text-decoration: underline">Privacy policy</a>\n                    <span aria-hidden="true">-</span>\n                    <a href="https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility/accessibility-yale" style="text-decoration: underline">Accessibility at Yale</a>\n                    \n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </footer>\n</div>\n\n\n<script type="text/javascript" src="/ocedashboard/assets/app-64ec30218e4e8f6eca224a18684e4884.js" ></script>\n<script type="text/javascript" src="/ocedashboard/assets/jquery-ui.min-b0ba1d1ac5ef9706219d68b4ecfcd5b3.js" ></script>\n<script type="text/javascript" src="/ocedashboard/assets/jquery.multiselect-a52ab3a5ee20a1f9138c469e94241a1a.js" ></script>\n\n<script>\n    $(window).bind("load", function () {\n        var footer = $("#yale-footer-bottom");\n        var pos = footer.position();\n        var height = $(window).height();\n        height = height - pos.top;\n        height = height - footer.height();\n        if (height > 0) {\n            footer.css({\n                \'margin-top\': height + \'px\'\n            });\n        }\n    });\n    function loadingMessage() {\n        $("body").css("cursor", "progress");\n        $("#loadingMessage").show();\n    }\n    function clearLoadingMessage() {\n        $("body").css("cursor", "default");\n        $("#loadingMessage").hide();\n    }\n\n</script>\n<script>\n\n\n    (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\'GoogleAnalyticsObject\']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n            (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n        m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n    })(window,document,\'script\',\'https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\',\'ga\');\n\n    ga(\'create\', \'UA-100715343-1\', \'auto\');\n    ga(\'send\', \'pageview\');\n\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n'
