<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: you will learn A LOT. There is a website with the notes for the entire class that is very comprehensive and super helpful for psets. Office hours are super helpful; even if you've never used them before, you will almost definitely use them in this course.
Weaknesses: the lectures are very boring and incredibly disorganized; he spends most of his time debugging the code he is writing. It's honestly not worth going to if Aspnes is teaching it again. You should probably just look at the syllabus with the notes. <br/></div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â They need to offer FAR more support/guidance for students. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class was well-designed and very informative. One thing I would have preferred was more clarity on the specs of certain assignments. I sometimes found myself a little confused with the specifics of the assignment. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures in the course were not very strong. It was difficult especially virtually to follow along, especially if seeing a concept for the first time. Almost all of the coding I learned through Professor Aspnes' notes (which were excellent), through TAs, or online. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The grade was just the average of 12 psets, no participation or exam component. This makes it pretty scary if you can't figure out one pset because you risk getting a 0, but if you start early and work with other people and GO TO OFFICE HOURS you'll be fine. I loved the automated grading and efficient nature of the course, but it does feel a bit impersonal and intimidating if it's not your style. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course makes you much better at programming in C! Lectures move pretty fast (in this sense having the lectures recorded was a blessing because I could go back and watch stuff I missed) and Aspnes isn't always the most engaging, but overall he's a good lecturer/professor; he tried to answer all of the questions in the chat and adjust based on feedback. Another weakness is that we zipped through a lot of data structures, especially near the end, so I don't really know how much I understand the content covered near the end of the class. One of the strengths of this course is the TAs -- they are SO HELPFUL; however, the set up of OH was also a weakness because the queue would sometimes get super long (like, more than 20 people for 3 or 4 TAs) and you had to be there as soon as OH started. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength of the course was definitely the online notes and code that were provided, they really helped me study the concepts even after the lecture. A weakness was that sometimes certain aspects of the material was brushed over and not clarified very well. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the lectures were interesting and that the ULAs and workshops were very helpful. I enjoyed having weekly assignments rather than projects and exams. I did not have a clear sense of where I stood in the class grade-wise, however. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would say the strongest aspects of this course were the extensive resources available to students beyond lectures. Professor Aspnes provided detailed notes with multiple examples, while TAs and ULAs held office hours multiple times of the day ,every day of the week in addition to Professor Aspness instruction. I have no complaints with the course, though I do wish the problem sets were given with longer deadlines because I often found myself pressed for time as some psets took me 12 hours+. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the lectures themselves were quite hard to follow in terms of learning content through live coding sessions. However, there was a clear schedule to the course. The problem sets aligned nicely with what we learned during the lectures. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the lectures were very informative. In addition, there were plenty of teaching assistants who were very helpful in office hours. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Under Dr. Aspnes, this course did not prove as stressful as the typical CPSC 223 experience. We had weekly homework assignments which were quite reasonable, so I never felt overwhelmed by the course. Some assignments took a significant amount of debugging, but it was a mostly enjoyable experience. I think the strengths of this course lie in the support from ULAs. There are plentiful office hours, which is very helpful when working on assignments. To improve the course, I would suggest moving slightly faster through the initial lectures on the C programming language. Everyone should have some programming background, so it felt unnecessary to spend such a considerable amount of time on basic boolean or arithmetic operations. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â During this semester, one of the greatest strengths of the course was the lack of exams. In former CS courses (both at Yale and outside Yale), I have found CS exams to have a negative impact on my learning; instead of bettering my programming abilities and working to optimize my code and increase the rate at which I could solve problems, I had exams which forced me to be bogged down by theoretical subtleties which I inevitably forgot in the weeks after an exam and that failed to assess the problem-solving skills the problem sets build over time. Although the lack of exams likely compressed the grading distribution and thus potentially hindered the ability for course instructors to create distinctions between levels of performance, it greatly boosted my ability to learn.

The workshops were also very useful, and well-executed. Similarly, yet to an even greater extent, the ULA OH were fantastic; the system was quite robust and enabled seemingly the most efficient OH system, and the ULAs themselves were almost always extremely patient, kind, knowledgeable, and helpful. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The assignments were fun to work on. Lectures were enjoyable but especially towards the beginning bogged down by questions of questionable merit. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Really liked the pset format and office hours support, but lectures were not very engaging (mostly just drawing on whiteboard) -- could use more applications / visual supplements <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Aspnes is very engaging and funny. Office hours were helpful a lot of the times! The TA's tried really hard to support students by holding review sessions for topics. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Not enough good things can be said about the TAs and ULAs. Holy cow, they are fantastic. Especially in C where there are so many technicalities that could go wrong, their help in office hours was absolutely essential to pass many of the test cases. And despite them often walking you through what you're trying to do (it's hard to give general hints in CS that are also helpful), I still managed to learn so much from them. Truly amazing - every last one of them. :)
For the rest of the class, Dr. Aspnes is really funny in class and knows his stuff inside out; it was a privilege to attend lectures with him. I also really appreciated the student community in this class (despite being remote, we had an active GroupMe and Discord server) that provided support whenever I needed it.

Weaknesses: I'd say one thing that could be improved is more homogeneity in what development environment we used. The TAs and students were split between Vim (which Dr. Aspnes used in lectures), VS Code (which everyone used in the fall but then didn't like so the staff did not universally recommend it this time) and numerous other text editors. This made it harder to seek help because people weren't seeing eye to eye on debugging strategies, for example. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: ULAs, content of courses

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the course notes are a very helpful resource. In terms of what can be improved, I didn't find the textbook helpful for learning data structures. Maybe listing another, more relevant textbook would be helpful. Additionally, some of Prof. Aspnes' lectures are just watching him code in C. I haven't taken any other CS classes so maybe this is the norm, but I feel that something like a Powerpoint may be more effective at conveying the information we need to learn. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked a lot that the course was project based and that there were many assignments which took off the pressure for each one. I learned a lot from the projects about to build data structures. The course didnt emphasize as much how to use data structures (the assignments often told you which one to use) which could be a helpful skill for coding interviews.

In particular, the course notes were very detailed and well-organized, the assignments were interesting and helped me internalize the content, and the lectures did a good job of explaining things.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The Coding assignments are practical, which can make them more interesting to work on and think about. Youre usually implementing things that mildly apply to real life. Theres also a great feeling when you complete them. This may be the case for any CS class, though. The class is also not too difficult if youre able to read between the lines of the spec.They have something they clearly want you to do on every assignment and that direct task is never too difficult.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Overall the course was very strong. Sometimes I got a bit lost in lecture and frequently did not use the lecture notes. However, there is nothing that is bad in the structure of the course itself. It was very well taught and all the psets were clearly centered around furthering my understanding as a student.
The course also had both intuitive and very rigorous approaches to explaining concepts which I really liked and help me understand many of the topics. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think a strength of this course was being a computer science class remote learning worked better for this course than some of my other courses. I think that the lecture style with going over new concepts and then actually testing them out in a code editor was helpful. I also think having recorded lectures was a strength of the course that allowed me to review certain concepts while doing psets in a way I wouldn't be able to do with in person live lectures. A weakness would be that having such a large class on zoom made it so I didn't really get to know my fellow classmates but this wouldn't really be an issue in the future hopefully. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It's a tough class. Having more TAs might make it better for the students, since they were really helpful with the homework, but were often overwhelmed later in the week. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: plenty of resources (notes, lectures, slides), engaging lectures, office hours support for psets

Weaknesses: sometimes office hours were overcrowded, likely because virtual learning inhibited students from forming study groups amongst themselves <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures were entertaining and clear. Professor Aspnes did a great job with the visualization of the data structures and code in general.

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Recordings of lectures were helpful for catching up and review. The class website has all the course content and sample code, which are very helpful for review and psets. Given the below regarding the 2 main learning channels of this course, the website was vital.
Weaknesses: Lectures are very fast and confusing, and don't fully explain things sometimes. Pset instructions were often unclear. In office hours, when you have to wait 2 hours in the queue, only to get kicked off without even getting to ask your question or only to get no answers or insulted, it feels terribly hopeless. Several ULAs avoided answering my questions, kicked me off the queue, or spent only a few minutes with me. They said it's because "That depends on your implementation" or "I can't tell you the answer" or "I need to get to other people in the queue." One ULA even said, "This is not the kind of question you bring to office hours. You're halfway through the class already" and "Office hours is only for asking conceptual questions" and accused me of making him do my homework for me. Office hours made me feel so lost, alone, discouraged, and invalidated. Students would greatly appreciate if office hours and ULAs are patient, share knowledge generously, and admit it when they don't know how to help, instead of wasting students' time with excuses and negativity. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Very organized course notes and helpful lectures. Professor Aspnes explains concepts and code clearly and honestly, while being one of the funniest professors in lecture I know of. Assignments this semester were pretty chill--cool and concise programming challenges that use what we learn in class without being overbearing in workload. Having no exams in exchange for a couple extra assignments I think was a good call (exams for intro CS classes tend not to be so helpful and effective in my opinion), but not sure if this will be the case for future classes. No weaknesses. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The amount of resources put into this course was remarkable. Between the abundance of notes posted online, the recorded lectures, and the office hours, it was rare to get hung up on a question/bug for too long. That said, the class was content-driven to the point where interaction with peers and TAs was pretty minimal. It might just be a product of covid, but the course felt a bit impersonal at times. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Virtual lectures were optional and recorded, Aspnes is an extremely chill instructor. You can take the entire class asynchronously, which some students did

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course goes over a lot of content - which is very good. The notes for the course are detailed, and the code examples are extremely useful.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was very structured -- from the assignments to the lectures. But, I do wish there was some sort of exam that tested my knowledge because the 12 assignments themselves don't require the actual conceptual learning. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures use a combination of drawings and coding sections, which gives us good visual intubation before diving into the code, so it was much easier to understand, and watching the professor writing and debugging the code live is both instructional and entertaining, and we got to see tools like vim, gdb, and valgrind in action, which is really nice. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was good! But it's easy for students to get lost sometimes and then go to office hours but not really learn as deeply as they could. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Interesting problem sets! Taking this class has made me a least a little excited about taking 323. Aspnes' detailed course notes are online, lecture code was also posted online. This made it easier to review what was discussed in lecture at your own pace, or to even self-study completely. Grades were completely based on assignments this semesterno midterms or finalso your grade was relatively more predictable. TA's could help you debug, and the groupme + discord chats were relatively active and had many helpful people asking and answering questions. Ed discussion posts were responded to quickly, and TA office hours generally had helpful, patient TA's. 

Strength and weakness: For this Aspnes class, aside from a small handful of test cases, most final test cases were very close to the public tests, so there wasn't too much racking your brain over coming up with weird edge cases. Also, especially for some assignments, the set-up of the structures has a lot of copying and pasting lecture code (ex. for tree structures) and then modifying it. The majority of the work is still your thinking, but I could complete assignments while still being lost on how some methods from class worked.

Weaknesses: Although covered in lectures, assignments didn't quite reemphasize some of the trivia-esque knowledge of computers, C, and its programming tricks that probably would be asked about on a test. Not a complaint because I didn't have to study and could solely focus on specs and debugging. However, while I walk away with better coding ability and some understandings, I'm sure I lack some small but useful details that might've made me a better programmer had the class been in person or included some midterms. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: Prof Aspnes is highly knowledgeable and is a very engaging lecturer. The problem sets will take a few hours but are very interesting and rewarding. You will definitely learn a lot from the course.

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â You definitely learn a lot about data structures in the class, and the class itself isn't too boring or dry, although lectures aren't very engaging. I feel like you end up really learning/understanding the material by doing the problem sets rather than watching the lectures, which feels pretty normal for a STEM class. However, it is sometimes difficult to apply the concepts you learn in lecture to the homework, so I ended up attending office hours a lot during my time in the course, and the queues were sometimes super long (longest I waited was three hours) <br/></div>
