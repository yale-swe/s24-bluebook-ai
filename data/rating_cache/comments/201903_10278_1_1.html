<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class only has strengths. Prof. Roberts is a huge one, obviously. She is a phenomenal lecturer and cares so deeply about her students. The work is light, but designed to make you think deeper about the class content. It also makes the course more accessible to students from all backgrounds. The readings are engaging and interesting. Going to lecture is genuinely enjoyable, despite the distressing nature of the material. <br/></div>
</div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Roberts is one of the best lecturers that I have ever had exposure to on Yale's campus. Every lecture is a new rollercoaster of emotions, discovery, and knowledge. Professor Roberts is able to absorb you into every lecture as she teaches as if telling a story and leaves you changed after every lecture. Further, my TA is one of the best TAs that I have ever had. She brings so much positive energy to every discussion section, which is very much needed in a course with heavy material. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class is amazing. There is nothing that needs to be changed. This professor is probably the best professor I have ever had because she cares so much and dedicates so much time. This is the best course of my entire time at Yale even though I am not the biggest fan of learning history. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â No weaknesses, only all strengths. Professor Roberts is an incredible lecturer - literally, after every single lecture there was a standing ovation for her. <br/></div>

</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â No weaknesses. This course was designed so that each student took take their learning into their own hands, and that is the true power of education. It makes people passionate about material that can be used for good. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Roberts is brilliant and kind, everyone could learn from her. 

I only wish we had a chance to talk about HIV/AIDs or other health epidemics in the late 20th century before we arrive at modern day. Especially felt like we had a lot of time to talk about intersectionality with regards to Black women -- which was great!-- but less time for Afro-Latinx people or queer Black people and their unique health challenges. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths - prof, tfs, content, thought-provoking sections, emotional release, literally everything
weaknesses - n/a <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The class was honestly so enjoyable to go to everyday, and grades are not an issue (there is extra credit given on the midterm, and she gives the questions in advance). It is an easy A because Professor Roberts cares more about her students taking a risk and exploring topics that actually interest them rather than the safe ones that would typically be explored in a class in which. grades are more of a concern. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course include the importance of the material, the determination and compassion of Professor Roberts and the teaching fellows, the ability for any student to take the class. The fact that grades were not the most prevalent factor of this course improved engagement as students genuinely learned the material for the sake of learning and bettering themselves. If there were any weaknesses, they were unnoticeable. This class is so different from any of the other lecture classes I have taken at Yale since Professor Roberts made herself available to students and emphasized student engagement over passive learning. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is incredible.  Such a breath of fresh air compared to the typical academic pressure from other courses at Yale.  The way Prof. Roberts structures this course is relaxed, but you still learn so much information by the end of the semester.  Other Yale professors should seriously take note.  Professor Roberts has got it figured out.  The fact that you are not overwhelmed and trying to cram large amounts of information into your brain allows you to spend time reflecting on the material, and therefor you remember and actually grasp so much more. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was really great as it is. Professor Roberts did an amazing job quickly managing the much higher than expected workload. The discussion sections felt intimate and still allowed us to get a lot from the material despite it being lecture focused. Some of the guest speakers were not as engaging as I would have liked. There were definitely times when I would have preferred hearing Professor Roberts cover the same material because she's just the amazing. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class is perfect in my opinion. The assignments were fun and engaging and open-ended, so allowed for creativity and exploration of specific topics we were interested in. Every lecture was interesting to listen to and I learned something new in each one. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The only weakness of this class is that it is only 50 minutes long; too short. Dr. Roberts is the BIGGEST strength. She is a powerhouse researcher, a fantastic orator, and a magnificent advisor. Her work and her pedagogy should be the template for all professors at Yale. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course is one of the strongest I have ever experienced at Yale. The TA selection was impeccable - all teachers were so kind and empathetic and really invested in students' learning.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: literally EVERYTHING. hands down, best class I've taken at yale. multiple lectures where the class is moved to tears. Professor Roberts is the best, kindest, most caring human at Yale and I wish all of my classes could be taught by her. She cares so much about students! Other lecturers in the history department dont give one F about students. Not her! She should honestly lead a workshop or something for other professors at Yale so they can learn how to be better. This class is not a big workload or stressful in terms of grades, but it is extremely intensive in how deeply you are made to think. This class was a new kind of hard in that it was very difficult to read such sad readings and learn such devastating facts and histories and to make intellectual analyses. It is very hard to think deeper than beyond "this is so fucked up how could people be so horrible", but you have to! This class definitely challenged me. 
Weaknesses: NOTHING. I wish I could take this class for another semester. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Roberts cares an enormous amount for her students, and she lectures very elegantly.

She does not gloss over the hard parts, but she also highlights some inspiring and hopeful stories in the midst of a very painful history. Also, she always links things in the past to things in the present, making the lecture even more impactful. Every single reading was so interesting, and every single lecture was so powerful.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course only has strengths. Dr. Roberts is the first of her department to teach such a course, queen of lecturing, queen of intersectional history, unfazed, bringer of important racial history to all premeds, wizard of primary sources, undefeated in delivering engaging lectures and the best professor I've ever had at Yale (and I'm 37 credits deep at this point). Truly, Yale does not deserve her. This is the most organized, well taught, though-provoking, and important course I have ever taken. I loved every single lecture. You can tell that Dr. Roberts puts a lot of attention and detail into each slide and each unit. Her background in theater clearly shines through during her engaging lectures. She puts so much effort into making sure that we have everything we need to succeed and that there are ample options to explore the topics that we are interested in. This is the first class I've ever taken where the professor uploads so many resources for our own leisure that she had to ask to get more storage added to the Canvas page! The assignments were well thought out (unlike many lazy professors who just have you write the same analysis paper over and over again) and really aided the kind of thinking she was trying to encourage us to do in the class. The guest lectures were great and I loved how they tied into the central themes of the content. No weaknesses!!! - and I certainly don't know how Dr. Roberts could improve such a wonderful and well put-together course. <br/></div>

In addition, the selection of readings were engaging and supported and enhanced the class material without being redundant, and amount of reading was manageable. Finally, the essays are fairly open ended, and the grading is generous, which gives students space and time to think and discuss and further research the course content without simply memorizing and reciting for a grade. <br/></div>

There is no mold that you are trying to fit, you get to write about the aspects of the class that have personally spoken to you, and that's pretty cool in my opinion. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was extremely informative, well organized, important, and inspiring. The materials were emotionally challenging; as a non-Black person of color taking this course, I think it is necessary that more people should learn about this history in order to see the fuller picture of the inequities that affect people of color, especially Black and brown people. Assignments and tests were fair; students had the opportunity to be creative and thoughtful. I appreciate the practicality of these assignments (e.g. you can publish your op-ed or conduct your lesson plan) as a way to spread insights and knowledge about Black/African American history in medicine and public health to others. I don't know and can't speak for any shortcomings about the class. <br/></div>

One can easily not attend class and somehow pass with B+/A- but the way the lecture is structured and taught, we wouldn't want to miss it even if we are sick in bed. The professor really engages with the material and it is evident that she loves it, and she wants us to know why. The time she spends getting to know her students is also worth-noting. There are more than 300 students in the lecture and she doesn't miss a chance to get to know her students from chatting with us before class, to hosting almost 24/7 long office hours and meals. It is really impressive and is the main reason why this class is so AMAZING. Will always forever be the best class ever offered at Yale!! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is WONDERFUL. There are no weaknesses at all. For starters, Professor Roberts is someone who cares so deeply about her students and the course. She mentioned how she would stay up past midnight some nights in order to prepare a high-quality lecture for us. Since the class was so big this year, she set aside an entire day once a month for extra office hours as well as weekly lunches so that she could talk to as many of us as possible. She never put a cap on the class size either and simply worked hard to hire more TAs to accommodate all of us. Professor Roberts said in the first lecture that her goal is for us to think critically and deeply about this material. The material of this class is also incredibly engaging and important. It includes everything that many high schools leave out when they teach U.S. slavery. We learned about how slaves' bodies were commodified and abused due to forced medical experimentation, grave-robbing (in order to use African American bodies as cadavers), racial science, lynching, and more. We also learned about the historical segregation and present-day racism in the U.S. healthcare system. Professor Roberts is a very engaging lecturer and manages to present so much information in just 50 minutes. My section TA was also amazing. She made our section into an incredibly warm and welcoming space were we could discuss these painful topics. The workload of this class was also very manageable. I did all of the readings as well because they were so interesting. The assignments were also very creative. In addition to a standard paper, we also wrote an op-ed and designed a syllabus for a workshop. Overall, I only have positive reviews for this class. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Dr Roberts was 10/10. Her devotion to the cause of the course was inspiring.

Could not recommend any improvements. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The biggest strength is Professor Roberts. Anything that a professor can do to be excellent,cshe does tenfold. Because of that, the only potential weakness was by the end of the semester when we had a couple of guest lecturers who even though they were very good, simply could not live up to the standard set by Professor Roberts. Every lecture is fascinating and engaging, and every reading feels gripping and relevant. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really can't find very many weaknesses to the course. Dr. Roberts was constantly concerned with making sure the class flowed during the semester. Her syllabus was also so meticulously designed from the start, that it didn't really lend itself to any issues. The beauty of her class is that she practically let us take every assignment in any direction we chose, forcing us to truly engage with the material, but also giving us the liberty to actually enjoy our assignments. <br/></div>

She is so full of charisma and presents a very difficult history with so much sensitivity, compassion, and care. This is a must-take class because nearly all careers Yalies aspire to go into have some stake in the social determinants of health. Furthermore, basic knowledge of the intersections of race and medicine is so important. Weaknesses: N/A. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I loved that this class forced me to think about race and American history in a totally new way. Learning about the violence and racial terror that fills this country's history was incredibly valuable, and often very moving. I was on the verge of tears in class more than once. Additionally, learning about this history required serious personal reflection on my part as a white person; I never thought that much about what it meant to be white before this class. That was awesome and I will never forget it. As for weaknesses, I think the assignments could have been a little more serious. Professor Roberts wanted this class to be low stress, and I do appreciate that. But I wonder if it went a little too far and if the class could be improved by having one longer paper. It was mostly fantastic though! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of the course was the lectures of Professor Roberts, whose intention was to create a course where student could prioritize learning rather than grades or perfectionism. It was a very refreshing way to learn about a deserving and delicate topic. I think this a true strength of the course. Its weakness perhaps was the occasional simplicity of some historical background material, which many were already familiar with. While little-discussed topics such as convict-leasing and the mothers of gynecology were discussed we probably didnt need to spend as much time on the rote history of the Civil War or the politics of reconstruction. The focus on health was the strongest part of the course. <br/></div>

I can not say enough about this class and I really believe that everyone NEEDS to take this course, especially if they plan on going into medicine in some capacity. The intellectual challenge of this course was in the synthesis and application. It was in figuring out how to move forward with the very difficult and at times gruesome information that we were learning about the history of medicine and race in the united states. <br/></div>

The strengths are basically infinite. Prof Roberts is the most caring, engaging and passionate professor I have ever met. I think all Yale professors should be required to take her class/talk to her so that they can become better teachers and lecturers. The assignments allow you to really focus on what interests you and lets you apply the themes we learn about to whatever topics you are passionate about in life. Every lecture is like a 50 minute emotionally charged TED talk, there are literally people in tears at the end. The TAs are also really great and section was also super interesting. <br/></div>

The assignments will get you to really think critically and reflect on what you've learned in class, how it permeates our world today, and what can be done. It is very well organized with clear objectives set and met each class. It is the perfect mix of humanistic perspective, especially in its inclusion of first-person narratives from African Americans, historical background, social science, and public health. Its interdisciplinary nature is ambitious but extremely well executed. Professor Roberts manages to communicate the gravity of this history each class, and it was refreshing that she managed this in such a large lecture. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Overall, Sickness and Health was a good course. The assignments were very open-ended in topic area, which I appreciate, but frequently narrow in execution styles, and the rubric often had a lot of specific requirements I occasionally felt were detrimental to my assignments overall. The lectures were overall quite good -- Professor Roberts is a very gifted lecturer; I can't stress this enough, the material is so relevant and not taught in other Yale classes. One weakness of the course is that given the nature of the material we move through history very quickly, and often Professor Roberts spent a good chunk of lecture giving us historical context not related to Black history. I think in the future another option might be to have a short pre-class reading (perhaps from an American history textbook or written by Professor Roberts herself, which I know would be a lot of work for her) that gave historical context for each lecture, and then the lecture could focus specifically on Black health. For example, in the lecture on the Civil War, Professor Roberts spent around 20 minutes talking about medical innovations in the first years of the Civil War, before noting that none of these applied for Black soldiers. Perhaps we could read a short textbook reading on these innovations before class, and Professor Roberts could then spent more time on how the Black soldiers were excluded or the role of Black physicians. <br/></div>

Similarly, my TF Kelsey Henry was very knowledgeable and understanding.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths are professor Roberts who is one of the most incredible professors I've ever seen at Yale. She makes class interesting and engages with tough material in a very sensitive manner. You can tell from her teaching that she cares deeply about the subject and understands its importance. She makes herself available to each and every student, she truly cares about everyone who takes her course. The TFs are also so dedicated to the material and ensuring we all understand everything. There are no weaknesses. <br/></div>

Each class is deeply compelling; powerpoints are well-sourced with historical documentation and artifact; the lecturing by Prof. Roberts is moving; the student attendance and participation is remarkable (especially given that this is a huge lecture course!). Section is also fabulous - everyone remains engaged with the content. Finally, content curation in this course is remarkable; all of the reading assignments and essays are meaningful and worthwhile. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures, readings, and guest speakers were absolutely amazing. I loved all the assignments, especially the lesson plan because it was unique. I wish the assignments were a little bit more collaborative, not meaning that they should be partner or group assignments, but discussed more in section. It would have been interesting to hear what other students were working on and their views on the class. I think a blog where students could post their work would have been impactful to learning. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was the BEST course I have ever taken at Yale. I'm sure many reviews would be the same, but this course was so amazing because of all of the effort and hardworking doctor Roberts put into her students. She picked remarkable TA's, which definitely impacted our learning, but was mainly focused on her students embracing the content, and her focus on our well-being kept me extremely engaged, even though there was a low workload. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Roberts is such a gift to Yale and the reason why this course was such a valuable learning and living experience for so many. Everything she says is thoughtful and important, and she is able to convey the intricacies and importance of her work while still being very accessible to a wide variety of student backgrounds. The readings were largely great and the ability of the course coordinators to accommodate all the students who wanted to take it with enough TAs for section was a strength as well. Dr. Roberts' approach to learning rather than grades is innovative and incredibly effective, but I wish I would've gotten a bit more critical feedback on my thoughts and writing because I still spent a great deal of time and effort on the assignments. Some of the guest lecturers were better than others and with such a great professor you really want the guests to be strong if they are taking away from Dr. Roberts' time. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Roberts is a wonderful lecturer and powerful speaker. She cares very deeply and personally about the class as well as the material, and makes herself very accessible to students. Most lecturers fail to keep Yale's promise of accessibility to and interest in individual Yale students. We are lucky that Professor Roberts bucks that trend. A few logistical suggestions: please do not put the midterm exam the day after break; break should be for break and not for studying. Reweight the essays: why is the 750-1000 word critical response essay worth 10%, but the 750-1000 word final essay worth 30%? They don't need to be equal, but this is a big disparity. Rethink the historical figures: there are so many slides each dedicated to historical figures, and there is a section on the exam dedicated to them (as stated in the study guide), so we needed to study tons and tons of these, which was a lot. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I honestly cannot think of a single way this course could be improved. Although it is a large lecture, each class was extremely interesting and engaging. Professor Roberts is the BEST LECTURER I have ever had and truly makes the class special. The class covers vitally important important in a productive manner. The only weakness I can think of is the lack of support it received from administration. <br/></div>

I felt this class had a true impact on every students character for the better in that we all became critical of how our education shapes us as people. All the faculty involved were invested in my learning and provided clear and significant feedback that improved my analysis of the material.
