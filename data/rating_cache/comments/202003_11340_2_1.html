<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The slides over zoom worked pretty well, I think that each lecture was well paced so that it wasn't too fast or slow. I missed the ability to ask questions in person. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the lectures were engaging and straight forward. Professor Mendelsohn was incredibly passionate about the material and took the time to answer questions from students in class and in office hours. Andie was an incredibly helpful TA who actively monitored the chat during the lecture and led wonderful discussion sections.
Weaknesses: some technical difficulties during the semester <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â You learn things, but the pacing is slow and the pset questions aren't talked about in class. If you're lucky, you get a TA who teaches the questions in section, but not all of them do. The psets are also sloppily written. The process of doing the psets usually involved asking a TA for clarification, the TA back-solving some stuff from the answer key, and then giving you the clarification. The quantitative questions on tests aren't any better, only there you can't get any clarification. At minimum, checking the psets for errors and ambiguity before sending them out would be much appreciated. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The class is among the easiest I've taken at Yale, but it still follows the standard economics major curve, leading to a severe rushing problem (which you learn about in the class - LOL). Professor Mendelsohn claims that because students, especially at Yale, will spend as much effort as they can competing for the top grades of the class, he does not seem to care as much for students' wellbeing (he blatantly refused to drop the lowest problem set grade that most other classes allow to help lower students' stress if they have one really busy or off week). Thus, the class is ironically even more competitive to get the highest grades. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course covers quite interesting material, but seems to gloss over the details of many aspects of environmental management. Since classes were only 50 minutes long, it felt like we would talk about 10 concepts per class, with one or two slides dedicated to each concept. Lectures moved at a very slow pace, but it seemed like we moved through the material too rapidly.

Furthermore, some concepts taught in this class are at odds with established climate science and other economists. For example, we learned that 4 degrees Celsius was the optimal warming target, and that climate change would affect only a small chunk of the economy. Professor Mendelsohn also claims that $5-10 is the optimal price for carbon, although other economists estimate numbers at least 10 times as high. I do realize that part of taking a course with a researcher in this field is understanding the different approaches that they take to problems. However, at times, it seemed that even the TAs seemed skeptical about the material that Professor Mendelsohn was teaching. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lecture is painfully boring and feels a lot longer than 50 minutes. There was also almost no overlap between what was taught in lecture and what was tested in problem sets. Section is crucial for understanding the math behind the concepts explained in class. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Its a well taught course and the slides are useful. My biggest issue was that we received feedback for the first three problem sets very late, which made it hard to improve / learn from mistakes before the next one is due. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I believe the course could be improved by going over more technical examples either in class or in discussion section. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: pretty easy to grasp materials. Weaknesses: the entire field of environmental economics needs to be revisited. The material is neocolonialist and racist and erases the history of indigenous peoples. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professor clearly knows a lot. However, I thought the math on the slides was poorly explained, and the math was mostly left to the TAs to explain during section. I really didn't like the Excel homework we had. Even the TAs got different answers in the answer key, so there was a huge variation in what we turned in. I think there should've been more direction and clarification when it came to the quantitative p-sets. Grading also took FOREVER. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Mendelsohn is super knowledgable and engaging; I really enjoyed going to lecture. Sections are very helpful and all of the TFs this year were great. 
Weaknesses: Problem sets (esp. towards second half of semester) were not really that based on lecture; you have to go to section to find out how to solve them. Problem sets are also not similar to tests. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lecturer (Dr. Mendelsohn) is fairly engaging and seems to have a passion for the material. The lectures could have been a bit less monotonous, but overall they were well done. The TAs did not seem to always be on the same page which resulted in some sections being much more useful than others with regards to being able to complete the problem sets. The problem sets and exams were also incredibly poorly written, vague, and ambiguous, which overall made this probably the most poorly taught class Ive had at Yale. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor is great, TF Andie was fantastic. I would say the one thing was that problem set questions were not discussed or covered in class and it was often difficult to figure out some questions without the help of the TFs. This was evident on the final exam for the last question, where it seemed as if something we did not fully learn how to interpret and approach <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course has strong material, but there is a disconnect between the problem sets and the lectures. The problem sets do not really test the most interesting material of the course, or develop one's knowledge of the issues. What could really improve this course is if the problem sets were geared towards learning more about environmental economics and less learning how to solve basic problems. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Mendelsohn is incredibly-informed on the subject matter and provides objective takes on climate change; TA Andie is cool
Weaknesses: literally everything else. the course is disorganized and Mendelsohn feels compelled by the econ department to force TAs to grade harshly. psets were graded inconsistently across different students. i had to reach out to TAs to change 4/10 pset grades because my friends would get a question correct but mine would be wrong even when we had the same/very similar answers. The final had several written errors and questions were worded ambiguously so the TAs had to constantly clarify things throughout the exam. This ended up resulting in an average exam grade in the low 70s and the highest grade in the class being a 91 (with 100+ people in the course). The TAs told us that there would be a curve but my friends have already checked their final grades and there was no curve, nor did Mendelsohn express to us if a curve exists and what exactly it is. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of the course is the material itself. The course covers important and interesting material while providing a economics perspective on issues we hear about a lot. The course is at its best during lecture and discussion section when the passion of the professor and TAs comes through. Professor Mendelsohn clearly cares about this class a lot, and same goes for the TAs.

The weaknesses of the course mainly have to do with course administration, specifically in three areas. First, communication was not easy. The lack of a piazza for the course made it difficult to have questions answered, and email oftentimes did not substitute well. I'd imagine that TAs got multiple questions a lot, and they sometimes seemed frustrated when they received a question more than once (which is totally understandable) but could be alleviated with a course-wide piazza. Second, the structuring and wording of assessments was poor. Oftentimes, it was difficult to understand what a question was asking. This problem was exacerbated by the lack of good communication channels and by a lack of dedicated time to go over practice problems. Some discussion sections went over practice problems while others didn't, and we never went over practice problems in lecture. I think it was good to have discussion sections and lecture cover material instead, but maybe a recorded video of a practice problem would be good. Third, grading was inconsistent. I rarely got good/clear feedback in a timely manner from the class, and I seemed to lose points for things I didn't think warrant a point deduction. We were told at certain points that some TAs carried most of the grading burden on their own, so I hope that's changed in the future so that students can get clearer feedback quicker. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There are a lot of weaknesses to this course. The lectures are extremely slow and repetitive, so I don't feel that I learned a lot of new concepts. The problem sets almost felt like they were a separate course because the lectures did not go over the techniques needed to solve them, and instead these techniques had to be gone over in section. This would probably be a challenge for someone who does not have a strong economics background. Overall, I don't feel that I learned that much, which is a shame because the topic of the course is so interesting and it has a lot of potential. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of this course is the content. It is super interesting and that helped me to be engaged in lecture. There are several weaknesses in this course. Pset-wise, you basically have to have the right TA to perform well on them. Thankfully, the virtual environment allowed me to jump to different discussion sections and I was able to find a TA that guided the section through the pset. Having experienced both methods of approaching a pset (critically thinking vs guided thinking), I still feel like I learned more through the guided thinking method for the psets. The professor needs to standardize this across all sections. Another weakness was the ambiguity on the exams/psets. They are poorly written and if you don't put the time in to ask clarifying questions, you could totally misinterpret the question. This happened a lot during the final exam and it causes unnecessary stress. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One weakness of this course was that some concepts in the problem sets were never reviewed in class.  It would have been helpful to address the new concepts more, especially with application of the equations we learned.  I only knew how to use these equations because fo practice in section. <br/></div>
