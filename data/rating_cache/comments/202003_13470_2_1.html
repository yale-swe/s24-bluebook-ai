<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would say the strength is also it's weakness. The course has incredible breadth, covering a basis for cognitive science as well as various "case studies" for aspects of cognition that Scholl finds especially interesting. However, this means there is not an incredible level of depth with any one topic, so any one seeking to learn a great deal about perception, reasoning and decision-making, linguistics, or any one topic through the lens of cognitive science, expect to learn some about that topic but a whole lot about other topics as well. Pretty understandable for a survey course though. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â organization: so bad. i didn't know what was relevant and what was irrelevant, and usually that kind of thing is pretty obvious, but when the TFs and the professor literally tell you to "relisten to the lectures and see which parts he talks about the most" as a study guide.....ok
i understand that he's very engaged and enthusiastic about the content but the way he would get distracted wasn't helpful. and when a TF told us that he didn't like it when one TF would send stuff out to the whole class instead of their assigned group of students was strange, like why don't you like us getting equal access to information...

and i don't really understand why he won't use canvas? having to go to his own website to get all my materials and relisten to lectures and such was a hassle, and i don't really think canvas is so ugly or so inconvenient that he feels that he has to make his own website for us to go to, especially when all the other yale professors use it perfectly fine... he cropped his lectures weird too. instead of categorizing them by day, he did it by lecture topic and that was annoying too
he also wouldn't upload grades at all, just emailed them to us... no updates in the semester, you just have a vague notion of whether you're passing or not
knowing final grades shouldn't be russian roulette 

but otherwise, the content itself is very interesting <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class was always very interesting and easily applicable to the real world. It is a very good introductory level course. Weaknesses that come with the breadth of this class is it feels like (especially only meeting 2x a week) that we breezed past certain topics. Additionally, there was very little feedback on submitted work. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Scholl is incredibly energetic. He brought more enthusiasm for this class than any other professor I had this semester. Since this class is a survey of a broad field, however, at times it felt a little stitched together rather than the course material building on itself each week. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The greatest strength was the interesting content in lecture. The greatest weakness was that there was very little support outside lecture to help us confirm our understanding of the material and prepare for exams and essays. Students could benefit greatly from sections, a given option for study groups, and sample exam questions and responses to those questions. I struggled with the exams not because I didn't understand content or pay attention in class, but because the answers asked of us were very specific and it was not made clear to us how to answer the questions. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures were usually very engaging but sometimes hard to follow. I would, however, attribute this more to the online format than anything else as I understand it must be very difficult to teach maximally effectively on a zoom call. I think that the first exam was a somewhat frustrating experience for some of us because besides the format we knew very little about what sorts of questions we would see. So a bit more transparency with regards to that first exam would likely go a long way in alleviating some student anxiety. Additionally, the "thought paper" was, albeit likely intentionally, about as open-ended as you can imagine, and since the course dipped lightly into a variety of topics and we were instructed to avoid doing outside research, this made for a bit of a tough brainstorming and writing experience. In retrospect this was probably a good thing-- churning through many thoughts and potential ideas to arrive at the most appropriate one is a great exercise-- but it was certainly tough. It may have helped if we were provided a few more sample papers to get a sense of what was expected of us, and what qualified as truly original thought. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths included the lectures were always interesting and the immense support received especially from our teaching fellows. THe concepts were nice and the reading questions were very interesting at times. Some weaknesses were that some reading question articles were really long and unnecessary to understand the concept. At times the recorded lectures didn't makes sense as he would refer to his mouse in the lecture but the mouse would not be visible in the recording causing the students to get confused, <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths are that the lectures are very organized and easily followable. I would say that it clear what was going to be on the test, but that was more easily known by going to the TA review sessions because they would go over major topics and ideas. However, the test questions are very vague and fairly difficult to answer, even though I felt like I had a good grasp on the material as he was going over it, so it was hard to know what details were important. I think an improvement would be having summary slides or big topic points at some point in the lecture to better organize what to focus on. <br/></div>

Strengths: the super kind professor and TFs
Prof. Scholl is a gem and while some lectures feel like they drag on due to the topic, he still maintains his subtle comedy style of teaching
The amount of controlled breadth in the topics is a strength too, the class did not feel like it moved too fast through the topics and spent due time on each <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths were the variety of topics bevause it made the class exciting and engaging. Some weaknesses is that some class topics were not fully taught which made it hard to grasp for the exam. The readings on certain topics like linguistics were very difficult to grasp by myself. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course were that Professor Scholl was extremely passionate about the topics that he was teaching. Because of this, however, he often would spend too much time on a topic, and that would cause us to be behind in terms of the content. This meant that the readings that we would be doing would not coincide with the lecture topics, and that discrepancy would cause some confusion in terms of learning. Another strength of this course was that the professor and TFs would stay behind after lectures to answer any questions in a group office hours format. This made it so that students could often receive direct feedback on the questions that they had that related to the course material that was just covered. A weakness of this course was that because there were only 3 TFs, the TFs were overworked and could not really provide direct feedback on the reading questions that were submitted to them. Grading was also a bit slow because of that. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Some weaknesses include the fact that you will only receive feedback about your performance based on your midterm, which can only be viewed / reviewed with your TF during office hours, which fill up very quickly. Then, you write a paper and also take a final. However, you will not know how you did on these assignments until (I assume) the final grade is released. In addition, there is little to no confidence in how the curve is going to break down. Prof. Scholl said that he was "incredibly lenient" in grading the exams, but they ended up having an average of a 70. I don't want to focus on grades, but these are some things that caused a lot of stress during an already stressful time. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would say the strengths and weaknesses are mainly related to the trade off of breadth vs. depth. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This is a very good introductory course for covering a range of topics in cognitive science while still going into depth in many of them. However, even though it's structured in a way that lets the professor cover several facets of cognitive science, this course can only discuss so much with the time we have. I wish there was a way to have been able to go over more content while not getting too bogged down in certain case studies or examples...or, better yet, a way to poll students about which topics in cognitive science they'd be most interested in learning each semester. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of the course include the breadth of material covered, ranging from core concepts to specific domains of research such as perception and language. The course could be improved by having more assignments tailored to classwork material, as it was difficult to grasp the main concepts and ideas from the lectures. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A weakness of this course was the grading system . The grades we received on homework were based on completion only and no feedback on the depth of our thinking about the readings save for the most exemplary reading responses. The only feedback during the term was our Midterm grade, which was administered via Canvas and results delivered via email reporting only the percentage. We weren't even allowed to see which answers we got wrong on the exam page despite the fact that a significant portion of the test was multiple choice. Having a larger number of low-stakes small quizzes throughout the term will help prepare students for the midterm and final and provide an impetus to do the readings. Also this method will help provide a better picture of how well students are digesting the material - which is a lot. <br/></div>

The topics were interesting and Professor Scholl does a good job of engaging the students through videos, jokes, and "games" even over the virtual format.
