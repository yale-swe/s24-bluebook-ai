<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Successes were that the qsets and the final are open-note and there were weekly review sessions held by Professor McCarthy. 
The class could improve upon engagement during lecture, perhaps with more breakout room questions. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Having both the recorded lectures and live lectures felt extremely redundant to me since they were basically the exact same
I also would have loved having small group sections with TFs like I have in other large STEM lecture classes <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The prerecorded lectures were helpful, but the fact that we had to watch 2 hour long prerecorded lectures + go to class made it difficult to balance courseload and stay engaged. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the pre-recorded and live lecture model works, just watch how much is put into the pre-recorded (especially since you included pre-recorded lectures from years past). Same with the written materials, considering there were lecture notes and supplementary textbook passages and scientific articles. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One of the only issues I had with the course was the length of pre-lecture videos. It is my opinion that pre-recorded lecture videos should not amount to more time than the actual length of the class. Especially since most of the material was just covered again anyways. In some instances the total video length would amount to more than 2 hours. I think that it should just be considered that many other professors also decided to do lecture videos in addition to live-virtual lecture and as someone who watches them at normal speed and stops to take notes, this amounted to a lot of time for me. Additionally, this was the only class that I had of 3 that followed the same course mode, in which the lectures videos were so long. Even though I did enjoy learning the material, I think this is an aspect one should be considered for next semester. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the recorded videos were very beneficial for learning the material, but it could feel repetitive when watching the recorded lectures before class and not covering much new material. I think it would be helpful to reduce the recorded lectures to minimize overlap. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I like the prerecorded lectures because we can plan when to watch them before class. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The posting of the lecture videos and notes ahead of time was very helpful in managing time; however, the lectures were very very long (even when watching at 2x speed). <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â McCarthy offered more extensive prerecorded material which made the in-person lectures review (which felt like a waste of time). The prerecorded material was fantastic, however. With the extra time he was able to discuss each unit inn real depth. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There was not much virtual engagement in this course, much of the class was just watching lecture and reading supplementary materials. There was an attempt at breakout rooms, however, with virtual learning, everyone was at different places in keeping up with material so the disscussions in the breakout romms were not always very productive. Perhaps a weekly email to a TA would be a better way for virtual engagement - like answering a question and emailing that "homework" to a TA so you can get immediate feedback on whether you know what is going on in class and it could open the door for easier communication. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â For a remote semester, the workload was too much. It is a lot to expect students to watch an entire prerecorded lecture and read lecture notes before actual live lecture. This made studying hard as well since there was so much different places the material was covered. Furthermore, the prerecorded lectures were often longer than an hour and thirty minutes. It is fair that students can play the lectures at a faster speed but it was still a struggle to capture all of the material and stay on top of the class. On top of that, there were weekly qsets that required students to chunk out 3 hours time. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Honestly, this course was displayed perfectly through virtual learning. Lecture notes were given along with pre-recorded lectures for a detailed introduction for each live lecture. Secondly, the live lectures had concurrent diagrams, which allowed students to follow along just as they would in-person. The class ran very smoothly even with it being online. <br/></div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The pre-recorded lectures definitely helped me as a visual learner (I prefered watching them over reading the textbook). Prof. McCarthy put a lot of effort into making them, and they were great resources for qsets and review. However, please consider making them shorter/more brief so that you could go into greater detail during the live lectures. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I know some people really didn't like having to watch recordings and then going to live sessions but I really didn't mind that. I think it worked super well to have the lectures available anytime during the week. I had a mom recovering from surgery, a house that's just not super easy to do work in, and a job, so being able to watch whenever worked for me was really nice. Also, they did try to make zoom sessions have a bit of discussion but with everyone being like, devastated half the time, that didn't always work but it wasn't their fault. I think Professor McCarthy made great videos that were really interesting. <br/></div>

<b></b>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the final exam was not at all conducive to the online learning environment. In an effort to combine the usual rigor of the in-person exam with the open note concept of an online exam, the exam overall was very rushed and very long. I think it would have been much more beneficial for students to have a research paper to end the course. We covered so many interesting topics, and a research paper would have given all of us the opportunity to dive deeper into one of the topics and actually use our knowledge instead of memorizing flash cards and organizing an entire semester's worth of notes for a 3 hour exam <br/></div>

Also, we were told at midterm the exam would be open note (to adjust for not being able to proctor the exam I guess) and then like a week before the exam we were told that it would be so many questions in so little time that we would not be able to look everything up and it would be essentially not open book. The professor also said he made the exam as hard as it has been in the past and I cannot fathom why he would side against empathy and hold us to the standards that his classes NOT HAPPENING DURING A PANDEMIC were held to. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor McCarthy recorded far too much content that anyone could be reasonably expected to meaningfully consume in the BEST of times, but given that we are living in a pandemic and suffered through incalculable loss and difficulties adapting to new lives on campus, off campus, or struggling with challenges of studying remotely with family/guardians, it was simply too much. Professors should not be allowed to pre-record lecture content that surpasses the amount of lecture content that they would have in a normal semester. Professors should only have their allotted time in the course's schedule to lecture and not a minute more. Professor McCarthy pre-recorded 2+ hours of lecture material per class meeting, in addition to having an hour and 15 minute live lecture component. This led to us having around 7 hours of lecture material to consume on a WEEKLY basis. This doesn't even account for the amount of time it takes to create notes or study the material after the initial viewing of it all. This also was redundant as he mostly covered the same content from the pre-recorded lecture, but there were days where he included new content embedded in the original content, thus requiring every student to either watch the full lecture or scrub through until they reached new content. None of his lectures had captioning or a transcription available, so they were very inaccessible as well. Professor McCarthy made all of our quizzes open-note, and after mid-semester feedback, made the final open-note. However, with 4 days to spare before the final he informed us that, while the final was technically open note, there were so many questions in so little time that it would be impossible for us to consult our notes for the majority of the questions and that we must treat it like a closed-note exam. This was after several weeks of the entire class preparing for the final expecting it to be open-note. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â McCarthy does an excellent job at providing ample, ample material in order to address the difficulty of self-learning that comes with isolating oneself during the pandemic. However, what McCarthy does not seem to grasp is how immensely fatiguing watching videos and lectures is for hours upon hours at a time as a full-time student. While the videos he provided were helpful, I believe that his attempt to keep students more engaged with the material actually had the reverse effect for many students: I became so overwhelmed by the amount of pre-recorded material, written supplements, and lecture material that I mentally checked out. I know several students who felt the same way and addressed such concerns on Piazza, yet there seemed to be a lack of understanding from the teaching fellows and instructor, with the general response being, Speed up the pre-recorded material if that is helpful. I believe that McCarthy is a wonderful professor with the best of intentions who is exceptionally devoted to his students, but in the case of COVID-19, less is more. 

However, one major strength of the course given the online, virtual format was the use of breakout rooms during live lectures, as these breakout rooms enabled students to stay engaged by actively discussing with peers. 

While McCarthy seemed to attempt to address the concerns of virtual learning by making the final exam open-note, I believe that the ability to use notes actually hurt my performance rather than helped it. Without having access to a practice exam, I had absolutely no concept as to how to time manage for the exam, and I ended up being far too reliant on my notes and running out of time to answer many, many of the questions. Personally, I believe that I would have performed better without using any notes at all and just relying on my gut. Please, PLEASE, incorporate some sort of a practice exam in the future (whether the exam is open-note or not) to allow students to practice this time management skill. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Given that remote learning is a lot more challenging, I would appreciate if the workload could be lessened to accommodate. I did appreciate that the final exam and qsets were open book. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weekly Psets were great this semester, as were weekly quizzes. I appreciated that they replaced midterms, for virtual learning especially. However, I think this course was incredibly poorly structured in terms of the delivery of material. It is simply unreasonable to expect students to watch 90 min prerecorded lectures ahead of a 75 minute lecture two times per weekespecially when both of these are VIRTUAL. It is rather uninspired way to learn over recordings of slide presentations ahead of a live slide presentation. I would appreciate condensing this into one live lecture so that I actually have time to consolidate my learning after lecture instead of just worrying about the next lecture. <br/></div>
