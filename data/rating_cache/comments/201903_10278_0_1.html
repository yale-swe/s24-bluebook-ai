<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class teaches so much history, focusing on traditionally ignored narratives. It is very balanced between the history of African Americans and the history of health in the US. You'll be shocked at how little you knew about these topics, and will gain a whole new perspective on the world. The course is very broad, and covers a long and difficult history from the slave trade to the BLM movement. The content is interesting, the readings are a good mix of primary and secondary sources. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I learned that this country is founded upon the backs of enslaved individuals and slave labor. Without slavery, America would not be in the place it is in, whether that means economic prosperity at the expense of black bodies or the racial issues that still persist in modern society. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I learned so much that I could probably never learn in any other course at Yale. I have learned that there is a lot more that goes on in terms of health, interactions of people and societal dynamics that should be made aware. This will definitely shape me in my future career and make me ask the questions that many people may be afraid to ask now. This is a must take course! <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Amazing course all around. Low stakes way of involving yourself in deep discussions of African-American history and the idea of sickness and health in marginalized communities in the past and today. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It justifies radicalism - the injustices marginalized communities face begins with slavery... This class just blew my mind about how I perceive the world. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Every student at Yale should take this course. It's a fundamental history course that needs to replace the history that we've learned about the US throughout grade school. You will learn how systemic discrimination is present in nearly every single part of our lives and systems that we live, work, and engage in. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is amazing. It challenged me intellectually to come to terms with and grasp the deep-rooted effects of slavery and the ongoing persecution. This is the first class at Yale to change me, and change the way I see the world. I will carry the lessons i learned from Professor Roberts with me forever and I truly believe this class has opened my world view for the better. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I learned a lot about how health can be an important vector for studying social relations. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â this was THE BEST class I've taken at yale. I was initially attracted to it because of the high prof rating, low workload, and content but it completely blew my mind and expectations. EVERYONE NEEDS TO TAKE THIS COURSE. IT SHOULD BE REQUIRED, ESPECIALLY FOR MED STUDENTS OR ANYONE INTERESTED IN GOING INTO HEALTH. this class will make you rethink all of your biases and give you space to evaluate the abuse of black people like never before. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class is the most eye-opening and best class I have so far taken at Yale. There are hardly words to describe the impact that this class has had on my life and on my future. I not only developed knowledge of 400 years worth of black history, but I also have also gained a deeper understanding of the relationship between history and the present. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I learned so much about the black community and the history of its struggles in the medical field (and in society in general). <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I learned a great deal of African American history which has made me much more aware of the struggles that black people have faced and continue to face. It was definitely eye-opening to read first-hand narratives told by enslaved persons that are largely ignored. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This was an incredible class. The material covered in this class is something that is often omitted from any history, public health, or bioethics course despite it being very relevant. You learn how to trace present-day issues with race and medicine back to their roots. It is a difficult course to take in that the material is very heavy, but it is probably the most important material with which I will leave Yale. The assignments make you critically think and present you with opportunities to engage with the material in personally important ways. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â We learned all about African American history from the Atlantic slave trade all the way to 2019, through the lens of medicine and health. We went in depth about the injustices that slaves, newly freed slaves, and black Americans faced and continue to face in the healthcare system and in general. This class has changed the way that I see healthcare and has opened my eyes to biases that exist and has inspired me to do more to spread the word to eliminate these biases. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I learned about ways the African American community has been exploited throughout history and how that legacy continues today and follows people of color into their medical and professional and everyday interactions.  I've learned about how racial science was something created to enforce the idea that black people were inferior.  I've learned about the physical and mental effects of racism and things that we can do to combat these harmful attitudes and stereotypes and live a more mindful life. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course taught me so much about the history of public health in the US. It sharpened my empathetic tools, learned how to actively listen, and learned how to read historical texts. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I learned about the history of African-American health and medicine in ways that history textbooks and prior courses never dared to venture into before. I learned how to take my academic experience into my own hands, how to dive into topics that mean something to me, and how to be a compassionate, active, dedicated learner. I also gained valuable insights into the history of abuse in medicine and am compelled to do something to change it. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course covers a broad range of American history (from the beginning of global circumnavigation to the 21st century) but looks very specifically at the intersection of black history and medical history. We began with the study of the medicines, illnesses, and doctors present on slave ships and traveled to medical experimentation on the plantation. From there, we studied the first black doctors, the stealing of black bodies for autopsies in America's earliest medical schools, the history of reproductive justice and black women's health, war and black health, and the effects of racism on physical and mental health. The interdisciplinary nature of the course allowed us to ask a lot of unique questions and resulted in looking in a lot of unique places for answers. We engaged with primary historical documents, images, books, journal papers, videos, and news articles all at the same time. The course also has a wide variety of assignments that challenge you to think about history in different ways (a critical analysis paper, a sample syllabus, an op-ed, and a free-written final essay). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thoroughly enjoyed my experience in this course. It was the best class I've taken at Yale and perhaps the best course I have ever taken my entire life. The materials were gut-wrenching. The course overall has enhanced my knowledge and understanding about medicine and public health especially from a racial justice perspective and what it means to be an ally to Black and brown people. It was definitely an informative experience, and knowing that I have an opportunity to apply what I learned about the intimate connections between racism, slavery, and health in my work as a public health professional, I feel the responsibility to be thoughtful and intentional in advocating for racial justice and health equity. The course taught me that a lot of the problems happening in today's landscape simply evolved from those in the past. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It enhanced my critical thinking skills and I was able to apply the material outside of the course. I learned about the untold history of medical practices and how many modern operations and forms of treatment were discovered through abuse, experimentation, and exploitation of the Black body over centuries. I learned about institutional health disparities and the role racism plays in the doctor-patient relationship. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The insidious relationship between American medicine and racial bias that force us to reckon with how concepts such as sickness and health function as prisms with explanatory power beyond the biological. Instead, racial and gender hierarchies, cultural values, and social norms shape how we, as a society, interpret sickness and health in black communities. Often, we turn sickness into deviance, transmute illness into criminality, and render black pain as morally suspect and socially illegible. Activists today helpfully call our attention to such overdetermined beliefs and direct our gaze toward the social policies and institutions that uphold them. Although we will spend the semester focusing on black struggles for health and wholeness, much of this history is imbricated in, and resonates with, past and present challenges faced by other marginalized communities. By gaining a critical historical foundation in the several centuries-4 long struggle for black lives, we will be better equipped to understand the challenges of sickness and health faced by other vulnerable communities.

I never realized how much I wasn't taught in my past history classes until this class. Dr. Roberts was able to fit hundreds of years of history into a semester's worth of classes and she did it with eloquence, power, and conviction. I learned how to take in all the information I was learning and use it to inform my decisions and relate it to different aspects of life.

Each lecture presented us with information that most of us didn't know (for a reason) and challenged us to question everything we thought we knew about American history. Although the course analyzes history from the lens of medicine, sickness, and health, its very global in terms of the topics we discuss in American history.

We also learned about African slaves who contributed to Western medicine; in general, we studied ways in which medicine ties to slavery and racism. I will never forget the horrific acts of violence that we studied in this class.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I learned about the interaction of healthcare and African American history from the slave trade to today. I learned that many societal ills of the past, such as slavery, were somehow even more horrifying than I thought (frequently on the order of Nazi war crimes). I learned that many narratives have two sides, and that the side that empathizes with African Americans is frequently ignored (for example, the Progressive Era of American history was mainly progressive for whites; it was actually among the worst of times in African American history). I learned that many problems of today (such as police violence and distrust of medicine) can be explained at least in part by the history of these institutions, and likewise that many phenomena that we thought we left in the past (such as segregated housing) are still widely abundant today (segregation may not be legal anymore, but in many places its almost exactly as prevalent in housing and schools as it was decades ago). This class opens you up to a new way of thinking about race relations in America (the fact that Im saying this as an African American male should impress upon you how special this class is). It also challenges you to go out and make positive change in the world. Professor Roberts really wants this class to be a jumping-off point for change, and for me, that has been the case. <br/></div>

Lots of sources, data, videos, articles, etc were given as proof of the healthcare disparities that affect not only black people but Latinx people, low-income patients, and an array of minority groups. I truly learned a lot in the class but being that I identify with a lot of the identity patients presented I wouldn't say that it was new content for me personally, but I know that it was very new information for many of the students in the class. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This was an amazing course that taught me much about slavery and shed light on issues such as medical exploitation and scientific racism that I had never explored before. I emerged from this class with a more informed perspective on the issue of racism and obstacles black Americans have face since the beginning of American history up until the modern age. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I am sure that all of the reviews for this course will be overwhelmingly positive. This class is a wonderful survey and deep-dive into untold histories. I learned so much about the ways in which health and class, race, gender intersect. Students become much more knowledgeable about African American history (both medical and not), and they also become much more thoughtful &amp; critical agents when examining medical/public health narratives. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I learned SO MUCH from this course. I think this is one of the most important, brilliant, informative, and amazing courses at Yale I've ever taken. I learned a completely buried version of American History that showed me just how flawed my high school curriculum was. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course allowed me to fill in the gaps of my education that had been created by the institutional racism of United States schooling. I learned how important it is to be able to learn and analyze uncomfortable and intense material. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class definitely improved my critical thinking skills and my ability to synthesize multiple texts, sources of information, and compare different time periods in history, including the present moment. Prof. Roberts gracefully and powerfully taught us about so many difficult, often ignored topics, greatly improving my knowledge of African-American history and as such, American history. I gained incredible insight into the roots of racial disparities in healthcare and health outcomes, as well as how racism and racial biases affect and harm people today, and how they affected and harmed people in the past. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â By taking this course, I feel like I have developed a different perspective on being in the medical field in the future, as the course emphasizing uncovering concealed information that should be taught everyday to every student in America. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I realized how entrenched slavery is in our every day lives and how we are still benefitting from the institution that we never really think about. This class was amazing and changed my perspective on racism and how we still have so much work to do in our society today. As a premed student, I think about medical schools and doctors differently, and I realize that the medical field has only advanced so far due to the blood, sweat, and tears of enslaved people. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I learned about the medical dimension of trauma and injustice that has faced African Americans for about 400 years. Everybody learns about slavery and racism and segregation in elementary school, but nobody learns about this. The medical racism that has faced blacks is pernicious, long-standing, and unfortunately still active today, so there is plenty to learn here for just about everybody. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is life changing. It changed the way I think about America as a country, about our world as a whole, and about many of the day-to-day interactions I have with people in my life. It covers the history of African American health from the beginning of slavery on slave ships coming to America all the way up to today facing police brutality and maternal death rates. This course covers the history of America your high school class was afraid to teach. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I learned the forgotten history of African American people in the united states, how medical institutions have ignored the history of medical experimentation of black people, the importance of lost voices, to highlight the voices of minority groups through the lens of science as well as outside of medicine. To be vulnerable in the classroom and take time to digest the material properly so that i can make meaningful conversation. And that I don't always have to have a say in a conversation and I have to instead take a step back to simply listen. I also learned to be compassionate when sharing sensitive information and respect the people involved. <br/></div>
