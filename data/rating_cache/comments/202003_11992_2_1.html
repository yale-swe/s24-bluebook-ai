<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: peer tutors; I literally would not have made it through the course if the bio peer tutors didn't do one-on-one peer tutoring with me or have their office hours; cool if you like actin and myosin and cell bio (i dont think i do LOL)

Weaknesses: Lectures hard to follow online (Professor mooseker cares about the course a lot and provides helpful advice on piazza and has sunday review sessions, but i think recorded lectures are torturous for him to make and a little difficult to watch), first pset is like AHHHH WHAT DOES THIS MEAN and noncollaborative psets are kinda AHHH THIS IS SCARY AND NOBODY CAN HELP ME but go to office hours and they help you &lt;3 <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought that a strength of this course was the weekly enrichment sections held by Professor Hartman. They were a great way to recap the material from the week. The weekly lecture that we had to watch were quite long. Additionally, I wish that there was some other form of grade source apart from the weekly problem sets. Perhaps a small research project? <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: very knowledgeable professor, passionate about subject matter
weaknesses: inconsistent problem set grading (posting a rubric/answer key would have been helpful); lectures/ppts seemed disorganized/hard to find material when needed <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I honestly think the pace of this class was extremely fast, and many times I didn't really understand where we were (especially in BIO 102 -- BIO 101 was not as fast). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths = enrichment section

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Piazza is a wonderful resource for quick questions. Lectures were nice to be able to do whenever I wanted, but I also felt very distant from the professors and other people in my class. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength of this course is definitely the utilization of Piazza for questions and answers about the course material. I'm not sure how this can be improved but the difficulty jump from 101 to 102 is really a struggle and those who are fast adapters win here but we want to make the transition easy for everyone. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The recorded lectures go into a lot of depth and are very thorough. Teaching staff are active on the Piazza. The professor's review sessions are also very informative. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the format of the course 
Weaknesses: Everything else. The delivery of the material was terrible as it was seemingly assumed that we had an extensive background in cell biology, so we skipped over all the basic aspects and straight into the minute details certain parts of the cell. With nothing to attach this to, actually understanding what was going on was very difficult. In addition, there was no continuity in what we learned, as we just jumped from topic to topic and no time was taken to show how the weekly topics related. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: having the lectures be recorded helped a lot to allow students to be able to pause the video and fully digest the technical jargon and the complex biological mechanisms covered in class. The midterm and final this semester was also converted to what were essentially take-home tests that you could work on throughout the week, so that reduced a lot of stress for this course.

Weaknesses: lectures introduced a lot of new content that wasn't covered in AP Biology or in a standard high school biology class, but that's to be expected; just be prepared to take down a lot of notes. There was a lot of technical jargon in the lectures though, which will likely make you spend more time than the supposed 120 minutes of lecture per week since you will probably need to pause the recorded lectures a lot in order to fully digest and understand what is going on. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I'd say it was a strength that during COVID-19 Mooseker was kind enough not to give us tests, and the collaborative open-note nature of the psets made them much easier than in a regular academic year, although psets being 90% of our grade this year wasn't the best for stress levels. The strength and weakness of the course could be that biology is taught from an experimental perspective, as it was interesting to learn about biology and analyze it as one would in a lab setting, but it would also be difficult to translate this knowledge to the typical biology curriculum of other universities and other people when talking about biology - it also gave a very limited overview of everything we ever learned. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â With regard to strengths, I think the instructors and teaching fellows were all super supportive. However, that's about where the positives stopped for me. I thought the lectures were far too dense and I really missed the idea of "key concepts" from BIOL 101. I also felt this way about the textbook, as it was difficult to get a supplementary understanding when the textbook was so dense and hard to read as well. Lastly, I REALLY didn't like that essentially the entire grade was determined by PSets. I think it led to a hyper-stressful environment to the students where every last detail felt unreasonably consequential, and I think we would've been far better served by keeping the quiz/PSet/mini-quiz format from 101. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The discussion section was really helpful, especially in preparing students for the problem sets. The fact that the lectures were pre-recorded was definitely helpful as well, since it allowed us to pause the video when taking notes.
Weaknesses: The professor was not very good at explaining things, and I felt very lost during the pre-recorded lecture. I felt that I only just barely learned the concepts enough to get by for the problem sets. The problem sets were also super hard and it took about two hours for me to do each problem. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really loved the collaborative P-SET sections, peer tutor hours were very helpful, and I enjoyed that most of the grade was composed of our P-SETs (as opposed to examinations). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would have appreciated if more time in discussion section was spent clarifying lecture concepts that weren't necessarily in the textbook but were asked in depth about in p-sets. This course was not as engaging as BIOL 101, perhaps because of the lack of weekly quizzes that made sure we understood the material. Some of the problem set questions were also honestly a bit too in depth for what we were taught in class, especially since there wasn't much explanation supplemented by the textbook at times. I also think that the lectures could be cut down a bit in size since with hundreds of slides per week and zoom fatigue, it can be hard to 'get' everything. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The biggest strength of the course is Professor Mooseker. He is incredibly knowledgeable and wants nothing more than to see his students become better, stronger scientists. His optional review sessions were wonderful; and while the problem sets were challenging, it was the intellectual challenge that made them fun and engaging. For me, my discussion leader was a strength; I guess this varies amongst the students. Reading academic papers really gave us insight into how the real world of science operates; that practical insight is more valuable than anything covered in lecture. The instructors also did a great job having plenty of opportunities to engage with TFs/instructors to ask questions; there was always a way to schedule an appointment or ask a question during office hours/review sessions.

The only weakness of the course is the actual lecture itself; it's very tough to stay focused on Professor Mooseker. Because he's such a knowledgeable scientist, he employs a lot of jargon that is tough to understand, and sometimes you don't really know what he's trying to convey. But, this is only a problem because of the remote format. If the lectures were in person, I'm confident they would be more engaging. <br/></div>

weaknesses: sometimes it wasn't entirely clear why we were learning what we were in class. It's a lot clearer by the end that the whole class is working its way through the cell, but it can feel a bit random at first.

Weaknesses: the only one that comes to mind is that I found beginning with the plasma membrane to be quite overwhelming -- for me, the first unit definitely did cause some anxiety, but that was quickly quenched as the weeks progressed (Unit 2 felt fine). Maybe this was just do to the fact that the general style of the class is different from 101 and I was still adapting -- I'm not quite sure. <br/></div>

The psets were also fair but challenging so that you really had to think and apply what you learned in class. As were the red questions.

Weaknesses: I think the fact that this course was conducted predominantly over recorded lectures weakened this course, but that is obviously specific to this year. Also, the fact that basically the only type of assignment in this class was a problem set made the class seem rather repetitive. 

How it can be improved: Maybe add a little variety in the types of assignments? E.g. maybe replace a pset with a different type of activity for a week or two

Another weakness: to the best of my knowledge, course grading procedures (i.e. weighting of assignments) were NOT consistent with what was initially stated, except for the discussion sections. 

How that can be improved: decide on course grading procedures either before the class starts or early on in the time of the class running so students know what to expect <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course's greatest weakness is Mark Mooseker. He is not interested in adapting his teaching methods to the circumstances of the pandemic and has simply accepted that he is "not very good at teaching under these circumstances." I cannot speak to his performance as a teacher during a normal year, but under these circumstances his teaching style made the course very hard to engage with. He began the class being very rude and snappy to students asking questions on Piazza and asking for help with learning difficulties. This continued throughout the course. He teaches using language of a molecular biologist and has no interest in using more simple terms to improve our understanding of the material. Every time I went to a discussion section in this course I was forced to speak because all the other students said they had no idea what was going on in the class and couldn't understand a word of the lectures. I had to spend a lot of time on this course, especially compared to 101, and do a lot of reading from the textbook and online sources (Khan Academy, etc.) in order to engage with the material in discussion section. I think that the idea of reading articles during discussion sections is a good one, but it was executed better in BIOL 101. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was good with teaching a great amount of cell material in very a short period of time.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The pre-recorded lectures felt a little useless. Though I continued to watch them, it was extremely difficult to really understand the material. There was not much description of the overall significance of the parts of the cell. However, the biggest problem for me was just how much jargon Professor  Mooseker used throughout the lectures. I just had a hard time following what he was talking about, and so found it extremely difficult to really stay engaged with trying to understand the material. <br/></div>

I felt like each pset question was intellectually stimulating and valuable for my learning. The recorded lecture format did make it difficult to engage deeply with the material, but I still felt like the pset questions were enjoyable and deep enough for me to get something out of the class. Despite the difficulties of COVID-19 I thought the structure of the class was great. <br/></div>

Weaknesses: The material is very hard to understand. Too many technical terms are making it difficult to follow. I felt like I had to stop and do a Google search to understand what I was listening every other minute. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was definitely intellectually challenging, however, I feel that the scope of this course was too focused on only a few specific concepts, as opposed to covering a broader range of cell biology that I had expected it would. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course ends up having only 5 assignments in the grade book, excluding the few points received from discussion section. Because of this, it is extremely easy to do poorly in the class simply because of a few bad assignments. This would not be so bad, if it were not so hard to get a good grade on some of these assignments. The assignments are all made of "red questions" asked in class that are not answered. In other words, the assignments are made of questions about things that you have not been taught, or at least of things that have not been explained completely. In addition, two of the assignments are non-collaborative, meaning that you can't even get help. This idea of asking a hard question in class that we usually cannot answer with the information given to us, and then not answering that question, and then making it our homework is mind boggling as to how that seems like a good teaching strategy. To be fair, there are live Sunday review sessions where the teacher answers these red questions with everyone, so this should seem like I am wrong in what I have said. However, the problem is that the review session occurs in the evening/afternoon on Sunday, and the assignment is due Monday morning the next day. So, you have an extremely small time frame to check, correct, and fill in your answers. And again, these questions are often unanswerable. I say unanswerable, but I mean in the sense that you can give an answer, but there is no way to know for sure if your answer is actually right or wrong. You basically have to give an educated guess on many of the questions. There are two easy ways to fix these problems. One, as bad as this sounds, is to give us more work, so that there are more options to do good on assignments to boost our grade. BIOL 101 has triple the amount of work BIOL 102 has, yet I did far better in that class because the few assignments I did bad on were outweighed by all the good ones. The other fix, which is a much better fix in my opinion, is to just move the Sunday review session (although really it's a teaching session, not review) to Friday or before that so people actually have time to learn how to answer the red questions. Just moving the session would completely fix the class and make it all okay. <br/></div>
