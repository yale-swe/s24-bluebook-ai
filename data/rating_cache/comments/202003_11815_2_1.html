<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: modules are only two weeks long so the material being taught wont feel repetitive. There was no midterm or final which eased the stress of needing to remember content from every module. The weekly quizzes were fair and a pretty good representation of how much I understood the content. Discussion sections were informative and engaging. 
Weaknesses: attending the lectures live or watching the entire recorded lecture in one sitting was difficult because it is a long class and staring at a screen for that long is hard. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think that there should be less memorization on the quizzes and more application of knowledge questions. I felt like all the questions on the quizzes came directly from the slides, and I think have more difficult/application based questions would help students learn more. The paper discussions were my favorite part of the course, and I liked how the professors would give a brief intro to the papers during lecture to help students get a baseline knowledge of the topic before reading. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the course was taught very well given the circumstances and the greatest strength was the review sessions held by the TAs the night before quizzes. They were very helpful and helped to prepare for assessments. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course provided a pretty comprehensive and engaging survey of genetics, from Mendelian genetics to population genetics to developmental genetics. However, the biggest weakness I found with the course was with the grading structure. There are absolutely no assignments for this course, and you were only assessed on six Thursdays throughout the semester where you had to take a quiz and then participate in a discussion section about an assigned research paper. It was frustrating to have my entire grade rely on quizzes that were trickier than the material we learned in class, and I wish I had more opportunities throughout the semester to prove my knowledge. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Some of the strengths of the course were the way it was structured, with lecture lessons and then Special Thursday's, during which there was a quiz and discussion section. I think it was really helpful to digest the information through talking about relevant scientific papers, especially because I was very new to that. However, I think it would have been helpful if the homework and work on Sapling had been more directly connected to the course because it felt relatively disparate and unhelpful to complete. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths were the professors and their passion for genetics. Professor Dellaporta was really enthusiastic about the material, which helped our learning. It could be improved with more quiz practice questions integrated into the lecture slides. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked how the course was split up into different modules and that the quizzes were not cumulative so that we could focus on the content. On the quizzes where there are math questions, it would have been helpful to know the rounding rules beforehand. I appreciated having problem sets on Sapling, but Sapling in general is not great--sometimes the answers seem incorrect, and it's annoying when you don't know why you got something wrong. <br/></div>

weaknesses - developmental genetics module covered same material as BIOL103 so didn't learn anything new or more challenging there, professors' slides felt disorganized sometimes and not in a logical order so can be difficult to determine what the big picture is during a lecture (a more in-depth outline at the beginning of each lecture would be helpful) <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: This class was VERY well facilitated for learning in an online environment.  Low pressure, great class discussions, and very clear instruction.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It's tough having virtual-format quizzes on Canvas. Toward the end of the semester, we switched to having quizzes where we were unable to review past questions we had already answered (to ward against cheating), but this format made it difficult, as normally you can go back to check all answers before submitting quizzes in person. Otherwise, lectures were well-taught and interesting, and discussion section for papers were handled well! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think a major strength of the course was how Dr. Dellaporta took our situations into account and was able to adapt the class accordingly; online lectures were great and he was able to answer our questions with ease and help us learn. I also think the discussion sections were interesting and not impossibly challenging so we could learn. I believe the review sessions for the quizzes could have been better; they did improve as the semester went on, but I think all the TFs should have a good handle on online learning and how to share their screen in order to give the best experience over zoom. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: prof. dellaporta, course organization
weaknesses: I wish there were clearer deadlines on PSETs, and clearer guidance on what needed to be completed by when. We were told that our PSET/reading/activity completions were going to be given an "effort grade" which I guess makes sense, it would have just been helpful to know what went into that grade. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of the course were that it was well taught, and well organized for learning (bimonthly quizzes, special thursdays).

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths of the course include the bimonthly discussion section and quiz day, which helped me keep up with the material in manageable chunks, and the instructor's enthusiasm/knowledge. The Sapling format felt like both a strength and a weakness because it was a flexible option for students to reinforce their handle on concepts, but it was not really clear what was expected of students since performance was evaluated by effort rather than a more concrete measure. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - Quizzes were very fair, readings and overall workload was rather light (quiz and paper discussion with preparatory questions on Sapling every 2 weeks), help sessions and peer tutoring office hours were offered every week, textbook was immensely helpful in clearing up confusion about lecture concepts. 

Weaknesses - sometimes difficult concepts in lecture were covered a bit too quickly but if you go back to the lecture recording and read the slides and the textbook or go to office hours you will be completely fine. Also apparently a lot of people cheated on the online quizzes. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professor made good use of the recording element of the course and offered asynchronous lectures which were appreciated by many students during this time. The lecturing itself was typically interesting and informative. I definitely appreciated having quizzes every other week with no final exam. However, Professor Dellaporta's quizzes were significantly more difficult than Professor Dawson's quizzes, to the point where to do well on them you had to really memorize all the slides, even if he didn't cover every point on the slide (especially the ones at the ends of lecture). It definitely seemed like he, more than most professors, tried to challenge students with questions on the quizzes (ie. 8/11 could be a typical class average from a quiz). I very much preferred Professor Dawson's quizzes to Professor Dellaporta's because they were much more straightforward. Vocabulary that was not formally defined on the slides often appeared on the quizzes, which made it pertinent to do the Sapling reading and memorize the vocabulary from there. Grading of the other components was pretty ambiguous for most of the semester until the last week. He gave conflicting information about grades (ie. at the start of the course, he said discussion &amp; sapling components would help improve most people's grade from the quiz average but then said at the end that he starts people out with a 3/5 (for 25% of the grade!) and moves them up or down from there with 5/5 being reserved for above and beyond discussion performance - but we all only had the opportunity to equally participate once during discussion before it ended so this seems highly subjective. He also said learning curves on sapling would not be graded but then sent out an email at the end of the course saying that he had included them in the 25% sapling grade and, likely as a result, the average given for this component was 8/10. With all of the grading ambiguity and contradictions in combination with his insistence on trying to really "challenge" students on the quizzes (ie did you completely memorize the slides or not), I would not put it past him to scale students down. Overall, I really enjoyed the actual teaching and material of the course, but did not appreciate the grading system. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - Professor Dellaporta is an amazing professor who really cares about the wellbeing of his students and wants to see everyone in his class succeed. 

Weaknesses - Sapling Learning homework assignments were often tedious and were not very relevant to the information we were expected to know for quizzes. The weekly quizzes were also significantly more challenging (due to "match definition" and short answer options on Canvas) compared to the quizzes administered in person in prior years of this course (which were almost all in a multiple choice format). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was wonderfully organized. Its main strength was the "special Thursday" section where students were given the opportunity to discuss papers that covered important topics in genetics. I feel like I did most of my learning here. The Sapling questions were also helpful, but sometimes the question content was beyond the scope of the course. I would have liked a better understanding of how our engagement with Sapling would have affected our final grade. It would have been helpful to have received quiz grades back earlier as well. <br/></div>
