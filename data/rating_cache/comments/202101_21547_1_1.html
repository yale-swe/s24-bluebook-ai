<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures are clear, and the office hours (both from Minsky and the TAs) are helpful.  It seems like they all really care about the class and want the students to understand the math.  My only suggestion would be to switch from two days a week to three, as absorbing 75 minutes of new math in one sitting can be difficult, and it's often easier over more shorter periods. <br/></div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: this is an absolutely incredible class. It starts with Professor Minsky. He is so dedicated in teaching his students. He always responds on the Ed very quickly, and he is always seeking feedback. Furthermore, he held two office hours every week where he answered all of our questions. In class, he blends the perfect amount of rigor in the beautiful subject of measure theory, while also giving us a fair amount of intuition, problem-solving strategies, and examples. He is an extremely clear lecturer and has great handwriting on the iPad. Furthermore, his problem sets will challenge you to the brink. However, every problem reinforces learning and feels great to solve. Weaknesses: Not many. Maybe a minor tweak is to spend more time on general measure theory because it felt a little rushed. Another thing is the textbook Beals. I understand that the course follows chapters 10, 11, 12, and 13 pretty closely before going off to do other things. However, it might be worth looking for another textbook. Beals has a lot of errors. Also, many of the proofs in Beals aren't actually all written out, so it was a little annoying if I was confused by something in class. Furthermore, a textbook for Caratheodory/Hahn-Kolmogorov would be extremely useful. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Minsky! Professor Minsky is an amazing lecturer who explains everything clearly (and with lots of pictures). He is also very approachable and helpful in office hours. The class was also extremely well-organized, so it was easy to follow the progression of topics.

Weaknesses: The homework grading was a bit...pedantic at the beginning of the class, but got better towards the end. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The biggest weakness of this course was the combination of grading and psets. Psets were very tricky and required you to "get in the weeds" very often, i.e. work out small details and edge cases for pages on end. Grading was insanely anal  graders would take off 1/3-1/2 of the points for a question if you missed even one of those details/edge cases (e.g. if you forgot to check that certain functions are measurable, a fairly easy task, you might get 3/5 points for that question). The instructor also failed to fix this until around 3/4 of the way through the course, which is disappointing since the students were giving him overwhelming feedback about their experience with grading pretty early on. However, lectures were well done and the exams were doable. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course strengthened my mathematical thinking immeasurably. The material was beautiful and useful. Everything was explained with clarity and vision. I truly can't think of any weaknesses (it was a fair bit of work at times, but this wasn't a weakness, it was a strength; we had all the support we needed, and every single pset/exam problem was valuable). Towards the end of the course I struggled to maintain my attention span during long proofs in live Zoom lectures, but this was just Zoom fatigue, and not the course's fault. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Minsky is a great lecturer and, lest the importance of this be forgotten, has very clear handwriting. His office hours are also incredibly helpful, and I definitely recommend going to them.  The course hews pretty tightly to the textbook (Analysis, by Beals), which made reviewing the material much easier as compared to other courses. The material is difficult, but you get some pretty cool results out of it, too. 

Weaknesses: at least one proof per pset was super tedious, and the class in general takes up a lot of time. If you're willing to dedicate a good chunk of your attention this semester to the class, it's not bad, but it's not a class you can just skim. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class was awesome. Lectures were great, and very engaging. Problem sets were *hard*. Very heard and very time consuming. But, after each problem set, I felt like I really, truly understood the material well. I really don't have much to say here. The class was fantastic in almost every way.

The one thing to say is that the graders were real pricks sometimes. They really seemed to enjoy taking off points. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One of the strengths of the course was Professor Minsky. He is really good at teaching, is super organized and passionate, and also dedicates a lot of time to office hours to ensure that we can get any questions we need answered, both about the homework and about the material. The homework is a very central part of this class, although this may be a weakness; the homework often took 2-3 full days each week to complete, and without dedicating that much time to homework I found it impossible to actually absorb the material at all. The material is challenging and a lot of the proofs are hard to wrap your head around - I had a lot of times where I felt completely overwhelmed and lost, and the only way to do something about it was to dedicate many many many hours to wrestle with the problems on the homework and come to terms with the material. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: 
- Minsky is amazing and deeply knowledgeable. He loves math and it really shows in his teaching. I found his lectures to be at a good pace, although it did seem like a couple of the students were asking questions way ahead of the material that made it a bit harder to follow. Minsky also hosted a generous amount of OH to help discuss the weekly homework assignments. I learned a ton in this course and really appreciated how engaged Minsky was in the course

weaknesses:
- the workload is very high. There are weekly problem sets and each one would take me 15-20 hours, and only because I was able to greatly speed up the process by going to 4 hours of OH a week. I also felt very intimidated by how naturally everyone could understand the material. Relatedly, both the lectures and OH are dominated by the people who already have a deep understanding of the material, which honestly makes it pretty difficult for those of us for whom the material doesn't immediately click <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Minsky is amazing, I highly recommend any math student to make room for his class in their schedule. The material was presented in a very organized, cumulative way, and the expectations for proof writing followed. 

Weaknesses: Not really a weakness, but I'd say if you take the class, be prepared for it to be one of/your highest workload class. The psets and material take a while to wrap your head around. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Minsky's engaging and well-organized lectures contributed to my excitement about the course material [he added polls to assess student understanding, short videos to provide an introduction to course concepts, and answered questions throughout class]. However, the real star of this course was our Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) Richard. Although it is easy to feel inadequate or overwhelmed in an upper-level math course, Richard went out of his way to clarify concepts in a way that was welcoming rather than belittling [unlike some of the other office hours]. I do not know how I would have made it through this course had it not been for Richard's patience and willingness to talk through concepts in a way that solidified my understanding. :)

Weaknesses: Professor Minsky assigns too much work for a class that has weekly problem sets. I do not mind 20+ hour homework assignments when students are given adequate time to complete them, but expecting us to finish a **20/30+ hour problem set** in a week's time is simply inconsiderate. I have taken other difficult courses at Yale (MATH 350, CPSC 223), but none of them hit me as hard as this one. My mental health was greatly affected [as what that of many of my classmates to whom I spoke] and Professor Minsky made little effort to adjust his course in response to student concerns. Professor Minsky moves *so* fast that there is never any chancebesides the homeworkto review what you have learned or internalize the material. I have never suffered to this degree mentally due to a course. Whatever you think the workload of this course may be, double that. I am not sure if it is worth the semester-long mental suffering. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Prof. Minsky is great. He teaches the material very well. He always makes sure to interact with the students despite it being a large class which is nice. In terms of material, I wish we spent less time on measure theory and more time on fourier series. I wish we had stuck with things related to fourier series until the end as opposed to switching back to measure theory. As it is now it is still a wonderful class. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There was way too much content crammed into each lecture, with little time left for me to digest before doing the psets. Office hours are relatively unstructured, though both TFs were well-qualified and friendly. I stopped attending live lectures because it was too difficult to keep up with. The graders were incredibly harsh, especially towards the beginning of the semester. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the lectures were good and informative, and in general very helpful for understanding the topics. I found the most frustrating aspect of the course to be the grading. Often times myself and other people in the class I spoke to would fully understand the topics but be marked off considerable points on problem sets and exams for minute details when the understanding of proofs were fully there. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Minsky is excellent and really cares about the success of his students. The material is really interesting,  Minsky's lectures are (for the most part) clear, and exams are fair. However, the course is a LOT of work. The problem sets easily took me 20 hours per week. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength - Professor Minsky, he is easily one of the clearest and insight math lectures in the department. He really works hard before diving into a proof to make sure people understand the idea in order that the dont get lost in the technical details and can actually see what the math is saying. Also the ULAs are goated for this course, specifically Richard. Richards office hours from 7-9 on Fridays were the only place to be on a Friday night. Weaknesses - after the first 1-2 weeks I dont think there are any weaknesses with this course, the only initial one was getting used to the background knowledge needed for this course/the rigor of psets. Coming from 230 this course was a good leap in rigor and in the first few weeks there was a bit of extra material I had to catch up on. However Minsky really made this transition as nice as possible be providing readings and extra pre-lecture videos on topics people might not know! Also sometimes the psets could take 20+ hours of work and one problem could be 5 pages typed. This isnt a weakness per se but some weekends it was annoying and the motivation to finish a 5 page problem became extremely low. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would be hard-pressed to discuss the strengths of the course without mentioning Prof. Minsky and the efforts he undertook to make this course as great as it was. The course certainly is thorough in discussing the material and covers foundational concepts in real analysis, but I think that's really where the strengths of the course itself stops and the strength that is Prof. Minsky begins. Prof. Minsky is fantastic at explaining the material. His lectures are clear and concise. He makes an effort to address each student's questions and concerns, whether that about the material or the course itself. But most importantly, he fosters an environment that is conducive toward learning. He really places an emphasis on learning the material and works so that students's learning isn't impeded. As a result, students were willing to participate in class and in discussion during office hours by sharing ideas and asking questions. 

The only "weakness" that I can think of is that in the beginning, the grading was somewhat strict. As a result, I, and from what I've heard and seen, other students, were spending a considerable amount of time writing up our problem sets (with actually solving the problem sets taking up only a smaller portion of that time). <br/></div>
