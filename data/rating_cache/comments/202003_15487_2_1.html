<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The biggest strength of this course would have to be the diversity of the personal memoirs. It's not everyday that we get to hear what North Korea is like from the voices of North Koreans themselves or other nationalities who have lived for extended periods of time in North Korea. Some of my favorite memoirs included Bandi's The Accusation and Masaji Ishikawa's A River in Darkness. The former includes stories written directly inside North Korea, and the latter recounts the overlooked story of Japanese nationals who migrated to North Korea. Overall, reading their stories has helped me challenge preexisting narratives about North Korea and its people that don't give North Koreans a chance to speak for themselves. Moreover, examining North Korea from a more "micro" level (on the grounds approach if you will) also helped me empathize more with everyday struggles that the people face. Their struggles and aspirations are no different than what people all around the world face. 

I wished that we had the chance to read more personal memoirs because they were that enjoyable to read. I was at first worried that I wouldn't have been able to read a whole book a week, but the stories are so fascinating that I couldn't put books down sometimes. I understand that it's impossible to know everything about North Korean society within one condensed semester, but this class was more than enough for an introduction. Maybe in the future, the head instructor might consider making the class at least twice a week to allow for more discussion and lectures. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: Professor Hwansoo Kim himself is a strength. Weakness: Sometimes I wished Professor Kim would lecture more than having more student-led discussions. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: its content
Weaknesses: a decent amount of it is student discussions, and I wish we had varied up class structure more. Like, if we had done group activities or debates or something <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought most of our readings were really engaging and revealing, and our discussion posts helped me clarify what I thought and understand my peers' perspectives. Our last class was on North Korea moving into the future-- I wish we spent more time on what is happening in the present that could signal change for the north korean regime and people. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The readings were very versatile and interesting: we read academic papers, memoirs, fiction, news articles, interviews, and even watched documentaries and films. Because Juche ideology was a focus point in the class, I would have also liked to have had the chance to read and discuss more primary sources  like Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-il's speeches for example. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think this course had a really interesting thesis (can we treat Juche ideology as a religion), but I was somewhat disappointed in how we developed that driving claim. It seemed like the course was more "North Korean history through a religious lens" which was still really interesting, but I was hoping for a more modern view on the interactions between religion and global affairs and how the parallels we can draw with Juche should impact how we look at North Korean government and society. I also think that this course was a little too focused on Christian ideology, and I would have loved to see more critique of this rather than viewing it simply as a "saving" force for North Korea. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course gave me a really good background on the establishment of the DPRK as a state and about North Korea culture. I learned a lot about the inner workings of the country and gained an appreciation for how North Korea's history and cultural attitudes influence its action in modern times (with issues like nuclear weapons). The books we read were really interesting and useful in learning about the country.  I do wish the course had focused a bit more on the religious component of the class. We talked about the idea of religion a lot, but it never felt like we were really getting anywhere to me, and I wish we had focused on developing a definition a firmer definition of the term earlier in the course than we did. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: There was a lot I liked about this course. For staters, this course had interesting material, and I learned a good amount about North Korea that I had never known previously. Dr. Kim is a very sweet and approachable professor. He structured this class well in terms of order of units where it felt like it followed a logical progression. People were very ready to participate so it never felt like there was a lull in conversation. I really enjoyed being broken out into breakout rooms with my peers because everyone wanted to participate. I also liked that therre was such an explicit effort made to switch up class structure. The assignment workload was quite light. We just had one seminar to lead, weekly 500 word discussion posts and a final paper. One of the best and coolest facets of this course was getting to meet Monique Macias on the last day of class. Getting to meet and interact with someone who was raised in North Korea and has close ties to the Kim family was incredible and truly once in a lifetime. 

Weaknesses: The biggest is that this class was very anti-North Korea, pro-Western world. I felt many of our discussions got into bashing the North Korean way of life which is not fair (and also not the point of this course). Iljea (our TA) was the great balancing force in this dimension always forcing us to rationalize the biases we have against the DPRK and for the Western World. North Korea is far from perfect (what place is), but it's not our job to make an executive decision or summary judgement on their way of life. On that same note, it was easy to tell that the class was made up of almost all Christians. As a result, our discussions on issues like "missionaries" were not in the least bit critical. There's something seriously problematic about a missionary saying he "saw the need for saving in the DPRK people," yet no one wanted to acknowledge this (especially in thinking about how imperial powers had messed with the Korean Peninsula for centuries). Second, although I thought the class was organized, I felt we were given too much in reading assignments every week. We often had a whole book and a film. In truth, that just means not everyone will read which will only hurt the conversation. Third, it felt like the same conversations were repeated class after class. In particular, "Is Juche a religion?" was asked in basically every class. Relying on different students every week to craft the conversation undoubtedly resulted in some of that repetition. On the note of seminar structure, I felt the non-student led portion also became repetitive and somewhat disorganized. In the beginning, we used that time to talk about religion in North Korea, North Korean political structure, and Korean history all of which I found interesting. After we had gotten through that material, the early lecture portion of the course became more disorganized. Lastly, on the note of assignments, I think the workload was great. However, truthfully, we got NO grades before our final papers (except for our discussion leading). It would be nice to get grades for some things prior to so we could know where we're at heading into our final paper. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course, for its first time, was structured very well and seminars were not boring in any regard. Whether it were virtual or in-person would not have had much bearing on the course material or facilitation. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I felt like the weekly readings were pretty long. But theyre all engaging so its worth reading and fun to read. I wish I had gotten more feedback on the weekly discussion posts I made. I wasnt sure if I was doing them correctly or if there were ways that I could improve. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Everyone in the class was engaged and very interested in the subject, so discussions were that much better and enjoyable. The films we watched and the memoirs we read were very thought-provoking and emotionally touching. There is a fair amount of reading, but the work is certainly worth it and if you enjoy the subject, it will often not even feel like work. 
I wish we received more individual feedback because our main source of feedback was peers' responses during discussions. Also, this class focused more on the North Korean aspect and not so much on religion. I enjoyed the class regardless. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Prof Kim and Iljae created a wonderful environment that felt open and welcoming even over zoom. They both have an incredible amount of knowledge and insight. I wouldn't necessarily say there were any weaknesses other than I wish there was more time to discuss certain topics or go more in depth because the material is truly fascinating and even after an hour or so there is still plenty to talk about! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Almost every aspect of this course is perfection in my opinion: the structure, assignments, readings, discussions, the TA, and of course, the professor most notably, who drives this course with insight and passion. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: this class is truly one of its kind, and I don't regret for a second that I chose to take it. Professor Kim made a wonderful introduction video that sold the class to me within the first few seconds. Take this class for Professor Kim, but also for the subject matter. This is an extraordinary opportunity to study North Korea in depth, without demonizing the country. Reading memoirs and firsthand accounts, while watching films and discussing the way the government functions, and contextualizing it with a little bit of Korean history (from the foundations of the country to Japanese colonialism, to the Korean war, and finally to modern day North Korea) we touched pretty much all the bases. And this is an incredibly unique perspective from which to learn about the country; a religious one, which provides numerous avenues of study. We also had incredible guest speakers, like Monique Macias and Ria Chae, who brought their expertise (and lived experience) to the class, which made it even better. The discussion posts are entirely open ended and graded on completion, so there's little stress involved and you're really allowed to give your opinion, whether that's airing your grievances or engaging critically. And the final "essay" can be a project; I chose to avoid writing an essay and made a video project, which allowed me to present my findings and my argument in a completely different fashion, which was fantastic in terms of flexibility but also goes to show that there are multiple ways of showing competency in a subject area. Professor Kim brought in contemporary resources, like BTS and BTS Army, and we loved talking to and with him in class. The readings were also chosen really well, save for Kenneth Bae's memoir and some of the longer, dense history texts. The memoirs were a fantastic addition to the course, as were the movies selected. The films were incredible.
Weaknesses: While this class was highlight of my week, there are certainly ways it can be improved. At times, it felt like a glorified book club. The second half of the class, wherein one to two students led discussion... frankly, I did not get a lot out of this experience. Discussion leaders gather information and formulate questions from our discussion posts, making a presentation to summarize the week's readings and then diving into discussion. Perhaps it works better in a classroom setting, but over Zoom, it was rather awkward raising our hands via Zoom and then jumping around from student to student in a very inorganic way. Iljea, the TA, would jump in, but only to disagree or provide another perspective. It was really free rein at that point. I would have preferred more lecturing from Iljea and Professor Kim. The discussions didn't really teach me as much as the readings or the lectures in the first half of the class; I could've discussed the same things with my family members or a friend outside of class. More involvement from Professor Kim would be great, because the structure just gets repetitive. We had one class where Iljea lectured, and then after 10-15 minutes of his lecture, the floor was opened to questions. It was silent for a few minutes, because no one had anything to say. At all. Then people scratched their heads and came up with inane questions, just to fill the emptiness and silence. Not super effective for making the class very engaging. But on other days we'd have incredibly lively and fascinating discussions, or we'd watch something provocative and it would be lovely to hear from everyone. There was just something off in the balance and grand scheme of things. This class was a wonderful experience, but it could definitely be improved in these respects. I want to learn, not just listen to my peers. The professor and TA know more than we do, right? So I want to be taught! <br/></div>
