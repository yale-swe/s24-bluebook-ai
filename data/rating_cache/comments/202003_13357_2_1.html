<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There isn't an enormous incentive to watch lectures. Anything assignments or discussions require only a knowledge of the reading, as long as the reading has been done thoroughly, the lecture rarely adds any additional understanding that isn't provided through discussions in discussion sections. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: You learn a lot and have great TFs to help you
Weaknesses: Very easy to feel overwhelmed and confuse the different thinkers <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: really engaged teaching fellows who want to help you succeed; lectures provide clarification and summaries for sometimes difficult readings; readings are manageable; essay topics are genuinely interesting
Weaknesses: the final's structure was really difficult (three essays of three pages in 72 hours with challenging prompts that require argumentation and reference to 2 or more thinks) and required significantly more time than I think imagined by the teaching team <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths-
Great professor, engaging lectures
Weakness-
Difficult long readings, heavy workload <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: discussed a variety of philosophers in politics
Weaknesses: Each philosopher only receives a week of attention (which amounts to exactly two lectures) which is nowhere near enough to comprehend the nuances of their arguments; often times it was up to the students to understand what the philosophers were talking about. Lecture didn't clear anything up because the professor provided extremely biased reviews of the philosophers, and endorsed those she liked while being extremely pushy of those she disagreed with. This led to pretty much of a "what i think political philosophy should be" rather than "political philosophy." Also, like half of the lessons were self-promos of the professor's book or books she planned to write. The course began with promising students to come up with their own response to the question of "who should rule," and then proceeded to answer that question in the first lesson for the students. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Engaging, important texts. Spectacular professor. The course structure/flow is fantastic.
Weaknesses: I wanted more reading...which will make the course harder. However, the difficulty of the course grades-wise stemmed from rather ambiguous essay grading. I had little idea how to write a successful paper. There should have been far more effort to showcase how an "A" paper is written. We all know how to write essays, however, writing a political philosophy paper is different. I felt a bit like I was winging it since we receive no feedback on discussion posts. The drafts were helpful but usually the prompts were released slightly late so the drafts were not great (speaking for a number of students). <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures, sections, and amount of work was good.  I think the biggest weakness in this course is its lack of diversity in the authors we read - we only read one female author.  I don't think people understand how hard it is being female and reading all these books talking about how females don't possess full rationality or virtue and are therefore subordinate.  I can't even imagine how it must feel being black and reading so many justifications for slavery.  I wish we read more female and minority voices.  We read a few, but wish there were more. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One strength of the course was the breadth that it covered: we really went through 2000+ years of philosophy. A weakness might be that, while the essays assessed our ability to make internal arguments, we did not extensively talk about this in lecture-- it was just sort of "expected." It would have been helpful if there had been more emphasis on different kinds of philosophical arguments during lecture. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â it's A LOT of reading. If you're a first-year, I don't know if this is the best class for you to take, especially if you're going to be balancing other classes, extracurriculars, and social activities. One or two philosophers a week is A LOT. The only reason I got through it was that the TF explained important concepts more in-depth during the section <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: covers a broad range of different philosophies and political systems, does a good job of summarizing general themes/ideas with each author (especially during the lectures), writing intensive section was a great help for improving writing skills; Weaknesses: when discussing complex ideas presented by some authors the live lectures often did not provide a very good explanation and I would often have to wait until discussion section to understand major ideas, the lectures focused A LOT on historical/personal background of certain philosophers despite encouraging students not to focus on contextual information in papers - mixed signals <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Our reading material was engaging. But I believe the lectures could include more discussions and interactions with students. Especially for the writing intensive version, the course should provide more example papers to guide students as the reading material does not necessarily set a good example for how students are expected to write. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Great course overall. One thing that could be improved is the TA system. I think there should be more standardization with grading and expectations for work among the Teaching fellows. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course provided a strong foundation for learning about classic texts in this subject area. The TAs for the course were also all very dedicated and helpful. However, it would have been nice to explore more of a diverse range of texts. To be frank, most of the authors were old white men, and it would have been nice to look at works from women and minority groups. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The larger lectures were a bit harder to participate in, but the best part of the course was the weekly discussion section with the teaching fellows. They were very engaging and intellectually stimulating. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of this class is the sections and their interactive character. The importance put on writing and developing arguments is a key strength of the class which transcends the immediate content and proves very useful in a wider context. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I felt as through there was too much reading to manage in this course. It was not possible to complete all the readings we were asked to do. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was a good overview, however I think some of the big questions we were trying to answer were too simplistic. I think that instead of applying the question of who should rule to multiple different authors, we could have focused more precisely on certain ideas in each work. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Landemore's lectures were very clear, and TF's were great.

Weaknesses: sometimes breakout room activities took too much time. I wish there had been more lecturing during lecture times. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Sometimes, the course felt like it was moving too fast as we would focus on one thinker during one week and then move on. I believe this course could be improved by better connecting all the thinkers in a sort of line of thought rather than just grouping them based on chronology/topics. Overall though, lectures and sections were very helpful in clarifying the very dense readings/topics. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: everything really

Weaknesses: Only one concern; I came away from the final session getting the impression that a lot of fellow students (ones not in my section) had taken from the course the notion that democracy is worse than some form of aristocratic government. I don't believe this was the intent of the course, but I do find it worrying given that many of these students will find themselves in positions of influence in the future. Perhaps a greater emphasis on the final few texts, specifically in comparing them to the earlier texts and highlighting the advancements made in sociological analysis, might allow these students to develop greater understanding. Perhaps not though! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â For me, the most significant strength of this course was the quality of teaching delivered by the Professor and my Teaching Fellow. They were very kind and approachable and transmitted concepts with clarity. Another strength of this course is the Discussion Section format that accompanies it, which has been the platform where I have had some of the most insightful discussions and debates during my time at Yale so far.

Whereas I on one hand consider the number of texts we explored in the class to be a strength, each one left me with a sense that I had not fully explored and that there was much to learn about it still. I understand however, that we could well have spent more than a semester discussing the implications of even one single text on the syllabus.

This course was very thought-provoking, and I loved it for that. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Provides an introduction to some foundational political philosophers and their way of thinking; Instructor used these philosophies to consider their potential implications on modern society
Weakness: Too many reading assignments were assigned over such a short period of time that students are not given ample time nor opportunity to fully comprehend the material. Instead, students are left with a basic, baseline understanding of each reading. Additionally, I found most of the lectures in the first half of the semester to be unhelpful and mediocre at best. The professor would merely paste quotes from the readings on to the slides, read them aloud, but failed to provide further context or analysis. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course is interesting, but there is a little too much reading. It felt like we were just reading to read sometimes because we would sometimes read parts of a piece of philosophy, then not really talk much about that part in section or lecture. This class could be improved by incorporating more diverse thinkers, as we mainly read (and spent the most time on) the political philosophy of white men. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â In my view the course was just about structured optimally. We covered a huge range of material with just enough time to dive into each one, which was really fun. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think this course had a great initial start, with a lot of the readings having clear progressions week by week, but towards the end it sometimes felt like a jumbled mix of authors with no cohesive weekly plan. Further, the lectures were not the most engaging given the virtual format. Given this downside, the live discussion sections were my favorite part of the course; I found them very helpful in clarifying and discussing the readings. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures were alright but not especially engaging. Sometimes they felt more like summaries of the reading than anything else. But, overall, I really enjoyed the class and felt that it was a great intro course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of the course were lectures and seminars, as they were always clear and thorough. I think where it can be improved is that some of the readings did not relate to the content of lectures, while some parts of lectures did not relate to the content of the reading. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked much of the content; however, some lectures were very shallow. Much of the meaning of the authors can be ascertained in the reading, and yet often lectures just reiterate the reading. It makes the course seem shallower than it is because the deeper implications of the work is only touched on in discussion section. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course allowed me to dive deeply into the works of several famous thinkers. I felt that the lectures could be improved slightly-- sometimes it was difficult to follow Professor Landemore, as she would often use terms without defining them. It was also hard to keep separate her opinions of the thinkers from what scholarship/more objective sources have said. Finally, a very small thing, but her slides often had tons of text. It would have been helpful if she put less on each slide and explained each thing more comprehensively. I also think the course could be improved by perhaps reading excerpts, rather than the full works for several thinkers (for instance Locke and Rousseau). This would allow us to discuss each thinker in a bit more depth, and possibly include more thinkers that felt absence from the course. (For instance, it was hard to understand the comparison between Marx and Hegel having read absolutely no Hegel, and hearing only a 5 minute summary in lecture.) Finally, I think it would have been helpful to trace a few more themes over the course of the semester. Professor Landemore shaped the whole course around the question "who should rule," but many of the thinkers were less interested in who should rule, and more interested in questions about how people should rule, or what principles defined government and justice, how society was formed, or how society would shift. It might have been useful to separate the course into 3-5 units, examining different guiding questions, rather than forcing all of the thinkers into a lens of analysis that didn't always directly apply. <br/></div>
