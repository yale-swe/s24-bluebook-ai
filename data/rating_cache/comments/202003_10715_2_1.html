<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course covered a variety of different methods and I do believe that I have a better understanding of contemporary machine learning as a result. However, the most frustrating aspect was the gaping overhead when it came to the math presented by Professor Negahban during lectures. Even as someone who has taken more advanced math courses, I couldn't understand the huge logical jumps with little explanation when proving results or motivating certain concepts. Even if it would mean slowing down the pace of lectures a bit, I wish the math had been more digestible. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: you can tell Sahand is excited about the content, and his lectures reflect that. He hosts office hours consistently, and he responds to class feedback very well. He asked us how we felt about the class (strengths/weaknesses basically) and genuinely took in that feedback and adjusted accordingly -- not many professors do this, so I really appreciate this aspect!

Weaknesses: grading is very slow, class is a bit disorganized, felt like lecture content wasn't helpful for psets (one of the psets was really difficult, and lectures did not help at all). My main complaint is that the lectures went too fast (felt like content was being crammed and not explained well), so I ended up not understanding many of the more complex topics. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The homework could have applied more of the coursework from lecture; at times the math felt very tangential. More office hours should be added as well. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was very challenging. The material was not taught in a way that was understandable to many people and the problem sets were excessively long. The syllabus did not make clear when assignments would be due and quizzes were often announced on short notice, <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was listed on Yale Course Search as Applied Data Mining and Machine Learning, however this was not an applied class at all. Barely any lectures focused on implementation, but rather dwelled on mathematical derivations or intuitive concepts. Also although the syllabus said that no prior knowledge of Python was required, Sahand failed to listen to student requests and never taught any Python, but magically expected that we were able to code complex functions for the homework. The course also assumes knowledge of matrix calculus, although that isn't clearly stated anywhere. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Sahand tried very hard but he did not seem invested in making the lectures more clear or connecting the topics. There was a lot of math that flew over my head. The problem sets and quizzes could have been connected better to the course material and given more guidance. The problem sets could also have been longer, as I did not actually understand most of the course material as I was not able to practice implementing it. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class has so much potential it just didn't live up to. The weaknesses of this course is how much math is done instead of coding. The professor himself said that doing all this math was not necessary for real world applications and it's just a was to differentiate the course from 355. Talk about a waste. If you want to learn how to use python to do machine learning, take a different course. The lectures were quite fast in the beginning, but were adjusted towards the middle of the course to be slower paced which was very helpful. There are definitely not enough office hours for the course and it seemed as though some of the TAs/ULAs were overworked and overwhelmed. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Learned about a wide range of topics. Focus of the course was on the math and statistics side of ML, not so much the coding (as the syllabus suggests; if you want to learn more about the coding side, take 355). Problem sets were challenging and pretty interesting. Instructor was very responsive on Piazza. Instructor definitely seems to know a lot about the subject. Quizzes were chill, forced me to make sure I understood what was going on in the course. Not an assessment heavy course  there's no final, and the midterm was a pretty small part of our grade. Weaknesses: Logistically, the course was a little unorganized. We had fewer assignments and quizzes than the syllabus indicated at the beginning of the semester. Grading was a little unclear. But I don't think these were major weaknesses. I still learned a ton. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course covered good material, but overall the course had more weaknesses than strengths. The instructor (Sahand) was about as disorganized as could be, and the pset difficulty varied WILDLY. His lectures were always confusing as well <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was incredibly difficult to folllow, as lectures randomly changed from live to recorded, and there were typed slides about half of the time. Our homework was often unrelated to what was proved or shown in lecture, and we didnt have a good source of information like a clear textbook to inform our work. The homework assignments frankly were too difficult to help me learn the material any better, and I often just blindly tried to find help online and use that to put down any answer I could get. The same went for the coding assignments  we were asked one week to code a K Nearest Neighbors algorithm from scratch, then our csv outputs were graded. The average in the class was a 5 out of 10. We never received any feedback on why our grades came out so low, or what we did wrong. Further, it took until AFTER the credit/d deadline to get any meaningful grades back, including for several quizzes. The class also did not follow most of what was described on the syllabus. We were told wed have 5 quizzes, but we had three. There were weeks when we wouldnt receive new assignments, or we would receive only a math assignment and wait for a coding portion only to be told right before the due date that there was none. It was difficult to get ahold of the professor and TFs for this kind of information, and I know many students were frustrated. Office hours were often moved or canceled, and weirdly we were made to sign up for 1-on-1 office hours. This was intimidating and confusing, and I stopped going. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was centered around the mathematics of machine learning, rather than the coding aspect like I expected. I wish there was more guidance with Python - as a beginner who had never coded in Python prior to the class, I spent a lot of time on the first few coding assignments stuck on syntax problems. I enjoyed the mathematical derivations and gained a better intuition for how gradient descent / random forests / gradient boosting etc. works, but it would have been more effectively reinforced with corresponding coding tasks. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â ABSOLUTELY NO STRENGTHS. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE CLASS.  I have waited very long to write this review. This is a long read, but if you are seriously considering taking this class, read this fully. I do not want anyone else to suffer like I and many others did. And this is coming from someone who has done well and is quite confident of getting an A in the class. I regretted taking this class so much. Learnt absolutely nothing, though I got almost perfect scores on the assignments. The assignments were terribly designed, extremely confusing, didn't test your grasp of the material but rather your diligence in pestering the TAs and trying to figure out what exactly the question wants. 80% of the time was spent trying to figure out what the question wants. That's how I did well. TERRIBLE ASSIGNMENTS! They teach you nothing! LECTURES WERE IMMENSELY FRUSTRATING! Trust me, I have friends in the class, and EVERYONE (I mean, every single one) I know does not understand 90% of what Sahand is saying. He just talks to himself, reads equations off the slides, does absolutely no explaining, and skips to the next slide. Lectures were soooo frustrating to attend or listen to. At one point, I had a phobia of even attending Sahand's lectures, because I just knew I'd be confused and misled the entire time. You may ask, how about ask questions on Piazza? Haha, yes, indeed, guess what: He gives you one-word replies, or says he does not understand the question, and then links you to Stanford's ML course and notes. I then proceed to watch a Stanford lecture for 3 hours, trying to figure out their notation. It's much better delivered, but the notation Stanford's Andrew Ng uses is completely different from Sahand. So it's a terrible mess. And excuse me, you're supposed to be teaching the course, not just redirect your students to another course video. We're paying tuition to Yale, not Stanford. Also, Sahand simply ignores some Piazza questions! Essentially, TERRIBLE PIAZZA RESPONSES AND EXTREMELY IRRESPONSIBLE PROFESSOR. The midterm was horribly designed, barely tested what we learnt, instead focusing on calculus. Quizzes were a joke, they were so trivial and just involved copying the slides. Psets were confusing and time-consuming and taught you nothing. REALLY TERRIBLE ASSESSMENT. Office hours were a JOKE - I did not find a single good office hours throughout the semester. ULAs could not help at all. Sahand cancels and reschedules office hours as and when he wishes, giving zero consideration to his students' schedules. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING! Finally, this is the class with the WORST logistics and organization EVER. In case you think I'm just ranting, let me present some evidence. The following are quotes from the syllabus, followed by what was actually implemented:
1. "Assignments will be posted roughly every week and a half". This corresponds to about 9 assignments. Guess how many we got? 5! Some took 20 hours, some took 3 hours. There's so much inconsistency. No idea when the next assignment is going to be, everyone's just guessing, Sahand doesn't say a single word, everyday's like playing Russian Roulette.
2. "Mid-semester exam, which will just basically be a homework assignment that you not work on with anybody else.": It was not a homework assignment. It became a timed assessment. Also, it was given right before thanksgiving break. That's not even midterm.
3. "The exam will also include a portion where you will discuss a random solution with the teaching staff.": No such thing was given.
4. 5 quizzes were promised. Only 2 were given, and only 1 was graded.
Piazza responses were misleading and outright contradictory: He says quizzes are 10% in the syllabus, and then later says that they "don't matter". He contradicts himself on so many things about grading policy. Promises to give grade estimates by midterm, and then goes offline and uncontactable for a week. Promises 1 more quiz and 2 more psets, but none were given. What a joke. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course had a lot of weaknesses and very few strengths.  At a bare, bare minimum, I expected to deepen my coding skills in Python.  Even that didnt happen.  There were only five homework assignments, just three of which required any substantive coding.  

Most lectures were spent executing endless derivations whose goal or ultimate purpose I usually failed to see, since Sahand mostly did a poor job explaining how the nuances of all the math fit together to coalesce into broader ideas about machine learning.  I couldnt wait to be done listening to the lectures each week, and I couldnt even bring myself to watch the ones from after the midterm exam.

It was far more difficult to get help than it should have been.  I attended Parkers office hours a few times, and he was a solid explainer of ideas, but I sent him emails on three separate occasions and never received a response.  I also emailed Sahand four or five different, detailed questions about various homework assignments when I was lost and frustrated.  Every single time, he sent back a one-line response, usually telling me to go look on Piazza.  Once, he merely said, I have to log off now, and didnt bother addressing any part of my original ten-line email. 

The frustrating lack of help from Sahand or Parker left the burden to fall to the ULAs, who were wonderful.  I could not have completed all the homework assignments without playing some serious email tag with Isabel and Luke, who seemed completely overburdened and swamped by student questions.  There were times when they took awhile to get back to me, but they pretty much always did get back to me, providing the kind of guidance that Sahand and Parker should have been better at dishing out.

Finally, the homework assignments were simply torturous.  We barely developed any new coding skills, and I feel fortunate that I had some background in Python going in.  My friends who had not previously coded in Python struggled mightily to simultaneously learn a new language and try to implement it to solve difficult homework problems, since Sahand provided just a cursory explanation of Jupyter Notebooks and the basic syntax of Python. 

Perhaps my expectations for this class were misguided, but I anticipated learning about the general parameters of various machine learning algorithms and techniques, then practicing applying those techniques to different sets of data in order to build models or answer specific research questions.  The homeworks, as it turned out, were nothing like I expected.  They usually contained a substantial component that was pure math; ostensibly meant to mirror the material we had covered in lecture, these math problems were extremely frustrating, using notation and techniques for which Sahand had not bothered to provide a baseline explanation.  

The homework assignments, in general, were far too advanced and nuanced for a class that was supposed to introduce us to many of these machine learning concepts for the first time.  I understood going in that there would be a math component, but I didnt expect this course to be a poorly-taught math class, which is essentially what it turned into.   The only strength of this course was its grade breakdown: homework was worth a substantial portion of the grade and there was no final exam, meaning that if you did well on the homework (as I did, thanks to lots of guidance from the ULAs) and moderately well on the midterm, youd earn a fine grade for the class.  Every other aspect, however, was a weakness: from the instructor, to the pace at which topics were covered, to the lousy waysomehow both too deep and too surface-levelthat the topics were taught, to the availability of help from the instructor (or lack thereof), to the difficulty of the homework assignments. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Very poorly organized. Course kept toggling back and forth all over the place with little sense of direction. It improved a little towards the end but by then it was too little too late. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really can't think of a single strength of the course. The lectures were terrible--I had an easier time reading the slides myself than listening to Sahand just read them off. Sometimes Sahand didn't use slides, but instead used an interactive notebook, and those are just illegible--I did not learn anything from those lectures. And his response time to student questions on Piazza was just grossly inconsiderate. Sometimes he would just disappear from the platform for days while important questions sat there without answers. At other points, he would blatantly ignore the more important questions and leave the unanswered, but would answer less important questions. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Ultimately, although I found the course often disorganized, it does force you to grapple with the math and the code behind many foundational methods in ML. Its greatest weakness is that it seems like a course still figuring out exactly what it is supposed to be. It was not the most "applied" course, and it involved very little (if any) data mining methods. The material-trajectory of the course was not always clear, and lectures often felt tangential or fell behind schedule. Sometimes Professor Neghaban explains things lucidly, especially when the slides or notes seem well-organized in advance (and on Piazza), but oftentimes the lectures were just confusingly-explained. If one of the course objectives really is to equip students with some applied ML capabilities, I think that one possible improvement of the course could be the addition of a final project at the end of term. Personally I got a lot out of the harder math and proofs in the course, but wish that there had been much more guidance on matrix calculus. Other strengths include Python notebooks which demonstrates the course concepts (although they could use more organization and comments), and the psets' inclusion of hints to help us along the larger problems. I did really appreciate Professor Neghaban's efforts to gather and respond to student feedback throughout the course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This was the most disorganized class that I've taken at Yale. I realize that teaching during a pandemic is very difficult, but the professor failed at just communicating with us about logistics and grading, which made this virtual class even harder. In the days leading up to the midterm drop deadline, so many students were posting on piazza begging for homework grades to be released. We had finished 5 assignments so far, but only the first homework from a month and a half ago was graded. A few hours before the drop deadline of 5pm, the professor released the grade distribution of the class without actually telling us our individual grades, and we STILL only had 1 assignment graded at this point, so we didn't even know where we fell on the distribution. The student piazza posts about this were left answered. The syllabus said that we would have 5 quizzes in total over the course of the semester. By Thanksgiving break, with 1 week left of class, we had only taken 2 quizzes. The professor did not tell us the plan for finishing the other quizzes or update the syllabus. Only AFTER we asked on piazza did he tell us that there would be no more quizzes this semester. I'm not complaining about how the number of quizzes was reduced. The issue is that the professor almost never told us what was going on when it came to logistics or grading  (how many assignments should we expect in the next few weeks, why was grading taking so long)--literally ANY explanation would have been helpful. The students had to constantly ask. Also, it seemed that the TAs were just as confused as the students. Homeworks were assigned at random intervals, and it was unclear how many homeworks we would have in total (once again, no updates about this until students asked). This made it very difficult for students to plan for the semester. The lecture material and homework assignments were already extremely challenging, so having a disorganized class with the students feeling confused about the schedule and structure only made everything worse. This class also had way too much emphasis on math and not enough on coding. All I remember is doing a bunch of matrix multiplication, calculus, and mathematical proofs for the homeworks and maybe occasionally using a Python ML package. However, Professor Negahban did say that he would try to balance the math and coding in future iterations of the course. Professor Negahban was pretty responsive on piazza, which was helpful when working on the psets, but grading/logistic questions were often left unanswered. He also really valued student feedback and sent out a few surveys over the course of the semester, which I appreciated. I think that this could have been a good class, because the topics are interesting and the professor is very knowledgeable, but I did not enjoy it at all. <br/></div>

Weaknesses: honestly, many. First, there was too much math and not enough coding in the problem sets so while we learned good theory, we didn't get any real practice applying it. Secondly and most importantly, the course is heavily unorganized. Sahand basically disappeared for a few weeks in the middle of the course. Something like 3 weeks went by without a problem set being released, and not even the TAs knew what was going on. Grading was an absolute mess and results were almost never released, so much so that we didn't even have a good sense of our grades before the drop and Credit/D deadlines. The midterm in the course took place 3 weeks after the midway point in the semester, the drop deadline. It was abysmal, honestly. <br/></div>

I liked the mathematical focus, since I'm more comfortable learning the available implementations on my own, but other students may have preferred to learn more immediately-applicable coding skills. The lectures moved fast at times because the slides were quite dense with notes and equations, even though the concepts weren't too hard to understand. More frequent check-ins with students about course pace would have helped, especially in the online format.

Organization-wise, this course was not organized well. Psets were sporadically distributed and varied wildly in difficulty. The lectures were a random mix of live and recorded, which isnt really an issue given covid, but it wouldve been nice if the recorded lectures were more standardized so we could schedule around them. There were also a couple of deadlines during the semester (drop, credit/d/fail, etc.) that we were promised to get grades by but ultimately did not get, so it wouldve been nice to get those when we were told wed get them by. I think ultimately, this course mightve needed more TFs or ULAs to support a class of this size, especially during covid times. <br/></div>

It would have been much more interesting to understand the different topics as a general progression of some sort, which was at times completely absent such that a new topic seemed like a complete surprise. Where the class could be improved the most for students without an advanced background in the subject is in the manner in which new topics are taught: rather than jumping right into a slide full of math, a motivation, followed by an intuition, then an example, and finally the math would have been much better for my style of learning. Otherwise, it often felt like a disjointed journey through different math proofs where my fragmented understanding of their relevance and what they were for followed later. <br/></div>

There were many times where I did an assignment and thought I would get a certain grade only to be shocked when my grade was higher than I expected. However, there are also many weaknesses to this course, starting with the organization of this course. This was a very disorganized course where live lectures were often cancelled for no reason and where the structure of the syllabus was weakly followed. For example, we were expected to have 5 quizzes for this course. Instead, we only had 2, which made them extremely important. Assignments sometimes took 2 to 3 weeks to be graded (not exaggerating here), which made it difficult for us to determine our grade in the course. <br/></div>
