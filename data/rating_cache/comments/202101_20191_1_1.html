<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One of the strengths of this course is that students get meetings with one of the amazing tutors to receive feedback and discuss the themes produced each week. This is the only class I've taken at Yale so far that incorporates 1-on-1 meetings for feedback, which has been extremely helpful and provided deeper insight on my writing than could the normal mode of feedback for writing classes. Another great thing about Daily Themes is that it's taught by Mark Oppenheimer, who is not only an excellent lecturer but is also energetic and enthusiastic. His teaching never disappoints, and is one of the classes that I actually look forward to attending (and I took this class virtually, so that's quite impressive!). <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really liked the podcast format, since it makes virtual learning a lot more interesting. In fact, I found the podcast format easier to pay attention to than any in-person English lecture I've had at Yale. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: tutor relationship, podcast lectures (a great break from staring at screens), interesting conversation.
Weaknesses: Wish that in-person lectures were a little more interactive, and, though most of the lectures felt relevant to the craft of writing, a few left me scratching my head about what I could take away from them. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This was the most worthwhile class I took at Yale. I would definitely take during your junior or senior year - when you have more life experience to write a theme a day. The only suggestion I have for improvement would be for more themes to be revisions of prior themes <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The highlight of this course are the tutors. It is so special to be able to meet with your tutor and discuss your writing with them in-depth, every week, and to get to know them. There are so few classes at Yale that give you this level of individualized attention to help you improve. The tutors are all such interesting, engaging, and passionate people who genuinely wish to see you improve and offer such practical feedback to make you improve. The other strength of this course is the fact that the themes are not graded and the work is graded as a collective. This really reduces the academic pressure of this class and allows for experimentation and risk-taking that a strict grading regimen often prohibits. I really wish that all classes at Yale were graded and assessed this way, rather than putting the weight on particular assignments. And finally, the last strength of this course is the fact that it is daily themes - making us write daily, while can be stressful alongside other classes' work, really lets you get into the habit of not romanticizing writing as well as making sure you are practicing writing consistently. I really appreciated the opportunity to take our Daily Themes work and then translate that into a longer, two-week piece at the end of the semester as well. This was an experience that really made me ponder and reflect on the stories I wanted to write and craft.

I would say the only weakness of this course is that sometimes, the prompts can be a bit repetitive or rather cliche, which makes them a bit boring to write about. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The main strength of the course is simply writing once a day. It also benefits from great podcasts and tutors. The main weakness was the revamped lecture, which were mostly engaging and fun, but occasionally (especially towards the end of the semester) became professor Oppenheimer and the tutors discussing books that I think most students had never read/heard of. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Great course! Would totally recommend if you like creative writing. I got slightly burned out at the end from churning out something everday, but I never stopped enjoying it. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the pre-recorded lectures were great, but the live virtual lectures were a bit dull. Working one on one with the tutors is a fantastic experience though because they really get to know your writing. I loved my tutor, and she helped me make significant improvements in my writing. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of the course is undoubtedly the weekly meetings with a tutor. This was an excellent way to reflect on my writing. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The weekly meetings with the writing tutor were so helpful. As someone with no workshop background, having a set time each week where someone gives feedback on your pieces gave me the opportunity to work on my writing style, without being overshadowed by others in a group setting. Also, the daily assignments keep you accountable; some days are worse than others, but everyday I tried to use the feedback from last week in my new pieces. I also thought the podcast lectures were a good way to split up the lectures online. 
Weaknesses: Some of the weekly lectures had less actionable advice than I would have liked; workshopping a specific piece (maybe with the Word Review tool) would have been nice. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength was that the work was very flexible and could be as personal or impersonal as the writer saw fit; you made the class what you wanted it to be.

A weakness is that we didn't get to spend as much time on the different aspects of writing each week than I think they deserved, but it was a nice introduction into them anyway. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the premise of writing every day, Mark, podcast lectures, final short story assignment (voluntary)

Weaknesses: tutor meetings are kinda useless because they address super micro aspects of your work without granting any advice on how to grow as a writer, live lectures offered little, prompts sometimes felt restrictive, I found the length of the pieces frustrating (would have preferred to work on longer pieces every day than create individual 300-word blurbs), workload <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really struggled with the format of this coursewhich I recognize may be more a me problem than anything to do with the course. Basically, I found the lectures to be super thematic, but with little practical writing advice. My favorite lecture was from a guest lecturer who spoke about metaphor; I found it helpful because in addition to giving examples, which the normal podcast lectures were chock full of, it gave tips and tricks for implementing metaphor into your writing. I think the tutor idea was good in theory, but I felt that 30 minutes was too short for how much we wrote a week. I also often felt like I wasn't sure what I was supposed to say to my tutor after they gave their feedback, since there was a lack of continuity from theme to theme. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I absolutely loved this course. Nothing to improve. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was very engaging because there was a whole community of writers bonding together over daily writing, which enhanced the quality of learning. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Oppenheimer was not as accessible as one would like, granted there being constraints due to a global pandemic. Overall I think there was very little ability to engage in the material and rigorously analyze it. This felt more of Oppenheimer pontificating with only minimal student interjection <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â More writing feedback from tutors: 1 hour per week with tutors as opposed to 30 minutes. Meetings with tutors always felt like a sprint against time. One needed to be selective about which writing pieces to talk about and how much detail to discuss the pieces in, because of the very limited time, which doesn't validate the amount of time students spend writing each individual theme, if some themes are never discussed due to time constraints. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: INVALUABLE weekly one-on-one tutor sessions with experienced professional writers, being assigned daily prompts completely changes the way you approach writing and puts you in a completely different mindset, Mark is a very engaging lecturer and had fun podcasts!

I wouldn't necessarily say there is any weakness but the workload is very high so don't take the course if you do not have the time. This is the equivalent of 2 or 3 classes in one. The podcasts were a little bit rambly at times but I enjoyed them for the most part and they were a nice change in our COVID year. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I loved the podcast format of the class and think that Prof Oppenheimer did everything he could to engage us in such a strange year. I always looked forward to listening to the podcast and think it helped ease any Zoom fatigue that a 2 hour virtual lecture would create. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Obviously it's tough to write a piece a day -- but that's the whole point. I would say sometimes after the podcast, the lecture didn't feel as engaging because the material was covered in the podcast itself and so the lecture was just more chatting with Mark and the tutors. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â If you're interested in trying your hand at creative writing, this is the class to take. Having a personal tutor who will only follow your writing for a semester is so helpful... it's like singing in front of a stranger: less nerve-wracking, fewer stakes. At the same time, my tutor was also extremely helpful as a sounding board / reaction gauge for the stuff I put out.

I didn't like the prompts or X-themes (exemplary themes) chosen by Professor Oppenheimer at times (I thought they were sometimes a little cheesy), but that might just be a difference in writing style between us. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor was great. Learning concepts and mentor component were good. 

As the course went on, it felt like the professor was less prepared.

Some way to indicate interests to align with mentors might help. Didn't feel like my mentor shared writing interests with me (nature writing). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Writing 5 days a week can obviously become tiring some weeks, but overall it really works! Ive definitely become a better writer, and most of all, become better at overcoming writers block. The class gave me an opportunity to try lots of different types of writing and the weekly meetings with the tutor are amazing. When else are you going to have a personal editor giving you detailed feedback on every single thing you write? <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Prof. Oppenheimer is a swell guy, tutor P. Franz is too; themes were well selected; lectures engaging; daily writing is a sound idea and this class is built to foster it
weaknesses: There is a certain aloofness that accompanies this class and some other English department course at Yale. Though Prof. Oppenheimer tries hard to create an engaging environment, his insights and lecture discussions can at times give one the sense that too many Yale-affiliated individuals have never stepped outside elite/academic circles. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was probably my favorite. I think the workload is very fair and the lectures are engaging. Writing a short amount every day is a highly personal, vulnerable, essential experience. Meeting individually with a writing tutor was a highlight of the class. One improvement is I wish the meetings with our writing tutors were longer! 30 minutes once a week is not enough. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The podcast lectures were very engaging and interesting, and the writing tutor meetings were very effective at giving thorough feedback on the ways our writing and our writers voice can be developed. The course also exposed me to various writers and their ways of telling stories. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Oppenheimer! And the tutors! Everyone involved in teaching this course was wonderful and so knowledgeable. It felt like a privilege to be in this class. The structure was also great and the prompts were mostly useful, too. I really appreciated that we had a choice about whether to do a lengthier final project and that the work was spread out evenly, instead of piled up around midterms and finals. In all of the ways that matter, this course was superb. I'm recommending to all of my friends.

Weaknesses: communication about grades. In a class like this, even mentioning the word 'grades' feels dirty. Professor Oppenheimer and the tutors all do a really good job of trying to get us to focus on the point of the class rather than just grubbing for a grade. But as much as I'd like to be free of my GPA, I'm not. Would have really appreciated a bit more clarity about where I stood at the mid-semester mark rather than just 'doing a pretty solid job'. <br/></div>
