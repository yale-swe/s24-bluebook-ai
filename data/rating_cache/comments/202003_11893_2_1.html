<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The main strength of this course, besides Prof. Snyder himself, is the syllabus. From the beginning of the semester, it is sufficiently clear what is expected of the students. The course description sets out with a very specific goal and it meets it. If you do all the readings, you will leave this class with a strong understanding of fascism, communism, and the regimes of Hitler and Stalin. This course could be improved by requiring essays less frequently. Although the essays are not very long, the fact that there is one due every week feels like a bit much at times. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Prof. Snyder is incredibly engaging -- his lectures are interesting, thorough, and answer questions you don't even realize are important until he's addressed them. In addition, section is a useful time for placing the ideas covered in lecture in context and understanding their places in history.  The weaknesses of this course are mainly in the workload -- there is a ton of reading and writing throughout, meaning that I was always thinking about and working for this class. This was rewarded with a relatively low-effort final project, though. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â too much work-- just an actually impossible amount. the lectures were phenomenal though, as were the readings. 12 essays is just a few too many and it got in the way of my ability to do all the reading. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Very interesting course material. Exposed me to a different part of history that I had no knowledge of. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course design with recorded lectures, weekly writing assignments and section is extremely engaging as you cannot take a week off and allows you to work consistently on your writing without putting too much stress on any assignment like a midterm or final. The problem with this setup is that at some points you will feel like you need a week off and it may be hard to keep up engagement over the entire term. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The structure of the course was too much. The weekly assignments were an overload during the pandemic and made it difficult for anyone who was mildly struggling to succeed in the course. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of the course are its content and the TAs and professor. The class is hard work but you definitely leave the semester having learned so much more than you'd expect. Prof. Snyder's lectures are quite clear and straightforward and my TA was quite helpful. A weakness may be perhaps just the breadth of readings every week, especially given that some of the readings are sometimes almost word for word material that is mentioned in the lecture. Perhaps streamlining this to avoid the repetition would improve the class in the long-run. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: extremely engaging course; readings usually felt very relevant &amp; were from thinkers I hadn't read before; revision process was painless
Weaknesses: occasionally essay prompts could feel repetitive; would have been a better class if there had been a built-in rest week midway through the semester where there was no essay due (on top of having the lowest score dropped); section discussion focused more on writing the essays, which was frustrating because it was the only opportunity to have face-to-face interactions on course material (which rarely happened in my section); more standardized section discussions would have made this a much stronger course <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I enjoyed all the reading selections and appreciated the variety of sources we were directed to for our weekly writing assignments. It was refreshing and humbling to engage with audio testimonies, newly published memoirs, and primary sources from WWII. This was also the first history course I've taken where I actively return to read the feedback and think about what edits I want to make. I would have hoped for a little bit more guidance on the prompts and for the lectures to be released earlier than they were (a few were posted 24 hours before the writing assignment for the same week was due). <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I loved the way Prof. Snyder adapted to the pandemic by removing the screens as much as possible. The podcast format and handwritten essay component was much appreciated. I needed a break from Zoom! Prof. Snyder's lectures were incredible, as usual, but I don't need to say that. His success as a historian says it all. It's incredible how often we read his own books. He is a gifted instructor and writer. I would have liked to see a live talk-back session component to supplement the recorded podcasts, that way some sort of face-to-face contact with him would be possible. That's the only weakness I can think of; this course was excellent! <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the general premise of this course, as well as most of the readings, were fascinating. I liked how Prof. Snyder made a point of doing an audio-only lecture; it was refreshing compared to other courses.
I also liked the layout of the course. Even though the workload was larger than average with a 1000 word paper due each week, it was nice that we were able to revise some of those papers at the end of the semester. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: very informative and in-depth, knowledgable (genius?) professor, and excellent readings
Weaknesses: overwhelming amount of work at an extremely fast pace with limited lenience, no live lecture with limited office hours the only possibility to meet the professor <br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I found the weekly essays to decrease in value as the semester went on. In the beginning I felt like they helped me engage with the course, but by the end it seemed like a busy-work assignment. This was particularly the case with the Fortunoff assignments. I found the idea of diving in and just picking a random Holocaust testimony to write about seemed rather disingenuous. I think the source assignments could have done a better job relating to each other, and I think this would improve the course. At points it felt as though each week were it's own course and that there was little continuity -  this was cemented by the fact that the final dossier was 6 one off assignments glued together with seemingly no relation. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Snyder's lectures were the best part of this course. TF's gave timely feedback on papers and the class was overall very well-organized.

Weaknesses: sometimes Professor Snyder can get pretty abstract, and it would feel like he was simply throwing out big, general claims without supporting/justifying them with historical evidence. I would have appreciated more robust empirical evidence for those general claims.
Towards the end of the semester I also felt fatigued with essay writing, to the point where I had written so much that I couldn't really tell if I was convinced by my own arguments or not. 
I can't stress this enough: we should receive a writing credit for this course! <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Snyder is an amazing lecturer and hes seriously intelligent. He will open your eyes to a completely new and exciting way of doing history. Hes not only concerned with fact but with philosophy - not only what happened but what it means for that thing to have happened, and how that impacts us today. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strenghts:  the podcast format works well and sections were very helpful. I enjoyed that sections focused on how to write rather than reviewing that taught in lecture. 

weaknesses: one paper a week was way too much. although I enjoyed writing and surely learned a lot, i could have done more reading if i didn't have to spend hours each week on a paper. a big writing load is certainly good, but maybe once every two weeks is better. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The class was almost perfect in my book, so I am just going to talk about the few weaknesses. At the end of the course, I felt like we strayed from Hitler and Stalin to a more broad sweeping claim about Trump, and I did not enjoy bringing modern politics into the class. The class moved at a very rapid pace; therefore, it would have been nice for a slight break one week in the semester. But, I did love the weekly rhythm of the class, and it kept me very organized. Some of the readings were not needed for some of the essays, so it was easy not to do the reading for some weeks. I feel like that defeats the purpose of the class though. <br/></div>
