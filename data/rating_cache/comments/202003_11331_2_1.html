<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength: MIRA!!!! But also, the sections and TA's were very helpful. The psets were quite long and challenging but were really helpful to think through the concepts covered in class and was also really good practice for exams. I honestly can't think of any weaknesses. This class challenges you to think outside the box so please be sure you know what you are getting yourself into. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths include organized material, although the material is challenging. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Not really any strengths or weaknesses in my opinion. Very average course overall. Not very hard but not easy either. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: interesting final third of the course on insurance and risk, collaboration between students was helpful for problem sets, sections were surprisingly helpful

Weaknesses: unnecessarily challenging psets; two different lecturers made no sense to me; both of them were too smart to teach the class, as they couldn't understand that someone didn't understand something <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths- the course was divided into three modules with two different professors. This worked out SO WELL. It made a lot more sense and it was easier to understand the material. Both Professor Frick and Professor Reiche were INCREDIBLE. The organization of the course was very good as well. We had a quiz after every module as well as psets throughout and one final exam at the end. The professors allowed us to drop one quiz (the lowest one) and a pset (the lowest one), which I think was super fair and made the course less stressful--I hope they keep this aspect for future students.

Weakness- Module II (Professor Reiche) was a bit disorganized and sometimes she went over the time. Module II's quiz was also quite unfair compared to the first and second. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I wasn't a big fan of having two professors, especially if they have pretty different teaching styles. I loved Professor Mira so much and while Professor Soenje isn't a bad professor, I had major learning shock because she just moved at a faster pace that I was not used to before. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: a lot of office hours, recorded sections, review sessions,  partial credit on the written parts of exams 

Weakness: the ALL multiple choice first midterm was brutal. For midterm exam 2, we never learned how to solve the problem. Needed more mathematical examples that were more similar to midterm problem. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â An amazing course. I definitely learned a lot. The professor Mira Frick is amazing. Sometimes though, the lectures went overtime. Maybe in the future, lectures should be made longer so that we don't have to rush through the material. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The problem sets could stand to use more numbers. As much as I love the Greek alphabet, there comes a point at which there are simply too many symbols to make any sense out of. Using more numbers would have been tremendously helpful. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: PSETs were great to digest the info from the class, classes were structured well (powerpoints uploaded before class, topics were very clear), overall class was structured well (3 modules covering various topics), very generous with grading policy (switched from 6 PSETs to 5, lowest PSET dropped, lowest exam dropped)

Weaknesses: would've appreciated more guidance for exams (e.g. using section to give an outline of what we should know) <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought that the lecture slides were well designed and clear. I also think that the problem sets, while long, actually introduced some fascinating conceptual learnings that I wish we could have discussed more in lecture or discussion sections. I wonder whether the discussion sections could have been a little bit more interactive; at least in my experience, they essentially just consisted of watching teaching fellows solve problems, which while educational, could probably have been made more engaging. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Mira is a great professor and she pauses in lectures to make sure that every student knows what's going on. The support provided from profs and TAs are great and grading is pretty lenient too.
Weaknesses: The sections could be run more efficiently since towards the end of the semester no one goes to live sections any more (at least in our section). <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was pretty bad, and I'm an economics major. It's not even that the content is that difficult, although it isn't a cakewalk, but the professors were not at all ideal. The lectures were longer than time allotted for because they couldn't get through the slides fast enough, and they also would get sidetracked in meaningless explanations on topics that aren't within the scope of the class when students would ask obscure questions mid-lecture. The slides were fine, and are the only reason that the class had any semblance of structure. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Very adaptable professors, always willing to provide help (at any hour), and reasonable amount/difficulty of work
Weaknesses: Two professors caused it to be a bit hard to adjust in transition periods. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Mira and Soenje are amazing. They were extremely kind and helpful, and the lectures were very organized and easy to follow. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â the course was divided into three modules taught by 2 different professors. While it was aimed (I think) at providing more clarity and perspective it seemed disorganized and the psets varied widely in difficulty <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was well-organized. There were 3 modules, each dealing with a major general topic in microeconomics. The slides were very easy to follow, and the lecturing was clear. There were many practice problems available to be solved in preparation for the quizzes. It's difficult to think of a weakness, honestly; there wasn't really anything that could be improved. I suppose that sometimes, the problem sets felt very tedious and time-consuming, but they were critical for understanding the concepts, so it was okay. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Both professors were really good at explaining concepts during lectures. It was also nice to have one problem set every two weeks rather than once per week.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course were the professors! Mira Frick and Soenje Reiche explained all the course material thoroughly in class, gave psets that were relevant to the course material and exams, and provided many practice exams and review sessions for the exams.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professors were phenomenal- clear that they both really cared about students. They allowed us to drop 1 of 3 quizzes and did a good job using our feedback to improve the quizzes and make them more like the psets so we could get partial credit on questions instead of all-or-nothing multiple choice. They also shortened the psets a bit throughout the semester. In class, the professors did a good job explaining concepts and taking questions.

TA's: They were kind of hit or miss. Alvaro saved my life multiple times on psets and other TA's didn't do a great job of providing help. That's true for any class though. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked the content of the course, but I think the math was described in a very overcomplicated way.

The biggest strength of this class was the teaching, as both Soenje and Mira are perhaps my new favorite professors at Yale. They were both incredibly good explaining topics and allowing time for questions and uncertainty, very passionate and knowledgeable about this field of study, helpful, and amazingly kind and understanding. They recognized the weirdness of this scenario and constantly adjusted to make it less stressful and more enjoyable for us while simultaneously maintaining a very high learning standard.

Weaknesses: Tough problem sets that I always wished I started earlier on, but maybe that's just par for the course; Whenever the math/derivatives are unnecessarily challenging such that you get so bogged down in the math that you don't actually practice the economics concept and just get lost.

If Mira and Soenje teach this together in the future, definitely save taking this class for the semester they do so! I was EXTREMELY worried about taking this class, and honestly only took it because it was a major requirement, but they made sure students like myself felt comfortable with the material and had chances to improve their grades (letting us drop our lowest quiz and problem set, as well as making the final exam a take-home in teams).

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: a very solid course with manageable and fair psets. The exams were straightforward and the pre-exam exercises give an accurate sense of what to expect. The professors are engaging and obviously try really hard to make the content interesting. All the course materials (slides, exercises, section practice, etc.) were well-organized and easy to find.
No particular weaknesses. <br/></div>

Weaknesses: I wasn't a fan of the two-professor format of the course. I don't have anything against Soenje, but Mira was such a great professor that there's no reason for her not to teach this course alone. <br/></div>

Mira and Soenje are two great professors who were very understanding and willing to give us many chances to really digest the Econ knowledge. The only weakness is that some quizzes were a lot harder than others, and in particular unit 2 was quite difficult, but that was negated by the fact that the lowest quiz score was dropped. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This was largely because of the online format, but I found the first assessment that we had to be extremely hard to take. However, the instructors responded to the feedback from the students and accommodated by not making it all multiple choice and giving us more time, which I really appreciated. Overall, I thought that this course was very well done. The lectures were crisp and well-organized with clear slides, and there were plenty of office hours with the professors along with amazing TAs and peer tutors who were very helpful.

Weaknesses: The problem sets were fairly long. Even though we were given two weeks to complete them, we did not go over concepts that were relevant to about half of each p set until a few days before they were due. I would recommend planning the lectures differently to accommodate. During the second unit, we consistently went well over the allotted class time. Class ran 10+ minutes over for most of this unit. <br/></div>

Weaknesses: I personally don't know how I feel about group finals. It is very easy for someone to contribute absolutely nothing and get carried by the team.

That said, some of those concepts were not well explained. The TF office hour that I went to was not really helpful (they tried hard not to give the answer away, but sometimes that blocked explaining the concept itself). However, the professors were very understanding of the circumstances this semester. I could see that they had tried to improve the course based on mid-semester feedback. Besides some parts in the first few lectures, the slides that they provided were also generally clear and helpful. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths were the very well put-together lecture materials and the excellent course structuring (both with Canvas/Piazza and the communication between student, professor, and TFs. We were given many resources to help with our learning, and utilizing office hours was a necessity, but an enjoyable one. One of the weaknesses of the course comes from how intermediat micro is very math-drive. We learned equations for all of the concepts we went over and were always tasked with analyzin these equations in psets in questions that often times were more rigorous than the examples in the actual lectures. However, the professors were always super fast to reply on Piazza to any questions which would help a lot, and they would also sometimes make Canvas announcements with hints. Still though, especially in the beginning, the psets felt more like a test of our algebra/calculus ability rather than our ability to use and build off-of what we did in class. With practice, though, the math generally became easier (there are only so many ways to maximize an equation lol) <br/></div>
