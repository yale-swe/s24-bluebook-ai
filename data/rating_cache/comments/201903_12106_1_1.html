<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Okihiro's insights and anecdotal aspects of the lectures provided additional context that definitely contributed to my depth of understanding and engagement with the course. His mapping out of the social formation theory and the history of the discipline of Third World Studies were both incredibly interesting. That being said, I wish we could have spent more time hearing from him and his background as a theorists as we ended up doing Q&amp;A in class for what felt like a little too long. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course did a good job introducing the broader concepts, but I wish it had gone more in-depth on any one of them. At times, I felt like we learned so much so as to provide a very broad structure about how to think of the world that when any particulars came up  whether historical or theoretical  they could quite easily deconstruct our surface understandings. The readings were very helpful, although quite dense as well. Lecture was always interesting, but I felt sometimes that lecture time was wasted, either based on student questions or on the professor's tangents (some of which were very interesting, although not relevant to the course making it, again, scattered). <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â could receive more feedback from TFs throughout the semester, the absence of this kept me unaware of how I was performing the entire semester <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course's primary strength was its values. As the name implies, we only read Third World scholars, lots of whom spoke out about oppression, so we had to face a ton of uncomfortable truths about the world's injustices. This course was unafraid to be honest and unafraid to care. We didn't avoid topics for fear of alienating people in the room who benefit from these power dynamics, which prevented this course from censoring itself. The one weakness I'll flag is that in giving most of his lectures extemporaneously and irregularly welcoming student participation during lecture, Prof. Okihiro sometimes made class hard to follow because it was hard to know what his main points were. I totally respect his resistance to pedagogical structure and norms, and I'm not suggesting he come in every day with a perfectly rehearsed slide deck, but when the information feels so urgent and important, I just wish he had a slightly more clear thesis or takeaway for each lecture. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course material, especially the readings, was really fantastic and educational. It changed the way I think about my place in the world and my own identity. I thought that the lectures were hit or miss - some were very well-thought out and clearly communicated, and others less so and confusing. I didn't enjoy having class participation during a lecture, I thought that that was not an effective way to communicate material to a large group of people. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Some of the readings could have made more sense if they were connected to the lectures in lecture. Perhaps even mentioning their connection, but overall the lectures were great. I especially liked when Gary brought in a few speakers to the class for specific topics and always enjoyed how curious Gary was towards us. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course does a pretty good job of covering a lot of content extremely relevant to ER&amp;M as well as other disciplines. While readings are very dense, the assignments themselves do not take up too much time. The final paper is also a great way for students to end the course on their own terms. However, the class is very theory dense and more time could be spent breaking down that theory. The class specifically relies on Marxist theory, knowledge of which is often presumed. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The readings are the strongest part of this course. Lectures were eye-opening sometimes and a bit confusing other times. We had a guest lecture from Professor Chandan Reddy which was extremely well organized. It made me wonder if this class could benefit from inviting a few guest lecturers. Professor Okihiro is an extremely knowledgeable and articulate lecturer but at times he can go off on tangents. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class would be great if it were offered as a seminar. Multiple seminars at once. Discussion was hard in such a big lecture hall. The TAs were wonderful. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was very loose. We were assigned weekly reading responses, and beyond that, there was not a lot to motivate students to engage with the texts (there are a lot). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures were delivered in a confusing/hard to follow and preachy kind of way, and it was always a little unclear what I was supposed to know. As a STEM student, I often felt unwelcome in this course, as if my background was insufficient and I didn't know enough of the jargon or theory. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was very interesting and I loved the lectures! However, often at times very theoretical and abstract with concepts that were hard to grasp and the examples given did not always best illustrate the theoretical concepts. Very lengthy and dense reading material. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The readings we were assigned were great, but there were A LOT of them, to the point where it was difficult to actually do all the readings each week. I wish there had been fewer of them so we could have really discussed each one. Professor Okihiro's lecturing style was not that conducive to taking notes (for me), and his lectures felt pretty disorganized. But the material was really interesting and made me think a lot about what's wrong with the world, internal prejudices, and how to build communities of resistance. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: Gary Okihiro is an incredibly charismatic and foundational scholar in the fields of Third World and ethnic studies. Teaching this class is truly one of his greatest passions. He does a wonderful job of pushing students to relate the theories we read to our everyday lives.
weaknesses: I think that this class should have Intro ER&amp;M or some other related class as recommended prerequisites or at least spend some time teaching students how to understand and interpret theory. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: really enjoyable and thoughtful lectures, TFs are amazing, weekly assignments allowed us to keep up to date with the readings, the final paper serves well in terms of reflecting upon all of the things we learned about in class, content that we learned about touched upon a lot of different elements in our day to day language, from education to language, to eugenics, to tracing the origins of race and ethnicity

Room for improvement: guiding questions for the weekly readings would've been more helpful.. sometimes readings could get extremely dense and difficult to figure out what to get out of the readings. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The readings in this course are brilliant, and essential for anyone who wants to gain awareness of the way social formation is structured to confer privilege and oppression. However, Professor Okihiro's treatment of the course material left much to be desired. As someone who wanted to gain a more nuanced understanding of the complicated societies we belong to, I was deeply disappointed by the minimal amount of thought that Professor Okihiro put into his lectures. Instead of discussing the complexities of the topics covered by the readings, he instead chose to ramble about tangentially related historical figures and movements, providing no more insight than what could be obtained through a ten-minute Google search. On multiple occasions, he ran out of things to say (which is a shame given that Third World Studies is a field that he founded himself) and dismissed the class half an hour early. The actual critical theory itself was grossly oversimplified, to the point where we felt forced to accept his ideas without learning enough about them to discuss or challenge them in a meaningful way. Considering how much of our time we spent discussing the hegemonic nature of society, it's ironic that this was the most intellectually hegemonic class I've taken so far at Yale. 

I should also mention that I found Professor Okihiro's behavior during class incredibly off-putting. Even though he proclaimed that he wanted to treat his students as his equals, his actual behavior was deeply antithetical to these ideals. When students asked him to apologize for quoting a racial slur in class, he spent the better half of his "apology" theorizing about the nature of words. When students mentioned that they felt like they had too much reading, he told them to deal with it instead of working with them to arrive at a solution. When students asked questions in class, he would cut them off and talk over them. Instead of wondering out loud why people weren't asking more questions, maybe he could have taken two seconds to think about how his own actions were preventing any meaningful dialogue from taking place. 

For students who are not forced to take this course for their major, I would recommend looking over the syllabus and downloading the readings during shopping week to read on your own time. Please do not waste your time or your course credits on Professor Okihiro's lectures. <br/></div>

It taught me how to think and learn through a critical lens in a way that also allowed me to rethink my own experience. That said, I think the structure of the class is antithetical to what the class teaches; however, I do not think this is because of how the instructor structures the curriculum but because of Yale's bureaucracy. I also wish that we could have spent more time on the later subjects such as queer and feminist theory. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â While Professor Okihiro is well-intentioned, his lectures typically don't connect directly to the readings, and the readings are only discussed in section. Since sections are only 50 minutes a week, there was never enough time for us to get through the readings, which were often dense. Additionally, the different TAs taught and graded very differently, and so I feel like people had varied understandings of what they were supposed to get out of the class. Essentially, I think the course could be better organized but the material itself is incredibly interesting. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths- kind and passionate instructors at the forefront of their fields. Small sections and relatively small lecture foster an intimate environment. Interesting and broad-ranging readings as well as interesting and inclusive weekly themes. Guidance before the midterm. Lots of statements made at the beginning of the course are slowly elucidated as the course goes on. Weekly reflections and worksheets in section keep you involved and processing what you're learning; begin to make connections between themes in discussions in sections. The Professor does his good work, but the TF's deserve a lot of credit for the success of the course. They all truly believe and live what they are teaching.
Weaknesses- the lecture often feels like a stream of consciousness; it can be hard to figure out what is significant to take notes on and what is not, and the infrequent opportunity for feedback makes for a steep learning curve. The readings can be very dense and difficult to understand, and they're not always clarified, because they're spoken about in the language that made them confusing to begin with. That being said, the professor is always looking for students to ask questions and would happily answer them. Also- the prompt for the final is wildly confusing; we really had to push a lot to understand what our papers should look like. <br/></div>
