<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Professor Hinton is a great professor, and combined the perfect mix of seminar discussion and course instruction. Sometimes the reading load felt a little heavy, or at least not consistent, and we would spend time in class discussing previous weeks' readings, rather than that which had just been assigned. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Strengths - Professor Hinton is a phenomenal professor who is cogent and clear in her lecturing, cleverly facilitates profound class discussion, and is a professor who clearly cares about her students.

Weaknesses - I wish I had more of the class! We covered so much ground I think it easily could have been two or three separate semesters of material. If I could have taken multiple semesters with Prof Hinton, that would have been perfect. Within the one semester, I think students would have been aided by even more roadmapping of the course's direction. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Professor Hinton is the strength of this course -- the depth of her knowledge on these topics, and this period in particular, is immense. It makes discussions that much more interesting, because Professor Hinton always has some new tidbit to add into the conversation around the readings that we wouldn't otherwise had known.

I also really enjoyed how vibrant discussions were in this seminar; they were honestly more vibrant and interesting than most history seminars I've been in. The course felt like an intellectual space that was also a community (even in Zoom world), making time pass by as we grappled with questions around the readings and the implications for the modern-day.

Readings were a bit heavy at times, but they were absolutely worth it! Just make sure you carve out the time to consistently do them. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> no real weaknesses. strengths: great readings, discussion, and the midterm and final assessments offer great unconventional ways to demonstrate progress in the course. Professor Hinton is incredibly knowledgable, understanding, flexible, and engaging! The major strength of the course is the discussion and engagement with the readings each week. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> The subject matter and the readings were both incredible. I think that one of the weaknesses of the course was just that there were too many good things to read. Every reading I came across was enjoyable, informative, and gave us a lot to talk about during the class. There were, however, some weeks where it seemed as if the reading could've been two-weeks worth or so. As a result, people sometimes came to class on different pages and having read different sections of the readings as a whole. But each reading and, as a result, each seminar discussion was incredibly rich and productive. It was a pleasure to learn from these readings and from my classmates. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> This course was awesome! Some big strengths were how much it was grounded in historical context but drew lots of discussion into present day, Prof Hinton's dynamic lectures, and how well-chosen the readings were. The only thing that I wish would be changed is the amount of reading. I think it would be better to focus on Max 3-4 readings a week rather than the 6-7 we sometimes had. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Strengths: Professor Hinton. She is not only incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about this material but also is so supportive and encouraging and actually wants to hear what we have to say. The readings are also wonderful!!!! I learned so much. Will keep my notes forever. Loved the policy recommendation final paper - it was a lot of fun to write. Also the policy caucus allowed us to work in groups on topics we're passionate about and lead a class discussion and that was super fun. Loved the structure of the class also. And everyone who took this class was wonderful - a great group of students who care about inequality and have many smart things to say about it. Starting with Du Bois and Baldwin and Malcolm X was really impactful. Also I can't believe I hadn't read Manning Marable before this course. A must-read. Also this class is very solution-driven. We actually talk about HOW to make change. More classes should do this. 
Other syllabus highlights: There Are No Children Here, Hoop Dreams, From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation, Huey Newton's Dissertation, The Black Power Mixtape. Honestly everything. Also we watched Judas and the Black Messiah which was amazing! Super relevant to what we were discussing. 
Also took this class during the Derek Chauvin trial and to have this space to read and reflect and discuss during a difficult time was so worthwhile and important and really provided some meaning to everything that has been happening. I will miss this course a lot. 

No real weaknesses. Some weeks are quite reading heavy but that's all. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Prof. Hinton is a strength! She brought a wealth of knowledge and energy to our class discussions every week, and it was really exciting to get to learn from her around the time that her new book came out. Prof. Hinton always seemed to be genuinely interested in everything that we had to say during our class discussions, so I appreciated the dedication that she brought to teaching in that regard. Prof. Hinton also offered to look at drafts of our assignments before we turned them in, and I found it helpful to meet with her and get feedback on my writing. I appreciate it when professors offer to do this, so that was a part of the course that I found especially helpful. 

The theoretical readings that we opened the course with were really strong and provided a lot of great things for us to talk about seminar. Regarding the readings in other weeks, I didn't enjoy some of the reported narrative pieces that we read quite as much, such as the Kotlowitz book and the Anson book. Since I didn't have a thorough background in the topics that this books were intended to address on the syllabus, I think that I would have appreciated reading a scholarly history book (or sections from a book) that provided a more thorough historical grounding than the narratives about individual people and families did. I'm not sure if other students might disagree, so perhaps having one of the reported narrative-style books on the syllabus instead of two could be a compromise adjustment. I also think that some of the weeks of this course had too much reading to keep up with. If this course is taught again, I would recommend trying to pare down the reading in a few of the heavier weeks. 

The two major writing assignments that we had in this course were helpful and fun to write (the media analysis and the final paper). It was nice that we were given a lot of flexibility in choosing what to write about, so we could choose to address whatever interested us most. On the other hand, I thought that the reading responses were a bit stressful. Personally, I would have preferred having a second short writing assignment or being asked to write a slightly longer final paper instead of having to do the reading responses several times during the semester. I did appreciate that we didn't need to write them every week, though, and that we had some flexibility because we could choose which of the five weeks we were going to do the responses for. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> There are many strengths of this course. First, the time period of this course was slightly more recent than many history courses at Yale. In addition, the enthusiasm and knowledge of the instructor, Professor Elizabeth Hinton, is a major strength. Hinton's use of a pre-class email discussion chain also helped improve class discussion. She also often led class (rather than relying on student discussion leaders). Finally, the topics were interesting, and her in class mini lectures often provided essential background information. The weaknesses of the course were the too-heavy reading load, and slight disorganization of the topics. Some weeks, the reading was manageable and wonderful, but other weeks (particularly toward the end of the term), the reading was near (or even exceeded) 300 pages/week. This was extremely hard to complete, and sometimes hindered class discussion, as the class struggled to finish all the reading, and we rarely had enough time to discuss everything. It would have been helpful to slightly reduce the number of pages per week. Finally, slightly more attention to the divisions in weekly topics might have helped bring the course together-- some weeks, the discussion seemed focused on a place (detroit, chicago), others, the discussion seemed focused on a time period (the great migration &amp; early 1900s, the reagan years), and still others, we focused on a type of policy (housing, welfare). It might have been helpful to either choose one method of topic division (for instance, making the course chronological, then tracking these different themes through time) or just to be more explicit about the organization of that week or that segment of the course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> I appreciated the forward thinking nature of this course in that we were offered space to visualize change and how actions could be taken to remedy the injustices. I think many courses typically focus on the problem and dissecting the causes of the problem, with little regard to actually addressing it and I am grateful that solutions were a major component of this course. The course was structured chronologically in a way that helped to contextualize the material. There was a lot of reading in the course and discussion could have been improved if there were instructions of which readings in particular to focus on each week. Sometimes we ran out of time for discussion and we revisited readings from two or three weeks prior, which made it slightly more difficult to recollect. I think the course could be improved with greater time management or specificity on what we want to focus on for a particular week. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Strengths: Professor Hinton!! She is an engaging and supportive professor, she is very knowledgeable and an expert on many of these topics with first-hand research experience but is also open to learning and hearing our ideas. This course also provided a strong historical foundation for understanding current events and persistent inequality today. I wish we had more face time with our professor though and more opportunities to get feedback. The email chains/reading responses were really helpful for my understanding. They allowed us to engage with the reading before class each week and share our thoughts beyond talking in class.
Weaknesses: the readings were often very long and hard to know what is most important so maybe a way to highlight what we should pay attention to before we do the readings would be helpful. <br/></div>
