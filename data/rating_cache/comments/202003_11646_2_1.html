<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Overall it is a great course. It has been very well organized and it included clear feedback to learn. The last few lectures were a bit too fast for me. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Bennett is an exceptional lecturer who makes the content easily understandable. She works on a chalk board and rewrites her notes so it is easy to keep up with your note taking. The supplemental typed notes and informational handouts are great study tools and help solidify what you learned in lecture.
Weaknesses: Some of the psets were quite lengthy and difficult, especially the last one which was VERY challenging. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Overall this class was by far the best math based course I have taken yet. It is set up well, lectures were clear and easy to follow, and expectations were always very clear in terms of psets and exams. <br/></div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class was incredibly organized and clear in all of its communication. The professor and teaching staff set the students up for success and were a pleasure to work with. I would recommend perhaps going over the solutions with the TA's before the weekly help sessions (or at least if there are a few that are particularly challenging). <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really liked how Beth adapted the course to the online format. Overall the math stuff is fine and what one would expect of a math class, but the way Beth presented it was amazing and she is a fabulous teacher who I could not recommend more. The format of the course was great and I felt like I could really learn the material and understand the problems. Maybe a better set up as to why we have to take the course would be useful but the course was fine and the teacher was great. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - the lectures, notes and general teaching of the course is very organized and clear by Professor Bennett, which was very helpful given there are many formats of differential equation categorization
Weakness - doing the psets may take some time! <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I learned a lot of great skills from this course. It was incredibly well taught and Professor Bennett was great at sending additional information and answers to student questions to the class. I just would have liked to interact with Professor Bennett while she was teaching and heard other student questions during class. I think my learning took a great hit from not being able to ask questions right as they come up. The lectures were awesome but if I had questions, I couldn't get them answered immediately. There were office hours and such but it's a very different situation when you have small questions in class that are relevant and understood at the time. Those sorts of things are often forgotten by the time office hours roll around or might be hard to explain. But that's almost entirely covid's fault. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â S: Professor Bennett, undoubtedly. She consistently has been the best math professor I have ever had. Lectures, with her accompanying lecture notes, were straightforward and clear. The course is extremely well-organized, and there is every opportunity to be successful.

W: I think the only weaknesses have to do with the exams this year. Some would be super straightforward and others would be crushingly difficult and impossible to do in the time allotted. I think Prof. Bennett would be the first to admit that this was due to the unconventional nature of this year, and thus the exams were always curved fairly. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: lectures are amazingly well-organized, should be the standard for all STEM-oriented classes of: teaching a topic then doing examples with questions that we will actually encounter in the psets and exams. Concepts and problems were done thoroughly and clearly in the lectures. 
Weaknesses: exam difficulty and length were big problems for a large majority of the class, though this is understandable due to COVID. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professor is the greatest strength. Beth Bennett is so meticulous, it made learning in this class really effortless. The class was structured in such a way that it was really easy to buy in and keep up throughout the semester. Expectations were very clear, and feedback was delivered in a timely manner. I actually liked the asynchronous lecture format, but it was necessary for me to couple that with the office hours that were offered because otherwise it would seem like I was taking the course all alone. The lecture recaps were helpful, but perhaps in the future there should be more of a balance between reviewing lecture material and doing interactive problems. The problems, introduced for the latter half of the course, were really helpful, but sometimes in the later lectures (particularly on Fourier series) I got lost in the sauce during lecture and would have liked a more general recap. (Again, the problems were super helpful, so I don't know how to balance that out.) <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course has a LOT of difficult material over the length of the course, so if differential equations don't come naturally to you, you're in for a tough, work-filled semester. However, Beth is incredibly organized and committed to providing all materials for students to succeed, so as long as you take advantage of her resources and actually dedicate time to this course, you can do well. The exams are definitely a struggle, especially now that the course is online and exams are open-note, which means Beth often puts more obscure or complicated problems on the exam so it's not just a matter of copying solutions from your notes. However, this means you really need to study your butt off for each exam, and sometimes you'll just encounter a problem you have no idea how to address. That can be pretty frustrating and discouraging, especially if math doesn't come as naturally to you as your classmates, as these questions on the exam can feel less like they're testing your understanding of the material and more like they're testing your ability to find patterns or draw on concepts you learned (and probably forgot), or possibly never learned, years ago. However, this seems to be a problem that will go away upon the course returning to an in-person format, but if the course will be taught again online, it probably should be addressed. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â We went through a LOT of material, so sometimes it really felt crammed and rushed. That said, since lectures were recorded, they were easy to rewatch. Dr. Bennett is an incredible professornot only did she explain things clearly and thoroughly, she was extremely accommodating, helpful and approachable. This class was such a great experience with her and I could not recommend her more. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Beth Anne Bennett is the best teacher I have ever had. Given the medium, Beth did as good a job as is humanly possible. There is no better way to learn differential equations online. The course was supremely organized, there were ample resources to ensure student success, feedback was always clear and timely, grades were fair, and the path to success was always clear. Differential Equations is not very easy, and I could have done a better job, but given that the course was online, nothing about its contents or how it was taught is responsible for any lack of success. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is extremely well taught. The content is interesting and the instruction is incredible. The weaknesses of the course lie mostly in the virtual format. I have found that virtual, recorded lectures are not compatible with my learning style. Another weakness was in the length of the exams, each exam I found myself rushing to complete each question, leading to a lot of mistakes. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Although each lecture was pre-recorded, Beth made sure that questions could be asked during the Q&amp;A session. She also held exam review sessions before each exam as well. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The recorded lecture set up worked well to allow students to take the course at the time that worked best for them and by allowing students to pace themselves how they liked while the weekly homework prevented students from falling too far behind. That being said, I think a more consistent homework schedule would be beneficial, as would short multiple choice quizzes to help with conceptual understanding more since the homework is entirely computationally focused.  Something like a 10 minute quiz once a week or a short quiz at the end of each chapter with the potential caveat of needing fewer exams in that case since some exams do not cover 2 full chapters. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength is Dr. Bennett. She organizes this class very well and is one of the classes where I've learned the most from. We do not focus too much on the theory behind certain methods but rather work on learning how to apply it. This is especially beneficial for people who may have struggled on the proof portion of math (like largely what we had to do in Calc 1-3). A weakness of this course is the pace. The content is crammed into a semester and there are holes in our learning. For example, since the exams were noncumulative, many of us focused too much on just applying the most recent methods we learned in the content leading up to the 3rd exam that we forgot to consider that what we learned from the past lectures still played a role in our answers. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought this was a really great course. Lectures were always very clear and easy to understand. I felt the psets were sometimes more complicated than the examples done in lectures and very tedious with the math, but overall they were very helpful for practicing methods learned. I think the exams could be improved. They were always much harder than the psets. I felt they didn't do a good job of testing whether or not you knew how to do something  I would know the methods and had no problem doing problems from the book, but the exam would always throw a twist in there and I never ended up doing well. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths of this course include the organization of the material and the classes. The lecture notes alongside the recorded lectures were very helpful along with the review slides for tests. Solutions to the psets were posted so that we could review what we missed even though the psets had comments on them.  One weakness of this course were the tests. The way they were formatted over zoom I understand prevents cheating and looking things up but it was very stressful and I felt that I ran out of time on some rather than not understanding the material. I think it can be improved by adding an extra 2-5 minutes to the test time so that we can wrap up the last questions and maybe review our answers before submitting. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Everything was perfect except for exams. The professor admitted when exams were too hard or too easy and made the appropriate responses. I found this recovery from this weakness to fill the hole (even though a perfect set of four exams without adjustments would technically be the ideal case). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class was really good with lectures. they were in depth, and made alot of sense, as well as the extra handouts/lecture notes posted to canvas. The psets we're challenging, but useful and helped when studying for the exam. <br/></div>
