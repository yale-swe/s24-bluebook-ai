<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Strengths: Two instructors. Noah and Professor Timmermans are both extremely interesting, and because they come from very different sides of the climate science spectrum, their insights were extremely complementary while also being quite different. The partnered weekly writing assignments were also really great because if you were unsure about a specific topic or paper you could discuss it with someone or they could take the lead on that part of the assignment while you focused on other parts, and it was really great to work together on something. Also, we had to come up with questions based off the readings for a weekly discussion and it was extremely engaging and often helped clarify the reading and climate ideas very organically, as well as providing ideas for paper topics. Overall, though, the grounding in climate science was extremely good.
Weaknesses: Sometimes it felt like you had to have more of a background in climate science and Earth dynamics than everyone actually had, and it could be really confusing when there wasn't clarification. I also felt like some of the material was rushed. Also, trying to have discussions over Zoom was kind of weird and sometimes challenging and awkward, but if the class was held in person I'm sure that problem would go away. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Strengths: good structure of the class, great professors, interesting content
Weaknesses: topics were sometimes difficult to understand, even though this is supposed to be an intro class

This class has a good formateverything is centered around the readings for that week. During one class, a professor lectures on the topic the reading covers, and during the next class, you all discuss the reading. I enjoyed this format because it allowed us to learn from the professors and from each other! However, some topics were not as engaging compared to others, so the discussion/lecture wasn't as exciting. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> The main strength of the course is the introduction of students to the main aspects of climate change, without going too deep into any of them. The class provides a strong general understanding of climatology as a whole. Texts were diverse, new, and often challenged conventional ideas on the subject. I also enjoyed a balanced mix of lecture- and discussion-based formats, as well as the speakers professors invited to our class. The course is also heavily science-based, which was a plus for me. The idea of assigning partners for small weekly assignments was not very productive because we ended up just dividing work in two with little interaction with each other. At the same time, it did not impede any progress with the assignment. I feel cooperation on bigger assignments might be more fruitful. Overall, the course was very thought-out, and there is little room for improvement. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Strengths: One of the strengths of this course was the group weekly assignments and the seminar's small size. I really enjoyed getting to know my classmates through these assignments and collaborating during the virtual semester. Mary-Louise and Noah are the other great strengths of this class. They are really passionate, wonderful instructors who value student learning and student perspectives and are so open to answering questions and being mentors in the sciences. The weekly assignments and reading helped me internalize a lot of the differing concepts we learned. Additionally, the opportunity to regularly speak with and hear from scientists who are at the cutting edge in their respective fields was amazing.

Weaknesses: Very few! I just wish that the syllabus was a little bit more detailed about the topics we would cover in advance, and since there was lots of consistent writing, I do think a writing credit may have been warranted for the course as well. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Strengths: ample discussion, good presentation from the co-instructors, assignments were the right balance of learning, work, and rigor
Weaknesses: no major weaknesses, though some concepts presented in the lecture part of class could have received better explanation and more attention <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> The strengths of this class are providing insight into how climate change is impacting our world, and the TF. Sophie Westacott absolutely made this class and it would have been almost unbearable without her. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Strengths: the seminar consisted of a self-selected group of students who really wanted to learn about climate change. There was a good mix of students from various majors. The readings were also mostly helpful and relevant to our weekly topics. The TA (Sophie) was also really nice.
Weaknesses: I would've really preferred it if this course were a lecure instead of a seminar. Being an intro class, and since discussion questions weren't provided in advance, I was often completely unsure of how to approach the discussion questions, which often had little to do with the factual information presented in the readings. Whereas students who had taken a few EPS courses (there were even upperclassmen within the major) felt more confident, I felt discouraged from participating in discussions. I'd also rather walk away from a lecture feeling I have a systematic understanding of how the climate works than participate in a seminar that gives me bits and pieces of information. The weekly writing assignments plus the two 10-page 1.5-line-spacing papers were also excessive: the course requires more writing than many writing-credit courses. I wished the course actually provided space for improving scientific writing (e.g. submit incremental drafts for one long paper instead of two) instead of purely emphasizing quantity. I also hope the slides can be uploaded to Canvas after each class and the discussion questions can be provided to students ahead of time. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> The class was excellent! Mini-lectures were electrifying; Noah and Mary-louise are great at explaining key, complex ideas and getting folks from different backgrounds excited. Each week explores a different topic; the material was challenging but engaging. Lectures/assignments were fun and really helped synthesize the material and scientific uncertainties; I left the class with an ability to explain climate science to a broad audience and define its shortcomings and promise. Also, lots of the science we learned was astonishingfrom the complex feedback loops to how temperature impacts the impact of CO2 itself. I loved the ability to explore different ideas in our term papers too. 

Weaknesses- very little, honestly!! professors were great; their sunny, fun dispositions made this class a joy despite COVID. We went on tangents, but I truly felt these were fruitful and followed the interests of the students. There were maybe 1-2 students that slacked off in the weekly projects/ I had to pull extra weight, but it was fine because we rotatated away. You never work with the same person 2x. <br/></div>

</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> I really enjoyed having ML and Noah teach together, as they both come from different areas of research within EPS and provided different perspectives on things. Also, I enjoyed the one-topic-a-week structure as it allowed us to learn a lot over the course of the semester, even if some lectures had to be rushed to fit everything in. Also, we had a guest speaker nearly every week which was very valuable.

As for improvements, I think that some of the more in-depth science portions of the lectures felt unnecessary and just confusing. I don't really think that going over a specific series of chemical reactions really helped my understanding of ocean acidification, for example, and felt like it would better be left for a more specific course rather than an overview of climate change. <br/></div>
