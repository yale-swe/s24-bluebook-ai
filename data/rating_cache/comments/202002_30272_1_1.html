<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â it moves very fast which is a weakness for those who cant keep up but if you put in effort it's not bad, especially if you're only taking this class by itself. the strengths are the professor and TAs because they do their best to make sure everyone is accommodated and helped when needed. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Lots of help opportunities, good resources to prepare for tests, helpful homework, clear expectations

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â i think section could be more helpful if it wasn't just the ta doing suggested problems. i thought the course was pretty good for over zoom and all of those added difficulties <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Ghiassi-Nejad is an absolute gem of a human being. His lectures are engaging and interesting. His teaching style is clear and easy to follow. He also cares SO MUCH about his students!!!! He is the reason I had such a positive experience with this course!!!

Weaknesses: the administration of the test on examity caused a lot of stress for the students and it wasnt clear whether we could use certain types of calculators or formula sheets. Also, sections were not structured rigorously and could use more of a framework. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Homework was always useful and helpful to learn from and was not excessive busywork. Professor was very caring, accommodating and willing to make time and answer questions. TAs were helpful and available. Weaknesses: topics are not covered very in-depth, but that is probably to be expected for an introductory summer course. I'm not sure whether I would have learned more in a semester-long class because the depth was not always there, though it was obviously sped up due to it being a 5-week summer course. Not many weaknesses, I enjoyed the class! <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: teaching aligns well with textbook, although lectures can be a bit more organized and focus more on the conceptual thoughts of physics rather than derivation of equations/formulas. Office hours and TAs are very helpful. 

Weaknesses: exam problems can be more similar to the problems assigned (since I felt we werent taught so heavily with conceptual ideas and then the exam had conceptual problems that I wasnt used to seeing). Quizzes, although 5%, were so stressful under the 5-min time limit. I wouldve appreciated if the limit was extended to even 1 or 2 min more. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course is structured well: lecture is based off the main key points of the chapter reading, and the problem sets are from the textbook and begin from easy and increase in difficulty very fast. There are quizzes every discussion section that are graded, and timed, however, I would prefer if we could just work on the same problems in section with the TA because some questions are tricky or aren't really intuitive the first time learning it. The time crunch also is stressful. There are three written exams and an oral exam in this summer course. I don't think there is enough time allotted for the written exams as there are bonus problems at the end of the exams and I never even have time to touch those problems. <br/></div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course are the resources. We got ample practice tests/problems to help us prepare, we have office hours twice a week, and we had a great professor. A weakness of this course were the technical difficulties; however, they were addressed promptly. What can be improved upon is the spacing of the office hours. We didn't get office hours on Tuesdays/Thursdays/Saturdays and I wish we had access to them at least once a day. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths:
Help is easily available
Tests were reasonable, and adjusted when deemed too hard for the class

Weaknesses:
Online format is not for everyone
The assignments and homework were not in sync with the pace of the class, made it hard to keep up <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The quizzes did not align very well with much of the material we were learning in lecture, which was quite frustrating. The questions on the quizzes also were usually poorly worded, so the right answer wasn't always super clear, which felt unfair. Lastly, the quizzes were too short in time allotted. We were asked if there was enough time for the first quiz, which was relatively easy since there was so little material covered at that point, so the time limit seemed fine. But as the weeks progressed, the quizzes became much harder and there was simply not enough time to think through the poorly worded, oddball questions. I also felt like lecture could be too long sometimes and could skew to be slightly off topic. Maybe having a break in lecture or doing shorter lectures would be more effective. It could be hard to stay focused, especially on zoom for that long a period of time. The exams also often had specific vocabulary that was not in the book, nor mentioned in lecture or discussion. I presume many of these obscure terms are synonyms or equivalents of more familiar terms that we did learn, but it felt frustrating to have these unfamiliar terms pop up on exams, when the setting was already stressful enough. Another critique would be of discussion sections. I recognize that it is very hard to have collaboration and natural conversation over zoom, but I wish there was more of an effort to have students work together to solve problems because I feel like we can learn a lot from each other and see different ways to look at the same things that might be helpful. My final weakness would be how office hours were held. If online again, I think investing in a way to have both students and TAs show work via some sort of virtual whiteboard feature would be really helpful since it was difficult to explain as a student what you were visualizing without being able to draw and present anything. 

Strengths of this course would be the many, many office hours that were offered. It was super easy to get help at most times and all the TAs were super available and willing to help. This was excellent. The professor also seemed generally excited about the material and interested in it, which was good. The homework component was good and the additional problems were helpful as a guide - I only wish solutions and explanations were made available for the additional problems. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class was super well taught and extremely flexible with the grading, allowing me to truly spend time learning and understanding the material without worrying about my GPA.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It is very rapid, so it can be hard to keep up. The homework problem sets were well-designed, but the teaching could be confusing and hard to follow. It could be improved by eliminating sections and adding extra office hours for the TF's as well. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There are very flexible office hours, and teaching fellows were extremely helpful. The class itself, however, was not particularly well taught. Professor Mehdi is kind, responsive, and cares about students, and this could be a product of the course being moved online, but his lectures are hard to follow, and I did not gain a conceptual understanding of the topics from class. There were frequently mistakes in answer keys for quizzes and practice tests (which made me second guess my understanding) and the lectures did not spend enough time unpacking the actual physical meaning of certain concepts.  We mostly worked through practice problems and spent time deriving, which while helpful, limited my understanding of the topics as they exist in the real world. I think the course could be improved by spending more time discussing how to develop an intuition about outcomes before we plug in numbers to equations. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength is the amount of practice problems given as homework and practice tests before exams.

A weakness is the speed. A topic would be introduced, one very basic sample problem would be given, and then we would move on. Often the homework was much more complex so in order to finish the assignments the class required a lot of self teaching. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was a typical STEM class, and it was taught fine, especially given the online circumstances. Sometimes the sections are unnecessarily long, though. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think that the only weakness I would cite is having discussion sessions 15 minutes after class on Tuesdays and Thursdays it was difficult to remain engaged after doing Physics for such an extended period (9:30-10:45 and then 11-12). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor is really kind and cares about students. Lectures are very fast paced but expected considering this is a summer course. I think if the professor could explain the examples a little more thoroughly: it is more worthwhile to go though one example clearly than four examples but rushed.
I wish the quizzes matched the content of the lecture the day before: sometimes they were on content just taught and sometimes they were a week behind. I also think since the quizzes mattered little for the overall grade, it would have been less stressful to have a second try at the end of section (so we learn more in the end). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Mehdi was very accommodating and genuinely cared that we understood the course material. The only weakness I can think of is that because it was online, it was generally harder to be engaged. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was very well done. The visual aspect tailors to visual learners and helps to clarify areas of potential confusion. The homework assignments are very helpful in providing practice and insight. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Mehdi, the professor. Absolutely the best part of the course, not only bc of his candor and geniality, but also bc of his domain knowledge of physics. Take this class with him! He will help you whenever you need it. <br/></div>
