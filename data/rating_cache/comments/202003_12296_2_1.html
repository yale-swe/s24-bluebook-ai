<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It's very well-organized and designed to facilitate learning. There were plenty of office hours and study halls throughout the week, offering students many opportunities to ask for help on homework, get clarification on the lecture material, or just to get to know the professor. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths were very thorough lectures and homeworks paired with very helpful office hours and peer tutoring hours. Weaknesses were that some of the concepts were explained in a bit more of a convoluted way than seemed necessary making some lectures difficult to follow. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The biggest weakness of this course is the structure: completely asynchronous lectures with NO discussion sections, only participation questions randomly thrown into lecture videos. I would find out where the participation questions were in the day's lecture and only watch up until the question. I would not watch lectures after answering the question, because what was the point? I absolutely loved physics in high school but it was very difficult to be invested in this course, when there is little to no motivation to watch lectures and very little interaction with the instructor (which is what made my high school physics experience so valuable). 
Maybe the only strength of this course was the flexibility in grading. We would only have to submit 5-6 questions on the PSET, of which half would be graded. This was a much better workload compared to classes like MATH 120, which required you to submit all questions on the PSET and all would be graded. Another grading policy I liked was test corrections; corrections made it very easy to improve your grade in the class. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class is fairly difficult for people who have not taken physics/have limited knowledge of physics and the workload is very heavy. But, the Professor Steinacker is very willing to meet with students and the peer tutors are very helpful. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Because all of the lectures were pre-recorded, I found them to be very dense. There was no time to catch up on writing like in a normal lecture so it took me double the amount of time to watch the lectures. I wish they had an synchronous portion to opt into so that I could go to that and I think it would make the lectures easier to watch. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is very strong and made great by the passion seen in the professors lectures. It is only slightly weak in the sense of it goes by very quickly  and can be overwhelming at times. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was taught very well and I don't have any weaknesses to point out. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I find physics very interesting and applicable, as it is around us at all times but many people do not think about it much. Professor Steinacker has a true love for the subject and tries her best to make lectures engaging, however, it is difficult on zoom. The recorded lectures were helpful so I could pause and follow the information when it became challenging. A weakness, though, is that during these lectures, Professor Steinacker does countless proofs and integrations, which I understand there is a need for, but at times it felt like a lot and repetitive. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â To be honest, basically every aspect of this course was a strength. The office hours structure was great, the recorded lectures were clear, and the grading was totally fair. The only thing that I thought could be better was the late work policy, but that is ultimately up to the professor's discretion. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â this course is very difficult to take online. It is easy to fall behind or feel like it is being done alone, which makes a difficult class even more challenging. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: concepts are explained well
Weaknesses: the title of the class is "Intro to Physics", but it seems like it's much too challenging of a course to be considered in introductory course <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The main boon of this course in past years has been Professor Steinecker and her personality; she made up for the difficulty and grind of the class. However, this semester, we did not get to experience any of that unless we went out of our way to interact with her in office hours. This would not be a problem for a class with less of a workload, but due to the extremely high workload of the class, most of the time that could have been spent in office hours with her was instead working on the next PSET. This is not an individual trend; many, many people experienced this problem. We simply could not afford to go to her office hours when we had to work on the class's PSET, which to many was just as difficult as it is in a normal year.

Which raises another difficulty; despite the change in learning method, we were still expected to perform just as highly as they have in past years. In fact, despite the overwhelming amount of fatigue and burnout experienced by the students in the middle-to-late area of the semester that most faculty were aware of due to the lack of fall break, Professor Steinecker never even began to show signs of slowing down. Coursework continued at its normal difficult pace, and we were forced to adjust or risk our grades.

One strength of the class this semester I can give is that Professor Steinecker did begin to lengthen the window in which we could take our exams, and for many, this was a saving grace. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was taught very well-- although the lectures were super fast (for someone who didn't take AP physics), going to office hours (which were held daily!) really helped me understand concepts. The addition of "study groups" during online learning also really helped me study with my peers. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course allowed for a lot of flexibility. Having the lectures to watch on our time allowed us more freedom in designing our schedules. Our teacher also ensured that we all had study groups at the beginning of the semester. This proved to be very helpful throughout the semester, particularly on Psets. 

The teacher did well in removing stress from the course. I appreciate the opportunity to make up points on exams if we dont get everything right the first time. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Prof Steinacker was very good at explaining exactly where each formula came from and how to use them. However, at times the PSETs would be graded without very clear explanations as to what exactly was incorrect. <br/></div>

There were a ton of office hours pretty much every day to get high quality help, and I maybe shouldve gone to them, but I just cant stand being on zoom. I really cant wait for in person class because that is where I live. I was somewhat annoyed by the tests (and I guess homework) being open note but you had to follow exactly what the professor did, and sometimes what the professor wrote on the notes was wrong and itd make me go insane and be confused. I also was always really worried about the whole cant use formulas that arent on the formula sheet thing because I always just sort of wrote out the stuff to solve a problem and it made it harder because Id have to look at the  formula sheet and make sure I copied it exactly. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The greatest strength of this class was Professor Steinacker and her passion for teaching! The organization and expectations for the class were made very clear from the start, and while problem sets are challenging, Professor Steinacker will never leave you hanging or confused as long as you seek her help during office hours. She really tries to reach out and get to know as many students as possible, despite the class being so large, and she also posts special review lectures before each exam as well as extensive notes for each class. Professor Steinacker also uses a lot of demonstrations, which I enjoyed since they helped me understand the concepts through a more visual perspective. One of the weaknesses for this class is that grading by the TAs is sometimes unclear or subjective, and they would take off points if you didn't have things that weren't explicitly asked for. This isn't a big deal for the homework or participation since Prof. Steinacker had a policy where a 90% would be 100% for problem sets and the same for 80% on participation, but it was a problem for exams. <br/></div>

Otherwise, I found this course very hard to follow. I was brand new to physics; I hadn't taken it since my freshman year of high school. Although this course says no prior physics knowledge is required and it does cover the basics, I found myself at a large disadvantage compared to my classmates who had more physics knowledge. Additionally, we were told we didn't have to know Calc 3, but Calc 3 topics were used in multiple lectures. I also had no idea who my TF was, it was never discussed in the beginning of the course. <br/></div>

I personally found the exam questions a little finicky, with a lot of factors to consider, but this wasn't an issue this year because we were given extra time for most of the exams (I think 24 hours for the final). In person with normal time, I might have felt stressed over the time pressure, but I also like to take my time. <br/></div>

Professor Steinacker has been teaching the 180/181 intro sequence for quite some time, and she really has it down pat. Her passion for teaching and physics is readily apparent, and she adapted the course very well for the online format. Lots of support at office hours was also super great during these covid times.

Weaknesses: Not much I can think of. Some psets were kinda long, but they were definitely comprehensive and reinforced physics principles from lectures. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The number one strength was the huge number of TAs and such frequent office hours because it was usually easy for me to get help (with the exception of weekends, when there were no office hours). I think the psets were also extremely helpful in checking my understanding/mastery of the concepts we learned, and I liked that Professor Steinacker was very organized and sent out messages regarding topics covered in the week's lectures and providing very helpful review guides for exams.

I often wished an equation sheet like the ones given for exams were available to the class earlier so I could use it on psets. I made my own but I was constantly worried I was missing an equation or something. Given the online format, I think it was also a weakness that I rarely actually got to talk to my professor, especially since I've heard from upperclassmen that Professor Steinacker's personality is one of the best parts of the course. Though I still got to know her a bit through the lectures, it certainly doesn't compare to what one gets from regular live and spontaneous interactions. However, I will also say that I heard Professor Steinacker reached out to some students via email when she thought they could use some extra support after the first midterm and though I was not one of these students, I think its great that she reached out because if I were in that situation I would really appreciate and email like that which shows my professor cares about my success in her course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course did a very good job in introducing students to the fundamentals of physics. Professor Steinacker is clearly passionate about the topics she teaches and about  helping students maximize what they get out of the course. Overall, the course is pretty demanding and requires significant time investment. Among some of the things that I thought would require some change was definitely the deadline for homework submission. Having the deadline be on Saturday evenings every week was something that I dreaded. I think it would be much more preferred for the deadline to be on a weekday rather than on Saturday, as in that case I personally found myself working on the problem set many times all through Friday evening and Saturday morning/afternoon, many times missing out on extremely valuable rest time from the weekend. I really liked how mathematical concepts that were required for the course were explained by Professor Steinacker rather than being taken for granted. Having a dropped problem set would definitely be appreciated. Some notes on the last two problem sets: it would be much better for the second to last problem set not to have a due date the Sunday after we had to move out of Yale College housing, as that week was hectic (the due date was eventually changed); the last problem set was excessively long compared to previous ones, and it was due the weekend of reading period. It would have been appreciated if that was not the case for the last problem set of the semester. <br/></div>
