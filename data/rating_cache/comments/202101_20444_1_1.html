<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths- Interesting material largely new to all students
Weaknesses- **The TA team** completely unresponsive/borderline disrespectful
Section participation as a grade turns into a competitive learning environment
Grading is harsh..not appropriate for an introductory course
Overall, I actually wouldn't mind the challenge of harsh grading if TA's were willing to advise/help with material
But they are unwilling to read drafts, discuss any real points of the material, or really meet at ALL even on zoom. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the double edged sword of this class is the harsh grading. It can be a huge motivator when you do poorly, and then very gratifying when you do better, however, it can also make people shut down or give up. We all have our different thresholds for challenges that can cause us to try harder or stop altogether and I feel lucky that for me I worked harder, although I could have just as easily quit. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is fantastically taught. It's fantastically TA-ed, and all the topics are interesting. However, I don't agree with Prof. Kagan's grading policy. I've spent more time stressing about getting a good grade in this class than I have about actually understanding the material. When your comments are being graded in section, it's hard to feel like the conversation is going anywhere because everyone's just butting in to try and get more comments in to boost their grade. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: compelling course material, compelling teacher, responsive TFs
weaknesses: can't think of any <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I loved the course content but discussion section always felt like a rat race of jumping into the discussion to quickly make a somewhat coherent point or two. Overall it wasn't really a good learning environment because it didn't really promote "discussion" when everyone is just trying to get a word in, and it definitely didn't reward active listening -- sometimes it even just felt outright hostile! I also didn't really like how discussions were always structured as debates between two ethical frameworks because while I understand the argumentative value of picking a side and sticking with it, I also think there should be room for meaningful contribution to discussion that isn't along the lines of "utilitarianism sucks and here's why, Kantianism rules and here's why". <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This is a very engaging class. The lectures are presented impressively and they really do force you to think and evaluate your assumptions. The main weakness is that the class can at times seem daunting, however, it is rather fulfilling when that emotion is overcome. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of the course is in Shelly's lectures and the enthusiasm with which he teaches. I liked the way we covered utilitarianism, free will, and contractarianism. A weakness would probably be the grading. It's harder to genuinely learn in discussion sections when your comments have to be good enough to merit a good grade. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Shelly is one of the best lecturers you will ever have. He is engaging, enthusiastic, and witty, and he always encourages students to stay on after class to discuss philosophy with him (an opportunity you should not miss). He also did well to mask his own personal views on the topics, which is important in as controversial a field as ethics. Also, this class only requires three papers (albeit adding up to many hours of thought and writing). Weaknesses: although this might be a strength to an odd few (case in point: Shelly), Shelly's grading is gruelling. "C is for satisfactory work" was the first disclaimer of the semester. That being said, As and A-s aren't too hard to come by if enough thought is put into each paper; anyway, using up a Cr/D/F on this class is definitely worth it. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think there should be a better way to actually make sure students do all the readings. I definitely wish Id had more oversight in that department. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is really good and the professor is strong. The grading is not as hard as some people have made it out to be, but it is pretty difficult. Getting a straight A is extremely hard, but getting a B+ or A- is honestly not difficult at all.  The class is good for an introduction to philosophy and I would recommend taking it C/D/Fail honestly, so you do not have to constantly worry about the grade. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course overall was very strong. While I found the first couple of weeks of lectures to be a little slow, once the class got into the swing of things, it was interesting and engaging. Shelly is an excellent lecturer. In general, probably the worst part of the class were the questions from students, but that doesn't really seem like something it would be good to cut down on. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Credit/D/Kagan is real. He is harsh when it comes to grading so I recommend being ready to not succeed immediately. I have to say though, he does it in your best interest and you become a way better writer throughout the course. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â lectures are interesting, weakness: variability between expectations of different TAs <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths are definitely the teaching; the readings could be improved <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Overall a very interesting class. In terms of weaknesses the readings were sometimes irrelevant to the lectures. Also, our participation grade is based off of how much we talk in each section which often led to really unsubstantial discussions being carried by students for the sake of points. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Shelly is a very engaging and passionate lecturer. He is clear and encourages student participation. HIs lectures were one of the highlights of this course.
Weaknesses: I wish there was more guidance with writing the papers. I felt like the TFs were looking for a particular way of approaching the prompts, so I would have appreciated more instruction on how to write a philosophy paper (in addition to the handout that Shelly provides). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Shelly was an absolutely brilliant lecturer. His teaching style was clear, direct, and he genuinely wanted to help us understand moral philosophy. Shelly would hang around after class for as long as people wanted to answer questions, and his office hours were always a lively scene of discussion. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One strength of the course is that Professor Kagan and the TFs are willing to help you understand and extend the material of the course through office hours and other meetings. Additionally, while the discussion sections were always quite stressful, especially given my section had 18 people who needed to speak within our 50 minute section time, they offered some of the most rewarding philosophical discussions I have had in my life. If possible, it would have been better if either (1) the sections are capped at fewer than 18 people or (2) larger sections are given more than 50 minutes for discussion time. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â By far the greatest strength of this course is the Professor, Shelly Kagan. Probably the best instructor I've ever had. He made a subject that I am not particularly interested in an absolute joy to learn about. I also thought the discussion sections were a definite strength of the course. They were fun and reenforced/cleared up lecture material. The only weakness of this course was that I thought students asked too many questions during lecture which distracted from what Shelly was teaching. Sure, sometimes the questions were helpful. However, many times I felt as though students just raised their hands to hear themselves talk. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Lectures are fun, essays are thought-provoking, and philosophy discussion sections are the best.

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Shelly is an extremely clear, interesting, and entertaining lecturer, making concepts almost deceptively simple. Lectures often delve into very specific areas, such as the different camps within camps of a philosophical tradition. Essays are expected to be precise and nuanced, as well, which makes them harder than you'd expect -- but a good challenge to have. Sections, and occasionally lectures, were too fast for my poor brain to keep up. <br/></div>

As for the weaknesses, just credit d this class, grading is so stressful. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the material itself was very interesting and Kagan's live lectures were very engaging.
Weaknesses: DISCUSSION SECTIONS. It was the main source of anxiety for me this semester. Because they counted for as much as 25% of the grade, people were literally forced to participate even when they had nothing to contribute, so the discussions often turned out pretty shallow and driven by a couple of (naturally more talkative and extraverted) people. The grading rubric for those was also very unclear. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths:
- Shelly Kagan is a phenomenal teacher! His lectures are engaging, and he presents material in a very enthusiastic and novel manner.
- Sections are a great time. Youre bound to meet some very interesting people with very interesting takes, but its very enjoyable. Also, the TAs are amazing, especially Austen Hall!
- The readings can be difficult to get through, but most of class is about the actual ideas rather than the nitty gritty detail. Its more about doing philosophy rather than analyzing the work of a bunch of dead guys.

Weaknesses:
-Grading is pretty rough for papers. This is also a strength, because it will teach you to be a better writer, but this can be a rough spot for your GPA.
-Likewise, participation points are hard to get. This can make sections sometime feel more like a bunch of people talking over each other rather than a genuine philosophical discussion. <br/></div>

Weaknesses: Two 50-minute lectures a week are simply not enough, especially since a significant portion of most lectures was devoted to answering students' unhelpful questions (go to office hours!). This makes the class a very basic introduction to the most fundamental terms and thoughts in the field, but nothing more. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths are that the lectures are very engaging and the material is very approachable in the way that it's taught. The weaknesses are that the class is structured so that students don't do well on the first essay, but it's very difficult to predict how the final grade will be calculated and assess how well you are doing in the class. I emailed multiple times to ask how I was doing to which I got no answer from my TF. In addition, a lot of students were being given the same vague feedback when it came to discussion sections (which are also very hard in terms of grading). It made for a really frustrating and stressful experience, and as a result I credit/D/F the class. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: topics are really interesting and the professor is very engaging. The material is relevant to the real world and lectures were fun especially when you were imaging yourself in various thought experiments. Reading is very manageable. 

weaknesses: The biggest weakness is the weight of section participation and that you were graded on the quality of what you said in section not just your participation. I think this discourages natural discussion and often meant people were just trying to make any good point and participate for the sake of their grade and not to learn. This also seemed to discourage me from asking the questions i had about understanding course material because I needed to make "higher quality" contributions instead. The readings also weren't very connected to what was discussed in lecture. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course teaches interesting material, but suffers from two major flaws. 1) we do not engage with the reading enough. I understand that many courses assign reading which is not discussed in lecture, but these readings were not talked about in section either. It makes everything feel incredibly disjointed, and a couple of times, I thought we were either missing something major from the reading, or I must have had no idea what was going on. 2) the discussion sections for this class are the worst I've had at Yale- by far. First, sections are graded too harshly. We did not raise hands, just jumped in to speak. This led to only the most aggressive people ever speaking, and some people never had the chance to speak during class. I asked my TF what to do about this, and he essentially told me to be more assertive by TALKING OVER PEOPLE during section (yes, this ETHICS class incentivized talking over other students). I could never get invested in the conversation or engage with the material when I was just trying to find gaps to get a word in. I have no idea why Professor Kagan structures section like this. It was literally terrible and made me despise Monday nights. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I love Shelly Kagan. He is an insightful, funny, and clear instructor. My only criticism is that sometimes it feels that he finishes his main point of the lecture in about 40 minutes, and then no one has any questions, so he either makes up questions to consider that have really obvious answers, or he just sort of repeats himself, sometimes a couple times. Overall, best lecturer I have had at Yale. <br/></div>
