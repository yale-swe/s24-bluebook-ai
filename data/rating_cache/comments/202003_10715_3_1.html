<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I appreciated that Professor Negahban set realistic expectations for his students in light of the pandemic. The course material by nature is already very technical and accordingly difficult to comprehend. The assignments were created with the understanding that there were no in-person office hours to write out problems or go through code. Professor Negahban was always willing to listen to students' comments. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Piazza was our main forum to ask questions, but sometimes questions about the logistics of the course went unanswered. It would be nice to have more communication about logistics. But otherwise I think everything went well. I always had my answers about the course material answered. And having lectures recorded were tremendously helpful. Also, I really appreciated how Sahand gave us much more time than we needed on the quizzes and midterm, so we didn't have to worry about rushing and then trying to upload in a short period of time. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Organization, clarity, and feedback  this class lacked all three, and these are essential to learning remotely. Frankly, it would be more effective to take a machine learning course on Coursera or some other online platform. Dont waste your Yale tuition/credits on this. I had several other classes with professors who also had to compromise and adjust due to the pandemic, and every other course was far better than this.

We used Piazza, which is always good for courses online OR in-person that use code as part of assignments. It felt like, in this class, that instructors didnt want to give away answers and so often answered questions with vague clues that did little to help me. I stopped asking questions by the middle of the semester. The professor did not allow us to ask questions anonymously (only anonymous to other students) which, as someone who is not comfortable asking stupid questions, made it harder to ask basic questions without feeling embarrassed. This may just be a problem of mine, and amy not be relevant to other students experiences. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The 1-on-1 office hours with Sahand were the most helpful for learning and completing problem sets.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Sahand is extremely inconsiderate to students and puts in zero effort. If he is not interested in teaching, he should not teach. Students are paying $30,000 for your classes, and this is ridiculous. Please have some thoughts and consideration for your students. You are making it so agonizing for your students. The amount of anxiety, torture and frustration you impose on students is ridiculous. Lectures are cancelled whenever he wishes, and he gives 10 minutes notice ahead of a 9am class. He promises "Python notebooks" and then delivers nothing. Logistics of the class are so poorly organized. Students are left confused about assignment requirements, grading policies. Sahand promises a lot and then delivers nothing. Very very very disappointing. This should not be a Yale class. Wait, it should not be a class anywhere. There is no place for such a poorly-organized, ridiculously-badly-taught class. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I understand that this course (like others) had to be conducted virtually due to circumstances beyond anyones control, but its virtual form was severely lacking.  For starters, I feel that Sahand would have been a far better instructorone clearer in his explanations and more receptive to students questionshad he not been forced to lecture virtually.  The lectures were so dull, consisting of endless derivations and math on his iPad, and they sped along quickly, skipping over the time that typically would have been devoted to clarifying students confusion.  When Sahand did answer questions, it was quite disruptive to the flow of the lecture.  He would, for example, answer questions that had been asked ten or twenty minutes prior, suddenly jumping back to a topic from much earlier in the lecture.  Often, he interrupted his thoughts with the answer to a question, leaving me frustrated that he couldnt finish his point before bouncing to a completely different topic.  Upon addressing a question or a series of questions, he frequently strayed on wild tangents, only a portion of which actually related to the lecture topic at hand.  These diversions frequently included deep dives into the nuances of a particular topic, and the discussion would be concluded with, Oh, you dont need to know this for this course, apparently indicating that we had just spent ten minutes trying to follow the twists and turns of a discussion that we didnt really need to be paying attention to.  All these fits and starts made an already long lecture feel even more tedious, completely disrupting the logical flow of one idea to another and how they all fit together.  

This type of disruption and poor lesson execution really wasnt the fault of the virtual format.  Its something that Sahand could easily fix with an increased focus on being more coherent and straightforward, understanding that the material is complex and that such jumping around between topics and long-winded answers only muddles students assimilation of the relevant knowledge.

Additionally, something must be done about office hours if this course is held virtually again.  All the homework assignments were confusingly written, filled with errors, or generally difficult to complete, requiring students to query TAs, ULAs and Sahand himself for guidance.  The problem was that, in a class of over 200 students, eight hours of virtual office hours per week did not suffice.  Due to rules about not sharing code with other students, those students seeking help could only ask vague, non-specific questions in office hours, rather than the types of pointed questions that would actually help them fix whatever problem they had.  In order to ask specific, useful questions, students had to schedule 15-minute office hour sessions with ULAs or play email tag.  Neither of these approaches was sufficient for homework assignments that often took upwards of a week to fully complete due to their length and difficulty.  I hypothesize that the process of receiving help from ULAs would not have been nearly as frustrating if office hours were held in person, or if vastly more virtual office hours were held during a given week.  I understand the logistical and scheduling constraints that might make this difficult in the future, but something has to be done if this class is to continue virtually. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â For live lectures: Prof. Neghaban would often give us a short break halfway through the lecture, which was helpful to stay concentrated on Zoom. Live Q&amp;A in lecture was nice, but also having Piazza for asynchronous and more in-depth Q&amp;A was really helpful. I'm glad that lectures were recorded, and that we had access to the annotated lecture slides as well. Partway through the semester, most of the lectures started to be prerecorded (and not Zoomed). I'm not sure if this was more or less helpful for methey were perhaps a bit better-organized. But I think that the most helpful virtual model I've experienced for math/stats lectures is a prerecorded lecture which the prof. then screen-shares during lecture time while also being open to take student questions in real time (such as via chat); this might be a lot to ask, but I think that model would be most helpful for learning and keeping up the material. OtherwiseI wish that office hours with Prof. Neghaban were better-communicated and planned, as they were often canceled or moved around last-minute. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Because of technical difficulties, Professor Negahban stopped doing live virtual lectures and only made pre-recorded lectures for us to watch on our own time. I don't blame him for this, but I do think that when it comes to virtual learning, live lectures are infinitely better than pre-recorded ones. It's nice to be able to ask questions in real time, as soon as the question pops into your head. Live virtual lectures are also recorded anyways, so students who cannot make it to the live lectures can still watch them. Also, Professor Negahban would upload the pre-recorded lectures at random times, so I was unable to set aside a specific time each Tuesday and Thursday to watch the lectures. With live virtual lectures, you know that the recorded lecture will be uploaded to Canvas only a few hours later, at roughly the same time each Tuesday and Thursday. Ultimately, live virtual lectures are better than recorded lectures for virtual engagement. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â lack of live lecture halfway through made it that much harder to stay engaged, piazza questions were given curt and non-thorough answers often, we weren't allowed to email the prof with questions, office hours were often rescheduled or canceled and never made up, I liked the implementation of having some 1:1 office hour sessions with sahand and ULAs too but there were far too few slots open for this to be effective or something we could count on. overall extreme lack of consistency <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â As a straightforward lecture course, this course wasn't much different virtually than it would have been in person. The lectures seemed to move quite fast at times, and this may have been exacerbated by Zoom, since the professor couldn't physically see students struggling to keep up. More frequent check-ins about the pace of the course would be a good idea, and requesting that students keep their cameras on might also help. <br/></div>
