<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> The biggest strength of this program is the instructors. Anna and Luca both cared so much for us and truly showed us that they cared that we succeeded and got a lot out of the program. On top of that, the program does a good job infusing cultural visits and tours, so that participants perhaps gain a greater understanding of Italian culture and heritage, without overtly spending much classroom time on it. 

That being said, the program has quite a few weaknesses. The first is the culture of work that Siena creates. Because the program is so intensive, necessarily  students spend a whole lot of time learning vocab and doing homework. However, the pressure put on the students to preform created this nasty anxiety in which everyone worked all afternoon and didnt really take advantage of being in Italy. Grades became a fixation instead of learning from the landscape. The second problem (which, at times, blended with the first) is the location. Siena is a great town for study in many ways: its safe, its quiet, etc. However, its so small and plain (at times) that there are few activities for the class to do together to bond. Its a super isolating town in which the never-ending brick buildings seem to resemble those of a prison more and more every day. The biggest problem, though, is the homestay situation. It never felt like home. I still dont think my homestay parents really care for me at all; they host students year around (and if I had to guess, they are simply looking to profit). This isnt atypical from what Ive heard. Most students felt force-fed at times and essentially no one felt at home. 8 weeks is too long never to feel at home. Perhaps the old 5 weeks in Italy system was better in this regard. But the problems with the home stay program dont stop there. They are incredibly isolating. For the students who lived 40 minutes away from the center of town, alone, it was nearly impossible to make friends or feel connected to the program (which, of course, is compounded by the lack of things to do in Siena). The homestay section of the program taught me little about Italian culture (my host parents seemed more keen on criticizing my eating habits than teaching me about Italy) while making me feel super isolated and alone. Perhaps this could be rectified by doing a dorm component at Yale or in Italy, or simply by adding more class trips and class meals to foster a sense of community and unity within the program, but whatever it is, something needs to change. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> It was easy to stay engaged with the course at all times. Being surrounded by the language, and with the huge amount of information we were responsible for, it was hardly a choice whether to be engaged or not. You kind of had to be. 

I thought that the pace of the course was at times hardly doable. At some points I wasn't able to get a thorough understanding of the material because we moved on so quickly. I understand this is a function of trying to squeeze 2 whole courses into a short period of time, and there isn't much that can be done to remedy it.  

My biggest complaint was with the host stay situation. I was the only student in my household, and I found it very hard to interact with my host family. If I were to do it again, I would definitely ask for a roommate, as I imagine having another person with you that is in the same language situation would greatly ease the difficulties of interacting with your host stay family. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> The course goes a little too fast. It could be strengthened if there was time in between to review past material. The strengthens definitely were the professors! Great professors that support and are available to you make the learning process so much better. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> One of the weaknesses of this course was simply just the pace, however I think this was a strength in some ways as well. Having the language so condensed was certainly difficult and while we had class for 3 hours a day, 5 days a week, it also required 2-3 hours of self-studying on those days as well to keep up and do well with the language. I think that having the program entirely in Italy made a huge difference, especially living with a host family who spoke 0 English really forced us to learn quickly. Although this was challenging at the time, I do think that it really helped improve my ability to speak and learn the language.

I think that there are many ways this course and program can be improved. I think that the syllabus really needs to be looked at critically. I believe that the professors and some students of the program need to look at the syllabus together, and work to find a way where units that were most challenging or weeks with the most going on (trips, etc.) are facilitated and structured so students have more time to focus on more challenging topics, such as the subjunctive which was virtually skipped over at the end.

I also think that the timing of program trips needs to be looked at more critically, especially most of the Siena trips after class. The only three trips disclosed to students before the program and on the syllabus were: Rome, Florence, and the beach. I think that first, the beach trip should not have been referred to in the information session at Yale especially as the beach trip, as it involved a trip to the archeological site. I think many students, myself included, actually really enjoyed that visit (probably one of my favorites of the program), however many were frustrated beforehand because it felt sprung on them. It was also only 3 days of class that week because of the Palio, which I think made it really difficult to push through the final couple of weeks of the program, and this likely contributed to a lot of the exhaustion students were feeling. Additionally, there were many trips within Siena that came up even the day of, such as trips to Contrada Museums, the bank, etc. I think these need to be planned more in advance so that students are prepared to engage with them, and can especially plan their studying and travelling accordingly. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> I think the first few weeks should be spent at Yale because being in Italy for all eight weeks felt very long also we arrived without knowing any Italian so it was difficult to communicate for the first couple weeks <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> I think having the program in Siena for eight weeks was one of the most important improvements done to the course. You are being exposed to the language and the culture from day one, and you get more enthusiastic to learn the language and to learn it as fast as possible to talk to the beautiful people of Siena than if you were stuck in New Haven for the first three weeks, where there are your friends from outside the program with whom you can hang out, a whole world that has nothing to do with neither the Italian culture nor the Italian language. <br/></div>

</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> There should be more of a direct way to converse within the school settings because expecting our hosts family to contribute is nice in thought but in actuality It is not always feasible. Some families just stick to English and some just won't talk to you much at all if they can help It. A student can only force someone to speak with them but so much. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> At times, especially with specific grammar rules, the professors and the textbook differed. This could get really confusing sometimes, so it'd be nice if either a different textbook could be chosen or more of an effort could be made to match the textbook. Since the program was so intense and accelerated, we relied heavily on the textbook outside of class. Otherwise though, this class did an incredible job of including a little bit of practice in every form, with weekly essays, daily grammar and vocab, speaking mostly Italian in class, and having the opportunity to practice conversations with native speakers around Siena. One more thing is that the program seemed a little long, especially in the last couple weeks. I understand 3 weeks in New Haven and 5 weeks in Siena seemed too short to previous students, but all 8 weeks seemed a bit exhausting. Perhaps 2 weeks in New Haven and 6 weeks in Siena would be ideal. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> I think a strength was a the pure amount of information that we were able to learn in only a short eight weeks; however, one thing that could be improved was the timeline of the course. It felt like there was constantly too much going on which was very stressful and took away from our ability to enjoy our time in Siena and fully immerse ourselves in the culture. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> The main dilemma of the program was its extremely fast pace, cramming a year's worth of material in barely eight weeks. We were forced to skip key concepts and rush over to the next part without giving time to fully comprehend and absorb what was taught. This issue was slightly remedied because we were in an environment that forced us to speak and listen to Italian all throughout the day. The textbook was no help, however, as it was poorly organized, unclearly worded, and often contradictory. To improve the course, the instructors need to find a textbook better suited for the needs of the program. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> I loved this class. The teachers made it very interactive and fun every day--we would do Kahoot competitions about once a week, and have other interesting games interspersed between lessons. The one thing I would say to improve about the class is that sometimes we'd get off-task and spend too long covering things that are interesting, like Italian stereotypes, but not necessarily helpful to our success as students. However, these moments were few and far between, and overall this was a great class. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> The book was a major weakness. The course was too focused on grammar and writing and not enough on spoken, which meant that students knew a lot of the grammar in theory but then when they tried to use it in practice they couldn't speak because they did not know any useful vocabulary. Especially given that this course took place in Italy, meaning that the ability to speak to people is quite essential, there should have been a much larger stress on vocabulary and the spoken aspect of the Italian language. <br/></div>
