<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It's a lot of great and useful information but can be a bit hard to digest. The flipped classroom setting makes it pretty time consuming <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Having recorded lectures was good for me to catch up on my own time. However, because all the actual content was pre-recorded, I almost felt like the time for live lectures wasn't as effective in helping me learn or reinforce the topics. Mostly this might have been due to the lack of structure to the open Q&amp;A session. Having the quizzes integrated into the pre-recorded lectures required me to stay on track with the lectures but also were a bit stressful if I forgot to do them. At first I thought the debates were a bit extra, but they were a nice addition to the live lecture to hear from my classmates about a focused topic. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Pros: Content is fantastic-- really covers anything and everything you've wondered about healthcare in the US. 

Cons: the testable material is everything and anything he's said in class or in a recorded lecture, which is... a lot. The recorded lecture stuff is fine because there are powerpoints and you can take good notes. But the class sessions were formatted as Q&amp;A sessions, and he often didn't even read the question aloud before answering, so I didn't know what he'd be talking about until halfway through his answer, by which time it was difficult to write down what he just said. I think if he had a rough outline of the day's topics that he posted before class, it would really facilitate in-class learning. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The live portion of the lecture was quite a about a 45 minute q&amp;a session every week which wasn't really conducive to organizing the material. But the recorded lectures were quite clear. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The mandatory in-person Q&amp;A sessions seemed a bit pointless, in addition to the in-class activities. I did not really pay attention. The debates were interesting but also difficult to really take something from. The lectures and slides were very informative, but many of the concepts were not clearly explained or outlined on the slides. The organization could have also been improved, as a lot of prior knowledge was assumed so the topics seemed to jump around. The midterm also did not offer enough time and also had vague questions, despite being conceptually easy. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The live sessions were very hard to sit through/learn at times. I wish they would be more structured by topic rather than a free-flowing Q and A. The debate was pretty fun but hard to make engaging online. The midterm was way too long and was impossible to finish. However, this class was great-the TAs, especially Evie and Arya, were very accessible, as was Howie, holding office hours multiple times a week. I thought Howie was a great teacher to have, was really funny/was super knowledgeable on healthcare and coronavirus, and would answer all our questions and tried to make the class as interactive as possible. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The overall course material is very interesting and it brings to light the issues in the American healthcare system. As a premed, I loved taking this class because I was made more aware of the shortcomings in physicians, and I feel as though this class really opened my eyes up to the kind of doctor I want to be. However, the course was very disorganized, something I think was attributed to the pandemic. The live lectures had no structure and even the asynchronous lectures lacked structure sometimes. I wish that we had some sort of literature to refer to rather than just Howie's speaking. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Forman is a gem. This class also has something for everyone from pre-med students to polisci students to economics students.

Weaknesses: Sometimes the live sessions dragged a little bit when the questions stopped flowing (because the live sessions were generally Q&amp;A), but Howie would usually just let us leave early if that was the case. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths 
- Interesting course material
- super knowledgeable and passionate professor and TFs!
- Guest Lectures
- Prerecorded asynchronous sessions gave students access to course material in a very organized manner

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Interesting and important content. Howie is absolutely amazing and you can tell all the students love him.

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Prof. Forman is very nice and knowledgeable, and clearly organized class well. The asynchronous lectures with live Q&amp;A sessions worked well and allowed us to spend time with Prof. Forman discussing the more complex parts of the material.
I would have liked to study more of the economics behind healthcare. We studied broad trends and economic observations that have been made, but the course realistically did not require much economics background. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: Covers a wide spread of interesting material with good slides to get the main ideas. Weakness: There is heavy use of jargon that is not explained and having recordings from the summer means there was no ability to improve lecture quality during the semester. The synchronous sessions did not really have a strong purpose and more often than not were unclear and did not help facilitate understanding of class material. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength is the subject of the course, which is interesting especially if you take the time to look stuff up yourself. Weakness is the structure of the class. The asynchronous lectures felt rushed, the synchronous sessions didn't feel relevant, and overall the structure of the course could have been improved to both better facilitate learning and teach the material more thoroughly. <br/></div>

Weaknesses Tuesday and Thursday lectures definitely did not have to be 1h15m...Could've been a 50 min segment and still would've learned the same amount (or release students earlier than we were) <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths are that the topics are very interesting but a big weakness was having to watch lectures outside of the live lectures which led to a lot of extra work. Another weakness was the Q&amp;A format of the live lectures that didn't allow for a full and in-depth understanding of one topic because we would jump around topics. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A huge weakness was the required Q&amp;A sessions.

Getting to do a Q and A with Howie twice per week was by the best part of the class. Also, I loved the guest speakers, especially Farzad.

Weaknesses: I never did the readings, I'm not sure why they were assigned, but I think it would've been better to just assign a "layperson" book about the problems in the medical system and call it a day. <br/></div>

For instance, in the Medicaid lecture, it begins with "this is how FMAP is allocated for Medicaid states" as opposed to something like "Medicaid is insurance for people who are living close to or below the federal poverty level". 

However, Howie is a very knowledgeable professor and it was great hearing from his insights. I especially appreciated the paper as a creative way to synthesize course material. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â S: Howie is a very good lecturer, TAs are very attentive, and material is very relevant and interesting to learn 
W: the way the midterm exam was administered was a little ridiculous. Not only was extremely time-constrained, but there were no practice exam questions given. The justification was that they would give up too much of what the exam looks like, but me and other peers felt like like that was a ridiculous excuse to leave us unprepared for the exam. Furthermore, concern over cheating was a little too much, and the time constraint was awful for those with slower typing such as myself. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course covered a lot of material in a well-structured format. The lectures were incredibly relevant to what is currently going on in the world. The professor is always willing to answer questions and evidently passionate about the topics covered. The guest lecturers brought different perspectives on the topics that we covered in class. One weakness I would note is the prerecorded/live lecture format. Most of the "learning" was done through the prerecorded lecture, and we spent the live lecture time asking questions or doing debates. Sometimes the questions asked during the live lecture jumped from topic to topic which made it a little difficult to follow. I would have liked to see some structure in terms of organizing the questions. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Howie is a good lecturer, TAs are really helpful
Weaknesses: Weird class format (watch lectures asynchronously then required to show up to synchronous lectures which were basically mandated office hours), felt like at times Howie thought we knew more about health economics than we actually did so some parts of lecture he went over super fast without explaining much and left me confused, could use more econ application <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course had some good modules for learning and I really appreciated the way Howie answers questions.
However, the course sometimes appeared to be stacked against us in that Howie would constantly mention that we would do badly on midterms. Additionally, there was no point for an in-person lecture along with asynchronous video- that was too much work. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â OOf, where do I start..... doing this on zoom was a mess. The recorded lectures were lengthy and hard to follow, and the live sessions were very uninteresting (it was just a Q&amp;A about the recorded lectures). I would have appreciated it if the information was given to us live (instead fo the prerecorded lectures), so we could ask questions as information came up, and be more engaged with the live sessions. Also, Prof. Forman and the TAs kind of did us dirty with the exams... I've never heard of reasoning for not providing practice tests being "they will reveal too much about what kind of questions we'll ask"... isn't that the point? It made taking the exams extremely stressful (especially the midterm), in a semester that was already under stressful conditions. <br/></div>

Weaknesses: The midterm was terrible- too many questions and too little time. The course was a little disorganized (routine quiz questions weren't entered into Canvas until late in the semester).

At some point, I took five days to rewatch every prerecorded lecture and recorded live lecture and realized that the the content was quite interesting after all. The problem is just that once someone loses focus during the discussion of one question, they're pretty much out of the entire lecture and waiting to take notes later off of the recording. I think it might be helpful to have a five minute break so that people can keep up with every question being asked in class. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The combined format of recorded lectures and live virtual Q&amp;A's worked very well. Prof. Forman's answers were particularly valuable when they went beyond textbook-like material and into his personal experience or insight into current events. The sequence of topics built on itself nicely, and assignments were well designed to reinforce key lessons without being too much work. I thought that the debates didn't add much to the course, so their time could have been better used otherwise. I'd also be interested to have a conclusion to the course that directly addresses the big picture of why the US healthcare system is so expensive relative to its outcomes and what can be done to fix that, to the extent that clear answers exist. <br/></div>
