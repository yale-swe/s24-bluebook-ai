<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was exceptionally well taught, the professor did an amazing job, especially over video, of getting students to engage and interact with the material. You could tell his depth of knowledge and interest in the material during lectures. The only thing that could be improved was that every single day about 10 minutes was spent discussing the timetable for the day, which was identical each day, and this caused us to run over time about the same amount of time each day. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was well balanced. I liked that there were no recorded lectures and the readings were great. And the setup of the class was very straight forward <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of the course were that it quite thoroughly covered the material that it claimed it would, and had a plethora of relevant readings.  The only weakness of the course that I can think of was that only some readings would be mentioned in discussion, disincentivizing reading the reading of them because at some point they felt unnecessary. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the course is great and the instructor design its structure well. The only pity is that it is too much for a summer session. I believe if it is taught during school year, it would be better. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would say the only weakness was that classes usually went over time, but this wasn't really a huge problem because I was engaged in the information so I didn't notice. The course overall was great and the information was detailed enough to get the full story of the time period, but not too focused to the point you get bogged down in detail. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One of the strengths of this course was its frequent use of media. Throughout the course, the professor used photographs, newsreels, and primary sources to illustrate the concepts we were learning in class, which turned out to be very engaging. He also provided summaries of the course material at the beginning and end of the lectures, which I thought was helpful and useful. There were few weaknesses. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The format of the course was easy to follow and straightforward. All the materials were easy to access on Canvas, as were all the readings. I really liked how were had to submit essay outlines, and received feedback. It really helped me with my writing (not only with this course, but with others as well). I did think sometimes there were too many assignments due at once (essay outline, timeline assignment, missionary archives reading response), but that is probably a result of the short duration of Summer Session. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The Zoom sessions were amazing and very engaging! Moreover, the readings gave a great supplementary understanding of the events discussed during lectures. The discussion sections were also very insightful. I honestly think that there is not much room for improvement given how interesting and engaging this course was! Just concerning the summer session format, writing the final essay felt very rushed, so maybe planning in a little bit more time for that/having to submit the essay draft earlier would be helpful. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There was a lot of reading and I think that it was difficult to finish all of it.  It would be great if the reading workload was something more manageable.  I think the lectures were great! <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: really well taught, professor and TA team are obviously very knowledgeable and make the material engaging. Their support for their students was prompt and thorough.

Weaknesses: just personal preference but I wish the lecture material topic was presented first and the readings for that topic assigned after the lecture. I would prefer to have a big picture summary and then get into the reading than the other way around, but I understand there are drawbacks to that system as well. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Tyler Kynn was a very good lecturer. The history of the Middle East is relevant and interesting and he made it very accessible to someone with no knowledge of it (and scant experience with history courses at all), like me. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This was an excellent course. Other courses at Yale should be modeled after this. It was intensive, and certainly one of the more intense humanities courses I have had at Yale, but it was very well constructed and always engaging. This has to have been one of the only courses in my 3.5 years at Yale where I have actually paid attention to every minute of the 2hr lectures. 

I came into the course wondering if there might be some bias in how the politically charged events discussed would be presented, given the fact that our professors are American (to my knowledge) and that we are studying at an American university. But I was satisfied by the end of the course that information had been presented to us curated and taught in an objective and well-rounded manner. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I really enjoyed the variety of primary sources we were assigned to read in this course. My TA (Camille Cole) was also fantastic! She gave great feedback on essays and lead discussion sections very effectively. Another major strength of this class is that it challenges the label of the aggressor too often placed on Middle Eastern countries by the United States/Europe. I also enjoyed that Prof. Kynn made lectures more interactive through the use of Zoom polls. 

Weaknesses: I cannot think of many weaknesses. Although I realize that this course is very constrained by the 5-week time limitation, I feel that it would have been beneficial to spend more time on the damage that the US has caused in the Middle East in more recent history. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think this courses biggest weakness is that it moves very fast through history and some topics aren't covered as deeply as one might like. However, this isn't necessarily a drawback since the description of the course was that this would be a survey course about the history of the Middle East that leads to what it looks like today. I don't see any way Professor Kynn could improve this type of class. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I found the diversity of activities in the course very engaging. The workload for the summer was apt. If anything we could maybe break up the course more so it is not in three hours chunks which can be hard to sit all the way through. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It does a good job of covering an array of topics in a short period of time, and it managed to be engaging and interactive even though it was conducted online. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course excellently used the features of both Zoom and Canvas, and I felt like the topics were very well organized. The instructor and TFs were genuinely interested in engaging us, even though class started at 9am! I felt like the only notable weakness was the changing due days of the week and times for assignments. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: TFs--at least mine.  Camille Cole was excellent in helping both with understanding material and also organizing thoughts on papers and assignments.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This has been the strongest online class that I have taken online so far. Professor Kynn and the TF's designed a class that was incredibly engaging, and you could tell how much time and effort they put into making it so. The organization of the class was very straightforward, as were the assignments and deadlines. The expectations of the class were clearly presented. I very much enjoyed the incorporation of different types of media into the class, such as photographs, recorded speeches, newsreels, and advertisements. A highlight of the class was the role-playing game in which the members of the discussion section discussed the topics of the class from the points of view of different Ottoman leaders. All-around, this was a highly engaging and well- taught class. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: covers a lot of content with a surprisingly high amount of detail, helps understand the bigger picture and rich history/context of today's standings

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: This course was an astounding step up from the online classes Yale had to construct during the 2020 spring semester. The variety of different methods of engaging students really added to the class; the course involved roleplay of different historical figures, incorporation of primary sources, high-level historical discussions between students and TFs, and efficient assignments like essays and timelines. Choosing to do midterm and final essays instead of online tests was a very good call for this course, as it avoided any issues of cheating or inequity and added another level of learning (ie historical writing) to the class. But the biggest strength of this course was the faculty. The professor and every one of the TFs (and I can honestly say every one of them) were incredibly knowledgeable about Middle Eastern history, quite engaging and passionate about the class' topics, and continuously diligent and accessible to students during and outside of lectures. It was also awesome that each instructor had a specific, unique area of expertise (be it region or time period), so that when students asked tough questions about a highly specific subject, it could be quickly relayed to the correspondingly knowledgeable TF/professor. I kid you not, I believe that every single time (and there were many times) except once, even the most obscure specific question was quickly and completely answered.
Weaknesses: Being online BUT this course was so, so, so much better than the online regular-term Yale classes I had taken the preceding spring. It was far more polished and well-planned and engaging. Another weakness was just how short the session was.
Improved: I think the short breaks may have been a little too long and could've been shortened, although perhaps it's easy to say that now that we're not doing hours-long sessions. Also I suppose it's a bit much to ask instructors to keep talking and teaching without much break for over three hours... I was greedy for more of the course! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was amazing. Very well organized and very interesting readings and lectures. However, it's a lot of reading so I am glad I took it as a summer course. The reading definitely reinforced the lecture and I likely would not have bothered to do the reading atop 4 or 5 other classes. The discussion section activities were actually very helpful- some of the only useful discussion sections i've ever been in! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â My only wish is that the class could have lasted longer and Yale Summer Session courses did not have to be crammed into five weeks. Taking this class was such an amazing experience: the choice and length of readings was perfect, and we had just the right mix of class-related activities outside of lecture and discussion. <br/></div>
