<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course bit off more than it could chew. It tried to deal with too much course material to actually go deeply into any one portion of liberal thought. The strengths of the course were the beginning, when we would read one thinker a week (like Tocqueville) and discuss their influence on liberalism. This made sense to me, and felt like we were actually developing an understanding of what "Liberalism" even means. But the second half of the course was mired in far too many readings every week. This is not some college-student philistinism or laziness. This is, instead, a criticism of the way the course was structured: in my case, the problem wasn't that I was averse to doing reading, it was that I had no idea how to integrate the disparate array of articles we would be given every week into some sort of coherent broader narrative. Surely the instructors were just giving us more than we needed to actually read, so that we could just get a set of working impressions from all of the articles, but I found this strategy extremely unsuccessful. I was left feeling completely unmoored, without any real understanding of where the course was tending, nor any sense of the philosophical development of Liberalism past Cold War American Liberals like Niebuhr. The course was in search of a sensibility. Because of its winding and overwrought structure, I don't think it found it. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There were many readings but very few of them played into the course; the topics were interesting after a certain point but the early readings were less so because they focused on political philosophy and early liberal thinkers that did not play much of a role on influencing the writings of the latter half of the course <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â very interesting course and learned a lot, also a really unique structure in the discussions between the 3 professors, but definitely disorganized and didn't feel like a normal class at all - probably would have preferred more structured lectures (or one structured, informational lecture per week and then another similar to the current format). <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Lectures were always really interesting, especially with all three professors, all of whom are fantastic. I know I'll keep thinking about the questions they posed for a long time. Each brought his own ideas and approaches and brought the best out in each other. I would have given the professors more time instead of having a question-and-answer periodI wasn't particularly impressed by the questions, but I was always intrigued by what the professors wanted to talk about. The readings were always interesting (and you read quite a bit for the course), and I appreciated how we placed today's challenges in historical perspective. Weaknesses: The course moved very quickly through each topicit would have been great to have an hour and fifteen minute lecture rather than the fifty minutes, which only gave very limited time for each quasi-lecture to be followed by even briefer responses from the other professors. I also thought the questions we discussed in class and section often turned out to be more interesting than our paper prompts, but that is more a testament to the classes / section than a weakness of the essays. Overall, a great course! <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Extremely engaging and eye-opening, discussion-based lecture format was great for hearing the instructors' different viewpoints, weekly discussion section provided an opportunity to further ponder and engage

Weaknesses: Readings were quite varied in length depending on the day, ranging from a couple 20-page articles to a 250 page book (to be read in one day). It would have been helpful to spread the readings out to be more consistent. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: this course covers a great breadth of material, and the professors each present interesting perspectives. The discussion sections allowed for a thought-stimulating exchange between students and the TF.
Weaknesses: there are few opportunities for determining your grade in the class (2 essays, final exam, and participation). It would have been helpful to have an additional essay assignment to reduce the weight of each assignment. Sometimes, it was difficult to understand what the professors were getting at in class, and having three professors with three different view points sometimes just made the lecture more confusing. There was also just too much reading assigned for the course, and it was hard to know which readings should be prioritized for discussion section. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: incredibly knowledgable instructors; diversity of perspectives; highly engaging discussion format; great mix between classical texts and current affairs; the syllabus was very well thought-through; some of the best Professors Yale has to offer  

Weaknesses: I would have preferred reading even more classical texts over the current affairs lectures. Some of those seemed a little repetitive. Also looking a little more beyond American Liberalism would have been nice but I get that a class like this has a limited scope. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Perhaps a definition of liberalism would help in determining if there is a crisis. Not that one can easily be found but at least setting the terms more clearly so one professor isn't referring to the status quo order while another is discussing a philosophical tradition. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Cool discussion panel format between the three professors: The different professors offered different insights. That being said, there could have been more structure in the course  discussion. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think syllabus became significantly weaker towards the end of the course, and I don't think the link between the contemporary readings and the theoretical discussions had earlier in the course wasn't explored satisfactorily. Additionally, I think the syllabus would have benefitted from the inclusion of Rawls. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was quite ambitious in the amount of material it wanted to cover, and I thought the reading was ultimately too much (especially during COVID). It was helpful when my TF started telling us which readings to focus on for section, but some weeks there were hundreds of pages to read before lecture and that was not feasible (so I sometimes felt lost, or didn't know what to tackle when I was pressed for time). I think reducing the reading load would also make discussions a little more fruitful as people would be more likely to be on the same page. I also think that while it was useful in the end to have covered so many different genres of readings by the end of the course, as I felt I had a broad understanding of the history and contemporary aspects of liberalism, it was sometimes disorienting to move from dense political theory to op-eds. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The readings were interesting, but too much to go over in the class time. I think more focus would have been nice. Additionally, the class did not seem to progress very much in the final month, hovering around the present without seeming to go forwards or backwards. We also lost a lot of critical theory and many of the readings seemed to lose track of the first half of the class when we debated what constituted  liberalism. The professors were all interesting, but did not have enough time to talk. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class had three really cool professors who would be interesting on a panel about liberalism. However, the class felt unrooted. It meandered around questions without a strong structure. The different perspectives within single lectures could be confusing, especially because they did not always engage with the readings well. This class would've been a good four week series but it broke down fairly quickly after that. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: three great professors. Inherently interesting topic.
Weakness: everything else. The class assumed that you could grasp all the ideas about hard thinkers and com to lecture ready to listen to 3 professors debate thinkers you didn't even understand. Way way too broad. Honestly worst class I've taken at Yale, and everyone I know who took it with me felt the same way. 0/10! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the 3-instructor format had a lot of potential, and was very helpful for getting to see the interplay between three different people of different ideological persuasions within the umbrella of liberalism. Lecture was always engaging, instructors did a great job interspersing humor and pop culture which kept things fresh during Zoom. Good syllabus.
I think this class could benefit from limiting itself a little more. I don't know whether this needs to come in the syllabus or the way lectures are structured but "Crisis of liberalism" ended up feeling like way too gargantuan a topic and it was hard to grasp onto anything sometimes. I also thought there were so many readings that it was very difficult to do them all every week and most people probably didn't, but I guess that's common. I also think making sure that each instructor spoke in every fifty minute lecture made it very challenging for the instructors to fully flesh out their points/arguments; it often felt like things were left hanging. Maybe either lengthen the lecture time and have it only once a week or only have two instructors talk each time? <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think my main problem with the class was that I sometimes didn't feel like the content was worth engaging with because it felt like it framed very real and concrete issues in abstract ways that made them less concrete and sometimes denied the realities of certain issues. (Maybe this is more of an issue I have with political philosophy/theory overall than with this class specifically.) But overall it sometimes felt like three white men talking about the history of liberalism (and colonialism and capitalism etc) in an abstract theoretical way and that was frustrating at times. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: highly engaging lectures by three very dynamic lecturers. I loved the structure of the whole class - the balance between lecture content and discussion sections was very on point. Also super thankful to be put in a graduate student section, and not mixed undergrad-grad sections. The content itself was also really thoughtfully delivered, and the readings were fascinating. 
Weaknesses: the course would benefit from having a more international focus, and spending at least 1 week on liberalism in non-Western countries. It was very American-centric, and at times it felt like the class was really just trying to determine why Trump was elected rather than the broader international trends leading to the global rise of populism. Prof. Moyn is a great section leader though at times I felt the section was too free-form - I would have preferred a more deliberate discussion of the readings rather than the pick-your-topic discussion we ended up having. <br/></div>
