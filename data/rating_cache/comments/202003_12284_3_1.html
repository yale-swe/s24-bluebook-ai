<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The recorded lectures online were helpful, because students could replay them and slow them down as the wanted. The lack of in-person demonstrations was unfortunate, but recorded demonstrations were almost as good. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Succeeded: Despite the restrictions due to the pandemic, I believe that this course still did a great job of keeping students engaged and teaching the required physics concepts clearly. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The virtual office hours and spreadsheet was amazing, please keep it. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The virtual lecture style was just as if not more engaging than in-person lectures would have been, in in my view, and the transformation of the tests into open-note exams greatly improved my learning experience. However, the experience at office hours could be chaotic at times, despite the great number of available office hours each week. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked it. The recorded lectures were nice. and the availability for OH and peer tutoring was good. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the format of this course succeeded. Having the lectures recorded was nice because it allowed me to pause them and rewind and really make sure I understood everything being taught. Although students couldn't ask questions live with this format, Professor Steinacker and the TFs and Peer tutors all had a lot of office hours so it was easy to get help with any confusing concepts. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Steinacker was super flexible as a result of the pandemic and was very generous in allowing the exams to be taken throughout the day and lenient with homework and participation submissions. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Breaking up an hour and a half lecture into 3 thirty minute lectures was very helpful. I also really liked that Steinacker recorded all the lectures and then posted them. This was certainly more effort on her part, but she produced lectures of far higher quality than some other online classes as a result. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The time given to do assignments helped immensely. The focus of the course was on learning and not grading. Course was very organized. Review sessions helped as well. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Lots of virtual office hours were key <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The recorded lectures were informative, and they succeeded in teaching me basic principles of physics. I also appreciated the demonstrations that were fascinating yet really facilitated learning. We even put in study groups at the start of the semester, which really helped feel connected throughout the semester as I at least knew someone in the class. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked the recorded lectures format of this course because I could watch them at my own pace. I also liked that Prof Steinacker had office hours focused to the lecture material and separate office hours for the problem sets. I think she set that up well and she was still flexible and willing to answer any question. My physics study group that was created as part of the course didn't meet much, but I was still happy with that setup because I made a close friend and I met some other students as well. And, when we did meet, we were able to help each other and have fun. 

I didn't like the lecture participation questions as much because it was stressful to have to submit another assignment for a grade, even though you only had to get an 80% on participation.

The virtual study halls and office hours were so helpful and I felt like I had plenty of resources to be able to understand the material and do well in the course. I liked that the peer tutors were able to give me direct feedback (including whether my answer to a pset problem was right or wrong), as that really helped me understand the material and figure out what was going on in a problem. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The live virtual office hours and recorded help sessions were a great success. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This semester the professor added participation questions throughout the lectures to improve active engagement, but I feel like they did not exactly help. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Virtual live lecture rather than a recorded one <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I appreciated that this course was completely asynchronous, so we could take other courses concurrently. However, the participation component in the lectures was an aspect of the course I didn't like, especially because they were graded on accuracy. I often found myself skipping through the lectures just to find the participation questions. I also found that the take-home exams were much more difficult than the normal 3-hour exam. I understand why this happened, but I wish that we had been given warning or been informed of how long we should have been expected to take on them. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â N/A. I worked best with the recorded format. The one thing would be to have participation due the end of the week, not the end of the day. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I appreciate Professor Steinacker's attempts to standardize the curriculum with an average year through some demonstrations, and I also very much appreciate her flexibility on the psets and exams compared to non-COVID years, with the exception of her inexplicably making the final pset 3 questions longer. She made course materials quite accessible, even without a textbook, and I found her and the tutors' office hours to be quite helpful. That being said, I did at times have panic attacks based on the level of work that remained--while these were mitigated with the help of the peer tutors and the student groups she asked us to collaborate with (a good request that helped dramatically), it should be known that this course will be remarkably hard and take up a remarkable amount of time. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the recorded lectures were very clear and there was a lot of available help if you are confused about the content. I thought the participation questions due at midnight the day of each lecture were sometimes a bit unnecessarily difficult and they were graded for accuracy instead of completion. That was good because it made it hard to fall behind, but it also wasn't very flexible if you were struggling or behind. <br/></div>

I think that there is a big communication component in this class which is inherently difficult to translate online. I was really happy with the study groups that Professor Steinacker created for us to somewhat bridge that gap. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Although I did not love that the lectures were prerecorded when I first started the professor I came to appreciate this because it allowed me to go back and review information when I needed to verify something for homework or because I needed to study for an exam. I am not sure how the information in this class in normally made available to students, but having the ability to look at Professor Steinacker's lecture and homework notes made a huge difference in my experience with this course because I was able to always go back and verify my own notes. The office hours and study hall hours were also well adapted to the situation at hand because I felt like I always knew when I could get help if I needed it. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The exam times were very difficult to work with. With a limited window to take it and in the Pacific time zone, the first exam coincided with many different things. I ended up skipping dinner (goes through dinnertime) and taking the test for the full time. During this time, I was starving but could not go to the kitchen in fear that I would lose time and sharing a room with my family, I had many distractions. I don't think its fair to have a closed window for test taking for students in these circumstances. Please consider giving the full 24 hours for all exams. Exam 2 and 3 went very smoothly. I was able to choose my own time to take the test and even with distractions I finished the test without pressure. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Lectures were prerecorded, and I tend to focus better in live virtual lectures then prerecorded ones, so that made it a little more difficult for me. Also, some of the prerecorded lectures ran a little long while others ran a little short, and there were discussion/participation questions asked throughout that did not count towards the time. I think this averaged out to a normal or maybe slightly long amount of class time, but it could be kind of stressful because I try to watch the lectures during our normal class time and I had classes before and after so it was sometimes hard to fit it in. 

However, the zoom office hours worked really well for me and I appreciated how many of them were offered <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Asynchronous lectures were effective, but were not as engaging as live ones. Office hours for homework were frequent and extremely helpful for completing the homework and understanding the content. The instructor made sure that every student had a study group to discuss lectures and work on homework with, though my group never worked on anything together. Exams were not proctored and worked well, though they did create a significant opportunity for students to collaborate during the exams, despite contrary rules, which made the exams somewhat unfair towards those who did not work with others. <br/></div>

Even in virtual mode I had a very tight schedule but the recorded video format for Physics 180 contributed a good amount to keeping time management under control. A weakness I found with the virtual setting was collaborative learning. Working with my good friends on problem sets actually took more time than working individually, which was very surprising to me. I found the participation assignments pretty useful, too, especially since they grant some independence and support virtual learning for this course. <br/></div>

She was also very kind to her students and it was clear that she cared about our mental wellbeing throughout the semester. She would cancel participation on weeks where she felt it would be appreciated, or would extend deadlines by a few days to give us time to complete our work but also stop to breathe. Professor Steinacker was a great professor and while it was a shame to not have been able to experience her lectures in person, her personality and teaching abilities still shone through in the online lectures. I personally never made it to her office hours, but she was available often and encouraged students to come to her with questions about the recorded lectures.
