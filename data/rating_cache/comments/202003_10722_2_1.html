<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths are JDRS and teaching style - as well as ability to keep lectures engaging. No improvements needed. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: you learn about statistics and if you go to office hours (JDRS will walk you through the homework) you can better understand the process (material is not all memorize and go, you have to usually understand and apply concepts)

Weaknesses: exams will really sneak up on you and sometimes you can be doing really well at the homework (which is more use Minitab and process-based with directions) but then not as well at the exam (which this year online was multiple choice/short answer and required a more nuanced application) 

Would love more practice problems, but exams never felt impossible so I probably just wasn't fully understanding or applying myself <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The amount of synchronous office hours, the fun little lecture inclusions
Weaknesses: The lack of specificity on some problem sets <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: AWESOME lecturer, very helpful TA during office hours, very easy to do well if you put in a little bit of work
no weaknesses! <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course would have worked better for me if there were optional synchronous components. Though there is plenty of office hours, a more structured discussion or weekly review would have been very helpful for me because even after watching lectures, I did not understand the curriculum enough to do the homework on my own. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: available TFs and Prof
Weaknesses: Lectures can be dense <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Recorded lectures were a strength for sure. It does move quite quickly... However, psets were pretty helpful and exams weren't too bad. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This was probably my best course this semester. The recorded lectures were both manageable in terms of time, and also consistently well organized, easily digestible, and actually pretty entertaining. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â JDRS is a fantastic professor and by far one of the most understanding professors I had this semester. A weakness of the course is the difficult with making sure that all points were covered in Psets to get a decent grade (otherwise you have to spend significant amount of time in office hours with TAs) <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Online format made it difficult to get extra help, clarify grading, or stay on top of assignments. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: absolutely wonderful instructor, easy to understand breakdown of material in lectures, fun outros to videos that I looked forward to watching. JRDS never stop teaching! <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course is run very effectively and will offer you everything you need if you choose to take advantage of all resources. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: JDRS is SO charismatic and engaging even when pre-recorded. I feel like I know him really well despite never meeting. Lectures are clearly divided into topical videos within daily modules, and PDF notes were always easy to follow. Quizzes, psets, and exams are all fairly designed.
Weaknesses: Lecture could be several minutes shorter if story-time digressions and personal anecdotes were cut. Lectures are long enough (they're cute and funny, but I need to know how long they *actually* are so I can budget my time). <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think this was a great course! The format allowed me to practice while also moving at a pace that worked for me. The flexibility of the asynchronous lectures meant that I could balance my workload around my other courses. Also, JDRS knows his stuff and was adept t spelling out these concepts. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think that a strength of this class is the amount of office hours held. It was amazing to know that anytime I had problems or questions, more than likely I would be able to find a time in the day to attend office hours. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This is a really good class. I think it was suited really well to the virtual format, and I would encourage Professor Reuning-Scherer to keep many of the virtual aspects of this class in place moving forward. <br/></div>

The pacing of the course is also very well designed to facilitate learning. There is enough time to go to office hours or review concepts before psets, quizzes, and exams.
Weaknesses: None. Make sure to take advantage of office hours, though. Without them, especially in this virtual environment, this course can feel very disconnected. <br/></div>

Weaknesses: during the second half of the class, the TAs' office hour times were unreliable (there were several times when some TAs canceled their slot with no announcement or just minutes before it was supposed to begin, which was frustrating); I also felt like there could have been a bit more communication between JDRS and the TAs (sometimes when students would ask questions about grading or exam format at office hours, TAs would speculate or even give conflicting answers, which then caused a bit of tension on piazza during the final weeks) <br/></div>

I think there were plenty of options to get help in the course - there was basically office hours every single day. I took advantage of this and it really helped my grade. The one weakness I would say is Minitab. I really don't think using Minitab is useful - maybe teaching us R would help us more in the future. When I asked other friends who took Statistics before at other schools or in high school what Minitab was, they had no idea what it was. I don't really think it is useful, so that's probably one thing I would change. <br/></div>

At the end of the recorded lectures, he'd add in clips of his talented family members playing instruments or singing, and it always brightened my day! JDRS is the only stem professor I've met who actually cares about his students succeeding and doesn't try to pit students against each other. He was open to answering any questions during office hours and his explanations were super helpful. You could also go to the TAs' office hours. The review sessions were also helpful. However, I do wish that we could have had more practice problems/review sessions in between exams. The amount of information was a bit overwhelming at times and the conceptual stuff was hard to grasp. I wish we had been able to have more practice problems and maybe review sessions for the harder conceptual stuff. But the grading distribution makes it so that exams aren't that stressful, which was really nice! <br/></div>

There were office hours almost every day multiple times a day so lots of opportunities for extra help on psets etc. I appreciate that we could go at our own pace with the canvas quizzes (could subrmit whenever).
Also the teaching staff are SO generous and accommodating, always gave extensions/forgave slightly late psets if you just ask. Just communicate and it will work out.  
Open book exams with very generous time limits.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course is well-structured, and JDRS is very passionate and engaging. There are office hours throughout the week, offering support whenever you might get stuck on a problem. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor JRS is the strength and light of this class. He is an engaging and dynamic lecturer, even online, and is able to summarize, repeat, and convey information unlike many of the most talented scholars at Yale. I don't mean this as an exaggeration. It is difficult to teach and it is even more difficult to teach an introductory course over recorded lecture to many non-Statistics inclined students. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: JDRS and record lectures.
Weakness: Can't think of anything really big, other than that one or both of the midterms will probably be challenging! <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the assistants were extremely helpful as I struggled with the class in the all virtual, recorded lecture class format. JDRS creates videos that are both entertaining and insightful. 

Weakness: difficult to meet classmates and talk with them about material we were learning. This is a class that I regret taking online and wish that I had done in person. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: This course was a perfect asynchronous class to take during the remote semester because you could develop your own schedule to complete each of the modules, which helped me since I worked usually during typical work hours. Having no due date on the quizzes was a plus, and still having dates for each module helped me stay on task. The lectures themselves where the biggest strength, always going into perfect depth, and even adding light and fun skits towards the end to make remote learning less stressful. I loved this course so much!

Weaknesses: At times, lectures for the day would go above the typical 1 hr, 15 min limit, but it was made up with a few other lectures going below the limit. Some of the only ways to get help on homework was to go to the office hours, and I had trouble attending them because my schedule wouldn't allow for much flexibility. In all, there were still many opportunities to excel in the course and receive feedback. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: plenty of office hours, understandable lectures/good teaching, consistent feedback

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course offered a lot of supports to students, including very frequent office hours, review materials and options to have assignments re-graded. This may not be a weakness, but it is important to note that the examinations are much more like the quizzes than the problem sets, and the problem sets are as much a lesson in using data sets and graphing tools as they are a lesson in the statistics themselves. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â No weaknesses - as someone who would normally hate statistics, I have to say this class is amazing!!!! JDRS is absolutely incredible and he genuinely does the impossible in making a class like this (for someone like me) super engaging and interesting!!! <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The recorded lectures were easy to follow with clear examples and explanations. However, problems on the homework sometimes seemed to be only loosely based on the lecture, and you needed to attend office hours to be able to figure them out. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths of the course are the quality of the recorded lectures as well as assistance of all of the TAs. I also really liked the weekly quizzes that were low-stakes because it allowed me to see how much I was actually learning from the lectures. <br/></div>
