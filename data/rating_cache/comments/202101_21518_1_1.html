<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The professor generally does a pretty good job explaining , although sometimes he can sound a little confusing. The psets are pretty interesting and helpful with understanding.
Weaknesses: I think the course was a bit rushed towards the end. The professor tried to get through too much material, so we ended up not having enough time to actually understand the materials before moving on. He also had to upload multiple addendums to better explain the material we could not get to in lecture, which sometimes made things more confusing. Also, it would be great if the professor can do a better job at explaining the purpose/goal of the material before we get into it. Sometimes it feels like I'm just copying down whatever theorem/proposition he puts down without knowing how it would lead to anything useful. (Also just a note, having the exam worth 40% was a bit concerning...) <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of this course is probably the support provided by the peer tutors. 

This course had many weaknesses. First, the course was poorly laid out throughout the semesterwe spent over half of the semester going over minutiae and then had to rush through 4 chapters of the book without much time to process. Second, the discussion sections were of little help, since it was difficult to follow the graduate student's train of thought. This is also usual with the main instructorthey both tended to overcomplicate things, and I believe it is why we didn't get to learn more practical and essential aspects of linear algebra. I feel that we were thrown with a thousand theorems and definitions disconnected from the broader picture in math, let alone in other subjects. Finally, the final exam was in a format very different from what we practiced throughout the semester, a situation that added unnecessary stress to a complicated semester. I don't understand what's the point of memorizing over 170 minor theorems and their proofs. Is memorizing helpful for understanding? No. Will students remember even 20% of those theorems one week after the exam? No.

Oh, I forgot. The feedback on our PSets after mid-semester stopped coming until a very short time before the final. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was quite confusing. I found that we rushed through a lot of things and didn't have proper motivation/justification for what we were doing. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the theory was solid, though I would have liked a little more on the application side (even though this is not 222) as we discussed not so many applications (could mention these applications in psets maybe) <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course does a great job of teaching linear algebra but I wish it was more explicit about teaching how to write proofs. Like, I still don't even know if I can write a 'proper' proofs or not because we never talked about what a proper proof was. I definitely fell like I've developed some intuition, but I honestly still feel iffy about proofs in general. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: there were a lot of resources in this course (office hours primarily) that made it difficult to "fail" this course and also some addendums on certain topics that filled in blanks. I found that doing proofs in class often inspired "aha!" moments which were really insightful. Also, I found the way that the professor explained concepts very clear. Whenever I struggled to recall a concept I'd written in my notes, I'd go back and watch the lecture to hear how he explained it. I liked how the professor tried his best to engage student suggestions and answers during a lecture too.
Weaknesses: this class felt a little depersonalized to me. I didn't feel like I had built a strong community among the students taking this course, other than appreciating the ULAs and instructors for all their work. For me, this is something I attribute mainly to COVID-era learning, but it made this course much harder. I also often struggled to actually do computational problems even though I understood the concepts, and I found that my TA session notes were often not very organized and helpful. Honestly, I think the second half of this course was tougher for me than the first half, and it felt like it went a little faster. My only other remark is that I sometimes felt that the professor assumed we knew more about notation/linear algebra than I actually did (I can't speak for others). My other classes used GradeScope and I would have preferred to have all my course submissions method be the same (I think GradeScope is often easier?) but the Ed Discussion was really well maintained. Overall, strengths outweigh weaknesses but this was a rewarding, albeit challenging course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I'd say that the strength of this course was its comprehensiveness, and how the course was very thorough in making sure that every claim lied upon axioms or previously established theorems. The homework was also very challenging, but at the same time rewarding. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Or, the professor, is a new professor at Yale this year, but did a great job teaching the course. He and his lectures were very organized and I really liked the content that was taught. This was my first proof-based class, but I felt I picked it up fast. 
Weaknesses: The lectures were not too interactive, hence most kids watched the recorded lecture afterwards. I didn't mind this, but some students may prefer more breakout rooms, etc.
Mix: The problem sets were graded relatively easily so that helps your grade. They were not picky about the very specific parts of the proof and were more concerned with if you understood the overall logic. However on the midterm, the grading was very specific, which was something we were not expecting/prepared for, but Or curved it so it was okay. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think it was great that the professor would write the proofs in class and work through them instead of just talking about them. What would be very useful is if there was more time at the beginning of the class to really understand proofs and proof-writing since this is the first exposure for many people. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures and problem sets provided excellent motivation for learning the concepts; the Psets in particular were well-cultivated and provided intellectual challenges that cemented my understanding. The exams, however, were a bit of an uneven experience: the first exam had a rather bizarre format of being a 32-hour take home exam and ended up yielding a remarkably low average; I do appreciate, though, that the instructor took this into account and curved the exam. The final was a totally different format, which made everyone very nervous, but it was actually much easier than the midterm (very much appreciated!) Overall, the exam experience wasn't too bad, I think I just would have liked more clarity in what our expectations should have been for each in terms of format and content. Finally, it felt like the pacing of the course was a bit off, as we ended up very rushed at the end, not being able to get more than a cursory glimpse of the last few concepts. Overall, though, I thought it was a great course! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course does a good job at getting you used to writing proofs and thinking in a proof-oriented way. It could have been better at teaching how the proofs we learned applied to a more computational setting. In that sense, I would have liked a few more computational examples in class or as some supplemental material outside of confusing TA sessions. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Landesberg spent the entirety of the class proving from definitions--he offered no geometric or conceptual explanations for topics that would have made them more intuitive. As a result, the class was not engaging and hard to follow. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was taxing beyond belief. The weakness of the course is the lack of help. The material is extremely hard, and our resources were very limited. Reading a textbook about math is not a proper addition to learning the material, as if you cannot understand it through a professor, reading about it will not help. Office hours were useless with TAs. Not because they were bad, but because students would simply hound them for their own needs, and so it was impossible for them to get to everyone's questions. Bottom line, more TAs were needed. Math 120 had multiple teachers and far more TAs in addition to Ximera. Unfortunately, this class only had one professor who was not amazing in regards to returning emails promptly and only two TAs. It was not enough for this type of course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course include allowing students to drop their 2 lowest pset grades and allowing for late submission on 2 psets, and having the lectures recorded - mostly the structural things about the course. 

The weaknesses of the course center on how lectures are taught and the decisions made in how to communicate concepts. I did not find the teaching style of the professor to be particularly helpful - in particular, the lecture format involved little to no imagery and handwritten notes. Outside online resources taught me most of what I know conceptually, and helped me visualize and convince myself of things we only discussed abstractly in the course. Much of the teaching style was based on definitions and building upon those definitions to come to a conclusion in the proofs, but I can't say I understood the intuition behind the proofs. The class was a bit frustrating in this way. Especially if you are someone who has a surface level familiarity with mathematical notation, since that was a large part of proof writing and something lightly touched upon at the beginning of the course. I don't think the course had to be as confusing as it was, and highly recommend that if you take this course, to find a resource outside that you understand well.

In terms of learning how to write proofs, I think the course could do so much better. As someone who never took a proof writing course before, I did not have an idea of what a proof could look like, and what it would require. I think it would be helpful to future students for the instructor to spend time at the beginning of the course outlining what a proof is, and giving different examples of proofs. While I understand that much of learning how to write proofs comes by practicing, without an idea of what different forms proofs can take, practice isn't particularly useful, and there is an unnecessary amount of self teaching on the basics of proof writing that must occur.

Lastly, I'm not sure if this was just a result of the pandemic, but the response time for grading psets was very slow (at one point the past 4 psets hadn't been graded). That is something that could be improved. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think there could have been more one on one instruction between teacher and student, and the psets could have corresponded more to the tests. I thought the professor was very friendly and open to questions, but I do think that grading policies could have been more clear throughout. <br/></div>
