<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The support from the instructor/TAs/Peer Tutors was fantastic and the camaraderie amongst the students was a defining feature of the course. I always felt like I could get help 24/7 because of resources like Piazza as well as my fellow classmates. Despite the difficulty of the class, it is entirely doable for anyone who is willing to put the effort in. 

The only possible weakness of the course is the occasionally ambiguous structure. We jumped around from topic to topic and it was fun at times, but very difficult to follow at others. This also could be due to the difficulty of the material, so this "weakness" should probably be taken with a grain of salt. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was exactly as advertised. It is a proof based math course with a ton of work. Strengths: interesting work for those who are genuinely interested in math. Weaknesses: quick paced <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Pat is great. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the course was well organized and the psets reflected the topics we were learning in class. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: interesting material, great professor.

Weaknesses: I personally wish there was more of an emphasis on problem-solving and general techniques for mathematical problem-solving. Also, I wish Pat spent a little bit more time discussing the "intuition" behind the abstract concepts we discuss. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The main strength of this class is its professor. Pat made an introductory math class that could have been discouraging and alienating into one of the most welcoming communities I've found at Yale. The problem sets were challenging but never impossible, and collaboration was encouraged. The lectures were well-paced and enjoyable, including a mix of definition/theorem/example lecturing, breakout-room work, and discussion about *why* whatever we were learning was defined the way that it was (giving us intuition, instead of just feeding facts). There was also an incredible amount of support -- office hours, Piazza, TAs, occasional posted solutions, recorded lectures, posted notes from the lectures. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A weakness of the course is that, even with Pat trying his best to combat it, imposter syndrome was very high. Many students dropped out of the course and it was easy to feel disheartened. In addition, finding in-person study partners was difficult. While some people were very warm, others remained aloof. A strength of this course was Pat's teaching and the many office hours. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Pat is a really great professor, and there are always resources (office hours, study groups, etc.) if you need them. Some of the proofs are really interesting, and it's super satisfying when you figure them out.
Weaknesses: Everything is extremely theoretical, so if you don't already have a strong math background, some of the concepts can get kind of confusing. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is a LOT of work, but that's mostly a strength. You will end up spending about 15 hours a week on psets, but this means the content of the course sticks in your brain extremely well afterwards. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Pat is one of the biggest strengths of this course. He is passionate about math and genuine in his hope for everyone to enjoy math as much as he does. The course content is extremely helpful in developing skills in quantitative reasoning. The workload is heavy but they helps a lot in clarifying concepts we learn in the class. Sometimes I start the sets being clueless but by the end of it everything makes sense. The course and the assignments (and even the exams) are carefully designed such that things click step by step. It's extremely satisfying to see that everything makes sense in the end. If this class has any weakness it's probably the level of difficulty and workload (which really isn't a weakness since anyone who wants to take the course should be prepared for them). <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: a) Pat. Hes an engaging lecturer, and makes you excited about even the most routine concepts in math. b) The 15+ hr/wk psets. As much pain as they give rise to, they help build some unbreakable friendships and result in the most euphoric highs when you finish them. Theyre also artfully constructed, so that each result elegantly draws on previous ones, and by the end of the course, you feel like youve really proved all of analysis yourself.
Weaknesses: While this course is titled Vector Calculus &amp; Linear Algebra, you wont learn any procedural methods from either discipline; rather, the course is focused on proofs (almost exclusively). <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Pat and the TAs are great and super supportive. The content is interesting and the grading is fair. I think there could have been more feedback/emphasis on good proof-writing techniques. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths:
Begins with foundational concepts and builds up -- it never feels like an idea "came out of nowhere"
Problem sets (everything about them -- question types, number of questions, difficulty, etc.)
In-class lectures moved at a good pace

Weaknesses:
I feel like the ordering of the material could be rearranged a bit to make it easier to absorb, but the general structure and ordering I liked a lot <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths were that it taught me a lot of logic throughout the course.
The weaknesses were that since there was not a lot of time for the lectures, the professor tended to rush a little bit. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â To be perfectly honest, I learned more from the problem sets themselves than from anything else. I think much of the learning done in this course is self-motivated. Obviously, the lectures cover necessary material (and are really engaging), but it's the individual work that forced me to reexamine how I approach math problems.

And the feedback on problem sets is insanely specific - these comments in particular helped me improve my proof-writing skills. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course is very engaging and well organized, and it was overall a very enjoyable experience. The office hours are also very helpful with lots of time slots available. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Pat Devlin is a genuinely amazing instructor. He really succeeds at fostering a sense of community. The class feels less like a normal intro stem course and instead like an intensive but gentle boot camp for people who are all interested in math. He also really emphasizes creativity in math and people engaging with math outside of the curriculum. I've also been impressed by the detail and clarity of feedback I've received on psets.

I'm glad there's not a textbook -- it would kill the spirit of math 230 -- but I often wished there was a more central, organized place to review what we've covered. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This is an excellent course, probably the best I took this semester. Strengths: Pat's an incredible professor and person. He's really good at explaining concepts and making the course interesting and interactive even in a virtual format. He put in a great effort to have us form study groups and work with each other, which was awesome. He was also really helpful and understanding with deadlines/exams, and made things less stressful during a crazy year, which I really appreciated. The TA's were also really helpful.  The workload was pretty manageable and rewarding, and honestly not as hard as people describe it to be. I  can't find any weaknesses. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The PSETS for this course were incredibly interesting and engaging, and I think that's where I grew the most. It could've been useful to have more time in class spent doing example proofs that were more like the PSET problems -- we often proved theorems and statements stated in class and there was a great deal of time spent on proofs, but a little more could have helped. Also, the midterms were very, very long -- each one would contain a three-hour timed exam on top of a pset-type untimed exam (which could take many hours). These could pile up and be overwhelming in the middle of the course, although I definitely learned a lot from them. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Pat and the PL's create a class where collaboration is welcome. Office hours are numerous and there are several check in's and attempts by Pat to make sure people that want others to work with can try to find those people. I was fortunate to form a pset group early on in my residential college, and most of us met to work together almost every week for the rest of the semester. The psets are such that you can do the pset yourself, but it becomes even more enjoyable and manageable if you discuss and work on the questions with others. 

Submissions are all via gradescope, and comments are generally specific and informative, so it's easy to see what exactly you did wrong or what you did well.

The class also uses a Piazza page that is very active. Responses by students, PF's, and Pat are pretty substantive and often include links or their proofs of results to answer the question.

Finally, I note that a majority of the learning is done outside of class. In class, you get important definitions, theorems (proved and left to prove), and some example problems that are useful as reference. The learning took place when you were stuck on a deceiving problem and were forced to try different strategies. This, however, is necessary to gain math intuition. It was almost always worth it to figure out a proofand sometimes, to confidently catch all the special cases.

Weaknesses: It is a large time commitment with long, weekly psets. For most, in addition to solving the problems you also have to type up/rewrite your answers to be more clean. Still, we got two homework extensions, our lowest pset was dropped, and Pat was understanding about special circumstances. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It definitely had a lot of workloads, but I think all of them were necessary (and even fun) to teach us the concepts. Also, although the psets were challenging, there was more than enough help from the professor and the TAs. 

As for the weakness, I think there were some people who did not have any partners to work on problems together. Perhaps next semester or in future classes this component can be improved (especially for online classes). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course's strength was helping students discover the material for themselves through proofs. However, this was also a weakness, as it meant that less of the material was covered in class. <br/></div>

Material is very interesting. Doing proofs is also very satisfying. Community is definitely a plus too - study groups are highly encouraged, and you can bond through working on problem sets. 
Weaknesses: workload is very high. Extraordinarily so. Problem sets require a lot of thinking. <br/></div>

The lectures were clear and well-prepared, and the problem sets and exams were excellently designed to both further the concepts covered in class, as well as present new ideas for self-exploration. Collaboration was encouraged, and plenty of office hours were made available each week. Google forms were sent out a few times during the semester to ask for student feedback on the organization of the course. I did not feel that the course had any particular weaknesses. <br/></div>

Further, the midterms/final had clear links to topics covered in class. My one comment is that the speed of grading lagged a little bit near the end of the semester, so by the time the final rolled around, I didn't have feedback on my second midterm or on my final assignment that I could use to study/improve. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths
- Proof-based math: it's just so much fun, and it makes math feel more like a creative and analytical exercise than the monotony of mechanical computations and memorization
- Problem sets: I loved how the problem sets all interrelate and how we can use stuff we proved already to prove more stuff! Also, the TA's are really helpful in giving guided hints if you get stuck on a problem.
- Exams emphasize understanding rather than speed
Weakness
- Lack of a textbook: for the most part this isn't a problem since Pat explains concepts clearly and often provides some optional readings, but I still think it would be nice to have one not just as further treatment of a specific topic but also as a kind of roadmap for the course (since we do jump around a lot) <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength was the enthusiasm Pat had towards math -- it was almost contagious. I appreciated that a lot. It also assumed very little *actual* math knowledge -- technically someone who has only taken Calc 1 could take this course, although it was far more common to have taken more math than that.
The weakness of this course during covid-19 was the lack of engagement between classmates during lecture. Also, it is easy to feel like an imposter in this class -- some things that are very challenging to you can seem like second nature to others, and that can be really discouraging for someone who used to have confidence in math. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of this course is the cumulative progression of the material. In most classes, material that the instructor introduces at tthee beginning of the semester becomes obselete by the end. However, I felt that I continued to develop my understanding of the topics from the first two weeks throughout the semester, and this focus was necessary to build into ever more complex and abstracted realms. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The focus on writing proofs is central to this class. Think 75% proofs and 25% content. I started this semester having never experienced proof-based math before and am now confident in my ability to write them. Math 230 is a fantastic introduction to higher level math. With that said, this class is incredibly challenging! The weekly PSET dominated my schedule, and I had to put in significantly more time than the quoted 20 hour average. Going to TA office hours and making friends in the class is life saving! Math 230 has an excellent community in which you can find others to collaborate with. There was an abundance of kindness and friendship found in mutual suffering. Pat is very kind and helpful, but also, relatively chaotic (the class does not follow a book but rather is an amalgamation of topics, which can be overwhelming at times). He provided great, detailed feedback and was readily available to help. I ultimately learned a lot of math this semester and am glad I kept at it. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Maybe if we had more office hours? Sometimes it felt like I couldn't review my past psets or midterms since I was so focused on doing that week's pset <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths are that Pat is awesome, and you will find a new appreciation for mathematics if you take this course. Furthermore, it's extremely flexibly taught, with lectures and notes posted online and extensions available for Psets. Although its weakness could be considered a high workload, I actually found it more manageable than other classes with lower time requirements, because the flexibility lets you complete the work whenever you have time. However, it is not so flexible as to be easy to fall behind. Overall, I highly recommend despite the necessary time commitment. You just find a free day when you and your study group have time, and get the work done, and if something comes up, you use an extension. And you finish with a better understanding of the world of math and a lot of practice at thinking hard. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think Pat is a great teacher. He is really good at teaching you how to figure out and write a proof, which is really hard to teach.

I want to emphasize that this course does NOT cover the same stuff as MATH 120. That was made pretty clear to me, but I don't think I got a good grasp on what I would need the stuff in 120 for vs. what I need the stuff in this class for. I still don't have a good understanding of that. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â 230 was an amazing course, easily the best Ive ever taken. Pats lectures were fun and easy to follow over zoom, but also packed a lot of information (although I think the pace could have been fasterin the manifolds unit in particular, we could have used fewer examples and more walked-through proofs of theorems). Psets were amazingly fun, and exams were exactly the right balance of chill and challenging. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the main strength of this course was definitely the professor. Prof Devlin definitely made this class a lot easier to understand and was very helpful. Apart from him, the notes and lectures were also structured quite well. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course has no weaknesses. The strengths are the material, Pat's clear teaching style, tons of office hours and wise TAs, and lots of resources available to students. Pat is the single greatest strength of this course. Aside from his clear lectures, supplementary notes, and office hours, Pat also fosters a welcoming and collaborative environment that encourages creativity  and makes math approachable for all students. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is perfect. It highlights proof based methods in a work intensive style covering both vector calculus and linear algebra. The difficulty was made easier through the collaborative environment fostered through the classroom and various office hours/peer tutoring sessions as well as efforts to connect students to local study groups. <br/></div>
