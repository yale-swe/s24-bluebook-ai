<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think better planned code examples would benefit the course greatly. Often times the teacher would deviate from what was pre-planned which often led to a lot of dead time as he worked through issues. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: Good to know OOP so basically the subject of the class is good 
Weakness: Because it was Barron's first time teaching this class and first time at Yale, I think there were a lot of rough patches along the way in terms of timing of the class material. It really ramped up in the last 4 weeks of class (around Thanksgiving) and it was really stressful. It was fine before then until this course took a sharp turn that became a headache. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professor managed time very poorly. We had assignments that can be done in less than 2 days and were given at least two weeks at the beginning of the semester. Then we had an entire month with no assignments. All of a sudden two weeks before reading period we get two rather large assignments that is not trivial to implement all also within a two week period. 

The form of submission can also be improved. Gradescope is good for written submissions, however for code, I is definitely much easier to submit it over the zoo. I do not know why we still dont have a class folder in the zoo after being one full semester. Yes, we did get test cases for the later assignments, but those test cases falls into two categories. They are either so trivial that almost everyone will pass them if they tried to implement the assignment or you fail the test case and all you see is some error code. That is not helpful for debugging at all even if its public test cases. The public test cases are also released very late in respect to the assignment due date. This is because we get those test cases literally one day before or even the day of the due date of the assignment. This does not help for students trying to start on the assignment early. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: lecture quizzes (!!!) this was the only class I had that had a graded quiz after every lecture, and consequently was the only class I was never behind in because I actually had to watch the lectures. I definitely found the course content super useful. It actually teaches useful things you need to know as a software engineer (barely any Yale CS classes do this)
weaknesses: lectures were pretty dry and not engaging. Also I thought that there was a huge jump in the difficulty of psets (specifically pset 4, which we had to work on during Thanksgiving break) that left students really frustrated <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weaknesses: some of the homework assignments were offered late. Strength: the assignments were effective in getting me to practice object oriented programming. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course is built to facilitate learning well from lecture to lecture-- the problem is that the amount of material and the complexity associated with it is unevenly distributed between the first half of the course and the second. The first half of the course was mainly dedicated to basic ideas associated with OOP, relationships between objects, use cases, and then furthering our understanding of those basics in addition to some examples in python (e.g. pytest). The second half of the course then goes into the deep end, going over tens of unique design patterns and then assigning us large projects where we design and build a system using what we've learned thus far. While the projects and material in the second half of the course makes sense, it's just somewhat disorienting when an assignment takes more time than all the ones from the first half of the course combined. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths  Prof Barron is one of the younger professors in the cs department and his industry knowledge really distinguishes him from the other, more academia-focused ones. In this sense, he's a lot more relatable for the large subset of students wanting to work in industry instead of higher education and research. He brings a lot of interesting security knowledge and background while adhering to object oriented class content. The psets were also pretty fair and engaging, and a good reflection of the principles we learned in class. The final, which was open book, was also rather easy and fair as well. The public tests were really helpful with testing code without giving away all of the private tests. 

Weaknesses  Overall, the deadlines and assignments felt rather disorganized. While Prof Barron let us know which assignments were expected, assignments or files or deadlines or quizzes wouldn't be uploaded in a timely manner (as in, multiple days late), causing it to be rather difficult to keep up with the class. Communication also at times was spotty. Furthermore, synchronous lectures did get rather long with lots of pauses and tangents, and I think that condensed asynchronous lectures, like other classes have done, would have been a better solution to delivering content. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: loved the practical approach to writing code, as opposed to the theory I normally get from CS courses. though content was repetitive at times, it was MUCH more approachable than other CS classes.

Weaknesses: could get repetitive at times <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I found the live coding sessions and the live demonstrations and real-time explanations of the actual code involved in implementing design patterns to be really useful. I'm really glad Prof. Barron decided to do live demonstrations in an IDE instead of slides filled with lines of code. The psets are also a strength. They're a great opportunity to solidify learning. A weakness of the course is the crazy increase in difficulty of the psets. The first three were pretty easy but the last two were much more difficult. The spacing and workload of each of the psets felt really unbalanced, to the point where we had to work during Thanksgiving break to finish an assignment due two days before Thanksgiving because of our professor's awful timing. There were several days where we had just turned in an assignment and had no idea when the next one was going to be released or be due, which made it difficult to plan around this course if you have other serious commitments. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength of this course is that it was able to inform students about various object-oriented techniques. One weakness was that assignment descriptions would be updated part-way through the assigned (and sometimes close to the deadline) which was tough because I would allocate time for this class early on, but have to put in additional work without being able to plan for it. The test cases were also not up for most of the time that some of the assignments were  live which made it increasingly difficult to complete assignments ahead of time. The pacing of the assignments was also very uneven as some of the earlier assignments that were short and simple would be given two to three weeks whereas we had a large assignment that was due in two weeks and it was over the duration where on-campus students had to pack up all of their belongings and move out thus it was poorly timed. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Good overview of topics

The C++ stuff at the end of the course felt tacked on and not very helpful. Seeing more practical examples of OOP being used in industry would've been better imo <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures were informative and the problem sets helped in cementing understanding in class concepts and were pretty fun! A better organization of the course would be helpful in balancing the workload of the problem sets admittedly, since the last two problem sets took twice or thrice as much time as the first three. It would be useful to see more examples of refactoring specifically, for instance, more examples where the professor refactors non-object-oriented code  would help cement concepts better as well. The grading took some time so it was hard to keep track of how I was doing in the class at times. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The problem sets were well written so that they connected with the material that we learned and the code we saw in lectures. However, the problem sets would be improved if they were assigned sooner after we finished a topic. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course has good content but the difficulty curve made no sense. It was way too easy at the start and too little work was assigned, giving everyone a false sense of security. The professor probably realized everyone was doing way too well and decided to screw us over with much harder psets at the end of the course when everyone was busy with other final projects and assignments. Cheap move and it didnt reflect well at all on Barrons teaching skills. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was well set up for learning. Professor Barron is a very clear lecturer. 
The only weakness was the timing of homeworks/ exams. It should be determined before the semester. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths are that the quizzes for each week of lectures are pretty easy but keep you on top of the material, the problem sets are generally less intensive than those for the core CS courses, and python is more forgiving than C or C++. The weaknesses are that grades in the second half of the semester were a bit delayed for awhile, and also sometimes necessary clarifications on the specs for the problem sets were decided kind of last minute on piazza and affected the code you wrote, so you would sometimes have to make some last minute changes to your code. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I enjoyed the flexibility with the recorded live lectures. However, it was difficult to stay engaged with the lecture material, as most of the second semester was simply going over design patterns, and other topics like concurrency and C++ were seeming crammed at the end. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought it was an excellent course. The concepts were a lot more industry-focused unlike other CS courses at Yale that seem more theoretical. Definitely the most practical CS course I've taken. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was altered this semester to use Python rather than C++, which I think afforded more time to focus on principles rather than implementation details.  Unfortunately, a great deal of lecture was still spent looking through code, which I did not find particularly engaging. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course does do a good job of teaching object-oriented design, which is a useful skill to have for anyone studying CS in general. It also introduced testing (unittest and pytest), which is also cool. However, the course is far too disorganized in its current statethe Professor didnt seem to have a clear idea of what he wanted the assignments to be beforehand, and the pacing of the class was extremely mismanaged. For context, we had 3 assignments in the first 2.5 months of the class, each of which could be done in a day or two. However, we then had 2 final assignments due in the last 3 weeks of classes, which were extremely more in-depth and time-consuming (we had to build chess and checkers). Furthermore, we were never given feedback on these assignments until after both were due, which wasnt particularly helpful. Automated test scripts often also werent prepared until shortly before the assignment due dates, which made it frustrating / impossible to complete the assignments ahead of time. <br/></div>
