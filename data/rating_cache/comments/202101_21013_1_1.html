<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is amazing and solidified my interest in economics. I think that this is the best course at Yale in terms of its organization and structure, which can be attributed to Dr. Hawkins. I love the use of Ed for questions and the lecture summaries are very helpful. I don't have any weaknesses. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures are interesting and engaging. 75 minutes is a bit too long to sit on Zoom, which they tried to deal with. The review sessions were insanely helpful and set me up very well for the exams. The problem sets were a bit too complicated for me, especially considering I did much better on the exams. Maybe that's by design, but I struggled with them. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â - Lectures are run by one professor but all the important stuff (psets, midterm, final) is run by hawkins. therefore material you need to know and material that is interesting is hard to tell apart, you have to sift through all of the nonessential stuff.

 - Midterms and finals are structured so that you can guess the answers correctly, but students who study hard are very likely to confuse themselves on the exam. Therefore all of the grades are clustered in the center, with the Econ curve and luck essentially determining your final grade. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course excels when it comes to ease of learning though the large class size made student engagement difficult. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The problem set and exam questions are rather ambiguous and it seems by design. I would prefer to be tested on the application of what I know rather than my comprehension of intendedly ambiguous questions. If that means making the questions even harder that is fine. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the lectures incorporated funny asides and stories that made me want to go to them live. This was an incredibly organized course (go Dr. Hawkins) and I felt like the overall pacing of material was perfect. The one-page lecture summaries and Ed discussion threads on what to study for exams were definitely my favorite parts. I wish I had those in every class. The course emphasized applications of earlier concepts with more recent ones at times, and although it was hard for me to do that at first, I've definitely gotten a better understanding of the macroeconomy. Also, I really liked the PSet structure!  I liked the questions where we had to go to a site/article and then synthesize the lecture content with the new info. Another small plus was how I never had to assign questions to pages on Gradescope; I loved that. My discussion section TF was great and super patient. There were so many resources in this course that even when I was struggling, it was relieving to know that I could go to an office hours and have it figured out within a day or so. Even if I didn't go to an office hours, the TFs and Dr. Hawkins were extremely on top of the Ed discussion so I felt super supported 24/7.
Weaknesses: It was really hard to keep up with notetaking during the lectures. I'm not sure if the slides were text-heavy, I was a slow writer, or if the speed was just a little too fast for me, but I often had to go back and fill in parts of the notes after lecture. Maybe this was a ploy to get me to review the content again though because it certainly reinforced my understanding. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One of the strengths was the duo of Tsyvinski and Hawkins!! Hawkins made the admin side of the class very efficient, and Tsyvinski was a super engaging lecturer, plus the two of them would often go on tangents (often relating to Belarus vs. Australia) that kept the class entertaining even when the content wasn't as interesting. Another strength was that the slides were posted to canvas, and after each lecture there was a 'summary' pdf that basically condensed the content into what you needed to know for exams, which was very helpful. Ed was a good resource, and there was also a textbook that was written for the class that had information (but I didn't really use it that much). Peer tutor office hours were really helpful; TFs were sometimes less helpful in the OH. Lastly, I thought the course did a good job assuming minimal economic background (also it rarely referred to material in intro micro). <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of this course is most definitely its teacher and course director. If you are able to take this course with professors Tsyvinski and Hawkins, please do. They were entertaining as well as incredibly insightful into the subject they were teaching. The course material and additional resources are very accessible and well organized. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The professors are great lecturers-- fnny and engaging. When they could, they put in interesting content that relates to our everyday life (ie. COVID-19, climate change, work gender barriers, trade networks, life hacks, etc.). 

Weaknesses: It is an intro course so by nature it is a bit dull at times (second half of the semester). Also, because of COVID-19, the exams were excruciatingly and unnecessarily difficult. Regular years it is not that bad, but virtually, it is a stressful lecture to take. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Aleh's great, and Hawkins is great. I wish, however, that lectures were a bit slower and more concise. It feels like often we see data that really isn't needed and then that time is spent, so a lot of the important concepts are just blown by rather quickly. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â STRENGTHS: Prof Tsyvinski and Hawkins are really invested in the material and excited to answer students' questions, TAs are very helpful, there are tons of office hours and peer tutor hours, the material is organized well, grading is fair, assignments are clear

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Fun professors and friendly and helpful TA's , GREAT Ed Discussion utilisation (thought that was SUPER helpful), lecture summaries for every lecture were great to help us study.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Dr. Hawkins is undoubtedly one of the finest instructors I have ever had. He gives incredibly precise, thorough, and useful explanations, and meticulously managed the virtual classroom. He is a fantastic instructor, and should, in my opinion, teach the course himself.

Professor Tsyvinski is also great, funny, and a good instructor. He is a good fit to teach this big course, but he could also do well teaching intermediate macroeconomics, perhaps, and have Dr. Hawkins teach this course (this is mostly a reflection of how highly I think of Dr. Hawkins).

There are many resources available to students to learn, and although the class is certainly foundational, you come away from it feeling like you understand the world better. It's a great class to take.

Things to improve: Canvas quizzes are a bit clunky, and I didn't like breakout rooms for sections very much. Also, there were rumors of many students cheating on tests because of the unproctored, online exams. This was frustrating. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The one frustrating weakness is the inconsistency in the true/false questions. Most of the time, some reasonable assumptions are required to interpret the question, but other times, the question assumes that you don't make additional assumptions (because the answer is supposed to be false because it is excessively general). This could be helped by being more clear about what sorts of assumptions are appropriate to make for these questions. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think that having a combination of discussion sections and weekly live lectures was the way to go with this class. It gives us a chance to ask more questions and go over specific topics we may not have fully understood in lecture. One thing I wish could have been done is I wish the discussion sections should be mandatory. This is because sometimes, I wouldn't have the motivation to go (as bad as that sounds, I was burnt out sometimes).

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: DR. HAWKINS. This was by far the most organized, structured course that I have ever taken at Yale, and it was such a tremendous help to our learning throughout the semester. Every single professor and course in the economics department has something to learn from the way ECON 116 is taught; it was a stark difference from taking ECON 115 in the fall. The content is also highly engaging, and Professor Tsyvinski makes an effort to balance fundamental concepts with interesting applications such as cryptocurrency, climate change, and the COVID-19 crisis through an economic lens. The inside jokes that are developed throughout the semester also made each lecture a thrill to watch. Dr. Hawkins and Professor Tsyvinski are the strangest Australian-Belarusian economists duo that you could possibly imagine, but it worked out effectively, amazingly, and hilariously.

Weaknesses: A couple, but not enough dog appearances. Asking questions on Ed was also a bit intimidating and discouraging due to the way Dr. Hawkins responds to students, but nonetheless helpful. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Overall, ECON 116 was a well-designed course that gave students essential skills for understanding and analyzing the macroeconomy. However, one of the challenges of this course was that it was all very conceptual and felt a bit hand-wavy at times, and it was hard for me to feel sure about my own analysis. This course may seem easy at first, but I quickly came to realize that I had to have a very thorough understanding of a lot of minute details in order to do well on the exams/p-sets. I wouldn't say that was a weakness of the course, but just be prepared for more conceptually challenging material compared to ECON 115. <br/></div>

The TA sessions were incredibly organized and helpful, as I am sure all of the TAs had the same clear session plans organized for them. The midterms were fair, as it tested information clearly taught in the course. Despite it being a huge lecture, grades were posted promptly after examination and questions were answered promptly through Ed Discussion post or through the TAs.

The usage of Ed site is a big strength, as it allowed students to post questions and have them answered quite quickly. 

The weaknesses of this course were the Canvas exams. The main difficulty with them was the way the questions were graded - if one of your answer choices (out of 3, for instance) was wrong, while the other two were right, the whole question is marked as incorrect. It was also hard to fully understand the lectures at times, as the lecture slides and the lecture notes were not always in complete sync. <br/></div>

Occasionally some of the P-Sets and grading did feel a little arbitrary, and some of the material was taught with many considerations of different sides, but honestly that  in some ways  just made it more accurate and real world. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was very informing and good at answering student's questions. It was very direct and to the point. The sections could have improved some. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One of the greatest strengths of this course was the professors' emphasis not only on theoretical macroeconomic frameworks, but also on how these frameworks can be used to engage in thoughtful discussion about pressing and relevant macroeconomic debates. I also appreciate the broad range of topics that were covered in this course, from monetary policy to the economics of climate change and COVID-19. Another strength of the course was the use of discussion sections and the wealth of tutoring sessions (from both peer tutors and Teaching Fellows). 

Dr. Hawkins was also one of the greatest strengths of this course. He answered students' questions thoroughly and efficiently, which I really appreciated. His responses to my questions not only helped me to understand the psets, but they also provided broader insight into macroeconomic phenomena.  

I also greatly appreciated the "quiz" portion of the weekly homework assignments. Sometimes, while the virtual lectures were very motivating and interesting, it would take me some time to figure out how to apply the material from class to the pset problems. The quiz assignments were an excellent opportunity to build confidence in the material before approaching the graded problem sets. 

In my opinion, most of the weaknesses of this course stemmed from challenges that were inherent to Zoom/virtual learning. The incredibly large class size, for example, was not very conducive to virtual engagement. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I found the lectures relatively engaging (at least, as much as a lecture over zoom can be), and I enjoyed much of the content and found it relevant in many situations.
For obvious reasons, the course likely would have been more engaging in-person. <br/></div>
