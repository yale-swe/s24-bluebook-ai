<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think all things considered, virtual learning environment worked very well. Students don't have much of an option to come early or stay after class to discuss, owing to the online environment. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The final project was made optional, so I appreciated that. I'm not sure if anything else was changed to suit pandemic learning though. It was almost like Brad gave up and said sorry, this class just won't work as well on Zoom, sucks to suck. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class isn't meant to be taken in a virtual setting, but Brad's personality and energy helped make the course work over Zoom. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was nice that Brad worked really hard to connect with us, although like he said I don't feel like many people tried to connect with him. The only change from normal years was that the lecture itself wasn't in person and he really did try to remedy that virtually. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Zoom sucks. I will write this in every evaluation for every course I take. Distanced learning is incredibly flawed. Everything suffers because of the lack of human presence, I will include this in every evaluation. I refuse to let the administration pretend things worked well this fall. They did not. 

Re: CPSC183. Brad tried his damnedest. He kept people engaged during the lecture, audience participation was encouraged. This is the only lecture class I actively wanted to keep my video turned on it. The lectures are best live. This course would not have the same value prerecorded. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I felt like this class was too large to establish a level of comfort for participating often on Zoom. I wish there was a larger use of polls and breakout rooms. No one in my class was able to make any friends in the class and I felt quite disconnected from the class atmosphere. I wish there could also be an effort to create discussion or study groups and more access to office hours. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Doing lectures live and not recorded made the lectures more fun and engaging. Wasn't like watching youtube tutorials which most virtual lectures are like. It was weird that some people participated a lot and others were silent with cameras off the whole time. Not sure if it's bad or not or what to do about it. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think Brad did a great job going over readings with us in class. I got bored watching some of the videos he would present because I just didnt understand the references the videos were making - probably in a lecture hall it would have been easy to turn to a neighbor and ask them whats going on. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Live lectures were good, however it would have been nice to have them recorded (I was in a different time zone for the second half of the semester and the class was at 2am for me). <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I don't really feel like any of the class was well-adjusted for the pandemic; it seems to me like this is how Brad has always done it, so that's how it remained. Granted, I think the class was fine in the pandemic, but Brad mentioned a lot that we missed out on some great parts of the class due to it being remote. Brad attempted to do office hours, but I was never able to access it. I completely understand that Brad is busy and has a lot on his plate, but I don't think I ever received an email response from him, which I think is a little unfair in a remote setting. I thought lectures were great and remained engaging, despite the Zoom setting. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I wish that this course had been recorded. There were several times throughout the semester where my Zoom dropped, and I was not able to go back and rewatch what I missed. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The 'leminar' format is, in my opinion, the best format for highly-enrolled classes. It is a versatile format that is able to switch from professor-led discussion into seminar-style student engagement. Our professor was reactive to the needs of the class and changed the schedule of certain classes to make the experience more enjoyable for the students. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Office hours and the ability to ask questions through email to the instructor/TA definitely made virtual engagement in this course easier for me. For future years of this course (if it is still virtual), I would suggest using breakout rooms or some other kind of small group discussion for the students to get to know each other. I know this was the original plan at the beginning of the semester and I understand why it didn't work out. However, the feeling of community between students did grow with our extra credit final project -- connecting with other students for the first time in the course at the end of the semester still made it worthwhile. Nonetheless, I think that breakout rooms or keeping the group final project for most/all students would have assisted with the feeling of community. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I loved the videos we were shown in class. I felt left out In the discussions (mostly my fault for not speaking up, but a lot of references were made to things a person "fresh off the boat" wouldn't know. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think this class didn't have any practices geared towards learning during the pandemic, and I think that's actually a beautiful thing. This course can be taught both in-person and in real life. However, like I said before, the lack of being in the same space as other students does hamper the learning a bit. Since the class was mostly a lecture and discussion, I think there's little room for improvement. One thing of note was that we didn't overly discuss there were always videos to watch or resources to read that balanced the amount of talking in the lecture. I do believe that the class could benefit from a more active structure, possibly a live polling or learning feature. While I was studying at UNH, we used a live learning/polling program called TopHat that made class interaction fun because not only did you have to respond but you could also see other student's responses, so you could gauge what the class was like. I believe that if we were a bit more active, the online class would be totally fine.
One thing I think was neglected in this course was feedback, as I mentioned earlier. If we received our response papers back earlier with helpful feedback, I'm certain I wouldn't have felt like I wasn't sure where I stood in the course. We received a lot of grades later than expected, which could be improved if papers were simply graded earlier. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The fact that Brad asked a lot of questions and tried to connect with the class made a huge difference in terms of engagement. However, I cannot imagine being a first year or sophomore doing school from home and trying to navigate a zoom class. It's terrible. Personally, I signed up for this class with a really good friend of mine who was in my "covid bubble" this semester which allowed us to join classes together occasionally, and that hugely boosted my engagement. I cannot emphasize enough how important in-person classes are for learning, for a whole lot of nearly intangible reasons that can't be captured by some pseudo-quantitative approach of trying to figure out like how many units of lesson did we get compared to normal. Brad genuinely tried his hardest to engage us all, and he succeeded as much as is humanely possible over zoom. As an instructor, he doesn't have much room for improvement--the problems with the course, and with engagement, and with workload are all problems related to virtual education and are outside of his personal control. Ultimately, until the COVID-19 pandemic ends, the quality of all Yale classes will be significantly diminished, despite the fact that majority of the student body and the majority of instructors--like Brad--are actively trying their hardest to make this work. I feel grateful to have at least taken an interesting class, despite it not having been under the best of circumstances. Another thing that would improve the course that, again, has nothing to do with Brad personally would be if Yale funded more ULAs for the course, so that grading could be completed faster. I didn't get any papers back (even one I turned in the first week) until after the semester ended. I wasn't even mad about that because as far as I could tell there was ONE grader for the course and they seemed super over-burdened. <br/></div>
