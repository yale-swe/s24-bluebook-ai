<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: you learn an enormous amount of information in a short amount of time. Doing so is very rewarding. The teaching is amazing and there's tons of resources that students can use for help. 
Weaknesses: the workload is intense and you almost always have something to do for the class (watch lecture, take quiz, lab, or PSET). <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â SO MUCH WORK. 
David was incredible! Many resources for help. I really appreciate all the effort that went into making this course enjoyable, engaging and interesting. But, it still was the most time-consuming class I took this semster. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Too much for a beginner I believe. Hard to stay caught up some weeks without falling behind in other classes. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: this class teaches A LOT. There are weekly psets and quizzes that do a pretty good job of ensuring that you're staying on top of things. That being said, if you fall behind, it becomes hard to catch up. The lectures are engaging (albeit long). Section also offers a valuable opportunity to ask clarifying questions

Weakness: Labs are pointless because everyone just copy and pastes the answer anyways. I wish toward the middle of the term, TAs would have quick 10 minute meetings with people to check-in because the difficulty of the course significantly ramps up around then. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought that the course was taught very fast it was tough at times to follow. For students new to CS, it could be a very daunting course. 

There was clearly a lot of time and effort put into the course. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: learn useful skills such as logical thinking and problem solving; teaches patience, overall a very rewarding class when you finish

Weaknesses: lectures were like 3 hours long, hard to get through them sometimes; section leaders are just students who took the class in the past, which in my opinion, doesn't qualify them to help us solve all the issues we run into along the way; problem sets take such a long time <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: amazing lecturer, great structure and support (especially the TAs during office hours), really productive assignments 
Weaknesses: so much material and very time consuming, also office hours were only offered at quite specific times <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course is very rigorous, content heavy, and fast-paced. This is a beautiful thing for computer science because it's almost like a bootcamp in the sense that you acquire so many skills and languages in such a short time. In the midst of a pandemic with a shortened semester and everything being totally virtual though, it was super difficult to manage and keep up with. 3 hour lectures may not be as bad on a normal year. But when all of your classes, activities, jobs, etc are online, it may not have been the best idea. In addition, the heavy workload was difficult to keep up with because of screen/Zoom fatigue and the difficulty to learn during a 3 hour lecture. It made it feel as though I was self teaching on a week-to-week basis and having to spend numerous hours on labs and problem sets that I could've started earlier in the week had it been released and if the lecture was shorter. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The entire structure is well considered and the assignments were fun to solve. Maybe the content itself was too hard for first learners. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Great problems. I genuinely enjoyed doing my homework. All tasks had some real world application. This is definitely the course I learned the most information from. I can't think of any negative feedback. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This is an incredibly challenging course and takes SOOOO much time. The problem sets could be shorter. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A big strength of the course is the professor, David Malan. He is phenomenal at what he does, and he is one of the primary reasons why CS50 is so highly lauded across the world. Another strength is the course's structure. Week in and week out, I really felt like I was learning a lot, and the TAs were super helpful during section and in office hours to answer any questions that I may have had about the material. The labs generally had clear applications to the problem set, which were super helpful. The problem sets are super fun as well--we implemented a spell checker, solved a mystery using databases, and even created our own stock trading website. There were so many obvious real-world applications in the problem sets, which made them more fun to accomplish.
There aren't too many weaknesses with the course, but the lectures are really long (if you attend them live). They usually run for right under 3 hours, which is a really long time to focus on computer science. Though, if this is also the case for you, I would recommend watching the lectures when they are released on YouTube at 1.5x speed (or even 2x speed, if you're up to it). Also, sometimes the office hours queue would be overloaded with students trying to complete the problem set the day before it was due. I would recommend going to office hours earlier in the week if you can! <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: fun, engaging, challenging problem sets that are extremely rewarding to finish, quality of the lectures was superb

Weaknesses: seemingly needless/very tedious quizzes and "labs" <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The live lectures were very engaging and taught me a lot. I think the only improvement is to continue to make labs 1 point or even optional, so that they don't add more stress on top of already long psets. <br/></div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think that the course did a good job at teaching a large range of topics in a short duration of time. I think that sometimes it felt very rushed and I wasn't fully understanding the information presented. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Overall I spent more than the average time on the course and felt burned out. The course is unforgiving for those without a coding background. I wish the course homeworks demanded less as I wasn't able to finish all of them or even understand all of them before moving on, even with 15 hours or more of work with the course every week. 

The course gives too much information too quickly. I feel like I have a surface level understanding of a brand array of topics instead of a firm grasp on a few topics. This has led me to now want to pursue computer science down the road. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the level of detail that was explored in this course was perfect for an intro-level course.

Perhaps this interpretation is entirely personal, but I feel like some explanations were glossed over and I understood the topic conceptually but putting it in practice and actually coding was much more difficult. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It is an incredibly well structured class that takes into account all types of learning programming. Professor Malan is an amazing lecturer and always kept students very engaged. However, there are a few issues that arrised during the term. The lecture was given live on Monday during the time of many other Yale classes and because the schedule was not announced until 2 days before the class started, there was no way of adjusting my schedule to it. There was a quiz that was due Tuesday morning (which basically means due Monday night) and because of it students have to watch all 3 hours of lecture in one sitting. The material was very dense and it was very hard to focus throughout the whole lecture. I understand that having quizes due right after the lecture meant to encourage students to watch lecture earlier in the week, but I think it would be better if the quiz was due the next day after lecture. Sections were somewhat useful, but very time consuming with no real benefit from it. During the time allocated for completing labs most of the students ended up doing nothing, because noone was able to focus on the task. I did not find labs particularly useful for the completion of the psets, rather than more time-consuming. Problem Sets were definitely challenging and took a lot of time, but they are also the most important part of the class. OH were quite often understaffed, especially during the weekends with hard problem sets when everyone needed help. Test was unreasonably hard and quite a few question were weirdly formulated and when I asked for help from the heads, they refused to provide clarification. Project was definitely a highlight of the course and even though it took me 40+ hours to complete it, it was a very fun time. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The classes (and sections) are wayyyy too long. The lecture was consistently over three hours long in one sitting, and the sections are 1.5-2 hours. This along with 20 hours of homework a week warrants two credits! And personally I hated how all of the homework was autograded. The whole class felt extremely cold and removed and we had almost zero contact with actual faculty.

The workload is high but not as bad as I expected: completing the labs and psets almost always felt rewarding and fun (even though the debugging process itself can be stressful and frustrating).

There are endless opportunities to get help, and while you're expected to be able to do things on your own, they don't hesitate to work with you and really help guide you to finding the answer/information you need. The labs were nice to have a bit of practice before diving into the pset for the week, and I was happy once they made them more of a Pass/Fail so that I could use that as a learning/understanding opportunity and then see where I made mistakes and apply that to the psets.

Weaknesses: There was a LOT of information to learn over the course of the semester. I don't think this can necessarily be remedied, but it was really overwhelming and hard to keep up with everything - 3+ hour lectures, 1-2 hour sections, labs, psets, quizzes, etc. I think they all were helpful in bettering my understanding, but it was really easy to fall behind; not in the sense of procrastination or lack of effort, but just that there was so much to learn and remember and new concepts introduced each week that if you had difficulty understanding the information from the previous week, it was difficult to relearn that and catch back up. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One strength of this course were the ample opportunities to reach out for help when we were stuck on problems. There were several office hours almost every day in addition to the weekly discussion section, and we could also ask answers on ED (an online discussion forum). I was especially impressed by the fast response times to ED questions. On one occasion I posted a question well past midnight, and a member of staff responded within 10 minutes. I also enjoyed the lectures, which combined engaging and useful visuals with plentiful examples of code. One thing I would improve would be to better balance the workload throughout the week. Mondays and weekends were very workload-heavy, while the remainder of the week I didn't have much CS work to do. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A great introduction to programming. Lectures were excellent, though a little too long.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the staff was very willing to help, office hours were well-organized online through the queue and Zoom, my TAs were always one email away, the class was very informative
Weakness: the lectures on Mondays were extremely long (~3+ hours) and I would become overwhelmed by the end mentally, there were also too many assignments during the week that distracted from the problem sets
Improve: have the labs be limited only to section and have the section leaders walk through the solution, have the Monday lectures be more concise in length and time or have the quizzes due later than Tuesday morning (which would help those who have multiple classes at Yale on Mondays) <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is unique in that it has been offered as a remote (on-line) course for almost a decade at Harvard.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course was the access to help, in section and in office ours. The weaknesses  stem from the time commitment.

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The lectures are very well organized and the delivery of information is very well thought out. The lectures are engaging with various demos and visualizations in class facilitating learning (it has always been an online course so the quality of the lectures are very high). The information is presented in a digestable fashion, and I think this class is an excellent introduction to computer science. Also there is a lot of support throughout the course, though I've never had to use any of them

Weaknesses: Toward the end of the semester, they want to focus more on "learning it yourself", which I think is just an excuse for bad teaching and laziness. In particular, the lectures before the last two psets were helpful but did not supply the relevant information to actually implement the code, so office hours would definitely help (I still don't know how to implement a feature because I never asked). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths:
If you really have to take an intro CS course, this is probably a good course to take--at least, it's better than CS112, the other intro course offered at Yale, from what I've heard. This course has really great lectures and an engaging professor + Brian is freakin phenomenal.

Weaknesses:
Be prepared for the really high workload. Not sure why discussion sections are 2 hours long and that lectures are 3 hours long and PSETs often take 10 hours a week for me on top of working on labs which sometimes took me 2 hours per week in the beginning of the semester, when we didn't finish them in class. Plus, there's a weekly quiz that often took an hour because I got counted down if I didn't write down verbatim what the professor said--so I had to rewind the video multiple times.

For weekly section:
I don't think anyone learned anything in section, because we'd all come to the lab and not have any clue how to proceed, waiting for answers from the TA. Some people straight up left during section, sometimes for periods of 30 minutes and only came back in the last 15 minutes when the answers were being done by the TAs. The TAs often went over material we didn't cover in lecture and that we didn't need to know. 

For weekly labs:
Labs didn't really teach me anything new and rather just provided code that I could look at for the PSET (but I heard in previous years, we worked on the PSET in lab, so that would make a lot more sense). 

For weekly quizzes:
I didn't feel like quizzes reinforced or taught anything. There were a few times where I got marked down on quizzes, and I'd message my TA only for my TA to respond "Oh, that's weird that I marked you down for that. You're fine. But I can't change the grades. You're doing okay in the class though so don't worry about it." Quizzes also took about an hour or so since the times when I didn't write down verbatim what the professor said in class, I'd get marked down, so I often had to rewatch lectures for the exact wording. Sometimes, I'd still get marked down.

Overall workload:
Not sure why discussion sections are 2 hours long and that lectures are 3 hours long and PSETs often take 10 hours a week for me on top of working on labs which sometimes took me 2 hours per week in the beginning of the semester, when we didn't finish them in class. 

For the test:
The test doesn't make sense to me either. 
Tests are supposed to test how well you learned the material. Their goal, by having a test that covers material we didn't cover in class, is to "test how well you learned how to teach yourself" but they never taught you how to teach yourself--they just made PSETs really difficult so you either had to rely on your smart friends, go to office hours and pray your TA helps, or slog through hours of websites that don't really make sense because the only advice you get during lecture is "just google things and find the answer" as the only method of teaching yourself.

Also, on both the quizzes and tests, the questions always say "use three sentences" but whenever I use three sentences I get a 0 because I didn't cover the 5 things they wanted me to cover, and then I see other people writing 3 page essays and getting full credit because they regurgitated everything in the course. Not sure what the staff is going for with "only use three sentences"--are they trying to penalize people who follow directions?

For the project:
This was what I expected for the most part I guess, but our TA kept saying "you should do more" when, like. Buddy. It's finals period. There's a pandemic. I have better things to be worrying about than trying to add yet another feature to something like letting someone download an image. Being forced to make a video about our project and write peer feedback for every project we saw during discussion section was truly rubbing salt on the wound for an already high-workload course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The weakness of the course was that it was online. Online learning is difficult for me, because there is not much room to be able to interact with the professor of course material during the live 400 person lecture.

Very high production value of lectures.

Weaknesses:
The constant reminders about the honor code discouraged me from searching for information and resources online. I know that programming is all about finding existing code and adapting in many cases, but I was not able to develop that key skill because I was terrified of an honor code violation. I struggled through a lot of the problem sets on my own and used office hours extensively, but feel that I really missed out on a valuable opportunity to learn how to teach myself online due to the honor code. <br/></div>

Office hours were also rushed; I wish there had been someone to sit with me and help me work through my confusion, even if just by leading questions. Another weakness is in the class length in general - I found it really difficult to sit through the 3+ hour class and stay focused the whole time. <br/></div>
