<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course only has strengths! It was structured very well: we begin by looking at environmental influences and then transition to nitty gritty of the neurobiology of particular disorders (psychopathy and ASPD) that influence criminal behavior. The lectures are very understandable; you do not need to know anything about neuroscience or law for this class. Dr. Sommers structures the class to be readily accessible to everyone. All the lectures were engaging, with a mixture of video clips and poll questions (though towards the end, the lectures had less of those but they are still very interesting). The weekly quizzes are not stressful at all; the two exams were also straight forward, with ample support in the form of a study guide and a review session. I loved being able to read actual research articles about each topic every week (including Dr. Sommers' own research which is so cool); while reading technical research may seem daunting, Dr. Sommers makes it so you don't have to read the whole thing just the main points. I liked the structure of the first two essays being based on templates that prepare you for the last essay which is a much more traditional academic essay. There was also so much support in the class! There are so many office hours with TA's and ULA's and Dr. Sommers' herself; the use of Piazza was also very helpful for any general questions or help on essays, and Dr. Sommers would answer questions very quickly. Overall, this course is amazing and is extremely well taught! <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is well taught with a clear plan for each lecture. The material rarely feels overwhelming or too complex. The one time the material sometimes feels too complex is when discussing the different brain regions. I feel the course did a poor job of explaining the role of each brain region early on and rather expected students to figure it out on their own. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Honestly one of the most well organized classes I've had at Yale, don't have any suggestions for improvement. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was fantastic. We were given good feedback on our writing assignments and they were returned in a timely manner. For the exams, we were given the opportunity to do test corrections, which relieves the stress of grades a bit, but more importantly allowed us to learn from our mistakes and make sure we understood the material to progress in the course. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Relaxing way to learn about a topic that most people would consider very interesting; it's a good psych class if you're not a major and you're just interested or need a SS credit. It's low-pressure and low-stress; 3 essays that are pretty easy, one weekly open note quiz that's simple if you're paying attention, and 2 exams which she this term allowed you to correct for partial credit. Professor Baskin-Sommers is an excellent and interesting lecturer, cares about the students, and engages with questions. She uses Piazza to interact with students outside of class and has fantastic open communication. 
Weaknesses: None, as long as you're interested in the material. If you don't like the neuroscience/experiment aspect, you may be bored for a good chunk of lectures. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought that the twice a week live lectures were very engaging. The once a week quizzes were great way to keep people on top of the readings and watching the lectures. I do not have any suggestions for this course because I thought that it was very engaging, fairly graded and well organized. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - Dr. Baskin-Sommers. Period. She is amazing, and if you have the opportunity to learn from her, take it. I understood every concept not because I am a genius psychology major, but because her lectures are so clear and to the point. She explains everything  so well a toddler could understand it. However, this is not to say the lecture are boring because they are not. 
Weaknesses - none. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Prof. Baskin-Sommers is the biggest strength of this class. She's a great lecturer, and made the course easy to understand for everyone regardless of previous knowledge. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Baskin-Sommers is a wonderful professor who clearly cares about her students. She is the biggest strength of this course. Additionally, lectures provided relevant information, and the tests never went outside the scope of this class, and the assignments were straightforward. There really are no weaknesses that I could see with this course, and only strengths across the board. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I learned so much in this course due to the amazing Teaching team and Professor Baskin-Sommers. Everything was very clear, and there were myriad resources available to help us learn. Something that could make this course better is transitioning this class to two 50-minute lecture periods and a 50 minute discussion section. I have rarely had discussion sections in psychology classes at Yale and I often feel that having designated time to discuss the relevant material could help with understanding and engagement of the class. Especially with a class this interesting and with a subject matter full of nuances, a discussion time would be beneficial and outstandingly interesting. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: content was very interesting, quizzes were straightforward, exams were reasonable. We had exam corrections. Lots of personalized feedback and individualized response which was very impressive, given that the class was HUGE. 

Weaknesses: none, this was probs the best lecture class I've ever taken <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - fast feedback and Professor Baskin-Sommers is always willing to answer questions and is very well versed in psychology
Weakness - Essays were a bit difficult as virtual learning made things a lot more self reliant <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Baskin-Sommers is definitely a strength of this course. The lectures can sometimes get a little bit dry, but every lecture has info that is eye-opening and at times, even life-changing! <br/></div>

The professor was always on top of things and very responsive as were the TAs. This included emails AND piazza. Everyone was very helpful. The content was eye-opening and really interesting. The students were constantly asking questions and helping each other. Professer Baskin-Sommers did a great job with COVID stuff. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A weakness may perhaps be the limited office hours of the professor, as well as how the essays were graded - it seemed a bit arbitrary sometimes. I put more effort into one essay than another but the one with much less effort got a significantly higher grade. Because of the first essay grade, there is a little stress about the final essay. A strength is the lectures and how fair the quizzes/exams were. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths- professor is incredible! In a 200+ person lecture, she would encourage students to meet with her, email her, and she would reply to piazza posts almost instantaneously. She is so understanding with deadlines and grades, and if you try in this class, she basically guarantees you an A (through earning points back on exams, dropping lowest quizzes, etc). She is a fascinating lecturer and you will feel like you learned a ton after each and every class. Essays are really fun and easy!

Weakness- the readings are pointless because you are essentially just tested off of stuff presented in class. Just read the abstracts, if at all. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths were the lectures because they were very informative and lively so they were very engaging. I also think a strength was the constant availability of the instructor and all teaching fellows to making sure we understood what was going on. A weakness is the lectures sometimes went quickly and it was hard to keep up with taking notes sometimes. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures were very structured and easy to follow, but I wish we had spent more time analyzing case studies and understanding the minds of criminals as they are committing certain crimes instead of analyzing the criminal mind more generally with statistics. <br/></div>

The readings, though sometimes long or a little complex for my knowledge of neuroscience, were very interesting and all were very applicable to the course. I thought the essays were interesting to write, and the research involved definitely helped me broaden my understanding of the topics. Lectures and readings always prepared me very well for assessments, and the class was very clear in its expectations and teaching. The "Ask the Expert" class periods were always super interesting, getting to hear from other individuals in the field. I really can't complain about much with this class! <br/></div>

Not to mention that the essays assigned were very interesting and very applicable to the material that we were learning in class.

Her quickness in replying, organization in lectures, and passion to do her best is truly inspiring, and I wish I had her diligence and control! Her lectures were very well organized with summary slides, clear topic structures, and her pace was very easy to follow. Any topic I had confusion on, she clarified at the end or in the next lecture, making me very confident in what I knew and the comparisons between all the topics we learned. Piazza gave me a space to ask questions outside of class, and I wish all classes used Piazza! It was extremely reliable because I would get an answer within the hour, and it would be in-depth. If I did not use Piazza, I would certainly have not done as well in tests or in my general understanding. I do wish that perhaps there were more outside of class optional discussion times to go deeper into the material or even analyze a Criminal Minds episode. While not vital to course material, I would love to know the TAs and the Professor's thoughts on these real-life representations, and it would just be a great way to bond as a class. <br/></div>

Professor Baskin-Sommers is so, so organized. There's an easily accessible answer for any question you could even think of, but if you do need to ask, she'll answer your email or Piazza post so quickly. The TAs were also SO quick to help, even just before papers were due. They also gave such clear feedback. They were never like, "looks like you're on the right track," or "I would think of this differently." I'd literally get structured emails detailing what I would need to consider if I opted for one specific topic and what I would need to consider if I went a different route. I am a very easily stressed person at times and I was literally never stressed by this class because the expectations were so clear and you could find the info you needed anytime, very neatly organized into a Canvas folder. <br/></div>

It is also clear that the goal of the class is for the students to understand the information and be able to apply it rather than just cram for tests and there are opportunities to get points back on exams if you can improve your answers.

The material is engaging and the professor makes an effort to answer questions in a timely and precise manner and makes it very interesting. All of the material is also explained thoroughly, such that not prior knowledge is necessary, though an understanding of the basic brain regions and their functions is helpful. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: amazing professor who is both very engaging and supportive of her students; interesting material and easy workload; cohesive class with multiple mediums of conveying information

Weaknesses: the first 2-3 lectures may be a bit deceptive, the course mostly focuses on two specific aspects of the criminal mind (psychopathy and externalizing) and spends a very brief period of time exploring the social and environmental factors that cause crime.  I think the class could be made better if more focus was given to the social/environmental factors that cause crime <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Dr. Baskin-Sommers and her TF team make a SIGNIFICANT effort to care for students and accommodate COVID challenges. The content is explained in a way that someone with no psych experience (me) could understand. A well of resources are also made available which allow us to refer back when stuck. The goal of the class was us to learn, not to be graded--which was made evident in the format of assignments. Dr. Baskin-Sommers also worked to engage us in other ways than just class (playlists, screenings, weekly emails, question board). We also got our grades almost instantly. And lastly, Dr. Baskin-Sommers really is patient with some of these question interruptions that wouldn't normally happen during a live lecture (you deserve your flowers ).

The weekly quizzes were really helpful in ensuring that you understood the key points of that week's lecture and were really easy to score a perfect score on (they were all open notebook and you always had more than enough time to finish).

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Approachable and fantastic professor who is super knowledgeable about her topic and always willing to clarify thoughts if you ever get stuck; super super easy workload (I'm tempted to call this class a gut) BUT ONLY IF YOU DON'T KILL TIME ON THE "ASSIGNED" READINGS (more on this in the weakness section); easy plus helpful weekly quizzes that keep you on top of the material; exams are very easy and doable if you understand the lectures; essays are very generously graded if you follow the rubric (a 100 or 99 is very possible); super interesting material; easy A

Weakness: The readings are really unnecessary and should not be labelled as "Required".....they ended up killing a lot of my time during the first week of classes (until I realized that I didn't need them to understand the lectures and get a perfect on the exams/essays).....they have interesting content but the Prof. should just label them as "Optional" readings instead of "Required" <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was very interesting and the professor is very willing to help. The average piazza response time from the prof was ~5 min, there was a massive amount of office hours each week, and it was very easy to meet with the prof. The TAs and professor were always on the same page, knowledgeable, and clear.

Some of the grading weight choices didn't make much sense to me. Accounting for test corrections, missing a question on a quiz costs twice as much as missing a question on the tests. The quizzes weren't particularly tough, but that's still a lot for what's intended to just be a participation check. <br/></div>

She is incredibly knowledgeable and is a great lecturer! The course was organized very well, and the slides were very informative. There were plenty of office hours available.

Weakness: Honestly, I can't think of any notable weakness of this course. If I absolutely had to choose something, I will say that a quick overview of the courses terminology at the beginning of the course could have served useful and cleared up some of my confusion during the first few lectures. Aside from this, it was a really solid class! The explanations of the experiments at times felt like a bit much and felt very neuroscience-y, but Professor Baskin-Sommers did a really good job of explaining them. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course were that the professor and TA were extremely lenient and accommodating. They uploaded recordings of the lecture almost immediately after the lecture itself, and they recorded every review session for students. They also clearly communicated deadlines to students and promptly answered our questions on Piazza. Additionally, the professor made sure to review concepts that she would be building on in class during the classes (before she introduced a new concept) and while that would be repetitive at times, it was extremely helpful in the retention of those concepts. 

There were no weaknesses in this course. <br/></div>

I don't know how but the professor would answer our questions thoughtfully and well in less than 10 minutes on piazza. I was stunned by her care and attention to the students and to the material.

A weakness is the grading rubric. It always points out what's wrong with your essays, but never accounts for the good parts of your essay. Rather than just constructive criticism it would have been nice to know what I could do more of in the future. Another weakness of the course is that we don't get to engage too much with our peers. I wish there were more opportunities to either participate on either poll everywhere or go into breakout rooms to discuss topics in the course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really enjoyed this course overall and would not make very many changes. I thought Prof. Baskin-Sommers made great slides and structured the course really thoughtfully. I liked the weekly quizzes, the "Ask the Expert" series, and the test format. I was a little unsure of having templated essays but it actually worked out really well. I wish that we had spent a little more time on the biology/neuroscience/anatomy part of the brain in the beginning so that when we explore the functions of relevant brain regions we would have had some understanding of the underlying mechanics. <br/></div>

I also think a strength of this course was the guests lecturers. Since we weren't tested on this material we could just listen and retain the material, which made the class more enjoyable.

The weekly quizzes were a great way for the students to keep up with the material of the course.

     - Extremely interesting course material that, although scientific at times, is made palatable and digestible via thorough examples and extensive professor knowledge; material is never too overwhelming or boring; there was always something to learn and engagement can be as little or as much as you'd like
     - Tests, quizzes, and essays were all very fair and straightforward--they reinforce material, are not tricky, and all resources are available via the lecture slides, Piazza, readings, and recorded lectures; there was almost never a time when I couldn't find an answer to a question I had
     - Class is flexible: readings are more or less optional, one quiz per week, two straightforward tests, three essays that are completely outlined by the professor; lecture attendance was optional and two per week at ~1hr each were digestible and understandable and far from overwhelming; you can participate as much as you'd like or sit back and enjoy the content

*WEAKNESSES:
     - Readings/research were, at times, a bit difficult and scientific--lots of stats, research methods, neuroscience, etc.; these were not required, though, so they did not need to be read in full or in-depth all the time <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course material is interesting, but I feel that the course title of "The Criminal Mind" is a little misleading. The major foci of the course are antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy, but more general criminal behavior is only briefly discussed. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was the optimal classsuper low work, super high reward! No discussion sections, and very little reading material/assignments, but somehow this class was the most rewarding and educational of my classes this semester. Professor Baskin-Sommers is very good at teachingher PowerPoints follow a very easy to follow and logical progression both within the slides and between each PowerPoint, and have a lot of interesting video clips and polls and activities that kept me engaged. All of the material is relatively simple to understand but with major social implications. The class is large but there are a lot of TF's, so any questions asked in the chat would be immediately answered by a TF and often also Professor Baskin-Sommers herself. She also has a very clear voice and diction which is really important to stay focused in Zoom classes. I don't think there were any weaknesses of this class, although I would have appreciated opportunities to connect with other students in social settings. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Uber-competent professor who is just invested in everyone knowing this important information. You learn about good practice in psychology, evaluating crime through a professional lens, from an expert, that you won't find in popular discourse, though it is so relevant. The professor and TF's arranged modules to explain every facet of the course - reading academic papers, doing research for papers, etc. The first two papers were templates to teach us how to write for psychology and how to mine important aspects of the course. The professor brought in speakers and provided reading that lent an incredible human aspect to the whole course. The professor responds to any and all questions about the material, exams, papers, etc., instantaneously, using compassion and wisdom to really teach. I really can't even cover all of the strengths - there are too many. 

Weakness: It's almost silly to mention this, because the professor is the rare educator who has no interest in tricking her students through trickily crafted questions, but the exams were a little bit annoying. We are used to trying to read really precisely and answer questions according to carefully memorized and applied information, but even the detailed questions on the exams in this class are more about realizing that the professor wants us to have certain major takeaways that are sort of the hot-take of this class, and then answering in that direction. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength of this course was simply the material for me. I don't know if its a personal thing, but for some reason I really enjoyed learning about it and it kept me engaged even though it was a lecture format. The biggest strength however was the availability of everyone. The professor and TA's were readily available in lecture and out of it and that made it really easy to get answers to questions. The only weakness of this course for me is super minor but I felt as if the music was kind of unnecessary, luckily the improvement I would suggest is already in place in that it is optional to listen to and that its only played before class starts. <br/></div>
