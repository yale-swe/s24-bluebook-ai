<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: great lecture format, many resources for studying for exams, super nice professor and TAs
Weaknesses: the quizzes. I'm the type of learner who needs reinforcement and practice problems, so the quizzes really stressed me out rather than facilitate learning. I would have rather had quizzes that you had to retake until you got 100%, so that way I was really learning but less stressed about the grade. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Humphries does an admirable job of trying to make the class engaging. And the material you learn is important if you want to go further in economics research. 
Weaknesses: It's partially because of Zoom, and partially because of the material, but engagement was quite low. The class also asks too much time of its students. 2 1.15 hour lectures, a 50 min discussion section, and an additional 30 min-1.15 min R lecture every week is not necessary. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The midterm and final were open note, but not exactly sure if exams are the best way to test students knowledge when there are more pressing matters (i.e. a pandemic) <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Great lectures and a lot of help available if needed. Very reasonable problem sets that still make you think. And usually one every two weeks which was really nice. I thought this class was organized really well so props to Prof Humphries and the TFs
Weaknesses: I don't know a solution for this but people are coming in with very varied experience levels. I already am really familiar with R as well as statistics/regression so most of the class was review and not super engaging <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â sometimes difficult to follow along during in-person lectures, so I would always watch the recorded lectures- I could rewind or speed up that way. I think the pace could get too fast sometimes and I would lose track of what the prof was explaining during class. I liked doing the psets bc I really got to apply what I was learning. It always made more sense when doing the examples. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think overall this is a great course. The only problem was that, at the time of each lecture, I felt that a ton of material was being thrown at me all at once and then I had to digest it on my own. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Really really good course. Everything was neatly presented, slides and section notes were excellent. Easily the best course infrastructure of any class I took this semester. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures are very long and I found that this forced the lecturer to rush through the slides, without giving me time to really digest the content. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: we talk about some really fascinating concepts

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the class is well organized and there were multiple different resources of help (i.e. lots of office hours, online R lectures, etc.) <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought all of the material for the course was more than necessary for myself and too much at points. Some of the live lectures meandered and discussion sections were just not very helpful. The material was great and once you got the understanding of concepts it was really cool stuff, but the amount of necessary hoops you had to go through were sometimes too much. The psets were good, you had one due every two weeks and that was fine and well with some interesting things on the psets, and the lectures were overall fine with the added benefit that you could go through them at your own speed with the recorded lectures plus notes. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is outstanding, even though it is difficult and fast-paced. The material is interesting, but most of all, the resources available to students are incredible. Professor Humphries and the TAs, especially those who answer Piazza questions, were tremendously helpful in this course. The quality of answers on Piazza--some that looked like they took 20 minutes+ to write out--were very helpful in piecing together some of the more challenging topics of this course. The course is difficult, but students have plenty of resources to do well.

I think that it might have been helpful to have a little bit more time on instrumental variables, or at least a longer problem set to practice. I understand that the instructors may have been giving us a shorter problem set due to Thanksgiving break (thank you, if so!), but I did have to look up some additional examples and explanations of IVs on the internet prior to the final exam. 

I also would have loved to do a final research project, but it kind of crept up on me. I also felt like I didn't quite know where to get data and things like that. Maybe the instructors could record a video for students interested in research projects and explain how to go about writing a proposal or finding datasets on the internet. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I personally think this course has more weaknesses than strengths. The strengths hands-down would be the TFs and the overwhelming amount of out-of-class resources available to students. The many many hours of office hours were literally essential to honing concepts and completing problem sets. In terms of weaknesses, this course definitely was one where the professor read off the slides. The lectures were synchronous but I didn't see why they had to be because I didn't view the professor as really teaching the material, more guiding us through connected topics, but those aren't the same thing. Less about the professor, I personally think this course would benefit a lot from being flippedthat is, watching a pre-recorded lecture before class, then coming in and working on problems in breakout rooms or just further breaking down concepts in the big lecture format, similar to section, which is the one "in-class" time during this course that I really enjoyed and looked forward to because that's where I got most of my conceptual understanding. I think that a flipped course would also help students prepare more for quizzes. I felt I underperformed on quizzes because it was always the first time I received test-like problems after weeks of just going through equations. (In contrast, we received a lot of past exams for the midterm and final, so I felt a lot more prepared.) Additionally, I understand that the course itself is very in flux, but I found it really disorienting the jumps from theory to R. R seemed to be emphasized a lot only for us not to be tested on it, and again, I felt like we didn't spend enough class time actually going over how to apply the theory we were learning (so bridging the gap between the equation and applying that equation on a problem). The gap between R and theory definitely improved after the mid-term. This may be because I had a better grip on the course itself, but also it made more sense what we were doing in R since you quite literally can't do, say multivariate OLS regression, by hand. (Side note: I really liked the R lectures by themselves. They were clear, and I find R quite fun.) <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The lectures and psets offer a good mix of theoretical concepts and empirical examples. Professor Humphries tried to include numerous real-world research and examples in the lectures, which were helpful for us to see statistics at work. The slides were also super clear so it was easy to go back and review key concepts. The course materials are organized nicely on Canvas and it's always easy to locate files for any given lecture/section.
Weaknesses: This isn't a major weakness, but I really wished the course had pushed me to learn more R skills. The psets could've been more challenging with regard to R, instead of just asking us to plug variables into given R formulas. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really wish this could have been an in-person class, because I struggled a lot studying by myself. I found the course rather difficult, and even though having a section every Friday was helpful, the TFs were not the best at teaching, so there was a bit of a struggle there as well. I think it would be helpful to go over some more problems in class, since most of what we do in live lecture is very conceptual. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Prof. Humphries really cares about his students and wants to make sure that they all have lots of opportunities to get support and to understand the material, whether it's through additional R lectures, sections, office hours, Piazza, and/or email. The course itself is quite well organized and goes through a ton of material (which is both super difficult and super rewarding once it's over). However, I'd say a weakness of this course is that it doesn't translate well over a Zoom lecture. For me and a lot of my classmates, it's inexplicably and inexorably more difficult to pay attention during Zoom lectures; I experienced this unexplained and never before experienced phenomenon of being so completely confused during class but also ridiculously bored and unable to pay attention to be less confused. This I'd say would be my fault, but I came across a lot of my friends who felt the same way. Maybe there could be more breaks, examples (especially drawn on a whiteboard), and in-class discussion. Another weakness was the quizzes, which I personally really struggled on because there weren't enough examples in class and enough comprehension questions/discussion to truly understand the concepts just yet, and here I was being tested with pretty tough questions (where I couldn't even go backwards!) that were only one try and for a grade. I think the experience would be much less stressful and provide for much greater improvement on the student level for hard-working students (not just students who understand the concepts immediately or have had prior exposure) if the quizzes were unlimited attempts, like I've experienced in a couple other classes over the remote semester. <br/></div>

It was very easy to get in touch with the instructor or tutors to ask questions(Email, piazza, office hours, etc). Also, the homeworks were a great way to further digest what we had learned in class by applying method we had learned, though they were a bit long at times or included many steps (points of possible failure). So, I strongly reccomend getting a small study group to check over answers! The classes themselves were pretty drawn out since the material we were learning was pretty convoluted/involved many steps to get to a general idea. This made focusing a bit difficult, but the material itself wasn't crazy hard. I enjoyoed the asynchronous lectuers that exclusively were for teaching R as I could try and follow along in Rstudio on my computer. The homeworks were all fair, but the tests seemed a little too long for the given time period. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â JEH's organization of lecture and the syllabus was exceptionally logical, building on concepts from the beginning to take them to new places. The slides outlined what would be covered. Lectures would begin with an overview of the last lecture's relevance before previewing the next one. The course was strong in terms of continuity.

This is barely a criticism, but I wish the TA's were more prepared for questions that go into the nitty-gritty. This course does not cover that so much, which is definitely a plus as I get bogged down. But it would have been nice to have a resource to succinctly explain the extended concepts. <br/></div>
