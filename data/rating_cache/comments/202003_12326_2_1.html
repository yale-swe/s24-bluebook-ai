<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I liked Professor Glenn (even though I know there are people who find him monotone or dull). He does speak slowly, which might be a strength if you're someone who likes to watch the recorded lecture - you can do it at 2x speed and it'll sound just fine.
Weaknesses: This is more like a complaint - On the syllabus it said "3-4 programming projects and 10-12 programming exercises" but we ended doing 4 projects and 12 exercises. (And I was feeling so happy when I finished the 3rd project because I thought I was done.) But they weren't that bad so it was okay. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Pretty much no strengths. The class doesn't really teach you how to approach hard problems, it just forces you how to figure out how to do so on your own. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course material is decently interesting, but the context of the projects and weekly exercises feels antiquated and a little dull. Additionally, there is an extreme focus on private test cases in grading projectsfor me, this meant the balance between "Data Structures" and "Programming Techniques" in the course title was heavily imbalanced towards the latter. In my opinion, it would have been more valuable for me to get a deeper understanding of data structures and broad use cases in the real world, rather than using a data structure only once or twice throughout the whole course and spending most of my time testing my code for a good grade, as in the end, I was focused more on the grade than the content.

A very big gripe I have with the course is that they take way too long to get grades back to you for projects and exercises. For exercises, it's not a big deal, because they are very easy and such a small part of your grade, but projects are a huge part of your grade. Each project took about 3 weeks to grade, and it doesn't even seem like they're that hard to grade (it's just coming up with more test cases on their end). Additionally, the course staff took more than a month to grade the 3rd project (out of 4), which meant by the Cr/D/Fail deadline, we only had half of our grade. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was very well-structured. Having small, weekly programming exercises which took 1-2 hours on top of four larger programming projects which took 12-16 hours allowed for students to practice their C programming skills at a regular rate throughout the semester, rather than in short, furious bursts. The lectures were a little dry - however, this is more a function of the subject matter than anything the professor could have done. Additionally, more time could have been spent at the beginning familiarizing students to programming in C. Students coming in with experience do fine, but students without experience programming in C have to work hard to get up to speed at the beginning of the course without that much support from the course itself. Having a few "Crash Course in C Programming"-style extra sessions at the beginning would have been useful. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strength: a lot of help and support, amazing and understanding teacher

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The class was taught in a manner that was conducive to learning if the student put in a significant amount of effort. However, the class is very very very time consuming compared to other courses at Yale. It was also difficult to seek help at times, especially given that everything was moved online. There would also be weeks where you would have to balance a project, programming exercise, and midterm at the same time. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Covered a lot of content and learned how to use C very well.

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought it was well done overall. Glenn was good, the Tas were helpful, and I liked that there was low-stress weekly practice in the form of exercises. 

Weaknesses: My only beef was with the programming section of the exams. Objectively I can see how ~2 hours seems like a ton of time to complete four mini programming exercises. But if you get a minor bug in one of them that screws it up, youre at a maximum 75%, and in two and you can only get a 50%. And grade-wise theres no difference between someone who totally doesnt understand the question vs. someone who has the right logic but made a syntax error, for example. If it wasnt an exam I wouldnt freak out and would probably do better, but in the exam setting that gets pretty stressful. I can see how a take-home exam (like a full day to do it) could be problematic, but an extra hour wouldve really helped me relax and focus. We havent gotten grades back yet, but I wouldnt be surprised if the exam category singlehandedly tanks my grade 5 or 6 points. Which is a little frustrating because 6 hours out of the whole semester doesn't seem like the best representation of my work vs. the &gt;120 hours I put in on exercises and projects. <br/></div>
</div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The programming exercises and assignments were well-designed, requiring that students understand and implement the concepts discussed during lectures. Professor Glenn also did a great job emphasizing the advantages and drawbacks of different algorithms and when we would prefer one data type over another. 

The large weight placed on out-of-class assignments as opposed to timed exams was beneficial, especially during such a stressful semester. However, despite Professor Glenn's claim that the three-hour slot was much more time than students would need on the two exams, everyone else I know in the class was rushing to finish. This is because the exams consisted of two separate components: one on Canvas and the other on the Zoo. The Zoo section was graded using an all-or-nothing rubric (no credit if you don't pass the test cases), which was not the expectation for students in previous years. This resulted in a lot of unnecessary stress surrounding the exams. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The weekly hw exercises at the beginning of the course were way to long, but they listened to student feedback and adjusted accordingly which was greatly appreciated. For a course that pretty much has a computer do the grading, grades took a really long time to get back to people which was a little disappointing <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: this is an extremely difficult class that pushes and challenges students to develop necessary skills in programming and to learn difficult concepts. The programming exercises and assignments did that really well

weaknesses: the exam prep did not reflect the exams well and the exams were extremely difficult <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: some ULAs are super helpful. The course is organized for the most part.
Weakness: lecture can be extremely hard to follow. Some psets you spend more time skimming professors code than you do writing code <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was very well structured with distinct modules. The nature of the subject lends the student to constantly improve skills learned earlier in the semester. The lectures were succinct and decently clear for such a complex topic. The fact that all notes and lectures were posted was also super useful, as the student could rewatch specific sections they did not understand.

The biggest weakness in my opinion was the availability of help/Office hours. Right before certain assignments were due, office hours were flooded, and it was extremely hard to even ask a clarifying question, much less help with the assignment. Grades also took a while to be uploaded, so it was difficult to correct mistakes and apply changes for the next assignment.

Lectures were a tad boring at times, but as stated before, they were concise and easy to understand on rewatch. <br/></div>

Lectures explained the concepts in great detail, and coding assignments allowed us to put those concepts to use ourselves so that we could be sure we were really learning them. The balance of quick coding exercises to gain extra familiarity with the concepts and more expansive programming projects to really push the boundaries of our knowledge and abilities was excellent. <br/></div>

He is a fun lecturer, incredibly knowledgeable about the material, and tries his best to make all the assignments and in-class coding as engaging and interesting as possible. He adapted quite well to a remote setting. The assignments themselves were great to build understanding of each data structure. The course itself felt just a little bit too difficult, especially when it came to the multiple week-long problem sets. The last project seemed to be a huge jump up in intensity from the first two. Since we were remote, it was harder to work together, get help (even with virtual office hours), and meet friends in the class, so the projects were kind of torture at some points. Also, I would've appreciated a more in-depth look at 1) debugging, 2) creating your own test cases, and 3) space &amp; time complexity as a concept (felt a little lost on that end occasionally). I only just found out how to use VSCode's built-in debugger properly halfway through the semester, and the fact that you could fail private test cases even though you passed all the public ones really freaked me out sometimes. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The only strength of the course is the quality of the textbook. Everything else was a weakness. The lectures are incredibly boring, disorganized, and slow. The professor's teaching style was so boring that I would speed up the lectures 2x only for the lectures to still be too slow. Additionally, it felt as though the professor was trying to set us up for failure. For example, we had a final exam right before reading period started. Then, there was an insanely hard final project due on the last day of reading period. Most students spent all reading period working on the project and were unable to study for final exams in other classes the week after. The average on the final was a 51% and most exams had similarly low averages. On top of this, office hours are a mess. There are often 30 students waiting in queue for one TA. Oftentimes, less than half of the students would be helped over the entire office hours session. Additionally, most TAs took the class with a different professor and were often unable to help that much with the psets and projects for this class. Also, the head TA wouldn't even show up to his own office hours, making it almost impossible to get help. The time commitment expected from this class is absurdly high and unrealistic. We are expected to do a pset every week and a gigantic project like every 2 weeks. The weeks projects are due, we are also expected to do psets which makes it very hard to stay afloat. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think both the strength and the weakness of the class is the independent nature of the course. We did so much of the coding work by ourselves, and our feedback and grading for those assignments were solely from how many test cases we passed. I think with a better feedback system, we would be able to improve a lot more. I also think that there was a huge difficulty jump between assignments and projects. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class definitely could have used some better organization. It was difficult to find resources at times, as they were distributed among the canvas course page, piazza, the 223 webpage, and the zoo. Also, the time frame for the final exam (which was not officially a final exam) and the last project were very unreasonable. The final was given the last week of classes, and then reading period was taken up by the 50 hour projecttime I could have used to study for the finals I had early in the following week. Also, the office hour scheduling was often inconvenient, with too few or no TAs at all on days nearing project deadlines. Finally, I would encourage the teaching staff to create new practice exams, given that the format was much different this year, and that the questions on the actual exam were much more difficult than the ones on the practice. Other than that, this class was fine throughout the semester. The first 3 projects were tough but reasonable in retrospect (but I do urge the professor to make his project instructions more clear!). The weekly assignments were more than reasonable and I would say there was good office hour support for those. The 50 free late points for the semester were very much appreciated and I would recommend that the course instructors continue this practice, especially during covid times. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The projects felt to be extremely difficult, and took me and my friends ~40h+ instead of the intended ~15-25. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: lectures were clear and I liked how diagrams were presented during lectures to help understand the concepts and various data structures 
Weakness: a lot of work <br/></div>
