<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class was like 90% busy work. The biggest weakness was the creation of our problem sets. They were almost all incredibly long, but not because they informed us of anything. The longest pset we had included a design portion for our final project (~2hrs of work), a written portion with 42 parts (the same 14 parts repeated three times with almost no change ~3hrs of work), and a coding portion.

Almost every pset had a coding portion. This would not have been so bad since everyone in the class is an upperclassperson who should have taken ENAS 130 to learn how to do the coding. However, this was consistently awful. Joran is an actual idiot (more on this later) and designed his code consistently with errors. One night I ended up on a zoom call with eight people trying to figure out code at 4am. Turns out it was literally impossible to get correct. On average, the coding took 7hrs. I have taken CS 223 and this code was more tedious and frustrating than that.

Onto the lectures. Like I said, Joran is an idiot and he doesn't plan his lectures in advance. He for some reason takes pride in this and lets the students know. This means you go through lecture with him deciding to do something and backtracking before it even makes sense. Worse than that, when he does actually have an idea of what he wants to do, you get to watch him flounder through the math and eventually never get it right.

The final project had no advanced analysis done by Joran, so whenever you had to ask him a question, he would say he didn't know and have us ask a TA.

The most time consuming problem set was one where we had to CAD our pistachio crusher. MENG 400 is not a prerequesite so many people had no idea what to do and he only gave an unplanned lecture on how to do CAD once. This made the assignment very difficult. Joran decided to make this part even harder by telling us two seperate times after the assignment was done that the parts we had available were limited so everyone had to redesign the structure multiple times. I would say I spent 30hrs CADing this stupid structure.

Everyone knows that Fluid Lab is the hardest MechE class. The seniors in this class said it rivaled fluids, but at least they learned things in the latter. Joran just had a hard class because he is incompetent.

The way this course could be improved is by hiring Adam (the TA) to teach the class. Whenever a question was asked that was even a little bit technical, Joran had to defer to Adam. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths:  Professor treats students with basic dignity and respect interpersonally.  Thank you for that.  If you lose this respect for your students, the department is screwed.

Weaknesses:  His psets are way too long.  These super long psets makes me feel like he doesn't value my time.  In A5 we did the same problem with 14 parts 3 times.  NOT NECESSARY.  There's a point at which the difficulty of the course increases without gaining anything.  I like the coding aspect though, maybe just have us do code as opposed to writing out 15 pages of work additionally (I counted and it sucked)? <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course contains A LOT of content so, to effectively learn and get through all of it, assignments and lectures need to be well organized. Many of the assignments contained errors (such as in the provided code) that made completing assignments difficult and set back our progress in the class. Fortunately, the professor was extremely accomodating, but better organization would still be preferred. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weakness: lecture goes kind of fast so be prepared to rewatch lectures (if possible). Strength: this is the best real-life hands-on ME class in my humble onion. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is one of the few in the MechE curriculum that actually felt useful for me as an engineer. As a tactile/visual learner, I really enjoyed how the class was centered around a design project and every analysis concept we learned was applied to our project. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked the content and lectures were very clear. Professor was always accessible by email/Zoom to discuss assignments. I loved getting to prototype at the end of the semester -- definitely a welcomed change during a semester of Zoom! And Joran is such a nice person to talk to in general.

The only downside on my end would be assignment workload. For most of the problem sets, we had both a coding and a paper portion. I would spend at least 15 hours trying to finish the assignment, often spending a lot of the time coding -- which I get the rationale for, but I felt like was too much, considering that most students know how to code/won't end up coding in MATLAB if they do. 

Sometimes assignments were a bit disorganized. At the end, it felt like a push to pull my designs together and order parts, especially because random aspects changed. Prof/TA's did their best, though, and were accommodating with extensions. They also allowed multiple opportunities to make up work and gave thorough feedback which was really helpful. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One of the great strengths of the course was the varied methods of lecturing material that Prof Booth employed. Some notes he took digitally, some he used powerpoints for, and there was even a lecture or two that he pointed a camera at the blackboard and used that. He also made sure to reference where the material was coming from in the textbook, which made it easier to look up later for clarification or formulas. Apparently there were changes made to the curriculum since last year. For the most part, I feel like they were successful, although there was significant trial and error in both material taught and homework content. The final design project was limited in its accessibility due to COVID-19 guidelines, but nonetheless it was awesome to be able to build a project with creative liberty and see it come together over the course of the semester. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - really cool assignments, really interesting content, I felt like this was one of the first MechE classes I took that helped me understand what it would actually be like to work as an engineer in the real world.
Weaknesses - the assignments can be really complex/long, and once the answer key for code we had to write was wrong which caused a lot of problems. However, Professor Booth and Adam (the TA) were really good about owning up to any mistakes they made and were super lenient when it came to extending deadlines/allowing resubmissions/etc. Also, and this wasn't any fault of the teaching staff, but it was kind of a bummer that due to COVID-10 we couldn't get the hands-on machining experience that typically accompanies the class. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: hands-on project gives you a chance to use parts and components you learn about in an actual project. Also gives you handy reference for calculations in engineering design (will probably be useful in senior design)

Weaknesses: Fairly disorganized, could be structured better. A lot of the negatives were mostly because of the course not being well adapted to remote learning. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The project-based nature of the course made it the course I cared about most this entire semester. Everything we did in lecture was applied in our weekly assignments that built towards our final product. I could understand what I was doing, and I actually liked it. The workload was initially too heavy but Prof. Booth, and the teaching staff were very attentive to student concerns and adjusted the syllabus accordingly. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths are the teaching staff (Joran, Adam, Rowan) always being extremely supportive, the interesting/engaging material, and the development of engineering intuition. A possible weakness was the pretty intensive Psets in the first few weeks (although this may just have been because I was new to coding, etc.), but I learned a ton from these so I cant really complain. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course is very practical, and lays out clear tools for engineering analysis.  The course topics due feel somewhat disjoint, and it would be helpful to spend a little more time on first principles and greater context. <br/></div>
