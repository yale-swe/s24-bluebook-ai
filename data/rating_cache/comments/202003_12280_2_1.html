<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would never pay attention to the actual methodology of the labs because I didn't need to. I would just extract the information I needed. Therefore, this was more of a physics class than a lab for me specifically. I understand though that there's not much that can be done about that though, since it is all virtual. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The amount of work needed to go into submitting a lab report and post lab is far higher than in-person labs. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I appreciate all of the effort that the teaching team put in to make sure students were able to have some form of physics lab albeit remotely. The kits were very well-done and useful. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the course instructors are really helpful and responsive, chill lab environment, lots of options in take-home assignments, lab reports are straightforward
Could be improved by having more experimental freedom in the labs. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths were that the materials were all very well prepared and distributed and labs were all very well adapted to online learning while trying to maintain as much actual experimenting as possible. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Given the current situation, I think this course was organized in the best way possible. The weekly classes to complete our assignments were typically divided into breakout rooms similar to how an in-person lab would work I presume. The post-lab activities were creative ways to further apply our understanding of the concepts learned in the labs. I particularly enjoyed watching the WTF videos Professor Cahn made. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Since we worked virtually, we watched videos of the experiments being conducted properly. This was very helpful in developing an understanding of proper experimental procedure.
Weaknesses: The Post Lab Activities (PLAs) were often very time consuming and vague so that they added unnecessary pressure and work, especially since they were due at the same time as the regular labs. The PLAs only asked you to work for around 2 hours, but in order to set up your experiment properly with limited resources and gather enough data (and 'correct' data at that), you had to spend much more time or else points would be taken off for lack of 'insight'. These felt like the course requiring you to do double the lab reports for half the course credit. *I believe this format has been altered for the spring 166L course based on student feedback* <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Though the videos and lab handouts were very effective at communicating the spirit, if not the letter, of a physics lab course, in the virtual format the presence of the TA added little, and the course would likely have gone smoother if we had spent the entirety of it in breakout rooms. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Ample opportunity to ask questions to the TF and/or one of the course professors <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths were the teaching team and the quality of the videos, and also the couple times we did lab experiments together when they were simple. Maybe one weakness was sometimes when the experiments they included in the kit were too complicated and/or didn't work for me, I would have to panic and have to wait for others' results or the TA to know what to do. Maybe another weakness was how awkward the breakout rooms would get sometimes as it ended up just silence until one of us would ask for answers or results from each other. I DO see the need for breakout rooms though, because all of us in one meeting room would make it hard for the TA to attend to our individual/group questions. A major weakness: Sometimes it would get a bit long to sit in the same place watching physics videos or doing lab calculations/data recording for 3 hours. A shorter lab activity (max 2 hours) would be preferred. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I love how considerate the instructors were. The workload was a bit high at first with a lab report and the post lab due in the same week in certain weeks. However, the instructors were super understanding and eventually lessened the load. I felt like they spent so much time trying to send lab equipment but because it arrived so late, I didn't really get to use it. Not their fault though. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: did well given the circumstances of virtual learning and were very, very on top of ensuring every student in class received a physical kit to work with if they wanted to which must have been a logistical nightmare. TAs and professors very responsive and helpful in and out of lab, pretty clear with what was expected from assignments save for the post lab experiments which were very low pressure but almost too freeform.

weaknesses: some components were repetitive but once again could not really do much in making a physics lab go virtual. <br/></div>

I thought the professors and TFs were very considerate and always spent time answering questions. I learned a lot through the in-person activities, especially if they were more hands-on. The weaknesses are that I sometimes felt like I did not get very much out of the lab if we just watched videos and did calculations. Labs like the gyroscope lab was more informational since we could explore phenomena. Post-lab activities (PLAs) also caused a lot of stress because it was unclear what was expected and seemed very much open in the air. I spent more time than what was indicated just to collect data and make sure I had enough. I also thought that PLAs did not really add to my learning experience. I also wish that answer keys would be given for the quizzes or the practice practical. Otherwise, physics lab was very informational. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths were being able to do our own experiments with the kits and that the workload was reasonable. The professors clearly wanted to make this course engaging despite the virtual format. The main weakness was that sometimes directions were confusing or unclear, and also I didn't really receive feedback on my lab reports and post lab activities since many of them still have not been graded so it was frustrating to not be able to correct mistakes in future lab reports since grades were so delayed. For example, only my first post-lab activity has been graded which was due in September, with no comments about why points were taken off, and we had one due every other week of the semester. Therefore, I have no idea if I did the rest of them correctly or if I made the same mistakes on each one, and I don't even know what my mistakes were on the first one were. This was not a problem in every section, but having so few assignments graded in my section was very frustrating. <br/></div>

The kits really helped me get hands-on experience, and the TAs were very helpful during class time. Also, I liked the small group break-out group format because that was much easier to ask questions. I think early on in the course, the expectations for what a lab report or PLA looked like could have been a little more clear, and an example report would have been helpful. After the first lab, however, I understood the expectations. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of this course is that the instructors cared about the class and were quite enthusiastic. However, there were many weaknesses. First, the post lab assignments were unhelpful. After writing a full lab report and finishing the experiment, we had to complete busy work assignments. These post lab assignments taught me nothing I hadn't learned from the lab, and took well more than an hour to complete. The professors insisted the assignments shouldn't take long, but in order to finish assignments and receive full credit, we had to spend much more time than the professors suggested. Otherwise we would lose points for leaving out details or not watching the entire video series. Second, Professor Cahn's emails, while funny at the beginning of the semester, quickly became immensely frustrating. It's very stressful to receive an incredibly long email from a professor and not even understand what the professor was trying to convey. These emails took time to read and decipher, and often conveyed important information about assignment changes and deadlines. I often had to email my teaching fellow to figure out what was required of me, and my teaching fellow often couldn't tell. Clear and concise communication is essential. Finally, the sindYkits were fairly annoying-- they were large, difficult to pack and unpack, took up space in our small dorm rooms, weren't used very much at all, and required us to pick them up in person multiple times in a semester with a global pandemic. In short, I really do feel that the professors meant well, but I don't think they fully realized how stressful poor communication, complicated physical pick-ups, and changing assignment dates and deadlines are. <br/></div>

This was appreciated because it allowed for students to develop their skills creating an experiment rather than always playing it safe to get the best results. This courses biggest weakness was occasional technological glitches and the fact that some labs were not ideal for at home experiments.

Weaknesses: I just dislike the amount of hours that you would have to spend each week just to prepare and write notes/reports. Not to mention the post lab assignments and the weekly quizzes that we had on top of that. In some lab modules, the tasks were very repetitive and it felt like we were just filling time which I could have used for something more productive. I also dislike the break-out rooms mode of instruction, as we would all just shut the cameras and the microphones and work independently. It would have been better if we stayed in one Zoom room, with the TA available at all times. In addition, it would have been helpful if TAs would brush over the experiments at the start of each lecture to speed up the work done. <br/></div>

The videos we used to collect data from were always interesting to watch, and I really appreciated the thoughtfulness. It was a fair amount of work to do lab reports and post-lab assignments, but not as much work as several other lab courses. I liked having break-out rooms with other students where we could ask each other questions, check answers, or call the TF for assistance. <br/></div>

I really like Professor Cahn a lot because he made the course so entertaining and more fun, and he never hesitated to challenge us to dive deeper into the lab and try new experiments and learn more. 

I think it could be improved by reducing some of the work at the start of the course, like what happened in the last few weeks. As a course of half a credit, I think it demanded a bit too much (at least at the beginning) because I essentially did every lab twice at first: once during class and once after to complete everything I didn't finish/understand the first time. It felt like I was repeating a lot of information from my notebook in my lab report, which felt unnecessary. I suppose it may have somewhat helped in teaching me to write scientific paper in a succinct way, but repeating the information from my notebook in a lab report every week felt redundant. <br/></div>

I think one way it could be improved is taking into account struggles with the SindeyKit and time constraints.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I want to preface all the comments I will make by saying that I acknowledge that it was an insanely hard and peculiar task to try to navigate the intricacies of structuring a lab course in an online format. I believe that the fact that this course was possible is testament to the fact that the educators running this course are extremely passionate about helping students in any way they can, and I sincerely appreciate that. Having said that, I think it is simply impossible to replicate a lab course in an online format. Contrary to other courses I had this semester, this course did not feel feasible taking place online. First and foremost, I found the lab sessions themselves to be extremely draining over Zoom. Having students sit in front of a computer on a Zoom call for 3 hours straight is definitely something that is not sustainable. I found myself extremely drained many times throughout the semester, and I believe that that definitely took away from my learning experience in the course. Many times the fact that we were sitting in a Zoom room even felt counter productive. For many of the labs in my breakout room we would just sit silent working individually on the lab tasks at hand, seeing no apparent reason why we had to sit in front of the call working. Moreover, I know that this is a problem with many lab courses, but this was one of the times that I felt that the 0.5 credit was not sufficient for the work I was putting into this course. I would spend hours and hours during the week attending the lab sessions and working on the lab reports and the PLAs  more time than I frankly spent on a lot of my 1-credit classes  and this class still awarded me only one credit. I know this is by no means the fault of the instructors of this course, but I think it is important to acknowledge that lab courses like this are very time-intensive. On that note, I believe that the format of having PLAs as an additional assignment  this semester make this course all that more hectic. The workload was significant as it was and having to spend additional hours during the week working on the PLA was definitely something that added a lot of stress and took a lot of time. When it comes to the grading scheme itself, I believe that many times I would lose points for things that were not extremely clear and that I would spend hours and hours trying to improve on those mistakes by polishing my reports, seeing no tangible change reflected in the grades I would get back, losing the same points on things like insight. Again, I want to stress that this was a Herculean task, and that the fallacies I found in the lab were certainly not things that the instructors were to blame for. If I had to make one board suggestions for the next semester of the course that would be to try and be cognizant of the time that the students have to spend in front of a screen doing online school. It may end up being better to cut out things like the PLAs altogether, as they make students spend more time in the course than they would spend during a normal year. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One strength of this course was that we worked on experiments as groups, promoting teamwork with classmates and also making it easier to solve problems as they arose. Also, the workload was very fair, especially compared to general chemistry lab. The TFs were very helpful and I also think the grading was fair for the most part.

The only weakness of this course was maybe the lab practical exam. It felt a little rushed and it was kind of a stressful experience. However, for 166L, I think they are eliminating the practical exam component altogether. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lab packets did a great job of introducing the fundamental material and equations to allow us to complete the labs. I really enjoyed the pre-lab videos and my TA was very nice and willing to answer any questions throughout the lab. Sometimes it was tough to get through the 3 hour lab just sitting in my room, but this was not a fault of the course itself and more a difficulty with taking a lab online. I still think this is probably better than condensing the live lab sessions/having more take home activities on our own time because it was nice to ask questions to the TA/other classmates in real time. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was well-organized, and the selected teaching staff effectively supported student learning. The kits sent to us were very fun to conduct labs with, but logistically it seemed very difficult to distribute kits to so many people across the world. At times certain lab procedures seemed to be somewhat repetitive or even tedious at times, but perhaps this was an artifact of the virtual world we live in. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really wished I got to do the labs in person. The SindeYkits and the PLA allowed us to do some hands-on activities, but they seemed repetitive because we already did the labs during our assigned lab day. The chemistry department had in-person labs. Could this be implemented for physics lab? <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I felt this course had many weaknesses. Namely, there was so much work! The pre-lab quizzes, lab reports, PLA's. It was very time-consuming to put together full-point-worthy DIY's using the kit...sometimes, I got points off for not "improving the experiment"; there were few feasible improvements I could come up with and what with setting up the experiment and writing up the report, took well over 2 hours!!!! Overall, I felt that the kits did NOT teach me anything, other than how to stay up late. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I think the best way to describe Professor Cahn is whimsical. His enthusiasm for teaching really shone through this semester. The instructors were all very creative and worked hard to make sure we still got a physics lab experience despite the COVID-19-related challenges. The pre-recorded lectures were great as well as the sidneYkits.

Weaknesses: The organization was sometimes unclear given the virtual structure (a LOT of announcements). <br/></div>
