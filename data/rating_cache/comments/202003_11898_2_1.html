<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Prof Vaccaro is a good lecturer and makes pchem as interesting as it gets I guess. The weekly problem sets, though a little long, were reasonable. The first midterm was too long so he corrected that for the second midterm and final by making them shorter, which was appreciated. 
Weaknesses: Lectures are quite fast/dense and it would be helpful if Prof Vaccaro would pause for questions. Also it would be nice if we could drop one pset since there was one every week. Meeting during reading period was not fun. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: 1) You will learn a lot in this class. I have a deep conceptual and mathematical understanding of the material. 2) There is support in this class - use the instructor office hours, TAs for pset help, peer tutor reviews before the exams. The textbook is also great. 3) The documentation for this class is BEAUTIFUL. Professor Vaccaro's slides are colorful and clear and contain all the information you need. I appreciate how he would walk through every single step on the slides. The additional documents he posts to Canvas are also useful. And the pset answer keys are really clear! Clearly a lot of thought has gone into this class. 4) The extra credit on the later psets was great practice for the exams, and I really appreciated it.

Weaknesses: 1) The psets are long and tedious. Sometimes the psets will have parts a-k, and sometimes you'll be repeating a calculation you already did two or three times. While I understand the value in repetition, this adds up and doesn't contribute to your conceptual understanding of the material. The psets are so long that there isn't enough time in section to address everybody's confusion. Also some of that confusion is because 2) material covered in Friday lecture will be needed for the pset due Friday at 5pm. Maybe pushing that deadline to Saturday would be nice. 3) I wish we had exam answer keys - there wasn't enough time in section to go over the entire exam. 4) There is value in having to go through the equation sheet and understand all the equations for yourself. But there is nothing like having 10 min left in an exam and being unable to find the formula for the Joule-Thomson coefficient. Even slight grouping of topics or headings would save a lot of stress on the exam. 5) Lecture is dense. This is ok. It is less ok during reading week. It is very difficult to try to internalize old material while also learning a lot of new material - I ended up having to watch the reading week lectures 3 times each to get a grasp on the material, which not only impacted my ability to study for my pchem final but also for my other finals. The class is quite slow in the beginning  (first two weeks or so) - what if that part was faster to avoid this reading week lecture? <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A huge strength is that the entire course is mostly structured around the textbook. This makes it easy to refer to the text if you ever need anything and have your problem solved. We were also given plenty of resources to contextualize topics we were learning about, which were uploaded to Canvas. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think it's a pretty standard course for physical chemistry and drills down on the concepts it covers. The material was effectively presented and paced. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course material is presented very clearly during lecture, but a large amount of information is given in a short period of time. A slower pace would greatly improve this course. The PSETs are difficult and time consuming, but they are a decent indicator as to what the exams will be like. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths of this course is wonderful TA's and an available professor. Weaknesses include too much information and not enough explanation and tying ideas to the big picture. Exams are unnecessarily difficult and soul crushing. Additionally, the problem sets were unnecessarily long and arduous, often covering material we had not learned in class yet. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â All of the instructors and teaching fellows were excellent, the content was compelling and often put into a real-world context, and the grading weights were definitely fair. However, a couple of aspects of this course really didn't work for me and I'm sure many other students as well. For one, the first exam was borderline unfair with the amount of time we were given. Prof. Vaccaro definitely realized this and amended it with the following two tests, but I would've appreciated if that didn't happen in the first place. Also, the strategy of having homework based on the next week's content did not work for me, as I often just robotically walked through the PSets without actually understanding why I did what I did. I would've definitely also liked to be given any sort of practice material before the first exam, which was again amended for the second exam and the final via the extra credit problems. Lastly, I think the instructors did a good job preventing the environment of the class from getting too toxic or competitive, but they definitely need to not hire peer tutors that will send the exam distributions from the previous year in an attempt to "scare" us into studying. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I enjoyed the material of Chem332a! Professor Vaccaro writes excellent problem sets and demonstrates his care for the material. He is willing to meet with any students and discuss chemistry. Additionally, his Powerpoints were excellent. They were clear and engaging. That being said, I have one criticism of this course: NO LECTURES DURING READING WEEK. The fact we had two lectures (Monday and Wednesday) before our final on Friday was ridiculous. I do not understand why that was necessary. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course has so much help, just go to discussion sections and office hours and everyone is willing to help you understand the topics. Highly recommended that you create your own study group, so that you can guide and help each other work through the dense problem sets. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I don't particularly like the textbook (Atkins) and think the course would benefit from a different book like Simon &amp; McQuarrie. I think the course would benefit from a different structure - maybe spending the first couple of classes on mathematics to familiarize students with the kind of partial derivative/path variable/etc. thinking that PChem requires. There was a big disparity between the difficulty of the Psets  (which were time consuming but very easy) and the difficulty of the exams. Finally, I wish the course content was better motivated -- I don't really understand the significance or utility of some of the material we learned. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The tests were fair, but there was not a lot of practice for them. It was one of those classes where the teacher gives normal homework and the exam is nothing like it. Also you NEED a good foundation in math <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course brings up some very interesting concepts but unfortunately most of the lectures are dry mathematical derivations that lack proper context and explanation as to what is actually happening. You feel somewhat confident that you understand the material but then you get absolutely destroyed by the exams and realize how much you don't understand. Everything in the class asks for something different. Lectures speak mainly in math and don't give good definitions and explanations for what is really happening (the big picture). Psets are lots of computations and draw directly on formulas. Exams are require that you understand what is really going on along each step of certain processes/theories. There is no cohesion between the three. As a result, I am walking away from this class without not knowing anything concrete, which is really unfortunate. I would recommend that in lectures, the professor should focus much less on tedious derivations (including those as supplements for people interested) and rather emphasize definitions (what does enthalpy actually mean compared to internal energy, what does the Born Solvation model measure) and the big picture things (talking about how heat, work, internal energy, and enthalpy change in certain situations). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Vaccaro did a wonderful job providing lecture slides for every class, helpful supplementary documents for some topics, and detailed Pset solutions. He always stayed after class to answer student questions and was willing to meet outside of his scheduled office hours if there was a conflict. The TAs and peer tutors were fantastic as well! I felt that this course was very organized and there were many opportunities all throughout the week (and some of the weekend) to get help. I didn't engage much with other students in the course this semester, but this is not the fault of the course itself and more so the nature of online learning in a lecture-style course. Perhaps there could be some breakout sessions in class in which students would work on an easy example problem, but honestly I think the lectures were efficient and helpful as they were, and students could always ask a question during class if confusion came up. Another way this course could be improved is with some sample conceptual questions before exams as a sort of baseline knowledge check. As Professor Vaccaro and the TAs/peer tutors suggested many times, the homework problems were helpful to review, as they often resembled the longer-response questions on the exam. However, sometimes I was hoping to do a brief check of my intuition/basic ideas that might help especially with the true-false questions on the exam. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Overall, this class was one of the most organized courses I've ever taken. Professor Vaccaro's lectures and presentations are extremely thorough and detailed. He posts all the presentations and the corresponding in-class notes from each lecture. There are also supplementary handouts for certain topics. The midterms and weekly psets are tough, but there is ample support available for students via the teaching fellows, peer tutors, and Vaccaro's office hours. <br/></div>
