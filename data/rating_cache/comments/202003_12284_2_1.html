<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: lectures were very well-recorded and the professor explained the concepts very clearly. Exams were fair, and there was plenty of opportunity to get help from TAs, Peer Tutors, and the professor herself. I also really liked the group-work structure, where we all made groups of 5-6 and worked on assignments together. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The recorded lectures were amazing, and so helpful. I feel like this class was well structured, and despite the circumstances, I learned so much. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures are very engaging, and the provided notes are thorough, so studying and working through problem sets and tests is both easy and reinforces the material. However, problem sets can lean a little on the long side, particularly for a class conducted remotely. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: The professor. Prof S is smart. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of this course is hands down Dr. Steinacker. She is brilliant, caring, and truly invests herself in the course. I wish I could have taken it in person! The psets are long, however, they are helpful. If you work hard in this course you will be successful. Test corrections are wonderful -- they really help decrease the anxiety from test day and encourage engagement with the material. I learned so much from doing test corrections!!! <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths were that Professor Steinacker made each lecture engaging despite the recorded format and was always there to support students and answer questions. The psets were long but definitely helped me to learn and understand the material and also helped me prepare for the exams. Given the circumstances of the semester I can't think of any weaknesses, Professor Steinacker put in a lot of effort to make this a good course. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought that the lectures were delivered very well, but I think that we could get feedback a little sooner on the problem sets. It took a few weeks for our first one to be graded, and by that point, I felt behind in the class because I wasn't able to use the comments from my first pset until about the 3rd or 4th one. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is incredible and really well suited to facilitate learning. Professor Steinacker really cares about her students and puts so much time and effort into making the lectures/demonstrations and helping you until you fully understand the concepts. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Lectures are clear and nicely segmented to accommodate for online learning. Steinacker definitely put a lot of effort into making the course well adapted for online learning and I appreciate that a lot. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The class was very engaging despite being being pre-recorded due to class participation. There were many opportunities for help and access to the professor. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Steinacker is amazing but this course is really hard. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was extremely engaging, and I learned a lot from every lecture. The exam reviews were extremely helpful. My only suggestion is to provide solutions to the exams. Otherwise, Professor Steinacker and the TFs are some of the most helpful teaching team ever. They really care about your learning. For example, rather than not talk about the problem set like other professors, they openly offer any help. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Steinacker is great. She cares about students and tries her best not to make the course stressful. She has lots of her own office hours in addition to all the peer tutor office hours. The material is difficult and there's a lot of work, but there's also a lot of support from Prof Steinacker and the peer tutors. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures have been well planned out and incredibly informative. The office hour schedule was the greatest strength of the course as it allowed for interaction with the professor and TAs. Recorded review sessions were also helpful. There was a great deal of information to get through, but it was handled well. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course load is very high, which mainly presented itself through the p-sets. However, take advantage of the office hours and please don't wait until the last moment to do the work. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: accessibility for students in other time zones/with conflicting classes due to pre-recorded lectures, the sheer number of available office hours, and Professor Steinacker's demonstrations

Weakness: lack of office hours on the day before the psets were due, so if you had to start the psets later during the week, these office hours weren't an available resource <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Fun
Weaknesses: Huge time commitment <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I just really enjoy learning physics in general, I think all the concepts are really interesting. This is a really good intro class that sets the foundation for future physics and STEM majors. 

The lectures are recorded and non-synchronous, and the only opportunity to ask questions is through office hours. This made learning some of the more difficult concepts more challenging. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Steinacker is great and very kind. She really tried to encourage participation and student understanding by building participation questions into the recorded lectures (this forced us to watch the lectures on the day of each class period, although I would have appreciated if they were due just a day later). The study groups she had us form were also very helpful. TAs hold office hours almost all the time so it's very easy to get help. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course satisfies requirements, and offers sufficient office hours such that the psets are made possible through brute force. However, it is simply not enjoyable for many students, and I doubt any intro-level physics course, including 170, would be. The biggest weakness of this course is the structure of the psets, as it typically lags a few weeks behind the actual taught material, making it difficult to relate the week's lectures to the homework. The biggest strength is Professor Steinacker's enthusiasm for the course, which almost made it bearable, but if you are like me (a student in a vaguely related life sciences major with plans to enter a graduate program thoroughly not based on physics), there is simply no good option for intro physics at Yale. In regards to this course compared to 170, I can confirm from students in each class that they both wish they took the other. This is slightly harder than 170, but the problems can be solved with logic, while 170 is more esoteric but slightly lighter on the math. Honestly, I considered changing majors to avoid a physics requirement period, and all I can say in favor of this class is that its lenient grading policies will allow you to succeed (or at least pass) after a huge time investment.

This course will be the most time-intensive you take, unless you are also taking something on the level of organic chem or math 120. Plan accordingly. <br/></div>

The workload is pretty high, but it pays off by the end in a much greater understanding of the concepts. It's helpful that Steinacker encourages collaboration with other students, as this is a very difficult class to get through by yourself. Sometimes, homework problems would be incredibly hard, but study halls and office hours were super helpful and there was really no reason to struggle through those difficult problems alone. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course needed improvement in that occasionally the questions that were on the exams were tougher than expected, but I would be more willing to say that is a weakness on my part rather than the courses. Furthermore, if the questions were harder than expected there was always an opportunity to go over them afterwards and learn from them for the future. This course was strong in the areas of availability to the professor, comprehensiveness of how the lectures were formatted and where we could access the information needed to help us succeed, as well as usefulness of what we learned. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths include the robustness of the teaching team. During a virtual semester, it was super helpful to have TFs or ULAs available to help at a plethora of times throughout the day.

From the recorded lecture side, I particularly enjoyed the ability to rewatch, slow, and speed up the videos. It could be improved by providing closed captions, as I used it in another course while studying for exams and it provided a really nice additional level of synthesizing information. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the course promotes a deep understanding of the underlying material, but is unbalanced. The material that is on the homeworks focuses less on understanding the concepts and more on raw ability for mathematics. I felt constantly overwhelmed by problems that seemed not to test my knowledge of physics but my resolve to slog through a problem whose answer has seven terms and cannot be simplified. I also do not feel like I was taught. The recorded format made it impossible to directly interact or help students engage with the pacing of the course. I did appreciate the many study halls. They were what I wish the class was like. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One strength of this course is that you can learn a lot by completing the weekly problem sets. They help you stay up to date on course concepts and reinforce approaches that are important when taking exams. Also, the TAs are very helpful and the availability of office hours throughout the week was useful in getting help on challenging problem set questions. 

I think the only downside is that this course is pretty math-based, and so I think if you like conceptual physics then this class may not be for you. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Almost nothing could go wrong with Professor Adriane Steinacker, the queen of physics teachers. Her brilliant mind and sweet heart will definitely help you tackle any (if not all) problems/difficulties/curiosities that might arise in PHYS 180. Just religiously attend her office hours, watch (attend?) her lectures on time, and start the psets early. Things will be in good hands!

Pro tip: I feel it is really helpful if you have AT LEAST SOME experience with physics before taking this class. Even though it is designed with "no-exposure" students in mind, those with prior acquaintance with the topics in the class will defo cruise through the class (provided that they put in the necessary effort, of course!). I am even tempted to say that at some points the class could even be considered a "gut" for you. So if you can, try to use Khan academy or some "student-friendly" textbook to briefly acquaint yourself with Mechanics/Waves topics. You'll thank yourself later for that! <br/></div>
