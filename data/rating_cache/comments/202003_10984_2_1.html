<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would say one weakness was keeping the engagement at some points because the lecture style became a little bit hard to concentrate sometimes, but a major strength of this course was definitely the professor and TAs in the course. They sighted such a great environment for learning and improving writing skills. <br/></div>
</div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The content, on paper, is interesting. I also liked the easygoing nature of the class. 
Weaknesses: Assignments and assessments feel like high-school type busywork. Doing the review papers and quizzes was endlessly confusing due to the lack of guidance and even contradictory instructions from the teaching staff. The class overall felt disorganized, my TF was nearly as clueless as we were about assignments (although she was self aware about it), and I felt like lectures repeated the readings rather than giving new insights.

For the papers specifically, the instructions were massively unclear: we were told to use outside evidence, but not rely on it; to provide our own opinions, but not be too opinionated; to write out a thoughtful critique, but only in 2-3 pages; and this only for 5% of our grades each! As opposed to the quizzes, on which I spent less than 1 hour, but are somehow worth twice that. The effort vs effect on our grades is disproportional. 

The general feeling for me and a lot of people that I've talked to is that this is a very mediocre course. I don't feel like the feedback I ever got was helpful, and I certainly don't feel like what I learned in this class is stuff that I couldn't have gotten out of a book about the class' topics. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Lectures are very clear and straightforward, though I can tell that Professor Kao's lecture style would have been more engaging in person. One weakness is the actual slides Professor Kao uses and shares, because they have little information on them that help guide the lectures. Additionally, discussion sections would have been more engaging if there was prompted discussion instead of a reflection over the readings. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Lectures are really fun in this class. Professor Kao lets discussion flow naturally, even though it's mostly her talking. She gauges student energy well and will let us explore another topic if we have questions. Section also really helped us to clarify anything we didn't understand and discuss readings to be sure we interpreted them accurately. I can't think of anything that needs improvement. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Kao and the TFs were amazing - both were super helpful and willing to answer any questions about the content or any assignment. In addition, they were understanding of the unusual situations brought upon by COVID and flexible enough to allow students to thrive despite the circumstances. Section, though lacking in structure, was more fun that way as it allowed us as students to bring what we needed/wanted to discuss to the table rather than being forced into discussing a topic we didn't enjoy over zoom. 
Weaknesses: Content could go a little more in-depth, though I guess this is nitpicking since it is an intro level course. Some assignments could use extra guidance - perhaps some sort of memo that provided instructions on how to complete the assignment rather than waiting for the students to ask about it. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked that this course had very intriguing readings and research that pertained to the discussion topics. I thought that all that we learned was applicable to the real world, given the amount of critical analysis that students had to learn. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I loved the mini quiz and mini essays format of this course. It wasn't overwhelming and it served as checkpoints to make sure I caught up and genuinely understood what we were learning. The only thing I'd say to improve is the instructions for the mini essays; I was totally lost on what to do for the first one and I appreciated my teachers being very available to explain and help me out but I think there should be a document with tips on organization to begin with <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This was unfortunately the most disorganized course I have ever taken. We didn't keep up with the module plan and I was always confused about which module we were supposed to be in and which readings were due. It made it really difficult to stay organized mentally with the different course material. I also felt like there wasn't much information in most of the lectures, and a lot of time was wasted in breakout rooms that were unhelpful. For the lack of material we learned, I was shocked about how many assignments there were in this class. Four review papers, four quizzes, a video project, and a long final paper felt like far too much. Also, throughout the semester, there was never clarification about the expectations for the review papers and many of us felt repeatedly confused. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course were the content of lectures, the readings, and the assignments. Professor Kao and the TFs were also big strengths for this course!

I think one weakness of this class is that sometimes lectures and readings didn't match up with what was on the syllabus. I sometimes ended up doing a reading a week early, or showing up to class with no clue I was supposed to have done the reading. It would have been really helpful to have more clear communication about what was actually required each week. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The topic and the progression of the material were great but I wish that we were taught to think more critically. The assignments only allowed us to regurgitate information rather than to think cricfally. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think that this class was very disorganized. It was hard to know what readings we should be doing for what date and the assignments were very unstructured. I never knew what was expected and it seemed as if the teacher and the TA did not have a clear set of expectations either. It always seemed as if they were not on the same page, with different people saying different information. However, they were all very sweet and the material was engaging. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Many of the lectures were a repeat of the readings, but the readings were very interesting. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course did well to give students both a historical and modern overview of major topics in the field of sociology. I felt that the lectures did well to disseminate a large amount of information within a limited amount of time. I also felt that students had many opportunities to form their own thoughts and opinions around the material and to express them in written and verbal formats. I do wish that there had been more opportunity for collaborative work, but I understand that this was hard given the virtual format. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: the live recorded lectures were great because I could always go back and review. 

Weakness: I though the course would be a bit more interesting if we had a module or section to think about solutions or what people are doing about these disparities. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One strength of this course was the organization of the course. The layout of all the topics and discussions was extremely beneficial for learning. One weakness was that there were not many breakout room discussions to virtually interact with my peers. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths are that there were a healthy variety of assignments with each taking a fraction of your grade rather than a large chunk. A weakness is that there was little guidance for the final paper and it was difficult to figure out how to complete it properly. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Content presented in an interesting and engaging way. 
Weakness: Not a lot of guidance on the critical reviews we needed to write <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The topics are relevant, important, and delivered in a very engaging manner. The response papers were useful in helping us engage with the text (I do think the course would benefit from having 3 response papers instead of 4). I can't really think of weaknesses, the course was truly great with a wonderful professor, fantastic TAs and a really great community of my classmates. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Some parts of the course seem rather intuitive and not that interesting compared to others. One of the strengths is that instructors were very considerate of students <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class was a significant amount of reading, but the assignments were not stressful, and the final and group projects were well explained and graded I felt correctly and fairly. Having recorded lectures of the class was nice to have all of the information available at all times, and the way discussion sections were run because of COVID, at least with my TF, were ideal for this uncertain time. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths-
- discussion/section was really helpful in understanding the readings more 

weaknesses-
- it was hard to keep track of what the professor was talking about in class, the slides/info went too quickly and you wouldn't be able to take notes <br/></div>
