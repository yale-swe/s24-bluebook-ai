<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Not unless they are ready for a challenge, much more so than the reputation of discrete math at Yale would prepare them for, or they absolutely need to take algorithms next semester. The course is, in my opinion, well taught and interesting, but many problems given rely more on strokes of genius than on understanding of material taught in class. However, those who enjoy competitive counting problems should like this course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would only recommend this course if: 1) it's required for your major, 2) you're extremely good at math, i.e. able to tackle USAMO/IMO-type problems, or 3) you're prepared to work extremely hard. This course is much more difficult/rigorous with Prof. Pohoata, and I would not take it if you want a gut or are just a little interested in the course content. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Hmm... if you're experienced with proof-based math and maybe competition-type math, I think the class will be pretty manageable. As someone who hadn't done proofs before, and is not a math major, I found it pretty difficult. My understanding is that the course was more difficult than usual with Prof. Pohoata. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I wouldn't recommend it to most of my friends. Of course, if you're one of those people who took 120 and your principal thought was "math at Yale is too easy," then sure. You're one of the people who will succeed in this course. Knock yourself out. 

If you're a person like me, I would be willing to take this course with careful consideration/caution. Like me means: 
--this course can count towards your major 
--you like math and were pretty good at it in high school, but you've never taken a proof-based math course or competed in math competitions or something. You're a very logical thinker but might struggle with using math in a "creative" way   
--if something is explained half-decently, you can get the general gist on the first try, without having to get it explained again 
--you get mildly stressed about grades but not super stressed. (You won't freak out if you end up with a B+ or an A-) 
--you have enough time in your schedule to set everything aside for a couple days and grind for the midterms 

that was me and although I was tempted to drop the course after the first midterm, I stuck it out and didn't regret it (mostly). If you're basically like that or better than that (e.g. you actually can be creative with math, I envy you) then you can probably take the course. Sometimes the workload can be stressful but since there's only 6 psets, you mostly just have to a) go to office hours and b) be prepared to grind for the exams. However, be warned that two of the smartest people I know dropped this course after the first midterm and didn't regret it. So, maybe spare yourself the trouble if you're on the fence. 

(Oh also, this is already super long but if not for Joon Lee, I would've def dropped this course and it probably would've been the right decision. So if there's any way, maybe try to suss out if the peer tutors are good beforehand.) <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course under Prof. Pohoata was difficult at times but manageable. The office hours were very helpful towards completing the psets and the midterms were difficult but solvable. The final was unexpectedly very hard and I'm hoping the curve will be a generous one. In previous years I believe that &gt;50% of the class receives an A-/A, so although the topics we covered were mostly theorem/proof based, there is a nice cushion and plenty of support to fall on. The notes were well formatted and easy to follow, and the material on the midterms was easier than the psets/class notes. The topics covered include basic combinatorics, proof methods (pigeonhole, induction, etc.), graph theory, extremal graph theory, and the probabilistic method. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Yes! Cosmin was a great professor, and the material is super interesting. If you're comfortable with proof-based mathematics, I'd say this course is well worth taking. I wouldn't take this class if you want to learn how to apply a lot of these concepts elsewhere. I think there are courses in the CS department, for example, that are more suitable for that aim. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course may be better with another professor but definitely not with Pohoata. I do not feel like I have absorbed any of the course materials. The only information I Learned was from watching YouTube videos from other professors. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would recommend against taking this course, at least in its current format. While I believe the instructor is very qualified and a nice guy overall, I think the disparity between what is taught and what is expected on the problems is rough, to say the least. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Maybe. The content and homework should be typical for math courses, but the exam difficult is very high. Be expected to put above average hours (6+) per take home examination if looking to solve all of the problems. Professor also goes pretty quickly over material, so make time to attend office hours as needed <br/></div>

I thought I at least enjoyed math before this course and was decent at it. I learned otherwise.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â No, unless you absolutely need this class to fulfill a requirement for a major or for graduation. If you are a CS major, please take 202. The emotional and mental toll this class takes is not worth it. If you love math or want to take a really challenging course, then take this class. If you don't, then do not take it. I came into the class without any prior proof writing experience, but you will do much better in the class if you are familiar with proof writing. This was genuinely the hardest class I've ever taken, and I only managed to push through because of the peer tutors and the support system I had found in the class. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â If you are a stellar math student who is familiar with proofs and/or completed and loved math 230/231, go for it. This class has proofs, six problem psets, and exams with long time limits just like 230. However, if you took 230/231, felt a little shaky with theorems beyond Bolzano-Weierstrass, and are simply looking for a fun math class to enjoy, I would NOT recommend Math 244. The exams alone can consume a weekend, and the problem sets and lectures are just not very rewarding or informative if you can not allocate 5-10 hours into trial-and-error style problem solving. I took this course as a fun follow-up to Math 230/231, and (in my opinion,) it was almost just as difficult but was no where near as engaging. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I am unsure if I would recommend because this was probably the hardest class I've ever taken at Yale (difficulty went up substantially from other semesters taught by other professors; I've heard from friends that previous classes didn't even get to graph theory, which was a bulk of this class). You should probably only take this if you need to fulfill a requirement (which is what I did for the BS in S&amp;DS). However, I will say that I did learn a lot, especially because this was my first proof-based class, but it was kind of like getting waterboarded. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â No. I feel really bad saying this since this is Cosmin's first year of teaching, but this is one of the worst classes I've taken at Yale. The class is unorganized and the material sometimes seem to be coming out of nowhere. The problem sets and take-home exams are difficult. The professor lives in another world of math, where things that are "trivial" for him are things that make students cry at 3am. You will have nightmares of this class. Your dreams will become you solving math problems. You'll find out that even when you're sleeping, you can actually be productive and find proofs to the problem sets/exams in your dreams. 

I really think Cosmin has a lot of potential to make this class really engaging. The material in the first half seduced me to taking this class until the end. The second half was interesting as well, but I felt the guiding vision of the class was gone. I've always been a math person, but this class has made me sympathize with the people back in high school who always asked "when will you ever use math in your life?". Towards the end, I lost almost all my motivation to keep learning the material. The topics just felt too obscure. 

To those of you who won't heed our words, you are a masochist. Then again, I think the class can be astronomically better next semester if Cosmin really reworks the class, creates slides for the material (his handwriting is hard to read), and connect more obscure topics to more general topics. The class really has potential, but from my experience this semester, I suggest -- no, I beg you -- not to take this class. 

Joon Lee, the ULA, was really the lifeline for a lot of students in this course. Please thank this angel sent from heaven. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would recommend this course to students interested in math for sure, especially if they are also interested in computer science, since a lot of what we learn in this course has applications in computer science. It can also be a good standalone math course to take for someone who isn't really interested in taking lots of math courses, but does want to have some exposure to it, since this course doesn't build off of material from any previous courses or lead into another course. However, I as a math major found it to be quite challenging, so it could definitely be overwhelming for students who don't have a ton of experience with college-level math, and with proof-writing especially. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Probably not unless it's required for your major. This class was not what I had been led to believe it was. It has a reputation for being a fun not too difficult math class. This time around, the material was very different and felt a little chaotic. I was taking it with some other difficult classes and felt a bit blindsided. I also didn't feel like I learned that much. We would spend a lot of time every class on just one proof and then be expected to make very significant leaps in our understanding of the material on the problem sets and exams. I wish we had spent more time on subjects or at least gone through more examples rather than always jumping to an extreme case for an idea and spending hours developing that proof.  I think there are many interesting proofs and ideas in discrete mathematics, but this didn't seem like the class to learn them in. There are other Math classes at Yale that would likely be a better use of your time. <br/></div>

For greater than half of the semester, he went over time by 15 minutes each class. Eventually, he did make an effort to be more respectful to our schedules; however, it seemed that he didn't really prepare for lectures so classes often went overtime.

I understand that this is his first year teaching so he must create lecture notes from scratch. However, in his own lectures notes, he occasionally concedes that he is too lazy to finish his lecture notes and thus leaves them as incomplete. 

Assignment questions are cryptic and seem purposefully (or unintentionally, which is arguably worse) unclear. Once you finally understand a question, you immediately realize 3 different ways he could've described which would have saved you around 30 minutes. <br/></div>

Furthermore, the problem sets and exams need to be more in-line. In the current form, the exams did not seem representative of one's grasp of the course. Since both midterms and the final were only 5 problems, if one could not figure out the "trick" to solve a given problem, it would severely impact their final grade. In addition, there was not enough exercises (with solutions) nor practice exams that one could do to prepare.

For the mathematics major, this is a no-brainer great introduction to discrete mathematics, and is fairly fun and low-workload. For the computer science major, this class covers graph theory, objects which are found throughout computer science. Studying them in greater theoretical depth, though it may not make you a better coder per se, will pay dividends in your logical reasoning ability. To everyone else, this is a great QR! MATH 115 is stated as a prerequisite, but this class exists in a separate realm from calculus and any student who did well in precalculus could probably do well in this class. If you hated calculus, try this out before you write off mathematics completely. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would recommend this course to a student with a strong introductory math background who wants an intensive introduction to formal proofs in combinatorics and graph theory or to a student with previous proof background interested in a thorough overview of these topics. The level of rigor in this course may be discouraging to someone with limited mathematical proof experience/confidence, but it was actually very interesting for well-prepared students. This iteration of the course was significantly more difficult than previous iterations and focused more on theoretical mathematics. Thus, this course should not be taken lightly, even by those with strong backgrounds. On the other hand, it is also quite engaging and serves as a good introduction to combinatorics and graph theory for more advanced classes. <br/></div>
