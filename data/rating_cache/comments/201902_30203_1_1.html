<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> In my opinion, the strengths of this course resided entirely in the hands-on experience of filmmaking. The resources at FAMU were incredible, and it really was an amazing experience to "learn by doing" in an environment that expected nothing more than beginner's work. You are really thrown into the mix of things as a student, so the program is kind've like "expert level" with "beginner's expectations" if that makes sense. In other words, you aren't given a watered down, baby step approach to filmmaking. You are simply thrown as much information as possible and challenged to absorb as much of it as you can. That being said, the days of hands-on filming/editing experience probably only amounted to about 30% of our class time. It was by far the most valuable of all the class experiences, so I don't know why so much of our class time was devoted to other things.

I think this program has so much potential and truly some rare gems to it, so I found the weaknesses of this program to be extremely frustrating. The most pressing weakness of the program is the obscene amount of class time.  At a minimum, we were in class from 9am-5pm, with one hour for lunch. Most days, it went longer than that. We were also in class on more than one occasion from 8am-8pm. These hours do not include the amount of time it took for transport (30 min each way), nor do they include work/reading assigned to us outside of class (100+ pages of reading in a night on many occasions) If all of this time was devoted to filming and hands-on learning, I could see the value. After all, many sets in Hollywood do stretch that long. However, in most cases that class time was devoted to disconnected lectures and walking tours. It was virtually impossible to explore Prague on our own time outside of the weekends. Student were inevitably extremely exhausted by the final week, leading to less engagement in the classes and lectures. Half of Study Abroad's reputation for being a formative experience derives from allowing students the unprecedented independence to explore a country and culture foreign to their own and forge their own path. I could've been in a film program on campus at Yale and not known the difference because all I saw was the inside of the classroom. 

As much as I loved Jitka and as cool as it was to discuss the history of waves of film on Mondays, I would significantly cut, make optional, or even eliminate these aspects of the program entirely. The strongest part of this program is undeniably the hands-on experience, and I think the program and the students would be far better off embracing that strength rather than diluting it with broad film-history coverage and tours of locations that students both could and should have the opportunity to seek out on their own. Cutting these aspects of the program would create a more feasible time schedule for students, who in turn would be more engaged, happy, rested, and creative. My classmates and I all unanimously felt very constrained by the demanding schedule of the program, yet felt that the amount of actual absorption/learning done in proportion to that time schedule was frustratingly low. 

On the other end, one area of the program in which I would have liked to see MORE structure was the communication between professors and students, especially at the beginning of the program. The camaraderie formed throughout the program was entirely a result of the effort of the students, not the instructors. We were made to fend entirely for ourselves in getting to know each other and our professors. There were no ice breakers or real group bonding activities. We took it upon ourselves to do ice breakers, group dinners, and chat up professors. Had there not been such an active effort by many of the students to bond, we would have certainly left the program with no interest in speaking to our instructors or each other again. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> A strength of this course was that the material was tested and reinforced through the weekly exams. The first weekly exam was rather open-ended, vague, and difficult as a result. However the later exams were far more straight forward and relatively easy. They were a great buffer for the project grades. The greatest weakness for this course was the lack of structured feedback. Almost every instructor had a slightly differing opinion and would tell the groups how they could have changed their project. This resulted with a varied and vague description of how it could have been made better. Sometimes they would all agree on one thing, but then one would butt in and say the exact opposite and they would all change their minds. Also, I have no idea how the grading of the projects actually worked. Just one day the grade would appear on Canvas with no actual feedback or reason as to why. The grade averages seemed to be getting lower with each project even though our projects got objectively better with each one because of our increased experience. It would help the students greatly if comments or a rubric were provided that explained why points were actually taken off. The instructors provide the groups with so many criticisms that knowing why that amount of points was actually taken off would help greatly. Another weakness was the fact that the FAMU instructors would often not fully listen to or not understand our pitches and instead of trying to understand and help us improve our idea, they would suggest a completely new idea. It would have been far more helpful if we consistently worked to improve our own ideas with their help instead of just conforming to the instructors' idea of what our idea was. In addition to that, clear instructions or information about framing of shots was never provided. This is fine except for the fact that during the showings the instructors would criticize our framing or shots and then suggest how we should have shot instead. This is something that should have been suggested to us before shooting to help us. We are inexperienced and don't have the same eye as they do, so we need guidance. This could be accomplished by structuring the schedule to have another day for storyboarding or even just focusing more on that. If we work with the professors and talk about our sequence of shots and what we want them to look like before shooting, then the instructors would be able to correct us and suggest shots before shooting, and not after when it is impossible to change things. Finally, the criticisms and feedback of each project are great, however they are obviously individualized to each project and situation. When receiving feedback, I really appreciated when the professor managed to generalize their statement so it could be applied to other projects. It was useful when they gave their specific criticism, and then explained it with a generalization. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Way too much class time. The syllabus states that there will be quite a bit, but in reality there is even more. Compounded by the amount of work outside of class, there is barely enough time to appreciate the city. The professors in general pretend to be on your side, but often their comments during and after the film making process are like night and day. Often, they will critique your pre-production process after saying that it was fine during. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> I thought the strengths of the program were the insights offered by the many many instructors, the resources available through FAMU, and the film festival that we were able to attend.  I though the major weakness was the amount of class time, that ate away at my ability to retain much of the information I was getting. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> In general, shooting and Jon's lectures are useful, but some of the instructors at FAMU aren't so much. Although I think I learned a lot, I wish we went deeper in at least one aspect. Everything felt very surface-level. But professor Andrews clearly cared and prepared for our course, which made our experience very delightful. <br/></div>
