<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â i felt that a lot of the lectures wasted time on class polls/surveys, while i wanted to learn more about psychology concepts. i also felt that the class was a bit unorganized (e.g. the lectures aren't really named after the concepts) and that it was hard to know the core concepts of psychology/what we would have to take away. i hoped to learn more psych for future classes / exams but i feel left unfulfilled. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Most of the topics were pretty interesting, and I thought the profesor was good. One thing I did not like was how active the comment section was and found it distracting at times. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths
-v interesting material; wide variety of material
-lecture based yet still engaging with videos/polls/poppin comment section
-decent amt of guest lecturers
-no studying required
weaknesses
-occasionally lectures were boring, but I think its just bc the topic didn't align with my interests <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Engaging lectures. Guest lectures were the best part of the class.

Weaknesses: Final was awful. Incredibly confusing and did not test what we were taught in class. Some questions were incredibly vague while others were hyperspecific--overall very difficult to take for no reason. I assume it was put together by TA's per the Ed Discussion--please do better next time. Disappointing and pathetic. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I found the course disappointingly "soft." I think it would be improved by a more conventional structure, including regular textbook readings and tests or quizzes. I think that would have allowed us to get through more material and make it stick. As is, it felt like we were learning party tricks half the time - they might be interesting, but they left me somewhat unimpressed with psychology as a serious discipline.

I will say that the course instructors were very kind and understanding, and tried to encourage enthusiasm in the subject. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was great and it allowed for active learning without all the stress. I personally really love how this course was run and I think I learn best in these type of classes. Although there were no time exams or assessments, I still learned a lot from engaging in class. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I thought that Professor Lazzaro was an excellent professor. Her teaching style was effective, clear, and engaging and she was very understanding and reasonable with the expectations for this course. I enjoyed the guest lecturers and given the current pandemic, I believe that this course was taught to the best of its ability. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â In general, I found the course to be interesting and the teaching team was incredible accommodating to students' needs which I greatly appreciated. I do think that the course could be improved by providing a deeper dive into certain areas of psychology. It became hard to follow sometimes and especially in studying for the final when a lecture about robots was actually about confirmation bias and attitudes and behaviors. I think the course could be better structured so that it is less all over the place and more topical. Having units more clearly defined as cognitive psychology, behavioral psychology, social psychology, and other areas of specialty in the field would have been very helpful for placing this information that we are learning into context. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It is a fun class and they try to make the subject matter engaging and entertaining. I think a weakness of the course was how it was structured though. Even though arranging each lecture around a question was cool, it made it really hard to mentally separate material into disciplines. I would have preferred to learn more about the history/origins of psych in the beginning, and then have more specific sections of the class for cognitive psych, or behavioral psych and stuff like that. We could still have lectures based around questions, but that would've really helped me understand psych more broadly and it would've made it a lot easier for me to study. I also think the lectures in general were focused on giving us a lot of examples of specific things, rather than either going deep or broad into the material. I don't think I got a very nuanced understanding of any of the topics, and I also didn't feel like (due to the structure of the class maybe) I got a full understanding of a bunch of different areas of psychology. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course covers a wide range of interesting topics with appropriate depth; it is well-balanced. I appreciated the course focus on pursuing our curiosities through scientific inquiry, and it was helpful to discuss studies that exemplified each psychological concept. I also enjoyed the interactive course polls, which made the experience more engaging. 

In the future, it would be helpful to put fewer words on each slide. While the exams were open-note, some students prefer to take notes anyway to internalize concepts. The ability to summarize information and to isolate key concepts is valuable, but the slides should not be too overpopulated. Images that communicate concepts are often stronger than paragraphs. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The material is easy to grasp and understand, and many of the research studies presented are fun and interesting to learn about. Honestly, the workload is very manageable and I would not really change anything about this course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class was great! The readings supplemented the lectures, which could seem dense sometimes, greatly and reinforced the major topics. The class was well-organized, and it was very engaging in that all of the phenomenons had applications to other fields or everyday life. The guest lectures were a favorite, as they introduced us to different fields and varieties of psychology and were all incredibly interesting. The one weakness was that assignments were sometimes less clear, but they did get me critically thinking about the material. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course was the teaching team: all TFs and Dr. Lazzaro really made this course an amazing course. Structuring the curriculum to focus on questions in psychology / questions people have about their own minds was very effective, and I highly recommend taking this course to delve into a wide variety of psychological topics. The use of EdDiscussion was extremely useful, and the anonymity feature was utilized quite well. I cannot think of any weaknesses: this course was really amazing! The only thing I can think of to improve, though, is possibly the implementation of quizzes. I am all for less work, but quizzes would benefit students when doing the writing assignments as well as doing the little bit of studying to help with the final. Another thing that I highly recommend keeping are the guest lectures: ESPECIALLY Dr. Wendy Suzuki... she is an icon. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was very manageable. I think it might have helped to have quizzes or some assignment that related more to the lectures to help keep us on track with the material. There were assignments that weren't the most focused on having us study or use lecture material, but I think this made the final exam, which was a takehome exam a bit more difficult. 

That being said the professor's lectures were good, well explained and easy to understand even though we did span a lot of topics. She really cared about our mental health. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Lazzaro is super engaging and committment to creating a class envrionment that facilates student engagement. Also depending on the TA that you have discussion sections can be interesting or a waste of time is what I've heard after speaking to friends in different sections. Weaknesses: lack of clear expectations on grading for the class.--Be wary of the final exam! The work and content of lectures during the semester is very managable and interesting; however, the grading of the class is definitely a point of concern. The final exam counted for 35% of the course grade so to do well you have to do well on the final which was composed of ~20 short answer/essay based questions that were often times confusing or vague in their wording was really frustrating. The questions were written as if there was usually a very specific psychology principle or phenomenon that was the answer, but to know it you would have to have pretty detailed lecture notes or be willing to rewatch the lecture recording from the entire semester to find it in the case that you didn't remember it. I'm not sure if this disconnect between rigor of the final and prior class assignment is due to the fact that the graduate student TAs/TFs wrote and graded the exam or what, but I found it really stressful and that overall there was a lack of communcation regarding what to expect for the final exam until it was released. I am grateful that exam was given over a period of time for it to be manageable, but even then there were clarifications made on specific test questions after I submitted my exam so I probably got points deducted for not interpreting the question the same way in which the TA's wrote them. Also, in the final class period/course overview lecture led by the TA's taking live questions regarding the final, it was quite clear how little some of the TA's actually cared about how students did on the exam when they were laughing at the wording of clarifying questions that students asked. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: extremely engaging material and presentation of material 
Weakness: the final was the first time we were actually tested on if we understood the material / could apply the material. The previous assignments were basically effort grades so even if you explained something wrong you wouldn't know. The final was also pretty long and many of the questions were poorly worded. I don't think the content of the questions were difficult or unfair but sometimes trying to understand what they were asking was time consuming. On another front, the syllabus was useful for about 1-2 weeks. I wish it was updated regularly (and announced that it was updated) to actually match the class and assignments. <br/></div>

I highly recommend this course as a fifth class or to try out psychology, the course load is light and pairs well with other classes. Also a pre-req for other psychology courses.
Weaknesses: if you are looking for a rigorously intense psych course this may not deliver that level of challenge, but it can help you decide if psych is something you are interested in (or perhaps you need Psych 110 for other courses). <br/></div>

The prep that was required did not mean that you had to look in the lecture either as there were often readings that you could skim to find the information necessary. That prep was the rest of the weight of the course grade besides the final, which was a 2 week take home final.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I think that the biggest strength of PSYC 110 was actually Professor Stephanie Lazzaro! She was so kind and always in a superb mood when starting lectures, and I think that her positive attitude really "rubbed" off on her students. I also think that the students were in good hands during discussion section, as the TFs were all (at least to my knowledge) superb psychologists. Finally, the course material was presented in ways that were based on more understanding and less memorization, which really lended to a positive and less-competitive learning environment  one in which knowledge was favored over temporary memorization. Great job, PSYC 110 staff!
Weaknesses: This course didn't really have any major weaknesses, to be honest. The only thing I would mention is that there was a bit of a disconnect between the work required during the semester and the work required for the final. While I only spent, at most, an hour or two (not including lectures and discussion sections) on the course during the semester, the final was by far my most lengthy and tedious! I understand the need to check for understanding, but even cutting down the final from 19 questions to 12-15 would have proven to match the rest of the course. Other than that, I really enjoyed the class. Also, even though the final was lengthy, it was still very interesting and not too boring compared to other final assignments that I completed! <br/></div>
