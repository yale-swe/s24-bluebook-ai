<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â S: recorded lectures and Sapling was helpful

W: hard to know exactly how to study for the tests <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course lie in its resources: the TAs, the peer tutors, the professor, and the preceptor. The textbook is also excellent in guiding our learning. However, the slides given before lecture could contain more key information. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I had to take this course as a prerequisite for MCDB, so I did not always find the material super engaging. But much of the material was fascinating and I did learn some new problem solving skills and approaches. The main weaknesses of the course are the fault of the pandemicwe can't see the cool in-person demonstrations and we had to do our assignments through Canvas and Sapling (the latter a truly godawful platform) <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A little bit hard to follow when the professor didn't follow the textbook. I found we skipped over a lot of material in lectures which was okay when we were following the textbook, but challenging otherwise <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Discussion sections were extremely helpful to more fully understand the content.

Weaknesses: I feel like the subject matter was a little disorganized and I was unsure what was going to be a concept I needed to study and what was just a very convoluted example. <br/></div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The textbook did more of the teaching than lecture, for sometimes the lecture was not really adding to my knowledge of chemistry. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was great having so many resources for this course. (However, it was a little overwhelming at the beginning of the semester trying to keep track of all of the peer tutors and TFs and everything, but I guess that's a good problem.) Sapling was fabulous and I'm glad there was at least some opportunity for partial credit on exams (as opposed to the GenChem I). I also love that we could drop our lowest midterm. It took some stress off. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course was the depth of the topics covered in lecture, as well as the manner in which and clarity with which the topics were covered in lecture and reviewed in discussion sections, as well as the optional midterm review sessions. The problem sets and reading questions on Sapling helped students practice the concepts and calculations covered in lecture, while the midterms were fairly administered. A possible weakness of this course was the way in which some of the more complicated topics were taught, such as in the introduction to organic chemistry unit. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â more focus on test-type questions in lecture would help. I love hearing about real life applications, but it usually makes me feel like I understand the content and don't need to study more. When I get to the test it turns out I don't understand the content ):  Sapling was the most helpful part of the course for me, along with Hannah's website <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I don't have any suggestions for improvement. I appreciated the accessibility of the TFs and the fact that lectures were both offered live and as recorded videos. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths:
- covered the necessary general chemistry requirements
- exams and grading was fair
Weaknesses:
- lectures were not very helpful <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Lectures were very boring. Parr got off topic a lot and went overtime by 5-10 minutes everyday. Making the lectures more interesting would help, although I understand it is tough to do so over Zoom. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked the overall structure of the course, but sometimes lectures seemed unfocused and scattered. The course would really benefit from some reorganization. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course is fine. It is the second gen-chem class and as such consists of a hodgepodge of topics. While the middle units flow together nicely (kinetics-&gt;equilibrium-&gt;acid/base-&gt;thermodynamics), other parts of the class feel a little more thrown together. Additionally, it was sometimes unclear what information and skills were expected of us and what were not. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Prof. Parr is an excellent lecturer. He was extremely enthusiastic, and this made the lectures very engaging. The PSETs were designed well, and I feel like they really helped learn the concepts well. The sapling feedback was extremely thorough, and I really appreciated the explanations. Likewise, the lecture slides were also designed well, so it was easy to follow along.
 
Weakness: None. While I could nitpick small things, I think any flaws were inevitable with the pandemic. Overall, I thought the class was structured very well. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Im not sure what the course could to improve. It was very well set up and seems fairly optimized for the times. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Parr's attitude--sometimes positive and humorous. Hannah and her willingness to explain concepts in a tidy manner. Most TFs in the way they were available. PEER TUTORS! All very kind people with very great intentions of supporting you, if you ask the right questions.
Weaknesses: there are simply too many for me. The lectures, very fast-paced and not well organized, were difficult to follow most of the time (which is a lot considering the sheer number of lectures one must have gone to), and overall not engaging. Communication before lecture regarding class materials was scarce and unhelpful. The connection of material between the problem sets, lectures, and discussion sections felt fragmented and incoherent. All of these unorganized and unbalanced parts of the course inevitably led to unsure expectations for students. The expectations for learning were never set at any point in the semester, so students were only given vague statements about midterms and the final in a way that was not helpful for organizing their thoughts. Whether they succeeded or not was based solely on their ability to synthesize the material themselves without any guiding support from the instructors. The formulation of midterms was also not conducive to learning nor proper studying. They almost felt like an assessment of one's understanding of the fringes of the material rather than the core of it.
Overall, I do not think it is acceptable to conduct a course, especially a Yale course, in the way this one was conducted. This did not meet my expectations, especially during a virtual year. I expected more support from the instructors in their organization of the course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â STOP creating midterms with questions that are dependent on getting the previous questions right? It's not a true assessment of what concepts a student is good with and which ones they are not!. Like if i'm better a different concept but I got the previous question wrong then there is no chance of assessing what i'm good at and not. Which means I can't get credit for what I actually know. Very frustrating. One of the biggest frustrations were the peer tutors. It was like pulling tooth and nail to get them to use the white board during zoom meetings for examples. And the worst part is that several times when we had questions, peer tutors literally said "I'm sorry but this was so long ago for me, I don't know," "Yeah there are so many K constants I can't remember what this one means," and so many other trash statements. it's like......WHAT?! WHY ARE YOU HERE! It's absolutely frustrating when you have to wait for these sessions, time it with other study sessions you may need for other classes, only to get a "sorry" or lazy teaching. Like looking at a student ask a question, literally asking for an example for a concept, and the tutors just verbalize in the most abstract way....LIKE USE THE WHITE BOARD!! 

As far as mid-term testing, I said it for CHEM1 as well. If you're going to use Sapling for practice, then you should be gearing discussion sections and midterms with similar style questions. If the midterm is going to be created by you then we should not be using sapling if these questions aren't yours. Because the wording between the professors and sapling has so many opportunities to look completely foreign from each other. And it's disheartening to study all these ways the question can be asked on sapling just to take the mid-term and can't really decipher professor-created questions. And the instructions for the midterm should be on a screen before we press "take quiz" because I don't want to waste time reading the instructions and guide for taking the quiz and time is running out. What's worse is, I can't raise my hand to get immediate clarification on a question or the look of a question with different symbols or abbreviations from sapling. I would have to email and wait for a response for clarification......during a timed test! does that even sound right. So if anything, these mid terms should be live zoomed with the ability to raise your hand and the professor or proctor can take you into a break-out room to clarify if needed. But the biggest factor for me is I feel that the professor and study sessions and homework should have all been created by the professor and not used sapling. Just to get used to how he words them or how he wants us to understand concepts. Because these professors have too much leeway and it often translates to seriously abstract questions that are kind of undesired in a general chem class. Not everyone is here because they want to be. So it would have been nice to keep the fact that this is an introductory class in mind when creating questions. Basically consistency <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was good at providing options for accessing lectures for people who weren't able to access the lectures or needed to revisit them later. However, for Gen Chem II, there need to be more mechanisms in place for students who haven't had a strong background in science before coming to Yale. An option similar to the Enrichment section provided for Gen Chem I would be so so helpful, especially considering the teaching style of the class (which isn't accessible for many people). In the intro bio sequence, enrichment sections are provided for both semesters, so I don't see why the same can't be offered for chem. It's a much more low-stakes way to engage with the concepts than in section (which can be super intimidating). 

Another place for improvement in this class is the structure of exams. I'm sure it was difficult adapting this class to a remote format, and so thank you for all the hard work you did in making it happen! But the sheer number of all-or-nothing multiple choice questions on all of our midterms and our final exam this semester made test results incredibly frustrating. for many questions, I felt like I had a good understanding of the question and what it was asking, but because of silly mistakes picked the wrong answer and received no credit. To make matters worse, many of these all-or-nothing questions were set up as what felt like "trick" questions, deliberately leading students to pick the wrong answer. if these had been questions where we were provided a place to explain our work, that would be fair, but the all-or-nothing nature of these questions is harsh on people who understand the material but, in the pressure of exam-taking, select the wrong answer because the question is presented misleadingly. This issue could be solved by providing more questions with room for explanation, or just not giving us trick questions?? <br/></div>
