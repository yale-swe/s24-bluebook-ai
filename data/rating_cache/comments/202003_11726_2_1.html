<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The TF sessions and live virtual sessions were very helpful because we could ask questions about whatever material we did not understand in recorded lectures. The strengths of this course are that both Prof. Aizenbud and the TF (Abhinav) were so knowledgeable and extremely patient and understanding of us being enrolled off-campus. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths- the professor and TA were always available for office hours
Weaknesses- the asynchronous lectures could have been more engaging. I would have also liked to have learn more about the applications of the linear algebra. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The class was as good as it could be with the circumstances, posting practice exams for midterms and finals would have been helpful. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Pre-recorded lectures were good but it was hard to ask questions if there was any confusion. It would have been better to have a Piazza page or some method students could easily ask questions. There weren't many practice problems for exams and this would have helped to learn. Additionally, no answer keys for the HWs were released either, making it hard to study well. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There are no positives to this course. The lectures are not engaging at all and appear to be completely unrehearsed, the order in which concepts are introduced is nonsensical, the homework assignments are tangentially related to the exams at best, we are hardly given any practice/review material for the exams, they test some material that is way beyond the scope of anything we've learned, and I could go on with even more places for improvement. My most straightforward suggestion would be to structure this course more similarly to MATH 120, which had ample review material, clear lectures and homework assignments, and fair assessments. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths- well organized, profs are clear about expectations, and the pre-recorded lectures were well done. 
Cons- profs are not accommodating, 2 midterms and a final seems a bit over the top, and the fact that the profs had a pset due on the first sunday of thanksgiving break AND the sunday before we returned from break was honestly absurd considering we had not had a break for 12 weeks. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think this course could have been improved by adding more applications. Least-squares fitting and difference equations were the only topics I remember applying, and that wasn't until the second half of the semester. This is a shame, because a lot of the things we did earlier in the semester--solving linear systems, for example--have lots of real-world uses. The course would have felt more immediately useful if more of the problem set questions had been phrased as word problems, even if the underlying math was the exact same.

One strength is that the problem sets and exams felt very reasonable in terms of difficulty, and it was very clear what to study for exams. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course did provide a good introduction to linear algebra. I would say that the teaching was poor. The video lectures were difficult to understand, not because the math was difficult, just from generally poor communication. No connections were really drawn between topics, and terms would be thrown around without having been defined. The live lectures were sort of helpful but very sporadic because they tried to cover several days of material in minutes. Honestly, the most helpful and interesting day of the entire semester was one of the last videos where there was an actual application of linear algebra (I don't really think this course should be called linear algebra with applications, but only have one application). <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: material is organized well. I liked the recorded videos and the fact that there were several each week but they were short. Homework was always achievable. First midterm and final were pretty kind toward anyone who studied a fair amount. 
weaknesses: I thought Prof Lindenbaum's videos got kinda confusing, especially towards the end. Fortunately I had some linear background coming in, but if I hadn't, I would have felt like the course was not contextualized well. It seems like we're just getting a lot of facts thrown at us without really learning the fundamentals behind it. But maybe I should've taken 225. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think I would've preferred to have the lectures live in order to ask questions as we went rather than meet only for 30 minutes. I feel like I understand things better when I ask questions while I'm barely learning the material, not reviewing it. I also wish we'd received clear feedback on our psets and midterms. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course had several sources for help, and despite the unique circumstances, was very flexible. That being said, the course fell flat in being an almost completely recorded class. My engagement with this class was at an all-time low, and this class felt like an afterthought when compared to my other live classes. The lectures felt somewhat rushed, and I think more care could have been taken to ensure that lecture material and corresponding assignments were more staggered. I ended up watching the videos as I did the assignments, and did not feel as though I was forming a solid understanding of the concepts. 

In regards to the assignments, the length was often much longer than other STEM/Math classes of this difficulty. The difficulty of the homework questions often did not match what was discussed in the lecture videos, and more often than not, I would have to reference some obscure source to even begin to grasp the problem. 

Regarding the exams, I feel as though the two midterms were not representative of the material that we went over in class. When talking to other students in the course, I found that the majority of the people that I talked to did not do well on either midterm. Regardless, they were weighted at 40% of our final grade and were not curved at all. The amount and complexity of the material on the exams did not at all match the homework assignments, and I felt largely unprepared for them. I was satisfied with the format that the exams took, being open for 24 hours (31 hours for the final exam), and felt that this was a good change to accommodate differing circumstances. 

Communication overall was sporadic at best. One of the resources that I took most advantage of this semester was solution documents, to have examples of a problem that I could reference. The teaching fellow for this course led a discussion section that seemed largely unhelpful in this regard. His 'solutions' were often nothing more than scribbles. The one session that I did attend, however, was not much more helpful, as everyone sat in silence attempting the problems on their own. The solution files for the midterms, taken in October and November, were released 24 hours before the final, making them less useful as a resource for that exam. The level of communication is best summarized by the final exam date being 'changed' and the new date only being referenced in a standard, forgettable canvas announcement. It was not at all highlighted or specified, and I was only informed through a peer.

Overall, I am very dissatisfied with this course. I was told by a peer that this class acts as a 'weed-out' course for the math major. If this is the case, then it is doing a wonderful job in that regard. This class failed to dynamically adapt to its students as the semester progressed, and I always felt as if I had to put double the effort to stay up to date on material that was better explained by a free to watch course series on youtube. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class definitely could have been improved. For one, there was never enough time for the exams it seemed. Myself and many students felt the same, especially when we also had to upload everything onto gradescope (which often was extremely slow to upload the results). I also found having two different lecturers giving the lectures made Tsing notes seem inconsistent from week to week, due to their different styles <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of this course was the pace at which material was coveredit moved quickly but reasonably so that the majority of the material was covered thoroughly. The weakness was the structure of the lecturesconcepts were difficult to understand at first and often given little to no explanation before moving onto proofs, and often no examples were done in lecture so it was difficult to begin problem sets without any foundation of examples. Also, we were only given feedback on points missed on problem sets with no answer key to check our procedures for questions we got correctly. <br/></div>
