<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Covers far too much topic and details that are most often nowhere necessary for the exams, thus costing unnecessary stress and concern over the study materials for students. Unclear study objectives, what topics are important and how detailed we should understand certain processes, in addition to very low overall points on the exam that cost nearly 10% or more per question. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures were by far the most difficult portion of this class. They were much longer than the time that is cut out for the lectures and often needed a great amount of supplementary material to clarify the complex topics that were brought up. The time given for exams was quite unfair even when many did not finish the midterm in the time allotted, the number of questions was increased on the final. If the course was truly about learning biology they would make showing how much biology knowledge you have not dependent on how long it takes to recall that knowledge. <br/></div>

<b></b>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Due to the nature of the course, it was easy to get distracted and fall off course. <br/></div>
</div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the course jammed in a lot of information in a short amount of time. The lectures were sometimes really hard and contained a lot of complex content that I feel could have been more spaced out so that we could understand the concepts better. I feel as though problem sets or homework assignments following the format of the final and midterm could be given in order to help prepare. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - the PSETs were very interesting and engaging 
Weakness - the way the course material was presented, lack of practice quizzes prior to exam <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There was a lot of information and it was hard to know what to focus on. The exams were hard to finish on time. A strength is that the topics were very interesting. However, I think the course tried to fit too much in, especially since the homework did not directly reinforce lecture. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Zhong clearly knows the concepts that he would like to convey to the class, however it is often buried in examples that make it easy to lose track of the actual relationship to the material to be understood. I think live lectures where we could ask questions to better understand these examples would have greatly improved my experience in the class. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths were that professor went in depth and gave a lot of supporting examples to help clarify points; peer tutors were also very helpful in understanding course material.
Weaknesses were that professor sometimes used advanced terminology so lectures were difficult to follow. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was SO hard online. There was just sooooo much information per lecture, and the exams were horrible. I don't think we should have been tested in a final exam that required us to design ten experiments in fourty five questions in only 75 minutes. It was such a stressful experience. Everyone hated it. The midterm wasn't as bad - the final should have been more like it. The strengths of this course are enrichment and Professor Hartman and the peer tutors. And that we learned some interesting things about stem cells, cancer, and development. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Content was interesting, the recorded lectures were helpful, the PowerPoint slides were informative. It is very structured and it's clear what needs to be done each week. Certain topics weren't explained particularly well and appeared on exams, and the review for the final was not particularly representative of what we ended up seeing. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Writing a proposal was a very interesting and effective way to apply what we learned
Weaknesses: I miss the mentoring that we had in the BIOL 101 project. I wish we had one-on-one meetings built in for this project as well. Also, the lecture organization could use a lot of improvement. Slides were often confusing and I had to ask for clarification from TA's and Professor Hartman. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the lack of synchronous lectures was nice.
Weaknesses: Discussion section was not particularly helpful and the lectures did not prepare us for the exam questions. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think a strength was that the examples given in the course were followed through between different lectures so it made it easier to follow. A weakness was that there were no real problem sets so you could not really practice the material that much before you see it on exams, making it hard to judge if you truly understand what is going on. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I find the pre-recorded lectures sometimes difficult to follow and would maybe benefit from a live option (some of my other classes offer live Zoom lectures, which are also recorded and available to watch asynchronously). I really appreciate all that the teaching team does to make resources (like office hours and extra help) available, however. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weakness: Professor Zhongs teaching style and the lecture sides. Slides were very dense, very disorganized, not designed for maximizing student learning. 
I also wish that we had been more regularly tested on the material, like with P sets. Our psets focused on the final project instead.

Strengths: Professor Hartman! You can tell that she cares about student success. I also really liked discussion section and I like that the final project was divided into the P sets. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The recorded lectures were very long and often disorganized in structure in a way that made it difficult to associate the relationship between the different conceptual topics.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The concepts were interesting, and it really pushed more complex problem solving. 
Weakness: For an application based course, I was extremely disappointed that there were no practice problems. We had "practice tests" before the midterm and the final, but they were very short. On the final "practice test", half of the topics covered were explicitly stated to not be in the scope of this course. Needless to say, I have no idea how we can be expected to apply the coursework if we do not practice doing so. I could know the actual material inside and out, but application is a completely different thing. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course formatting made it easy to fall behind. The lectures tended to be longer than the other ones in previous sequences, (the longest one was nearly two hours long, and there was still an additional hour of lecture aside from it). Though this is typical of the Biology sequence, it's more inconvenient/harder to view the lectures when they're not broken up into smaller chunks. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: lectures were reasonably well made, PSETs built upon each other and were relatively interesting, peer tutoring was really helpful

weakness: Midterm &amp; Final were perhaps overly challenging and fast-paced; also, one thing I NEVER understood is why discussion section slides and peer tutoring midterm &amp; final review slides could not be shared, that seemed very contrary to the philosophies of collaboration and flexibility that this course seems to try to embody and honestly did not make much logical sense to me at all. I would definitely recommend revisiting this policy especially for the midterm &amp; final reviews because not everyone will be able to make time in their schedule to attend the midterm &amp; final review sessions. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Zhong structures his classes in the weirdest and most unhelpful way possible -- he packs the lectures with examples and then skims over the ideas needed to explain them at the end (or in later lectures), as if we are all already experts in the field. I just don't understand why this course is taught this way. Professor Hartman was a gem though, and the one lecture she taught was extremely clear and well-structured. There is also an abnormally high amount of content that is given very little attention except for a brief mention here and there which just feels rushed and unfinished. The exams were mostly well written (if not extremely time pressured), but I probably would have only been able to engage with them had the teaching in lecture been useful. I was pleasantly surprised by the PSETS, in which we were essentially asked to prepare a research proposal over five weeks and dive to investigate a developmental disease--it actually felt like this was developing a useful skill for the future. It's no surprise that this homework had no real connection to the content in lectures (except some general ideas). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength of the course was how useful and interesting the concepts were. Another strength was the emphasis on understanding research papers through both discussion section and the research proposal. I also really liked Ed discussion, where common questions could be anonymously asked by students and publicly answered by the professor. A weakness of the course was the lecture format, which made it difficult to know what information was actually important for exams. The key concepts sections were helpful in this regard but unexpected details were on exams. It would be helpful to know what specific concepts are important when studying. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course is definitely the teaching staff, as they are very dedicated to the success of every one of their students. One of the weaknesses was how dense the lectures were. This made it very hard to decipher the main points and I ended up spending hours on each lecture trying to decipher the material because there was so much. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think a major weakness of the course was that there was no way for us to practice the concepts we went over in lecture and make sure we actually understood them aside from 2 practice exams and the actual exams (which are not when you should be figuring out if you understand a concept). Lectures, in my opinion, were very poorly taught, and I spent so much of my time re-watching lectures in order to grasp what was being taught. I don't think it's reasonable to expect students to have to re-watch lectures (which often exceeded the allotted class time anyways) multiple times just to get a basic understanding what was being said. Part of the problem was that we would regularly go over complex examples without being clearly told what they were examples of (often until the very end of the example), terminology would be thrown around that we were just supposed to know, and then have no way to reinforce what they may or may not have just learned. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think that the major strength of this course was how in-depth we went in terms of learning about genetics and development. Although the examples were sometimes too much, I feel as if they were helpful in contextualizing the information. I feel as if students are required to remember too much information for the assessments and at times too much detail. Especially for the fact that we're living through a world-wide pandemic I feel as if there could have been more adjustments to the course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I learned a great deal from the research proposal project and this skill will apply to future labs and jobs.
