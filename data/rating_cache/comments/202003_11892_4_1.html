<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Yes, but not during COVID. There are quite a few fascinating parts of chemistry you wouldn't learn in a normal chemistry course. But they are quite difficult to wrap your head around, especially in the beginning, so I wouldn't try to take it online. If chemistry interests you, take it! <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would recommend the course based on the breadth of the content you'll learn but discourage taking the course based on the inordinate level of studying required. This course was extremely challenging and it requires serious investment to succeed. If you aren't interested in Chemistry prior to the course or you have a rigorous schedule I would recommend taking CHEM 163. The assessments were difficult and tamed down my enthusiasm for chemistry but I also learned a lot in the class. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Yes, I recommend this course for those who has a good understanding in chemistry and are looking for a challenge. The effort you put into the class is really important, but you'll learn a lot. There are many resources available such as peer tutoring, TFs, and the professor's office hours. If you take advantage of these opportunities to ask question and actively engage in the class, CHEM 163 is doable. <br/></div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Yes, I would, if you are comfortable with the AP chemistry background, this course will stretch you and make you think about chemistry in different ways. It's all very interesting stuff but you obviously have to like chemistry first. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Yes, but only if one is truly interested in Chemistry or is ready to put in more work. This class took up a lot of mine time in comparison to other classes and the workload was very challenging. I would only recommend to those with a high level of interest. If one is looking more to fulfill a requirement, then I would think the regular general chemistry class is a better fit. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would recommend this course to students that are passionate about chemistry and are genuinely interested in it. I would not recommend this course to anyone looking for an "easy credit." <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â If you have taken AP Chem or something similar then this course is nice in that it goes one step beyond what you already know. It is difficult to grasp certain concepts but working through the psets, going to peer tutors, etc should help you along. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Yes, if you would like to explore more topics that are usually not taught in general chemistry. If you need a refresher, I would suggest 161 since this course introduces a lot of new material. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Yes, I would totally recommend and have already recommended this course because of how we approached chemistry conceptually and because of the content that Mayer uses to develop our foundation. I really loved the arc of the class, moving from exploring periodic trends through quantum mechanics to orgo, synthesis, and mechanisms to transition metals chemistry to solids and material science. Professor Mayer is a really great instructor and the peer tutors and TFs are super helpful resources that make the class really manageable. The content and work is challenging but I found it super rewarding and, again, manageable. Also, perhaps this is an individual experience, but I thought that CHEM 163 was a really great class for me after talking to and living with peers in 161 and freshman orgo - especially compared to freshman orgo, which sounded like it was largely self-taught or relentless, a stark contrast to this class which felt reasonably challenging and comprehensive but totally within reach, especially if you took advantage of the multitude of opportunities to better develop your understanding of the content like practice resources, so many weekly peer tutoring sessions, and pre-midterm review sessions. I really enjoyed Mayer's 163 and totally feel like I made the right choice. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Absolutely! Please do not be afraid of the intellectual challenges along with the low grades you may receive. It is all relative, and the depth of knowledge coming from Prof. Mayer is unparalleled. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would recommend this class to another student. Teaching and layout of the course promoted a fundamental understanding of chemistry. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would definitely recommend this course. Although it is frustrating at first with the extremely complex concepts and the workload, the learning that goes on is something that you will appreciate by the end of the course. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was not totally terrible, but looking at the situation, I myself would NOT RECOMMEND this course to other people. Maybe if you are really a go-getter, and feel like you want an extreme challenge then sure, but if you arent planning to major in Chem and don't feel the need for intense intellectual gain then no. Looking back, the material that we learned was interesting and some still stick with me, but during the course, it was a struggle to keep up with the information and to study for tests. Also, some of the exams were very unfair, and they were not written well at all. I would study weeks prior and devoted about 75% of my time a week in advance to studying for these exams, but they rarely paid off. It is frustrating when you put the time in to do good, but the exams are structured in a way that getting a great grade is almost impossible. One great thing about the class though is the number of resources they give you to understand the material, which is a lot, however, it seems like even with all of this help, it is still so hard to do good. Also, choosing this class over Chem 165 is pointless. I could've done much better in Chem 165 and it probably would've saved me from the insane amount of stress, anxiety, and tears that were drained for me by taking 163. Most of my friends were flying by w great colors in 165, and my biggest regret of this semester is taking 163 instead of 165. They put me into this class since I did well in AP Chem my sophomore year of highschool, yet I felt completely unprepared to take this class. If you really want a challenge and feel confident in Chem then sure, take the course, but I advise people who are less confident to AVOID TAKING THE CLASS. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would recommend this course to a student passionate about chemistry and very confident about their general chemistry skills. The course gives a good introduction to organic chemistry. However, the course does require a rather sufficient background in general chemistry and a willingness to accept concepts that cannot necessarily be visualized (ie quantum mechanics). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â No. I'm a STEM major and really loved chemistry in high school but really did not like this course. The lectures were not well organized or structured, and the professor often went on tangents that wasted time and made it so often lectures got cut off mid-concept because class time was up and didn't cover all the material they were supposed to cover. No clear feedback was given on homework or tests. Having a midterm during reading week was not ideal, making it so the last midterm and the final were basically back to back. This course is not worth it, just take regular general chemistry or first year organic chemistry, at least then the labs will line up and make sense. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Yes yes yes! There were plenty of times I was frustrated with the course, but I am so glad I took it. I learned so much, even (or especially) when it was hard. At first, I was a little bit scared out of the idea of being a chemistry major, but upon some reflection, I'm not as scared by that idea anymore. I'm looking forward to seeing how I like CHEM 167! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â If you want a different approach to the world, then you should definitely take this class.  Because it is entirely theoretical, mathematics skills (other than algebra) really aren't needed, but if heavy conceptual topics are difficult for you then I would probably avoid this sequence. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I have recommended this course to several friends. Coming into the class, I had only taken sophomore level chemistry at my high school. I was worried that I would be in over my head, but my teaching fellow, Grace, Professor Mayer, and the entire teaching team along with my peers helped me understand the concepts they were presented in class. The concepts were also extremely interesting and nothing like a traditional Gen Chem class. I cant recommend this class enough! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It depends. I think if you really like chemistry and have a good background in it, then you'll probably enjoy this course. However, if you don't have a good background in chemistry, or are mainly just looking to fill a prerequesite, then this may not be the course for you because it is challenging and time-consuming. However, Professor Mayer is great and really understanding. This is also a really rewarding course, in terms of the knowledge that you'll gain from it. Besides how comfortable you are with chemistry, the main deciding factor between taking this course or taking 161 is really how much time and effort you're willing to put in. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would definitely recommend this course to another student who took AP/IB chemistry in high school and has demonstrated a level of knowledge to advance past regular Gen Chem. I believe that this course provides an intellectual challenge that fosters the development of critical thinking skills that are lacking within our generation while simultaneously acting as a proficient gateway course in the transition from high school STEM courses to college-level STEM courses. On top of that, I believe that the topics discussed in this class (organic chemistry in particular) will be useful in building a knowledge base for various other college STEM courses. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â If they feel ready for it. This course is very time consuming and the student must take it upon themself to learn and understand most of the material since the class moves at a very quick pase. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would definitely recommend this course. It is not easy at all and there it a ton of work that requires hours and days. The tests are also super difficult and cover advanced material. However, I have never felt so proud before. I took a three and a half hour exam and wrote 18 pages! This is insane. I am proud of all the effort I have shown and that I stuck to the end. I learnt so so much and got to interact with the amazing peer tutors and the ta. I used to think that maybe I should have taken 161, because I really was struggling, but in the end I was super happy with 163. It was an amazing course and Prof. Mayer really cares about his students. He was super accommodating. Just keep in mind that this is a hard course that requires a lot of work, dedication, and a new way of thinking. Forget about high school chem and enjoy this course. No matter how many points you get, you learn a ton! <br/></div>

I understand that Professor Mayer is super passionate about chemistry, but sometimes he didnt realize that it was all a bit excessive. Love him though - hes very sweet and you can tell he cares about his studentsI hear the curve for the final grades is generous.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think I would certainly recommend it as an intro chemistry course, because the real-world application that it brings in is interesting, and the pace works well.  The introduction to organic chem seems like it would be particularly useful if I take further chemistry courses in the future.  However, even with the outside applications, this is still a very technical course, and it seems difficult to bring the technical knowledge into casual everyday life, so I don't think I would recommend it to someone who isn't already planning on taking chemistry. <br/></div>

This course was very challenging, but it was very fulfilling. We went really in-depth on various topics, so there was at least one section that everyone really liked. Also, throughout the entire course, there weren't any calculations and even the formulas we studied we only used conceptually; so if you prefer to learn and understand concepts without worrying about math, I also would recommend this course for you.
