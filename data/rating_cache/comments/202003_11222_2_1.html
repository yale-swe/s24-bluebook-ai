<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course would have been a lot better in person. The pre-recorded lectures were harder to understand because Prof. Keil was not shown in it and he talked very fast and with a hoarse voice. It felt like the live sessions were not super related to the course material unless we specifically asked which most people didn't. However I really enjoyed having Prof. Keil because he has a lot of interesting insights and the lectures would've probably been great in person. The final paper was horrible and I felt like there was very little concrete guidance on it, and it was just something I had to do but wasn't as relevant to the course. I liked that we got the final questions in advance but the sheer number of them made it stressful. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â While the exams were well-designed, the final paper instructions were very vague and difficult to navigate. It seemed like the TFs were just as confused as we were. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the information was very very interesting and the professor did a great job of covering so many subjects in such a short amount of time. I really enjoyed the book readings and felt that they were an extremely helpful addition to the recorded lectures. The TFs were very helpful and broke assignments down into more manageable bits. 
Weaknesses:  this class was a lot of work between the readings, recorded lectured, weekly sections, weekly response questions, and weekly discussion meetings. I felt like I was doing the work for 1 1/2 classes. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The recorded lectures were relatively useless. They were difficult to hear and understand, and lacked organization. All information could be found more easily in the textbook. Appreciated having the lists of exam questions in advance, but there were far too many questions, and a significant amount that were not nearly adequately covered in the lecture. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The content of the course is extremely interesting and well-taught. I the final project could be split up into smaller portions so that its better organized and maybe a rubric or some more structured instructions could be provided. Prof. Keil is also very nice and knowledgeable in his field. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: really fascinating content! I loved not only watching the lectures but also reading the textbook that was written by the Professor himself. (I think this is the first textbook I have fully enjoyed reading!) I also loved how fair the grading/tests were. He gives you a list of about ~30 questions and he picks 5 you have to answer for the exam in class. I loved this style of testing because I felt I actually learned the material but with way less stress. You can basically be certain you get all the points on the exam because you prepare your answers before hand. But, since the questions are more of an argument than regurgitating facts, you actively engage with the material. I wish more classes used this model of testing. <br/></div>
</div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think that a strength of this course was the high engagement of the TAs. I felt like they really motivated us to be engaged and to stay on top of our work. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The prerecorded lectures allowed for flexibility, but I wish they were a little more polished. I did not find the live q&amp;a sessions to be as helpful as they could have been, but section was enjoyable and helpful. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is fascinating, and the content is fun to learn and exciting. It's applicable and interesting information! 

A weakness of the course was the design of the class in terms of building towards the final paper; the final paper ended up being a lot to put together, and while the sections provided crash courses in designing experiments, statistics, etc, it would still be a very difficult assignment to pull off without more experience in taking other PSYC courses (e.g. Research Methods, Statistics, etc). 
Similarly, the design for the exams also seemed inefficient / not as well-done as it could have been. The final was a random 5 questions pulled from a list of 20+ (on the midterm, 40 questions) that were given to students ahead of time. While it's an efficient way to make students review and study all the course content, it ended up being overwhelming and ultimately disappointing. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked the material, but the lectures were sometimes dry, and not totally necessary for the exam/paper. The textbook was also extremely dense, so I mostly skimmed or skipped it altogether. The live discussions were a good idea, but they were hard to participate in and in the end were kind of useless, despite Professor Keil's efforts to get us talking. The exams were also REALLY hard, and I most just ended up memorizing things from the textbook that I found while preparing. The final paper was really interesting but we didn't get enough guidelines/ instruction. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Keil is very knowledgeable on the topic and the material is very interesting. Additionally, the text is very clear and pairs well with lecture.

Weaknesses: This course is very demanding for no good reason. This semester your grade consisted of two exams and a large project. Each exam consisted of 5 essay questions that had multiple specific parts that required knowledge of specific studies to support your answers. A week before each exam, a list of 25-35 possible essay questions were handed out. This is insane. It takes a very long time to work through the study guide and the exam is not open note. The list should be shortened significantly or handed out way earlier. Needing to memorize that amount of information in one week is unreasonable. Additionally, the final project and final exam were within a few days of each other. The final project was meant to be worked on throughout the semester and the sections were meant to help with this. However, the sections did not do this effectively. They were essentially mini-lectures on research methods. It was very difficult to navigate such a huge project without consistent direction. I also believe the project was beyond the scope of the course since it required so much extra learning and resources during section. This is a 100 course that required a 5000 word research paper and teaching yourself how to use R. Super stressful. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course material itself was super interesting, but I wish it was a bit more structured. As a result, a lot of work is condensed during exams and at the end. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Keil is clearly incredibly well-versed in the field of developmental psychology. The course was interesting overall. However, I wasn't a huge fan of the flipped classroom structure. It requires a lot of self-motivation - all the learning of content comes from the student, and the live virtual sessions are just for discussing other topics or answering questions. I would have preferred a bit more live lecture, not just video recordings and reading the textbook. This format might work better for some students than for others, though. I also thought we needed more guidelines on the final research project - we didn't get enough guidance on how to "make up" data. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â weaknesses: the syllabus could be structured better; sometimes we had to read two or three new chapters + watch multiple lecture videos during the same week as we had an exam that tested us on that very material, so the material was a bit crammed in for some weeks <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: lectures were recorded and could be watched on own time, all the potential questions are given in advance so preparing for these is low stress, sections were informative
weakness: lectures and book overlapped a lot- better to just read the book to answer the questions, the in-person component was not very well organized and was dependent on students to lead the lecture which was hard because it was virtual,  I thought the final paper was an interesting idea to introduce students to research but it felt like a waste of time because making up a dataset to analyze it just seemed unnecessary in a course that wasn't about statistics. Maybe something like a research methods paper where a student submits a proposal of a novel experimental idea would have served better. I remember finding it very uncecessary. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the professor and TFs (mine was Tristan, she was great) were obviously very knowledgeable, responsive, and seemed genuinely kind.  A big weakness was the research paper assignment  I had really no idea what to do, even after discussing.  Again, I liked my TF a lot as a person, but the way the discussion sections were set up didn't really help me at all on the research paper.  I felt like I did most of my research myself.  Also, I think it would have been very hard without some background in statistics.  Additionally, I felt that the lecture videos and in-class time was interesting, but for the exams, the book was much more relevant  not good or bad, just something I wanted to note. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Seems like Professor Keil is a good professor in-person, but this class was not engaging this semester. The lectures were very slow and his engagement in the videos seemed pretty low. I understand that its tough to transition online so I dont want to speak lowly about the class. 

The material was very difficult to find purposeful applications. Some of the questions seemed to have no significance and it was tough to persevere through that. Some of the topics were interesting (e.g. critical periods and social deprivation), but I would recommend taking this class unless you really want to pursue child development later on in your life. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was very difficult to stay engaged with the prerecorded lectures especially because the slides had very little content. This would normally work in a live lecture because you can focus on the professor but it did not adapt well at all to virtual learning. I was honestly very disengaged with this course which was disappointing because I was genuinely interested in the topic. You end up teaching yourself most of the content as you study for the exams because most of the material on the exams was not covered in class or if it was it was covered very briefly and only at a surface level whereas the questions went much more in depth. The discussion sections were somewhat of a strength- I didn't learn much from them since they essentially only focused on skills needed for the final paper but it was nice to have something synchronous. Synchronous lectures would have been a major improvement in my opinion and if that weren't possible then more content on the slides would have been helpful so that we could follow along a little better with the lines of reasoning. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength was that the material was very interesting and the TAs and Professor were great. The weaknesses I believe can be mainly attributed to Zoom. The engagement was low because the class was so large and there were barely any cameras on.It was also very difficult to prioritize this class in terms of work. I think that we should have been encouraged to work on our research papers earlier on in the semester and have an official halfway point with something due. Most people seemed to start really working on it only a couple weeks before it was due. With the final 3 days before the paper was due, this time crunch was way too much. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think a strength was working on the research paper starting at an early point. It gave me enough time to prepare and think about my project before it was due. One thing the course could work on is finding new ways to make the lecture more engaging. Because we would read the textbook and also watch the pre-lectures, it kind of seemed like the lectures themselves were repeats of those things. Maybe we could talk about different things in lecture that still relate but maybe include different aspects which would make it seem more novel. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The TAs were helpful and willing to provide feedback for the final project throughout the semester. However, this course's format had many weaknesses. For one, the weekly recorded lectures hardly went into enough detail. Some weeks the lectures would just amount to 30 minutes worth of content. I feel like this would not have been the case if we were in person, so I don't know why lecture lengths were cut down by so much. The weekly discussion format also does not work for a class that's supposed to be 60 people. Also, the syllabus stated that there would be weekly responses that would contribute to our grade but in the end, only our midterms and final project amounted to our final grade. It would have been nice to have more check ins that could contribute to our grade, like the syllabus suggested. The midterm dates also did not match what was stated in the syllabus and clarification for that was only given a week beforehand. Besides this disorganization, the lectures were often hard to follow with slides that were not helpful as well. The content was interesting but it was hard to engage with the course with so many flaws. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Prof Keil did a great job with lecture and really asking questions that at first might not seem important but actually reveal a lot about children. Overall, the course was very well done, but I think for me it would have been helpful if we started the projects a little earlier into the semester. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Class content is super interesting and engaging but felt disorganized. This class is supposed to be amazing but didnt translate efficiently to online. 

Weaknesses: Very little guidance in terms of what students are expected to know for exams. There was no guidance on what to prioritize during the very short  lecture videos or in the readings  because everything was fair game. 

Very few opportunities for grades, only two exams and final projectSection didnt even count for a grade so few people showed Up. We also didnt have graded benchmarks for the final project so MANY ppl left everything for the week of the project.

Strengths: final project was very fun. We received a list of possible exam questions a week before exams. Teaching team is very knowledgeable and very kind and helpful. Frank Keil is a legend in the field of developmental psychology, great personality too! <br/></div>
