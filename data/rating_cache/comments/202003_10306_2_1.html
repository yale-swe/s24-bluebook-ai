<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Professor HoSang and the two TFs, Alison and Sylvia, were great discussion leaders who pushed our learning in new ways and combined several different modes of thought to think through alternative futures of resistance. I didn't really like the many additional small assignments and class preparation that got tacked onto the class, which sometimes, I thought, helped to facilitate learning and sometimes did not. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> The readings were challenging, engaging, and exciting. Dr. HoSang, Alison, and Sylvia were clearly committed to the course and worked really hard to ensure our learning. Seminar discussion was also typically really exciting and illuminating. The first half of the course did feel a bit disorganized in terms of the auxiliary assignments, which were about the workload of a discussion post, but different every week and only announced during or after seminar. In the second half, these assignments were on a rotation among project groups, which worked much better. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Professor HoSang and the teaching fellows were AMAZING. The way class was organized every week was so conducive to online learning and very engaging. I haven't had an online class yet that was as organized and well thought out as this one. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> A major strength of this course is the content. The readings and the discussions we had were incredibly important and engaging. Also, everyone in the course, from the students to the instructors, had a visible passion about these issues. However, one weakness is that I don't think the expectations were adequately reflecting the pandemic. I would have liked to have seen more accommodating policies when students were clearly struggling. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> The readings in this course were definitely a strength, especially the weeks we could choose our own reading. Also, this class was helpful in discussing what "neoliberalism" means and how this relates to current work on anti-racism. Additionally, the most interesting insight of this class was the work we did on class and labor organizing. However, sometimes it felt as though the syllabus was a bit broad, and potentially just felt like a course addressing all the things left out of RPL. Also, given how difficult and trying this semester was on students and professors alike, it was really hard to keep up with the demand of this class. It often felt as though a new component of participation was added every two weeks and it became overwhelming. It was hard to feel supported by the teaching staff, as the workload and the demand of the course was far too great for most students to bear in a healthy way, which I think detracted from the course. It was hard to stay engaged when completing the readings and pre-class assignments were so draining, or when you had to worry about one or more aspects of participation while in class. I think readjusting the workload is necessary. Also, restating the objectives of the class - especially since two of the listed goals on the syllabus are in relation to assignments. It would help to have clear objectives for learnings/teachings/practices that are to emerge from the class. Hopefully this would make the class feel a bit more focused and less like an extension of RPL. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Professor HoSang and the teaching assistants tried to be thoughtful about the way this class was carried out. They did make an effort to ensure that the workload was not excessive.  Reading was kept to around one hundred pages per week, and our weekly assignments usually consisted of a reading response or being responsible for a section of the class. The class largely revolved around two assignments: one to design a curriculum unit and the other being a somewhat open-ended final paper. These were probably the highlights of the class, as we were given the freedom to focus on a topic of our choice. The teaching staff were quite thoughtful about pairing us with other students with similar interests, and did offer quite a bit of support for both of these projects. 

I will admit that this course fell short of my expectations. I was quite excited to take another class with Professor HoSang, having previously taken Race, Politics, and the Law. Knowing that Professor HoSang is a stellar instructor, many of the shortcomings of the class can probably be attributed to it being conducted via Zoom. 

Nevertheless, the class itself was structured quite strangely. For one, there were, in my opinion, too many students in the class to allow for any type of substantive discussion. While the teaching assistants did put in quite a bit of effort into the class, it often felt like they ran much of the discussion, making a bit harder to engage with Professor HoSang directly. The workload was also distributed quite poorly, and piled onto the last few weeks of classes. This proved to be slightly stressful, as we essentially spent most of the semester having little to no feedback on our progress. Class discussions were also arranged ahead of time (i.e. who was speaking). While this was helpful in allowing us to focus on a specific part of the reading, sometimes we would be asked to speak at length on a reading two days before class. This was a bit frustrating, and I feel like it would have been better to have free-flowing discussions instead of imposing an excessive amount of structure.  While it was not downright terrible, the organization of the class could have been much better. Thematically, it often felt like our takeaways from each week did not vary much, and the insights I took away from this class pale in comparison to those from Race, Politics, and the Law. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> This is a very high workload course! In the middle of a pandemic, students were expected to read hundreds of pages a week, collaborate on assignments, and produce reports for next week's class as well as make discussion posts on canvas. As interesting as the material is, it is very hard to absorb so much of it at once and also meet the high expectations that the course has for its students. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Many of the readings for the course were very interesting and informative. However, given how much we were reading, we often didn't have enough time in class to fully discuss and unpack the readings and how they related to the greater course of study. This was particularly a problem for readings that were more difficult to understand. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Strengths: The books we were assigned throughout the course were fantastic, and provided many different perspectives to the topics of the course. 

Weaknesses: There did not seem to be much room for nuance or critiques of the ideas presented in the course. Sometimes the material was presented as this is what it is and dissenting opinions/perspectives were considered incorrect. These topics are not hard sciences... they are up for debate/critique. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> I loved all of the different and unique ways that we were called upon to engage in the course. Another big strength was the syllabus. All of the readings were truly amazing and very engaging. However, sometimes it was difficult to keep up with the rotating tasks that we were assigned for each week as the format of the class seemed to change often. Additionally, the reading load in a couple of weeks was hard to manage. That being said though, overall the class was very beneficial to my learning. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> I think a strength was that everyone in the class had taken "Race, Politics, and the Law" which allowed us to start the class with a level of common ground and shared understanding and commitment to the content of the course. However, I think that the size of the class was maybe too large, because it sometimes made in-depth full class discussions difficult. Because of this, the class sometimes felt more like a lecture-seminar hybrid than a pure seminar, because we did not have that much time for discussion (about 20-30 minutes total within every 2 hour class). However, I think that the breakout room conversations were very successful, and gave us the opportunity to really  work with the material and learn from our peers. I learned a lot during the breakout rooms! <br/></div>
