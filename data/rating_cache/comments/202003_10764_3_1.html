<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Succeeded: captions on Michael Koelle's videos were SO helpful, I wish the other profs had done this

Needs improvement: <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the recorded lectures were always very good, and the quizzes were very informative in their coverage of material. <br/></div>

</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The tactic of in-lecture quizzes was a very effective one for driving engagement with the material. However, engagement in the live sessions was often so low that breakout room sessions were spent entirely in silence. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought that of the five classes I took this semester this class did the best in adapting to virtual learning. I liked that we received credit for watching the lectures by engaging in quizzes, which motivated me to watch the lectures on time, keeping me to a schedule, while also testing my knowledge in a non-stressful way, since we were able to retake them until we got the correct answer. The live sessions were a great time to recap the content from the past week, although I personally did not find the breakout sessions very helpful. The polls during these were fun, though. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The recorded lectures, live virtual lectures, and discussion sections were all successful due to reasons mentioned above. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The asynchronous lectures with embedded quizzes were helpful. The sections also facilitated learning. I thought that the live sections were not particularly helpful, although I enjoyed the additional "fun topic" section. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Succeeded: Professors were very flexible with timing, i.e. there was no mandate to attend live lectures, and they were cognizant of those in inconvenient time zones when it came to exams.

Could be improved: The presence of prerecorded lectures disincentivizes people from attending live lectures and actively engaging with the material. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The prerecorded lectures were successful. Students could watch the lectures at any convenient time depending on their circumstances, as well as pause the lectures and replay sections if something was unclear. The polls and breakout room discussions during the live Zoom sessions and discussion sections allowed for virtual engagement - the ability to actually discuss course material with other students in real time. This was also successful. Nothing comes to mind that really needs improvement. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â successes: video lectures were mostly very efficient and effective ways to communicate material, save for a few without captions or unclear learning goals/commentary. embedded quizzes that could be retaken without penalty helped increase understanding of material and engagement with the video, especially in the last third where quizzes were embedded partially through videos rather than at the end. recording lectures and not making live sessions require or part of a grade greatly increased accessibility and contributed to an environment more conducive to learning virtually, especially for students in different time zones.

improvements: honestly none the class went extremely well in my opinion and even the canvas quiz exams utilized online infrastructure available very efficiently. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The tests, especially the final, seemed to be quite different than practice test questions and PSETs. I assume this is because the exam was held remotely; however, it would have been nice to have had practice with these types of questions beforehand. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I enjoyed having the live and recorded lecture components. The live lectures deepened my understanding of the material and provided meaningful practice. However, I was a bit frustrated that the course exceeded its designated lecture time overall and think that it made planning for my other courses difficult. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Recorded lectures ended up taking pretty long to actually get through, though I'm not sure there's much that could be done about this. Maybe restructure a little to cram more into the initial lectures and less into later lectures? The material seemed to be weighted towards the second half of the class. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would suggest shortening the lecture vids because they took a lot longer than I think a live class would take. Otherwise, I think the class did a great job combining things asynchronously that we didn't need to do live with a more engaging live session. Of all my classes, this was the only one that came up with a great model for live sessions where you actually learn and do great reviews from the pre-recorded lectures. Especially Matt Simon's part was really great in this regard. Also they did a good job taking our questions during the live sessions and answering them, so more people asked questions than usual since it was anonymous. Matt Cook was an amazing TA and really cared about the class and did a good job coordinating everything, giving us extra help and review, and I really appreciate it! <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The recorded lectures were helpful

I really really hope that you will all be generous with the grading for this class this semester. I still can't believe that despite this class occurring in a pandemic, the professors (who certainly understand the effect COVID-19 has had on everyone and their students) don't want to curve a class. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Pre-recorded lectures, live sessions, weekly zoom discussion sections, and Piazza greatly helped learning. I don't have any comments on what could be improved as the course was very good. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The time commitment I spent on this course was a lot more than I would have spent on the course if it were in-person, and even then I didn't do as well as I thought I would've. I felt like the amount of work I put in was not accurately reflected by my grades, and the feedback I received was not necessarily built to find a way to help me succeed but it was very much of a "figure this out on your own" type of class that left me feeling lost in a class full of people that seemed to understand what was going on. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I  really enjoyed taking this class in a virtual format. I think having the lectures recorded to refer back to was really instrumental to success this semester when it can otherwise be difficult to engage with virtual learning. There were checkpoints throughout all of the recorded lectures to ensure you understood what was going on, which was useful when you couldn't do polls in class that you would normally expect. Further, there were ample office  hours and Piazza was a great resource for any questions that came up. Even the break-out rooms were less painful in this class than in others. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course adjusted extremely well to virtual learning. I was able to learn a lot of the material, and the breakout room formats within lectures and discussion sections were especially helpful in learning. This allowed all of us to interact with each other to solve a problem and ask questions. For improvement, perhaps maybe more office hours would be helpful (or at least being cognizant of who is in the waiting room so they don't wait for an extremely long time like I was once). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I definitely felt it difficult to truly engage in this class because I didn't really know anyone in the class and so I didn't really feel I had someone to work on problem sets or talk over material with.  I would suggest that for the future, if this class has to be taught remotely again, it would be really helpful to give people the option to be paired with a study partner at the beginning of class.  It's the kind of thing that would happen serendipitously in an in-person lecture because you would meet people by sitting next to them.  I think that the awkwardness of zoom makes this a bit harder. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The balance between recorded lectures and live sessions were great, as was the use of video quizzes. Posting the lecture notes and study guides for each lecture was really helpful for taking notes. Piazza was also a good tool to communicate any questions and for students to have discussions with each other, despite being online. Offering discussion sections but not making them required was also a good strategy, since it allows students to interact with their TAs if needed, but it also accommodates for the fact that everyone has different personal situations due to the pandemic. The organization of this course and the use of various tools (Canvas, Piazza, recording live sessions, discussion sections) was very effective. <br/></div>

Although the psets were only graded based on one question each, my TA did not share what question was graded or why points were taken offthe TA usually just wrote good job.

I also really liked the format of office hours. It was nice to use the canvas tool, which allowed me to have a slightly smaller office hour session with the professors, but also didn't require me to email the professors specially. Finally, I'm not sure if this was a pandemic practice, but I found piazza incredibly helpful. It was great to be able to ask questions whenever we thought of them, rather than having to wait for the next class, and it was useful to read what other people were asking. Finally, I didn't love the live sessions-- I really enjoyed the supplements, and found some of the practice questions helpful, but it would have been nice if these sessions were a little shorter given that we also had to listen to two extremely long lectures by the end of the course. <br/></div>
