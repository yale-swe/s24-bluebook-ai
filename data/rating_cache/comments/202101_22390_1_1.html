<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The amount of work felt much greater than other courses because they came in intervals. I would have preferred weekly "keep up with the material" assignments over the current format of really long take-home assignments. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength is that the lectures are very well organized and informative. A weakness is that the first part of the lectures was kind of challenging for students to identify fossils just from pictures. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: love the survey-aspect

Weakness: Beginning of the curve had a super high learning curve, felt like we were expected to know a ton about fossils, but I had no background. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The material was great -- the professors truly do care about their fields and are very communicative and helpful. The course itself is horribly structured. There is no effort made to make transitions as we change professors, who have three different teaching styles. More importantly, in class lectures are not reflected in most test material or open assignments. The exams are extremely overwhelming entail extreme "outside research" to answer because they do not connect with the in class taught material. Any broad and "open-ended" questions have a particular answer, including on exams and the essay. Regardless of what may be asked, there is a particular answer for each question and oftentimes, the answer is indecipherable because it wasn't taught. There is an expectation of students to read the professors' minds on assignments, exams, and the essay when students are here to learn, not be grades as though they are equivalent to experts in the fields.  The course made no accommodations for the difficult learning environment, cramming material that turned out not to always been relevant to exams. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Each of the 3 professors in the teaching team had different interests and expertise. 
Weaknesses: 3 exams and 1 paper, which was a lot of work. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was nice that the sections were broken up with take home exams and homework assignments. My only suggestion would be to add a little more "structure" to the course. I had difficulty with knowing what was expected of me with certain assignments. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths- I sort of liked having the variety of different professors teaching this course.  Each is an expert in their respective field, and it was great to learn from a team that was clearly very passionate (and who really cared about the students).
Weaknesses- if the midterm exams weren't take-home format, I would have had no idea what to study.  Lectures often seemed composed of a lot of incredibly specific things and broad themes escaped me at many points. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professors were absolutely amazing; if I were just to audit the class and sit through lectures, every lecture was like a story. Unfortunately I've been having a hard time focusing, so the online aspect was a bit painful. I liked that we had three different professors for three different portions of the class. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The content, while a bit over crammed into this one class, was interesting and the professors were very engaging. Where the course lacks is how the expectations for the writing assignment are not very clear. Draft and/or paper proposals reviewed by staff would likely promote better essays. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â not a gut course for non-stem majors trying to get a science credit at all! <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Overall, I really liked the class. Each section was really wonderful. Derek's section was really well done and was a phenomenal introduction to the course, but I personally wasn't quite as interested in some of the details on preservation. Bhart's content was the least organized, but I also loved how much passion and energy he brought to the lectures. Celli's section was really fascinating, very compelling, and a great way to tie together the class. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I enjoyed the three-part format of the course, as it helped break up the lectures and brought in more diversity of lecturing style and topic focus. The course had a few too many assessments I think, as 3 large exams and a major paper made for a challenging workload at times. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was organized. I can identify topics ok.

I think the second part of the course had the slides missing info? but it was ok because the lecturer adjusted for it on thebexam 

I also wished we could see our exams afterward (to see where pts were lost) <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The format of the course and the enthusiasm of the instructors was great. 

The biggest weakness is the lack of transparency in grading. Assignments are returned with arbitrary grades with little feedback and no rubrics. This was frustrating at times. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: fairly engaging lectures, all three professors were fairly responsive to student concerns and input

Weaknesses: only Prof Hull geared her lectures well at non-science majors, and we didn't get to her until the end. Prof Briggs and Prof Bhullar would benefit from including more text on slides and focusing on explaining the basics to non-STEM students rather than trying to sound really fancy. We also NEVER got feedback on the first midterm which meant that as someone used to writing papers, I had no chance to improve how I tackled science exam questions until the final. Frankly this came off as very unprofessional -- it seems like you should not be allowed to assign a second exam until you've provided feedback on the first one, because otherwise how can I be expected to learn and improve? <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course covers a lot of material, which is both its biggest strength and its biggest weakness, I think. Naturally, you learn a lot and gain a pretty comprehensive view of life throughout time, but at the same time, it can feel like you're not taking much away because you don't study any one topic or time period in great depth. Of course, I think that that's sort of the point of the course, so it's not really something that can be improved, but is rather just something that students should understand going in to it. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Overall I really enjoyed the class and I was constantly engaged and interested. I wish that the lab could have been offered this semester. I thought that the overall design and structure of the course was very well-suited for virtual lectures. Something that I did not like is that it was very hard to receive feedback on psets and exams. I felt like I didn't really have access to feedback and so had trouble understanding what I was doing right and whether or what I was learning. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: content was rich and interesting

weaknesses: the amount of content was very overwhelming, and the course did not always feel very structured. Having three different professors was also difficult  because we had  to adjust to different  teaching styles with each  new professor. the  take-home exams were ridiculously extensive, and took many hours  longer than professors and TFs explained it  would (the  instructors  said the exams might take  about 3 hours, and students wound up working  on them for 7  hours or more). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The grading was very vague. Turnover time for exams was very long. We'd finally be notified the exams were graded, but often weren't given our grade unless we specifically asked the TA for it. Even then, you'd get back a letter grade with no other information, and would have to ask the TA for grading specifics, and even then the TA would say they couldn't return your exam or the marked up graded version in case we save it and recirculate it for future years, so you'd have to specifically ask them what points you got on and off of, and even then it was super vague/confusing/arbitrary feeling. The first and easiest improvement that could be made is using the grades page on canvas. That wasn't used at all this semester. Then, distributing a clear rubric for graded exams and also showing students where they got points on or off. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It's a lot of content: if I had not been able to do this course virtually (with the ability to rewatch lectures and use my notes for the exams) I know I would have had a much harder time understanding and retaining the material. It's a lot to cover (it's the history of life!!) so I found the classes sometimes went too fast (or the pace was ok but it was so much material that by the end of the lecture I realized I had not really retained much of it). The exams and exercises were helpful towards better understanding/applying the material. The course itself was really interesting for the most part; I particularly enjoyed the second part of the class with Professor Bhullar (his lectures are engaging and I found the material in this part of the course to be the most interesting). I think that overall I enjoyed the course but it could benefit from going at a slower pace at times.  I also appreciated the sections, which helped solidify my understanding, and the fact that they were not all mandatory (this flexibility was greatly appreciated!). <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength of the course is that 3 different professors teach the material over the course of the semester. Therefore, you get 3 different experts lecturing on their respective research, which makes for some interesting variety throughout the course. I liked the lecture format and the relevant exercises, which helped reinforce the material. Also, I can't stress enough how much I liked the take-home exams. Taking the exams at my own pace dramatically lowered stress and actually helped me learn AND retain the information (since I could look up answers to my questions as I was taking the exam). Compared to other classes which had in-class exams, I found that I retained the information for this class much better. However, it would have been nice to get quicker feedback on exams/papers/relevant exercises quicker since grading often took many weeks (I didn't know about 75% of my final grade until the last few weeks of the course). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Huge portions of this class were absurdly boring. Who knew the history of life was so dry? But I guess if you really like fossils you don't mind dry. <br/></div>
