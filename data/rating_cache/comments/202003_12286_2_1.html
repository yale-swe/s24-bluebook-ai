<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength include that the TF was amazing! Dr. Bhimani was one of the best TFs I had so far at Yale!

The iOLab (experimental kit used) was good and allowed us to make experiments but sometimes it was limited and the documentation available for it was inadequate (form the manufacturer). 

Working on a group has also been great because I was able to learn so much from peers. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One strength is that the course made it relatively easy to follow and learn the Python. They didn't try to teach us too many new commands at once, and the code we were given was extremely well commented. I'm not representative, though, because I have some previous coding experience (but not in Python). That being said, you could almost get by just by copying and pasting without really understanding everything.

I think it would have been nice to have more guidance from the beginning on how to write lab reports. We weren't told very much about what to include, or how to format things. This was only a problem on the first few labs; they gave us clearer instructions and models after that. It would have been helpful to have those from the start. I was also surprised at how short the lab reports were: two pages, double-spaced. This just isn't a lot of space to discuss a lab, and it's much less than, for example, chem lab. On the other hand, I imagine that an in-person semester might have longer lab reports, since we could do more complex experiments. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lab sessions and jupyter notebooks were very well-organized and helpful in learning, especially given that this lab course was completely virtual. Feedback from the professor or the TF was also done in a timely manner, I really don't have anything negative to say about this course except maybe the time; they were unable to accommodate my time zone very well which ended up in me having to wake up at 7am to attend each three-hour section. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professor and TF were great. They were very helpful and adapted the course well to the online format. The main weakness of the course was, of course, that it was online, so our equipment was very limited. Despite this, the IOLabs were pretty cool and let us do a lot of experiments in our dorms. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the iOLab was a great idea, and many of the labs were fun to go through with your partner. In terms of weaknesses, a lot of the homework felt like busywork and didn't add much to my learning. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was doen well for a virtual lab. However, it was difficult to conduct some experiments in the dorm room and sometimes the level of coding required was slightly above the level of someone with no coding experience. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I felt the lectures that started every class were a bit rushed. I would have appreciated more time spent on those as they explained the physics concepts behind the experiments we were doing in class. 

I also think more time should have been given to explaining what we were doing in each experiment and what the goal was before starting the actual experiment. I found that a significant amount of time was spent at the beginning of our independent classwork time every week trying to determine how to do an experiment as opposed to just doing it.

I also wish we spent more time in class going over the error propagation exercises we did and read about in HW. Im not sure I mastered the concepts and Im still not always clear when and how to apply the error analysis techniques that we learned. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was great! I feel like the course load was manageable and I learned a lot about how to run experiments. It was nice to be able to still do data collection at home with the iOLabs. Plus, the final project offered us creative freedom and the ability to think on our own to really get to the heart of what experimentation is all about. Of course, it would have been nice to actually "discover" something, but this is a weakness of most teaching labs anyway the results are already known and there's none of that error limbo and attacking concepts from multiple angles (i.e. using multiple different experiments). That aspect might be nice to add for next time (do I get the same results if I try an independent experiment?). Also, some of the "lecture" portions went a little fast and I had to ask the TA to recap a lot. Overall, I was very happy with the way this course was run, though. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course's sporadic and surface level exposure to statistical concepts was meaningless at best and confusing at worst. Up until 3/4 into the semester the statistical concepts were completely unrelated to the work being conducted in lab and made the homework seem like busy work. The confusion about the relevancy of the homework could be reduced if the lab write-ups included application of the concepts that directly tie to last week's homework. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Virtual labs are very hard to do, especially with something like physics which seems fairly hands-on. However, I think the instructors did a good job managing this by using the iOLabs. 

Weaknesses: The main weakness was a very brief introduction to Python. I have never coded before and this class definitely threw me in the deep end. Oftentimes, I didn't understand code presented to me and this made successfully completing assignments difficult. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The design of this course was excellent. It progressed smoothly and at an appropriate pace, with each weekly activity building another skill we would ultimately apply in our final independent investigation. I know planning a remote lab class must have been difficult, but it went off excellently, and I felt engaged with all the activities. The introduction to Python and all the error analysis reading we did was also fantastic. If I had one suggestion, it would be maybe one more mini-lecture clarifying some of the error analysis concepts. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of the course include the diverse array of topics, including subjects of interest for the final project, along with the easy-to-follow experiments. The biggest weakness is the lack of standards with regards to the lab write ups. There was no real rubric or guide to model our summaries after, which led to stress regarding what was left out or not. Furthermore, there should be some extra time set aside for programming help, as many students have not been previously exposed to it. Finally, the fact that this a physics lab should be emphasized more. Despite the reasonable focus on measurement and data analysis, the physics concepts themselves are also important for students taking the introductory course and should be considered accordingly. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think this course was pretty good. I did feel like we could have made better use of the IOlab, since we only used it for ~3 projects <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the course was done well online, the level of engagement was strong, as most of the time was spent in break out rooms with lab partners. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course could have been improved by including a better explanation of the Python code we were using. I didn't truly understand why we were using the code we were using, and even then, I only understood the little that I did because I learned some Python a couple years ago. The group work was a strength of this course, because I learned a lot from how my peers approached the lab problems. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I learned a lot about basic Python, and this course is a great introduction to application of code for someone who has never coded before. I didn't feel at a disadvantage to my peers who had taken computer science courses in the past, but I do think publicizing the TA office hours better (and sending all the TA's office hours to every student, not just their section's students) would be really helpful for the students who struggle with the code, especially at the beginning. Overall, Dr. Irons made the course really fun and engaging and I had a great time in the lab meetings, especially because of the small section size (there were only 4 people on my lab day). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course could have been more friendly to beginners at coding, offering maybe a little bit more of an introduction to using Python. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â To improve tthis course, I would spend more of time used fo error analysis to also learn to implement these techniques in python. I also would have liked to use more of the range of sensors on the IOLab to explore a wider range of physical properties. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Although it was harder online, I think the class was strong in terms of the labs we were given to do, and teaching us data analysis through python/jupyter notebook. <br/></div>
