<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures are a bit long, which can be hard to follow at times. But for the most parts they're pretty engaging and not like your standard English lecture. Professor Williams really goes out of his way to find interesting things about the literature that you wouldn't have otherwise thought of. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: great professor with well-planned lectures that conform well to the online format, great TAs that encourage thoughtful and engaging conversations in section, breaks in-between the lengthy classes (especially nice on the eyes), reading material length perfect for the short period of time that we have (I also appreciated the ability to dive into the works without being overwhelmed in quantity of reading -- it deepened my understanding of the literature), flexible/generous assignments, professor/TAs considerate of online format and willing to adapt 

Weaknesses: I didn't find any -- was one of the best thought-out and executed courses that I have taken! <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Even though the course was online and basically became a lecture, I thought it was conducted really well given the circumstances. Assignments were great and feedback was clear <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was a zoom course, but it felt like one of the best online courses I have taken. Discussion sections were interpersonal, and Professor Williams worked hard to engage with individuals even through the screen. I would have loved to read a larger range of authors, but being that the course was only 5 weeks long that may not be feasible. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought this was a wonderfully structured course for the zoom medium. It required an appropriate amount of work, all of which was beneficial. The breaks within the class were also greatly appreciated! They helped me stay fresh through the whole 3 hour period. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - very engaging, books were very interesting, questions always answered, very good support within my discussion section and TA, liked the prerecorded lecture that one time, was able to rewind and understand what professor was saying  
Weakness - lectures were very long, there were low energy checkpoints, not enough engagement within lectures, felt very draining to have 3 straight hours of content. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The discussion section was definitely the best part of the course for me. My TA Pooja Sen was really wonderful and the people in my section were all very engaging. The lectures were also very well put together. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: content was very interesting and thought provoking. TAs were very knowledgeable.
Weaknesses: If this class has to be online it should not be a lecture. Lecture format was very disengaging. Also, each session was WAY TOO LONG. We had class &amp; section from 1:00-4:15pm twice a week. Would have been better to break it up into three sessions/week. 

Also, I was unable to access many of the lectures online, but Ive been having issues with my zoom account. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The weakness of this course, in my opinion, was definitely the lecture segment. Perhaps it could have been improved if instead of having an extended lecture, and then a somewhat related discussion aspect, the two were more deeply intertwined. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Due to the strange circumstances of this summer, a lot more students than normal were enrolled in the course. Because of this, our class was a mix of lectures and sections. English classes are usually more discussion-based than lecture-based, so the lecture portions of this class were often less engaging than the discussion section part of it. The weakness of this course was thus the nature of the lecture, but our instructor tried his best to incorporate discussion by having section at the end of class, which was the strength. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Changing the method in the last two lessons threw me off my game. I would rather have the same lesson plan continue on; a lecture by Professor Williams (camera off and microphone muted) followed by Q and A by our TA and general conversation followed up by a wrap up of our conversations. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Williams is amazing, the discussion sections were interesting
Weaknesses: Sometimes it was hard to be engaged with the lecture portion <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: professor was engaging and taught an interesting perspective of American literature. The readings were also fascinating and built off each other. 
Weaknesses: the last assignment to write about what you learned was wack. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Despite the course being online, Professor Williams's lectures were engaging, and he was very accommodating. While it was nice that a large number of students could enroll in the class and have the opportunity to take Am Lit, the large class size was also a drawback. Am Lit is supposed to be a seminarand because we had TAs, I never got to know Professor Williams, which is a shame bc he seems like a cool guy. Given the situation, however, I think Professor Williams did the best he could in terms of the class format by having lectures and section with TAs. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â During a very abnormal summer, Professor Williams led a class that was as easy as possible to engage with fully, overcoming constraints like time differences, the strain of online class and the difficulty of not being able to engage in proper seminar discussion when studying English. The teaching fellows were knowledgeable, invested in the students and very encouraging, which enabled me to feel immersed in the class even from over 3000 miles away from where it normally would be held. Though it was a summer course during unprecedented times, it never once felt like I was getting a second rate study of some very interesting texts. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the only weakness of this course was that due to the short length of the course itself, we did not have time for lengthier texts. Overall though, the course was incredibly well formatted, especially with the mix of lecture and discussion over Zoom. I think the instructor and TAs did an excellent job of adapting the course to an online format. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the course was very strong, especially under the circumstances of having to be online and with such a large course enrollment. The setup was effective because we had lecture for the bulk of the class and then broke out into discussion sections which were very engaging. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Because it was an online course, Professor Williams was in an interesting predicament. I think he did a phenomenal job of trying to maintain student engagement, especially given that the course is usually taught as a seminar, NOT a lecture. He had students participating in class, despite being over Zoom and without video, so it felt oftentimes like a real class, even if we couldn't be in person. His presentations are also beautifully constructed, intelligently, with a great deal of information. His lectures on Emily Dickinson were phenomenal. 

As for weaknesses, I think it was especially interesting that we spent one day on Langston Hughes and Gwendolyn Brooks. There were the only Black authors that we read, where there are a great deal other authors to cover. In addition, the normal sequence of American lit reads "There, There," inviting a Native/Indigenous voice into the mix. While I was pleased that I didn't have to suffer through Moby Dick, I would have liked perhaps a more diverse list. There is certainly merit in reading the authors that were chosen, but for a survey course, or an intended survey course, there is so much more that could have been covered. Moreover, I do not know why, to this day, Marshall McLuhan was included on the syllabus. Professor Williams studies media and teaches a media theory course. This class is NOT a media theory course. McLuhan's stuff is for sure interesting, no doubt about it. But it's not what comes to mind when one says "American literature." We could've read Toni Morrison, Zora Neale Hurston, James Baldwin, or even something modern like "There, There" by Tommy Orange. What about an American Pulitzer Prize winning book? American literature doesn't have to be resigned to pre-1950s. But I digress--the theory, the McLuhan stuff, felt like it belonged in another class, and the lectures for those works, as well as those concerning Pynchon, tended to meander. I still don't really get Pynchon--I can tell Professor Williams does, but I still do not, and I'm not sure if the lectures made his writing any more clear. The class' duration was too long for the amount of things that were being covered, and so we could've done so much more. 

Also a note regarding the TA's grading -- I'm always hesitant when a TA is in charge of the grading, and this course is no exception. I cannot see my grade at the moment, but once I do, I'm expecting an A-, which in all truth, I'm not sure is accurate. The comments I received from my TA on at least one assignment should've have brought my grade up to an actual A, yet her defense was that while my argument was fresh, exciting, well-written, cogent, it wasn't simply "original enough." I'm not sure this should be the standard for receiving an A, and I've noticed a trend/pattern of elitism in grading procedures among the Yale English department. The comments I received on this particular assignment were essentially nothing but good. I received not negative feedback--would this not imply an A? In another paper, I was praised for my originality, yet I was not given an A either. So what is the double-standard? Sure, this was my TA's doing. So I'd be interested to know how Professor Williams would've graded my work, had I written it for him in the more traditional seminar setting of this course. Needless to say, I am frustrated by this grade. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think this course could improve from more discussion of form. This class is strong in terms of close reading, but it would be helpful to discuss overarching motifs and specific literary devices of the text. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was hands off and uninteresting. Rather than analyze the author's craft or better understand the art of literature, the course focused on unclear historic trends or was simply rambling. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures were very interesting and Professor Williams is an engaging lecturer. The texts were also interesting and the writing assignments complemented them well. Sections were a breath of fresh air from isolation, and the discussions we had were useful and productive. I can't think of any glaring weaknesses besides inevitable ones caused by the fact that it was an online summer course; we didn't have that much time to read longer texts, and online engagement is hard to do. But I think the class worked around these limitations really well. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One of the strengths of the course was that it made literature accessible for people who don't have a lot of background in the subject. The class was very interesting and we learned about more than just literature. A weakness was the assignments and grading structure. I think the course could have benefitted from having some smaller assignments, rather than just 3 big essays, to keep us engaged with the content. Also since so much of our grade was based on our writing we could have spent more time in class working on developing our writing. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was really well thought out and I thought that the readings flowed really smoothly. This made it easier to draw different connections to earlier readings that furthered my understanding of the course. I also actually really enjoyed the bigger lecture and then smaller seminar structure of the course because it was a good mix of listening to Professor Williams talk and then also having time to talk myself in the discussion sessions. Once weakness of the course is that I wish we had more time to discuss some of the later pieces. It felt a bit rushed at times towards the end. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â **Strengths:** Good selection of authors on the syllabus. Professor Williams recognized the fast pace of the course in terms of the semesters worth of reading and an essay due each week, and was quite understanding, relaxing hard-deadlines for submissions with a real effort to make the summer session as stress-free as possible. I enjoyed the fact that in the second half, we would break off from the large lecture into discussion sections led by the TAs. The TAs were great and put in a lot of work! More than the professor...

**Weaknesses:** Lecture was pretty horrible. During lecture, we barely analyzed the works we were assigned?! I will never forget how we pulled up sketches of Whitmans portrait from subsequent publications of Leaves of Grass and unironically focused on changes emphasizing how his crotch bulge ""increased in size."" In a class on American Lit?? Its honestly startling how little focus we gave to literature during lecture (however, my TA at least clearly made an effort to bring a stronger focus during discussion section). We watched YouTube videos during class about some random guy who could only remember the last 30 second of his life, as well as a Playboy interview with Marshall McLuhan (who was Canadian btw... in a class on *American* Lit), like why  is literature not interesting enough? I say this as an applied math major. Also the essay prompts for this class were god awful, easily some of the worst I have ever seen. Essay 1: Memorize 20 lines of literature and write an essay about how *the process of memorization* helped you reach a new understanding. Essay 2: Read a work, then identify *a single word* and write a 3 page essay on that one word. Essay 3: Write 3 pages on what you learned by taking this course (We basically were graded on a quasi-course review). Honestly the hardest part of doing these essays was connecting it back to the literature?! Like the rubric *literally* said we needed to produce publication-worthy ideas that probably no one has ever thought of before to earn the highest marks. And writing something publication-worthy about the literature given these prompts?! Are you serious <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Overall, the course did an excellent job. I would have loved to interact more with Professor Williams during in-class discussions, but I recognize that the split lecture-seminar style required for online learning limited that; our discussion sections were well-led by excellent TFs, and we did see Prof. Williams even if it wasn't realistic for him to jump into our small group discussions. But I wasn't personally able to see him in office hours instead. As an English major, however, I hope to speak with him sometime this fall! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Williams lecturing style was did many things right--with lots of visuals and interesting topics--but I wish he had been more engaging. While he asked students to read to the class often, I wish he had posed questions and found other ways to get students involved throughout the class period. 

It sometimes felt as though there was too much content being condensed into too short of a time. Picking the most important pieces and focusing on a few others to compliment them might have made more sense. <br/></div>
