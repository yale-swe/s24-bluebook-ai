<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Having both recorded lectures/textbook readings to do in addition to class time and tutorials once a week was more class time than would normally be expected of students in a non-pandemic semester which I don't think made sense. Students had to spend more time on physics which took time away from other classes and other responsibilities. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The prerecorded lectures were good, though they just ended up making the in-person classes somewhat repetitive. The "study groups" of 3-5 students that completed quizzes, exams, and tutorials together were great, until Simon decided to rearrange them halfway through the course, just as we were beginning to bond with our fellow group members.  Tutorials were fun, but it would have been better to develop a relationship with the same TA over several weeks. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the group work was a bit challenging, to be honest. The group quizzes proved to be more difficult than expected, resulting in low scores across the board. However, Prof. Mochrie allowed for quiz revisions for 100% of your lost points, which was amazing. I think the module structure was great, and the in-person lectures were interesting as well. Overall, I think given the online format of the class, Prof. Mochrie did a stellar job. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was not well adapted to COVID learning. The class asks for a lot of work and time from students, and I think that with the COVID-19 adjustment the class just asked for more work. A strength of the class is the TF team who is very helpful for problem sets and preparing for tests. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Again, the file uploads were a real problem - I was unable to try to work ahead. The mandatory tutorials were also entirely unhelpful as most of the TAs didn't even seem to want to teach effectively in a virtual format by just staring at us and not guide us through on a whiteboard. The study halls varied in effectiveness - a lot of TAs were the same ones who just didn't want to teach and would just blaze through problem set answers and explain things too quickly or just straight up not explain. The live lectures were a waste of time as the professor would try to go too fast, and it ended up that students would ask about concepts that were many slides backwards and the professor would spend the rest of time attempting to explain that part while the rest were all left hanging with our own questions, as we were all over the place in terms of understanding - again, many of us would be unable to watch prerecorded lectures or have watched different ones at different times. The uploading schedule and the way lecture videos were organized were also unhelpful in that sometimes the lecture videos simply were named by just number or module number, but even THOSE numbers would be incorrect sometimes. Appropriate, more detailed naming of lecture videos and regular timing of video uploads (maybe even just uploading them all at once) with captions would be really, really helpful to student learning facilitation.
The beginning of the semester with the random study groups was a bit stressful. I lucked out with two good study groups, but I heard horror stories from friends who had study groups where they would all just not respond in the breakout rooms or stay silent and not do their parts on groupwork. We know we are supposed to report this type of behavior, but it truly was stress-inducing in the beginning. The group midterms were good, though, albeit a bit buggy sometimes because of problems with Zoom screenshare, but that's not the fault of the teaching team. It worked out in the end. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The live lectures could be more helpful. They tried to make it a problem solving session but I think it would've been better if they just did live lecture. There was just way too many things going on with this course. I was forced to do physics every single day when I had other courses to be concerned about. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The virtual study halls were incredibly helpful for learning content in an interactive way, which can be challenging in large Zoom lectures. I also found tutorial problems to be helpful for learning the material, and using the whiteboard feature on Zoom was an effective way to allow groups to collaborate. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I was frustrated that this class exceeded its allotted lecture time; we had lives lectures, tutorials (weekly section), and recorded lectures. It made planning for other courses difficult. On the positive side, the professor made sure there was collaboration in the class though by making mandatory study groups which took some of the pressure off for tests and quizzes. The utilization of a Zoom chat link was incredibly helpful in facilitating study halls/ <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The study groups were still very helpful in my opinion, especially during an online format. The tutorials were unnecessary because it just served as more time I had to dedicate towards the class that didn't help at all with my level of understanding of the week's content. The final project in lieu of the exam took a lot of stress off the shoulder of students and highlights what we got out of the course at the end of the semester, which I really enjoyed. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really liked the group quizzes and tests this semester. I think that I was better able to learn the material and having group members to bounce ideas off of was very helpful.

I think that the only improvement I would recommend is to make the course more manageable. The sheer amount of time into this class was overwhelming: we had pre-recorded lectures, live virtual lectures, tutorials, the extremely long problem sets, and weekly quizzes. I felt very overwhelmed and stressed throughout the semester. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The combination of prerecorded lectures with in-person lectures added up to way too many hours per week of lecture time.  In the future it would be more useful to teach us during the synchronous lectures and cut the pre-recorded lectures.

I thought the study groups which we took exams and quizzes with were a great idea.  It helped me form relationships with my peers and form a support network which I would have lacked in an online setting.

I also thought adding a coding component to the course was unnecessary.  I took this class to learn about physics and biology.  If I had wanted to learn how to code, I would have taken a computer science class.   It added unnecessary stress and confusion, especially given that all but one TA didn't know how to code in the language we needed to use. <br/></div>

Improvement: this class was SO SO time consuming compared to my other classes.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The flipped classroom was a little frustrating, and students generally seem to find this format for learning frustrating in other courses as well. Using class time to teach concepts then psets to reinforce / practice solving problems might lessen the heavy workload of this course, even when the concepts were not the most difficult to master. It was also a little frustrating to have discussion sections at different times each week with different TF's. Plus, flipping study groups in the middle of the semester, while I understand the reasoning behind doing it, was quite frustrating / unbalancing mid-term. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course required one to spend too many hours on zoom/staring at a screen, way more hours than would have been spent in person in normal semesters. Between watching pre-recorded lectures, live lectures, study hall hours, and tutorials, not even mentioning any additional office hours, a student could easily log a minimum of 10+ online hours per week just for this class. Also the group format, which was supposed to be useful to offset the difficulties of online learning, made things a lot worse in some cases. First, the groups were randomly assigned, not taking into time zone or scheduling availability, which made tutorials very hard to schedule (sometimes it wasnt even a student issue rather the TA wouldnt reach out with their availability until half way through the week). Also, over zoom taking an exam with multiple peoples voices talking and zooms glitches was very stressful (students with exam accommodations were denied any exception and had to take the exam in these groups, even if this style was a detriment to their learning). Working in groups was also harder because one could be placed in a good group where everyone worked together and spilt the work equally or at least all out in effort, or at times the groups could be terrible. Many students had experiences in which they were with other students who didnt study, prepare, or try, but rather relied on the efforts of their other group mates. Especially when it seems to be just one group member that cares enough to want a good grade in the course, there was a possibility that a student could be taking the group quiz/exams by themselves while the other kept their camera/audio off, but still got the credit/good score. Additionally, the professor included a coding component and did not screen the TAs to see which TAs could assist students who did not have a strong coding background (any form a coding was not listed as a prerequisite for the course). There ended up being only 1 TA who knew the coding program we used for the course, which made getting help even harder. The professor was also really hesitant to change any aspect of the course format even hen multiple students would raise these issues. <br/></div>
