<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Office hours were usually really helpful.
Weakness(?): There's too much material - section covered a lot of examples but I didn't have the time (or energy) to attend section. They were also recorded; I just wasn't motivated enough to watch the section recordings. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The course materials are decently organized by time and the content is pretty interesting, especially for CS or Math majors.
Weaknesses: For the virtual format, don't expect the material to be delivered that interestingly. Prof. Pohoata is a bit messy which makes the direction of long proofs hard to follow. Additionally, when we approach a new topic, we dive straight into the deep-end, i.e. get started right away on the proof, which can be hard. I would have liked it if there had been easier questions to get us warmed up for the bigger questions. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Psets are related to material, peer tutors are EXTREMELY helpful and perhaps the biggest positive of the course.  Professor is quite awful and offered little support. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I could follow the lectures, but despite feeling like I mostly understood, I struggled to complete the homework questions on my own and I REALLY struggled on the exams. I wish the lectures helped us more with actually knowing how to solve the problems. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the course presented some interesting math puzzles and provided a good introduction to proof methods. However, it was quite a bit more difficult than advertised, and I think Professor Poahata expected more comfort with math than was implied by the Math 115 prerequisite. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Joon Lee. Joon if you are reading this, thank you for all your good work. I hope other people express their gratitude too because you deserve a round of applause. Also, interesting material, mostly. 
Weaknesses: Some sections were really poorly explained. This was mostly true for the first third of the course. Like the proof of the AM-GM inequality--what on earth happened there. Some other places in the first third I felt equally confused, but I don't remember the names of the proofs. Graph theory was pretty well-explained but some proofs in the Ramsey section were under-explained (e.g. for Schur's I didn't understand that the edges were taking the color of the corresponding vertex in our original set of integers rather than some generic color assigned to a given number, and for hypergraph I didn't understand that coloring subsets =/= coloring the vertices within the subsets, until I went to office hours, aka Joon). These might seem like basic misunderstandings but we can't all be on a high level all the time when it's our first time taking a proof-based math course. It wouldn't kill Cosmin to spend some more time on the context of the setup. Or even cut down the material by like 1/15 (I hear there's more material this year than in the past anyway) and spend one class prior to each midterm reviewing the basics of the key proofs. That would be sweet. 
Also maybe I'm missing something but it would've been nice if sample solutions to the exams were uploaded. Also solutions to the homework tended to take a while. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths:
- Interesting material, especially graph theory since it is a lot less abstract than most math classes

Weaknesses:
- Lack of engagement on the students' part. I believe that students should be forced to turn their camera on.
- No use of the textbook
- Very hard problem sets and exams compared to other years <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The notes were very clear and the office hours were very helpful. The exams were however very challenging, but I appreciated that they were all take-home. Class often went overtime, and I felt that there was just too much material covered, not all of it useful. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was taught well, the office hours were helpful. The final was unexpectedly very hard but for a take-home exam I guess it is warranted. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â No weaknesses! Cosmin was great (and he's also a very nice guy), despite this being his very first semester teaching at Yale. The course material was compelling. The homework assignments were very difficult, but intellectually stimulating. I'd say the same about the exams. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course material seems like it could be interesting, and it definitely has many applications in statistics/economics/computer science/etc. However, the largest weakness of the course was the lack of quality teaching. I believe this was Professor Pohoata's first semester teaching, and lectures were unclear and disorganized. He did not present the information in a manner suitable for students without experience in combinatorics. Most examples were presented without relevant explanation, and there was not enough energy spent helping to develop methods for proof based assignments. Theories and proofs were presented in a disjointed and confusing way without examples. The level of difficulty of assignments in no way matched what we learned in class. Homework assignments were impossible to do without going to office hours and midterms often covered content not explained or emphasized in class. Assignments did not include clear feedback on why points were taken off. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â While I think this course is good in general, more transparency with the grading scheme would've been appreciated as the failure to define the curve ahead of time caused a good chunk of students to drop the course, ruining the curve for everyone else. Additionally, the problems should be solvable given a standard engagement with the lectures and lecture notes, and not impossible special cases that take hours and hours of mindless brainstorming until you get a eureka moment that allows you to figure out the answer. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: interesting content and challenging topics to understand requiring good amounts of thought to be put in, good notes to view for each section outlining material for class, professor would go over previous lecture material that was difficult at the beginning of each class

Weaknesses: very, very difficult exams which increased in difficulty as the year went on, professor sometimes went quickly and often went a bit overtime in lectures, so occasionally had to catch up to fully understand material that was briefly skimmed over <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was too difficult for the intro level class it was with homework assignments that were nearly impossible to finish on time. The exams were harder than the homework by so much that the class felt nearly impossible. Please, make the class easier and cover the introductory level material before advancing. Also, stop assigning so much homework. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Cosmin was very excited about the material, and there were lots of opportunities to receive help in the course. In particular, the peer tutors were phenomenal, but that varies from year to year. There was a lot of time allotted for the exams, which was very much needed. 
Weaknesses: The difference between the material we covered in class and the homework/exam problems was drastic, with the homework problems being much more difficult. The first month, we had a homework each week, which sounds like a normal amount to have, but the difficulty level of the problems was extremely high. Think contest math level problems, most of which required some obscure/strange trick to figure out that was only possible to solve with help. Having a good TA and peer tutors is pretty instrumental in succeeding in this class, but even with those resources, it would take me around 10 hours to complete the homework. It was also difficult to read Cosmin's handwriting at times, but he worked to try and alleviate that. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: This course covered genuinely interesting material and had very useful lecture notes posted on Canvas. 
Weaknesses: The lectures were not engaging and often felt like they were composed entirely of proofs of certain theorems. While these proofs were interesting, they did not really teach students how to approach and prove similar problems on their own. They also often failed to give a larger context to the significance and applicability of these proofs. This is a lecture format that I have been found to be largely characteristic of the Yale Math department, so I may just have different preferences in terms of my learning style.  Another weakness of the course was the take-home format of the two midterms and final. Though the professor would approach these as "taking a few hours" to sit down and do some math, each of the midterms took me over 12 hours to complete, and the three day final engulfed 25 hours of my exam week studying period. I do not believe this workload was unusual among similarly prepared peers. While these large time commitments were entirely of my choice - I could have simply stopped after writing down a basic idea for each problem - the problems in this course are formatted more like riddles and less like calculus problems. Therefore, it is often the case that the only way to improve your performance on an exam is to spend more time "guessing" solutions rather than practicing calculations. As a result, these three exams were extremely unpleasant. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Excellent professor, very committed to teaching and very responsible. Incredibly clear and coherent lectures, well-paced and great explanations. Lecture notes also provided, though the lesson material is well-explained to follow along. Office hours were very helpful. Problem sets and exams were thoughtfully-designed, though my only gripe is that they were too challenging and therefore time-consuming, which is not expected for Math 244. Giving a 2-hour midterm vs. a 5-day midterm is very different, but I don't think it justifies making your questions so challenging and time-consuming. You may expect students to work on your 5-day midterm for just 5 hours, but in reality students will work on it for much longer, and it becomes a race to see who can dedicate more time to figuring out the questions. Those who can dedicate all 5 days clearly will do better. Making questions tougher just to justify a take-home exam isn't very reasonable in my opinion. Other than that, excellent course! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would say a paramount strength is Professor Pohoata's knowledge and passion for Extremal Graph theory, Ramsay theory, and all of the topics he teaches. I also thought his notes were quite excellent, with the small exception that some of the proofs in later notes packets e.g. 3/4 are omitted. I highly suggest he continue teaching the course, but with some adjustments to aid student learning. 

A weakness would be the discrepancy in difficulty between his psets and exams. I suggest he give more pset problems and exam problems that are MUCH MORE SIMILAR to what he teaches in class, rather than much more difficult than what he does in class. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I didn't find there to be any particular strengths or weaknesses -- this is just a very standard math course, with the setup of teaching concepts and going over proofs during lecture and making use of those concepts in problem sets. I don't have any issues with this setup, but these features also aren't "strengths" of the course per se, since these same features can be found in other math courses. There was also more than enough help available in the form of office hours, which I greatly appreciated. <br/></div>

Weaknesses: Lecture notes could also be more comprehensive--they were too difficult to read and understand, even after attending lecture. 

Furthermore, the content could be presented in a more straightforward way and lectures could be better prepared. They seemed impromptu and concepts were often explained in a confusing manner. For example, the Schur theorem could have presented in a MUCH clearer way. By simply searching for it on Youtube, one can find a student from the University of Georgia who explained the process, logic, and meaning of the much better. Something which took 45 confusing minutes in class could be concisely explained in under 15 minutes. <br/></div>

For students coming in without a background in proof writing (e.g. those who took MATH 120 rather than MATH 230/231), the proof-based nature of the class might be a bit much at first.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The main strengths of this course were the strong overall vision, the cool proofs/topics, and the generally reasonable and interesting homeworks. Each of the six units went into a decent amount of depth, and they fed into each other quite well. The proofs we did in class did help solve the homework problems, and the homeworks themselves reinforced those same topics with further understanding. In general, as someone with strong previous proof experience, these proofs were still difficult and very interesting, and I was often quite pleased with the final results. Only having six homeworks was definitely smart, as I had more time to really investigate and think about them. However, we sometimes only learned the topics on the homework in the class before it was due, which made it hard to work ahead. Correspondingly, the main weaknesses of this course were the sometimes confusing lectures, the occasionally too difficult homework/exam problems, and the slightly disorganized overall structure. Sometimes the proofs in lecture were done too fast or skipped important parts, which made them hard to follow, even as an experienced prover. Likewise, some of the homework problems and definitely a few exam problems were just far too difficult, requiring techniques and thought processes far beyond those covered in class. Furthermore, a lot of times, despite having lots of office hours/sections, it felt like the answers to questions was thats the idea, now figure it out yourself rather than real assistance towards a solution. As someone with friends in the class and a decent background, this was just slightly frustrating and led me to work alone or in friend groups instead, but people without these luxuries got discouraged and many dropped the class. Finally, I think the overall organization of the class could be improved, including the aforementioned homework cadence and lecture structure; the lectures often went over class time for little reason, leading to rushed proofs and additional confusion. Going over the proofs again the next class helped a lot, but that only underscored the benefits some better organization would bring. <br/></div>
