<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought it was a great course overall, there was just a ton of work in the beginning. The professors did not originally realize how much work was being assigned with the virtual format. The problem was fixed in the second half of the course. I thought the material was all taught very well. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: very well organized and clear
Weaknesses: workload at the beginning was overwhelming, although this was adjusted later in the course <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Sometimes prerecorded lectures were a lot to watch and felt very long. Study groups worked somewhat well. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course felt rushed at times because a lot of material was being covered in a short timespan. Workload was excessive at certain points. Some weeks it was as if there were 4 class sessions a week because the pre-recorded lectures took up a lot of time and, even though the live class sessions were meant to be "interactive" and "answer questions", more often than not, they introduced new material. Finally, the bonus question - in addition to a long, demanding weekly problem set - felt unnecessary. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was a very long and intensive course with Three weekly meetings and 2 pre-recorded lectures. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the asynchronous videos were very informative and I enjoyed working with my study group on the p-sets. The workload was definitely way to heavy in the first half of the course, but I appreciated how receptive the professors were to our mid-semester feedback and adjusted everything (i.e. less videos per week, shifting around p-set due dates, etc.) to accommodate the circumstances in the second half of the semester. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course material was challenging but not too difficult. There was a lot of work at times, but the professors listened to our feedback and corrected it accordingly. The study halls were pretty helpful in allowing students to collaboratively work on PSETs. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The first half of the semester was a lot of work but the instructors took student feedback into account and lessened the burden. The class is well taught but the material can get difficult. The derivations are often unclear in lecture yet the problem sets and exams require a solid understanding of them. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: very structured (both content and assignment), grading is pretty straight forward (can be good or bad I guess), 

Weakness: lots of work (so it's hard to enjoy unless you are actually invested in the content) <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The professors adapted well to the midterm feedback survey which was very helpful. The class was adapted well for virtual learning with both in person and virtual lectures. Response time on piazza was quick.

Weaknesses: A lot of new material was covered in the in-person lectures when they were advertised as more of review sessions. More time could be spent on synthesis of the material rather than adding on material in the in person lectures. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was really confusing having one professor teach modules 1 and 3 and the other professor teaching module 2. I think it would have been much better if there was either one professor or if one professor taught the first half of the course and the other teaching the other half. Two professor switches is too many. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Course was well versed, wished that there was not as much a workload as there was. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The organization of ECON 122 with weekly pre-recorded lectures, Monday synchronous lectures and Wednesday study group sessions was an effective adjustment to the difficulties of online learning. The professor's communication and responsiveness to student concerns was excellent. After student concerns were raised about the length/scope of the weekly pre-recorded lectures (2 lectures of 1-1.5 hours every week), the professors scaled this back and covered more material in our Monday synchronous lectures. Using Piazza, student questions about course material were answered daily. 

The course could be improved by including more interactive polls, as when these were used they were very helpful to maintaining engagement. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Highly structured course. Multiple ways for students to learn the material - live lectures, watching recordings, simply reading slides, etc. Large support staff of TFs and peer tutors.

Weaknesses: Problem set design felt quite weak - questions were frequently ambiguous, leaving students with no option but to simply copy down whatever the TF said was on the answer sheet. One or two instances of the answer sheet simply being wrong. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â At the beginning of the class the workload was too burdensome, but adjustments were made. The overall structure with pre-recorded lectures in addition to live lectures was an interesting combination. I did not gain much from my group work session that replaced a live lecture. I would have preferred two live lectures instead of a pre-recorded and one live with a group study day <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: I really liked the fact that we could work on the pset with group members on certain days of the week
Weakness: pre-recorded lectures to watch over the weekend was not the way to go and I wish we had psets due every other week rather than every week. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The workload of the first half of the course was too high and unmanageable but after the mid-semester feedback the instructors adjusted the class and it was much more manageable.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: reasonable psets, productive sections + OH, and very fun bonus questions each week on extensions of topics we discussed in class. In class lectures often included in-class participation like polls, which I found engaging. I also found the course structure itself to be beneficial this semester; Monday lectures were very helpful reviews and practice of material in the previous week's pre-recorded lectures, and I got along very well with the study group I was paired with, so having time built in on Wednesdays to meet with them and also ask TFs and the instructors questions was awesome. Since the psets were relatively short, I felt that this modified course structure did not significantly impact the courseload negatively. Additionally, the Professors and TFs were very responsive and open to feedback.

Weaknesses: not many practice materials since this was the Professors' first time teaching this class, which made studying for the midterm and final a bit stressful. Some students claimed that having 2 full pre-recorded lectures made the workload too high, so the Professors reduced the length of psets and switched from 2 to just 1 prerecorded lecture each week (which involved cutting some material). Some probably see this as an upside, but I was really enjoying the class, and also enjoyed having longer psets as good practice for assessments - tbh I felt that the original workload was comparable to that of similar level econ classes. Of course, I do still appreciate how receptive both Professors were. And, fortunately both exams were very reasonable. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: very organized, built in a way where I was able to take the information previously learned and use it to understand the new concepts
Weakness: switching between two professors was a bit rough, not many weaknesses about the course itself, the course load was way too heavy initially (it  helped solidify my understanding of the concepts but it was a bit too much material. However, this was corrected after the midterm feedback which I really appreciated), wish there were more practice problems to help prepare for the exams <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The psets were very hard at the beginning of the course. This was improved later on but definitely would have been better if they were not as hard from the start. There were also no practice tests! This made it extremely hard to prepare for the exam, as anything could take you by surprise. The grading in the tests was also very punitive (no partial credit) but that's expected when they need to meet the Econ department curve. The exams were also very long and hard. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course changed dramatically for the better after the instructors received the midterm feedback. Initially, the ~two hours of asyncrhoneos video instruction, bonus question, and PSET, were simply too much work to have outside of class. The bonus questions grew on me, they were a great way to further understanding of the material in a real world context. Frankly, I would consider them a strength. The psets were pretty much your basic econ class psets, nothing special some challenging problems, but there were plenty of office hours and the like. The Monday lectures were quite effective at distilling the material, and this class was the first one to use Zoom polls effectively, so credit to the instructor. The biggest weakness of the course were the Wednesday study groups. In short, each Wednesday students were put into groups to go over the PSET and bonus question w the same students all semester, and the instructors received positive feedback. Few notes here, first the attendance, even in the beginning, hovered around half and dropped. This was because different students had done different amounts of the PSET etc which made group work less effective. Next, the positive feedback is correlated with a small vocal minority of the students who enjoyed the study groups, and had selection bias. If the majority of the class doesn't go, there response speaks louder than the mid semester feedback which was filled out by a minority of students who did enjoy it. It just wound up being a dead 1:15 that could have been used for further instruction or clarification of the material. The actual teaching in the course was phenomenal, I just wish there had been more of it live. <br/></div>

The first half the course there was an absurd amount fo work, but when students expressed this in mid-semester feedback, they reduced it greatly which I really appreciated.  They talked about COVID and modern-day issues which made it more interesting.

Weaknesses: the first half of the class, there was so much work.  Also, they didn't give out any practice midterm/final questions or from previous years which made studying difficult. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The pre-recorded lecture we had to watch before in-person lecture was an organized structure for learning. However, often times, the pre-recorded lectures would take hours and hours to get through because of the density of the material. I think this can be improved if new information and its application were explained thoroughly in the pre-recorded videos, specifically, WHY we want to model it or why we even care. That was the most difficult aspect about learning the new models for me because I often times did not know what aspects about a model were important or why we even cared to learn about it in application to real world data and trends. I also though in the first part of the semester, the Psets and bonus questions were a ridiculous amount of work. I appreciate that the Professors were receptive to this feedback and adjusted their syllabus. <br/></div>

If things were unclear, you only had to look back at the lectures notes or ask a question over piazza.

The weaknesses of this course was the set up of the class itself. I felt like I was learning an absurd amount of material, but we were always moving so quickly that some of it got lost in the middle. The jumping around from professors and their different teaching styles, as long with the pre-recorded lectures that were just re-explained in the live lectures almost carbon copy. I took another class that just did live lectures and moved at a slower pace, and that felt much more comfortable. This subject matter is just extremely difficult to teach through zoom, and I felt I greatly struggled from not being able to go to office hours in person to find people to aid me with my work. <br/></div>
