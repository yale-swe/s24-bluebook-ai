<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I'm not sure how this course could be improved. I think that maybe the psets should have been a little easier, or that there should have been a few practice problems to do as a part of the pre-class homework because I definitely felt like my understanding of the concepts were not good enough for the psets and I always needed a lot of help doing them. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: material is interesting; peer tutoring is available. Weaknesses: due to everyone already having taken multi in high school, it really messed up the curve. It's not fair to grade those with experience to those who don't. The true false questions don't reflect the studying you put in and for some reason we also kept being asked to write counter examples on test questions. Psets were unnecessarily long, but somewhat reflective of the tests. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I personally thought this course was extremely well taught, contrary to what I heard before taking it. For context, I did take Calc 3 before this year, although I didn't do well in the course. There are ample resources, and my professor was John Hall, who explained things extremely well. I liked the Jamboards and breakout rooms along with the worked out examples. The Psets were difficult, but I utilized peer tutors, who were able to help you however much you needed to solve the problems. The tests were much easier than the practice tests, so I always felt adequately prepared for them. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: so much support of which I wished I took advantage, Professor Hall is amazing, and the tests and psets are fair for most of the people I have talked to.
Weaknesses: the final project is a little bit of a pain though I would prefer it to a final exam, frequent mistakes on psets corrected one or two days after they are posted. The main thing: it is very time-consuming to learn a concept three times since we are supposed to read the textbook and watch the videos before coming to class every day. The expectation is very inefficient as there could be a better way to structure it. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: tons and tons of resources available to students including peer tutor office hours (bless the peer tutors!), Ximera, professor office hours, review session before exams, and so many more. Weaknesses: I've heard that instructors are a pretty mixed bag in terms of quality, but it's not super difficult to grasp the material yourself if you take advantage of their resources. I also disliked having prerecorded lectures and reading quizzes; I'm the type of math student who learns better when I am taught by someone and I'm able to ask questions in real time and reading about a concept from a textbook/video was difficult and felt too much like Khan Academy. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths were a well organized class. There were a lot of resources for practicing problems. Weaknesses were I found the pacing to be extremely fast, and the psets were a big step up what I was used to. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â STRENGTHS: Small class sizes make it easy to interject questions during lecture. My professor, John Hall, was in charge of all sections, and his teaching and explanations were exceedingly clear. Problem sets and practice exams were very comparable to the midterms, so we knew what to expect and could prepare accordingly. The plethora of posted resources (Ximera, recorded videos, lecture notes, etc.) made my transition from MATH 230 halfway through the semester very smooth and aided greatly in studying for exams / understanding concepts.
WEAKNESSES: From what I've heard from my friends in other sections, the quality of the professors was rather hit-or-miss (however, as I stated earlier, I got lucky with Professor Hall). In my experience, this course's primary weakness was that most of the learning took place outside of class. The readings and pre-recorded videos (due before each class session) laid out the concepts, while class time was typically spent on calculations. I don't think it's absolutely necessary to complete each and every calculation; we know how to integrate. I think spending more time on the parts of example problems which directly involve applying unfamiliar concepts during class would erase the need for those pre-lecture videos, saving everyone's time and benefiting the students. Also, assigning a 30-minute presentation as a final project worth 10% of our grade hardly seems fair for how much work this requires. I personally would have preferred that our third midterm just be pushed back a couple weeks and function as a non-cumulative (or cumulative, I suppose) final. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: Not much. I thought the discussion sections were somewhat helpful but they were usually just repeats of the pre-class videos we had to watch. Beyond that, I didn't find any other strengths in the class. Weakness: Almost all the learning ends up being self-learning. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I enjoyed the problem sets because they were good practice for solidifying the knowledge we gained from class and homework. 

I think my grasp of the material would have been improved if we had been introduced to the concepts during class when we could ask questions in real-time and then practiced problem types for homework. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: recorded lectures were good, concepts explained well in live section, psets weren't overbearing

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Good support system, sufficient resources to learn the material well and prepare for exams

Weaknesses: Sometimes, we went through some units very fast. I think for students with some prior multivariable calculus knowledge, this was fine. But for students with little to none prior multivariable calculus knowledge, this pace was problematic. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I felt that, when online, the students did not have to fully engage with the material and I barely knew anyone in the class. Professor Hall was a fantastic teacher, but I could see how this course would be far better if it were online. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Hall is an amazing teacher who knows the subject well and can explain it to anyone in a very brilliant manner....whenever there is a confusion, he makes sure that every particular difficulty is carefully dealt with...he can really empathize; another strength is the practice exams which really mirror the actual exam format....I highly recommend making use of those; the course material is also very interesting and applicable in various fields

Weakness: Notwithstanding the rigor of the material, the pace of the class is pretty fast so if u miss some part of the class or don't understand key concepts introduced early on, you could suffer.....advice: I highly recommend that u first study Multivariable Calculus from Khan Academy (the playlist has 175 videos) before taking MATH 120........for me, at least, this made the class really manageable and fun, even if I never took MVC in high school and had very little familiarity with Calc 2 topics <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The pre-lecture videos were generally very clear and informative. The lectures themselves, technical issues aside, were also good. I found the psets generally too difficult and with all the work I had to do for my other classes I struggled to get them done as well as I would have liked every week. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A good amount of the learning felt routine, which is both a strength and a weakness. Much of the material was not difficult, which is surprising as 120 is the first math I took at Yale after BC Calculus in high school. However, the material was not as engaging and fulfilling. I feel like there was too much focus on doing complicated problems instead of learning important concepts as to how they work. Prof. Hall emphasizes learning to understand and not memorize, and I think shedding more light on the backbones of multivariable calculus in problem sets are important so we can execute them in the complex problems. However, the final project, presenting a practical application of one mathematical topic, was very rewarding to work on. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of this course was that it was taught by Professor Hall. He made the pre-lecture videos so it was helpful taking classes from him. One weakness might be that this course had a flipped learning format. While this format made room for more activities like exercises on Jamboard, I felt that some concepts were just rushed through. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course lacks a few key things. This course needs to work to engage its students with the math they are learning. It is hard to feel excited to come to class when your instructor goes so quickly and skips enough steps that you cannot accurately follow his writing on the page. It is discouraging and muddies the clarity needed for a course like this to be taught effectively. In general there seemed to be an apathy toward students' needs. I recognized that I needed help in this course early on, and reached out to my instructor multiple times over the course of the semester, as he had told us to do. I was not contacted by the extra instruction teacher (who had been running sessions throughout the semester) until two exams had passed. I had asked for help with exam study at the beginning of the semester, and followed up on it. When I did I was told my instructor (I had no way to follow up directly) would "check on it." This was unbelievably frustrating for a student putting their all into this course, and getting very little in return. Similarly, as content became more difficult, the course did not take the time to make sure that the content was getting across. This could have been helped if the instructors had taken more time on these concepts, maybe giving more feedback on them. If slowing down is untenable, then the instructors of this course should seriously think about creating a version of this course that stretches over two semesters. This course needs to work on being more student friendly, as strange as that sounds. It should not be a gatekeeper, but should excite students about what they are learning. <br/></div>
