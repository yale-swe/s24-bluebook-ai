<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Love Professor Carlson and the rest of the teaching team - all very engaging and knowledgeable. They make the biology easy to understand. Improvements could be made with feedback on pset questions. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Honestly, this course operated pretty much as I expected and as I wanted it to. I did think that the global warming segment was occasionally repetitive, but this wasn't a major issue. Overall, it's a good science course for students who want to learn about pressing social and biological issues but aren't STEM majors. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: super approachable and easy to understand for a non-science person, extremely interesting topics, amazing professors and TAs. Great science class overall and I am so glad I took it! The 2 term papers--got to explore topics that I was interested in, and really enjoyed writing them!

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: engaging lectures
Weaknesses: sometimes it felt discussions didnt perfectly correspond to lectures, maybe more of a roadmap for the course would also be helpful <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked the weekly problem sets in lieu of a final exam, but I feel very strongly like they were graded too hard. I put in multiple hours working on them and I took detailed notes on the lectures, but I still was unable to get good grades on them. I felt that the essays, too, were graded harder than they should have been for an introductory/basic course on biology. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Having two shorter papers instead of one long final paper was really helpful. Regular problem sets were also much more useful for learning than quizzes. Section was also really interactive; I appreciated the use of breakout rooms. 

Weaknesses: Having three instructors meant that the course wasn't exactly consistent all the way through. The last instructor's unit, while fascinating, was significantly more difficult in terms of scientific material than the first two. The grading of the problem sets also tended to assume more scientific knowledge than was actually taught in the lectures at times. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â At times, the lectures were engaging. Other times, though, I was thankful for the 1.5x playback speed. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the subject matter felt very relevant, the discussions were very engaging, and I learned a lot of useful material about our world.
Weaknesses: the science was overwhelming at times <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths were the wide variety of topics covered and the ability to discuss very relevant topics to ourselves and to the world we live in. Grounding the topics and concepts being discussed in an environment that we can relate to helped with active engagement and pursing further knowledge and research outside of the zoom lecture/section setting. The course could be improved by making its expectations of the different sub-units more clear -- some of the sub-units (like the neurotransmission one) were FAR more difficult than the others and the intricacy of the details that we were expected to know for the problem sets at times seemed unknown and unfair. Further, making the expectations for the problem sets more clear and facilitating a space to get more robust feedback on the problem sets would foster an environment where we are able to learn from our mistakes and develop more substantial and refined writing. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Psets were graded very harshly but besides that it is a good class. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Great course overall!

Course was taught by three different Professors where each section got progressively worse

I almost stopped wanting to believe in climate change with how much they were trying to shove it down my throat <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Overall, this course was quite strong. I think that the first two sections (diseases and climate change) were really well aimed to the non-STEM student, but that the third section (pain and drugs) could be adjusted a bit to focus more on the social aspects of drug use, while still providing concrete scientific information. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Some lectures were really interesting, others less so. Would have preferred more standardization between each part of the class. Same with section topics, some were interesting, others much less so. Would have preferred section discussions more related to the lectures. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the main strengths of this course are professor Carlson, who is incredibly engaging and clearly passionate about the subjects he teaches about. The TAs are also great, and went the extra mile to give us a comprehensive view of different biological concepts. I think the problem sets could be improved by setting word limits on the questions (some questions were really open-ended, and you could write entire essays in answers), and the climate change portion of the class could be cut short. Those classes felt very repetitive. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: a great introduction to biology-related science for those who don't have background. Love the discussion sections.
Weaknesses: Psets are really difficult to get full scores as you never know how detailed an answer they need. Course is taught by three instructors and there are no good transition/ connections between the three instructors. I would love to know why these three topics are picked to be taught in this class so more context is appreciated. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths of this course are its content, which is very relevant to today. Furthermore, the professors in this course are all really engaging and interesting, so I really enjoyed attending class. Weaknesses are the lack of clarity on PSETs (sometimes I got a point docked off because I hadn't realized that the question was asking for a specific answer). I ended up writing a lot per each question to ensure I would get everything right, which would be pretty time consuming. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professors were definitely the biggest strength of the class. They were all incredibly sweet and knowledgeable about the different topics covered. This class is perfect for a non-sc major without a strong science background who needs a science credit because the actual science covered is not intense at all and easy to follow. Most of the course is understanding the impacts of different scientific concepts and connecting them to the broader social world which was really interesting. If you are someone with a pretty strong science background this class may not be enough science for you but it is still a great course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of the course are that lectures are recorded so it accommodates people of different abilities and earning types/styles. Having p-sets once a week helps us stay on track with our learning. Furthermore, although the papers might seem daunting they were definitely preferable to exams and quizzes, etc. I would say the course could be improved by having clearer expectations on what they expect out of us on the p-sets. Overall, this was a well organized course and the best science credit I have taken at Yale. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Definitely the course content. Everything taught is relevant and approachable. I can see myself discussing a lot of topics we covered with friends. The Professors are also great (shoutout to Professor Carlson!). There were also no exams so I didn't feel pressurized to memorise anything and could learn for the sake of it. Problem sets were entirely from the lecture slides. The research papers were also a great way to expand knowledge beyond the course content on a topic of our choice. Sections were also interesting and Was put in an effort to make them as engaging as possible virtually. 
Weaknesses: Grading on the problem sets was a little rough and details mattered more than they should. I often found myself stressing about getting the details right so as not to lose a point/half a point in random places. I also wish the grading rubric for the papers had been made available before the first paper's deadline to have some more transparency about what the graders are looking for. <br/></div>

Also, I thought this courses's dive into explaining climate change was very informative. I already believed in climate change, but this the depth and details covered in this course will help me better explain it to family and friends who are still skeptical. 

As for weaknesses, though the latter quarter of the course that covered neuroscience was a little dry and contained little connection back to modern social issues. Although I enjoyed learning about the intricacies of action potentials, it just felt like a high school biology refresher at times. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The first and last section where really great; however, the middle section lacked much biology so it would be cool to have more biology and perhaps ecology included into that section, rather than just geophysics/climate science (to further wrap things in context like stated above)
The homework assignments were graded kinda arbitrarily, with some comments making sense and others being fairly arbitrary or about a difference of opinion rather than understanding of content. (As an example, I lost points because I thought that the best way to tackle climate disinformation was different than that of the graders) <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths were the times the course listen to the students whether through lectures where they answered our questions or during discussion sections.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the course was very well organized and the instructors were very good. The only thing I would leave a comment on would be that the problem sets relied on simply finding what was exactly said in the lectures and writing it out in the answers of the questions whereas I think it would be more educational to maybe have more reflective questions on the topics seen in class. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength of the course is how many facets of macadamia it covers! I learned about the economy, politicians, biology, environmentalism, addiction, neurology, and probably more that I'd remember if I had my notebook with me. A weakness of the course includes the odd ratios of the three topics. It seemed like the biology heavy section got an incredible amount of screentime, while the latter two were rushed and incredibly dense. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: good course for non-science majors, in-depth lectures and discussion sections on interesting topics, content material was accessible, problem sets were straightforward.

Weaknesses: wish they talked more about social issues regarding scientific research and in medical sciences, including implicit bias, the biologization of race in epidemiological studies, and scientific skepticism (e.g. anti-vaccine movements, mistrust of scientific research, etc.) <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The main strength is that each lecture tackles a new and interesting topic. The course aims to give (usually non-STEM) students a foundation in the sciences that will be important for everyone going forward, regardless of their field. For example, I really enjoyed the part of the course that taught us about the science behind climate change. I also appreciate the focus on breadth rather than depth, as we were able to cover a lot of ground without getting bogged down in one topic or detail. The only part of the course I did not really care for was weekly section. It was discussion based, but most students are non-STEM, so they tended not to be too invested in it. It wasn't the TA's fault he seemed like a really nice guy but I think it was just tough for students to get really engaged. Being virtual probably did not help that aspect. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Being able to learn about a range of interesting topics was great because it meant that we learned lots of practical and interesting information, and if something wasn't as exciting we would be moving on from it in about a week. However, the problemsets were graded incredibly harshly in my opinion, with very little feedback and it was always hard to know what they were looking for in the questions. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Range of topics covered, excellent TAs and really effective/interesting sections, TA mini-lectures, music to start each class, clear expectations.

Weaknesses: (1) The climate change portion took way too long. All of the concepts could have been summed up in one, maybe two lectures. I get that the topic is important, but it really felt like Professor Marlon was beating a dead horse by lecture 3/4. I'd have preferred to spend more time learning about the sections of biology that Professor Carlson and Professor Paulsen taught. (2) Some of the feedback on the psets wasn't released. I can see the score, but not what I got wrong (at least the last time that I checked). (3) Some of the pset questions felt too open-ended, especially in the first and second sections. I was writing legit essays to make sure that I got all of the points and practically quoting from the lectures. I was frustrated writing everything out and I'm pretty sure that Clara didn't appreciate reading all of it. Maybe some more narrowly worded questions would cut down on all of the writing and encourage us to just concentrate on the most essential bits of the lecture. <br/></div>
