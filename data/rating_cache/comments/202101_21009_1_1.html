<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Prof. Goldberg was a fine lecturer; PSets did a good job of covering the material of the week.
Weaknesses: sections seemed off-topic and a little bit of a waste of time; lectures didn't cover mathematical examples (that's all that exams and PSets were) but that's what section was for; some surprise questions on PSets and exams that felt a little unfair; grading was generally fair; peer tutors were somewhat hard to get in contact with and office hours weren't super accessible (at least for me) <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think it could have been nice to show problem application in the lectures as well. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Student-understanding based. Unintimidating. Much P-Set help. 
Weaknesses: Long lectures which did not engage students. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This is a great class to learn about microeconomics. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was very accessible, and the instructors did a good job of keeping the material approachable. I found some of the review in the beginnings of lectures a bit redundant; we could have moved to new material each lecture and kept the length to an hour rather than an hour and fifteen minutes. I didn't find the content especially intellectually engaging, but then again, it's an introductory lecture. If the goal is to build a foundation for future, more interesting courses, it succeeded. I appreciated the organization of the course and the routine nature of the problem sets. I always felt prepared for exams and thought the course functioned well online. It was one of the best organized courses of my semester. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the strengths of this course were the number of graphs drawn to portray material, weekly sections, the review sessions hosted before each exam, and reviewing the material at the beginning of every class. A weakness would be the lack of attendance during classes. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A serious revision of this course needs to be done. There is nothing redeeming or enjoyable about this course in its current virtual state. If it weren't for my amazing TA, I simply do not know what would be okay about this course. The lectures are EXTREMELY dry and hard to follow. The most frustrating part of this class is how the review sessions and the review content you are given for the tests are never reflective of the material covered in the exams. It seems like you can never study or prep enough for what they give you. I suggest that the econ department thinks strongly about who they want to be the professors of this course &amp; how they want to frame this course to be better for engaging students in the material &amp; not continuing to alienate students who may not be so interested in econ. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professors were really helpful and good at explaining concepts. There is no weaknesses to the course. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: section/office hours w section leader were the most helpful for me in learning material
Weaknesses: wish there had been more opportunities for going more in depth on more complex topics/lecture being more engaging <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: Canvas and assignments were well-organized; Daniela Morar was a great course director and section leader; the textbook for this class was interesting and helpful for understanding course material; the workload was manageable: weekly p sets and 2 midterms and 1 final; if you haven't taken econ in high school you might need to read the textbook more diligently which take some more time
weaknesses: little individual attention and feedback and fast paced lecture <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was hard. Go faster in beginning and slow down later. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I don't think this is Yale's strongest classthe professor clearly cared about teaching but was not the best teacher, and there is a limited willingness to hear from students. That said, this is not a super difficult course and there are a number of supports to make sure it goes well. A major strength: Joseph Ribaudo, one of the peer mentors for the course, went above and beyond to help students understand material. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really enjoyed how Professor Goldberg recapped the previous day's lecture at the beginning of each lecture. I would have liked for there to be more questions to the class that we could be called on to answer, but I understand that that was difficult this year due to the nature of virtual learning. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The extra resources in the form of teachers assistants and peer tutors are very helpful with fully understanding course material <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class conveyed a breadth of basic information on microeconomics, and was very approachable and accessible to people like me without any background in economics at all. The workload is very manageable and standard. However, the material is dry and the second half of the course felt more rushed. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The last third of the course was taught so quickly that most students did not retain the information that was being taught. Over Zoom, and even in person, this class could benefit from a 5-minute break in the middle of the lecture because every class was packed with info. I liked that Prof Goldberg reviewed material at the start of the class. I wish that the class could have been more engaging and more interactive. Outside of the lecture, my section was not very helpful. The class could have benefitted from doing a practice problem or two during lecture. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â this was a difficult class over zoom with some glitches with so many people and so many skilled economists from around the world and sometimes it was hard to understand what was said <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The only strength of this course was our peer tutor Joe. Without his office hours I don't think I would have completed this course which was honestly very disappointing. In lectures the professor only quickly scratched the surface of the content that we were expected to know in p-sets and exams. The lectures were very disorganized and tended to rush through major topics which made it hard to follow along with the textbook when the professor's content was insufficient. The discussion sections were a disaster. My section leader (Tolga Koker) was very hostile, unprofessional, and extremely unhelpful. As a result I stopped going to my section and instead better used the time by reviewing the content on my own. The final was extremely difficult. I have spoken with many students and we all agree that none of the lectures, sections, or review sessions prepared us for it. I also have no idea what my grade is and neither does the professor. We are given a percentage grade in canvas but she said to ignore it because she does not know what the curve will be. I truly regret taking this class this semester because I have heard such great things about the fall semester professors. This leaves me to conclude that the problem is not with the class but with the instructors. <br/></div>

However, all of that content that I mastered outside of examinations was on the tests, yet there was often content I had never been exposed to through the variety of ways I engaged with this course. It is very confusing because I don't understand why you would test on material that had never been explored.

Im certain that 70% of the class could not accurately describe what the marginal rate of substitution means in real world terms. The strength of this course is the 15 minutes at the beginning of each class that Professor Goldberg takes to review the previous classs material. That was extremely helpful. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I found the general atmosphere of the course to be stressful and my section leader, while helpful, was extremely negative, telling us to prepare to fail our exams because they would have to make the exams much harder this semester due to their online format. This was not encouraging. I found the lectures to be hard to follow because they were long and there were days when I wasnt sure the professors heart was really in it. The professors presentation was always somewhat monotonous. I found the final exam to not be very representative of the review sessions (all of which I attended) and felt frustrated by the exam after I had worked so hard all semester and done well (had an A). I also found it difficult to take this class virtually because they were not accommodating of West Coast students (we had to push for the final exam time to be moved to a better time for us). <br/></div>
