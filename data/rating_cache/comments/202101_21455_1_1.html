<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professors do not care about helping the students succeed and limit interactions with the students like the stereotypical STEM professor. I was extremely disappointed in this approach to learning given COVID-19 and the difficulty many students are facing and was hoping for a more humane approach. I think that material as interesting as this would be a pleasure to learn if taught by professors that were interested in the students in their course. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I wish the instructors would have spent more time on the more complex concepts and less time on the simple ones. The problem sets were also out of six questions which were each worth one point, so a mistake on one question would bring the overall grade of the problem set down considerably. 
That being said, this course is somewhat outside my major, so the material may have been more difficult for me than it would be for the average student interested in taking the course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The recorded lectures were really boring and long and the live discussion lectures were not very helpful or engaging. The TAs and the professor weren't really helpful in explaining our mistakes. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Hatzios is an extremely clear lecturer and also super clear when answering questions through email or during office hours. Live lectures were helpful in understanding some of the applications of what we learned from the recorded lectures and how we might be tested on the content. 

Weaknesses: The TAs were extremely incompetent. I honestly wish this was like many other STEM courses where there are peer tutors or undergraduate learning assistants since I feel like someone who had taken the class before would've known the content way better. I never felt like the TAs knew the material that well and many times they would either not know how to answer questions or provide answers that were incorrect. There was also very little coordination between them so when answering clarification questions on the problem sets, they would often give varying answers, which can be very confusing. The grading on exams and problem sets were also extremely nit picky. They would take off points for the littlest things. The questions were never specific enough to clarify exactly what they were looking for but if you didn't mention specific terms or phrases, you would immediately get points off. Professor Yan was alright as a lecturer but honestly very confusing and went a bit fast. I wish he went a bit slower and explained concepts more clearly. Also, the grading system is so unreasonable. They tell you that they can't determine letter grades until the end of the semester because they have to look at the total points, but that sounds so senseless to me. There is no transparency on how any student is doing, which makes it difficult for someone who might be considering dropping the course or credit/d/f the course. I also didn't like how they didn't disclose how letter grades would be determined. They say it's based on "class performance" but that's extremely vague and I feel like any course that grades on a curve just fosters a competitive rather than collaborative environment. Lastly, I wish they would've released the answer keys to problem sets and exams. The feedback was often unclear and I don't understand what the issue is with releasing the answer keys. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I appreciated the format of the class. Watching pre-recorded lectures and using the live lecture session to go over confusing concepts and apply our understanding was a good format. Also, Professor Hatzios was an excellent professor. She explains concepts very clearly and she was good at responding to emails and follow-up questions. Furthermore, I appreciated the fact that the teaching staff held office hours and review sessions multiple times a week. 

Weaknesses: I don't think the TAs were competent enough to teach this course. When I went to office hours, the TAs were very restricted in what they could and could not say, they provided vague and confusing answers, and sometimes they guided us in the wrong direction. For example, I would go to one TAs office hours and she would tell me something completely different than when I went to another TAs office hours the following day. Also, I believe the TAs took off unnecessary and unjustified points on the Psets and exams. Often times I had to email the TAs who graded my assignments and argue for points back, but the TAs were nonresponsive and unreasonable. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professors provide very clear lectures and are more than willing to answer student questions; open note tests are fair and reward studying; the problem sets are very short and the class has a relatively low workload; really organized with each assignment having both a release and due date on the syllabus
Weaknesses: I would have appreciated more grade transparency-- we were told that the class was on a curve but know little else about how our final grades will be calculated <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This is a good, well-rounded course overall. Some challenging concepts, but fair exams and problem sets. I liked that it balanced more detail-oriented topics (ie., bacterial cell biology) with more big-picture/broad concepts (ie., infectious diseases). 

One area of improvement would be more communication on the part of the TA's in announcing things like midterm review sessions. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course felt straightforward enough and the content was interesting. I appreciated the effort to boost engagement with the live discussions, but they didn't always feel very effective. We were often put into breakout rooms for five or ten minutes to answer a question that only merited thirty seconds. This is more of a comment on Zoom and teaching remotely. The live discussions were a great review of material and opportunity to expand understanding of the content, but but I think that they could have been more efficient. Other than that, I thought the questions on psets and exams were sometimes poorly written. There seemed to be certain assumptions that had to be made that weren't explicitly mentioned by the question, which left me wondering what the question was asking or what information I was able to draw on. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Fantastic class, I learned so much without being overwhelmed. Strengths include interesting lecture material and many ways to access professors/TFs. Can't think of any weaknesses. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I learned a lot from this class, and overall, I would recommend this course. Friends who took the class the years before told me the content material was enjoyable, but I couldn't believe it at the time  it turns out that was true! A large part of that had to do with the professors themselves: Yan and Hatzios were very thorough and clear in their explanations, and were always responsive to emails if you asked them a question. I found them incredibly helpful  I will say that I found Professor Yan's portion of the class to be significantly harder than Professor Hatzios' half, just because the first half focused more on the finer details of molecular mechanisms and bacterial cell processes.

My one complaint about the class, and this is a big one, is about the TAs. Oftentimes I'd go to office hours ahead of a pset to get some guidance on a question, and two different TAs would guide me along two different answers. If you asked any one of them a question during one of the review sessions, 75% of the time they wouldn't be able to answer it  and sometimes, when they did answer it, it was wrong... Additionally, their grading of psets and exams was terribly inconsistent. The answer they look needs to be worded a specific way in order for it to be graded fully correct  if you had a reworded version that still had the same idea, they would dock you. This has happened multiple times to me and some peers who also took this class  and this indicates that they didn't understand the material enough to see an answer rewritten and still perceive it as correct. Oh, another thing: we'd have psets due the week of an exam, for every exam we took. We never got those psets graded back in time before we took the test, and there was no answer key posted for those psets. That was a pretty annoying inconvenience.

Normally for any other class, I'd be shy to go to the professors, instead turning to the TAs for my questions. But these TAs were so incompetent that I found myself turning to Hatzios and Yan unexpectedly  and this was not a problem because the professors were so helpful and kind anyway.

Please, for next year, I urge you to change the TAs. Two out of the four of them worked in a microbio lab and still gave horrible, muddled explanations, with no clear understanding of the course material. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths- Both professor Yan and Hatzios were fantastic lecturers! Their lectures were not dry at all and were a pleasure to watch. The live discussion was also perfect for practicing the types of questions that they would ask, which was a huge help. I loved this course. 

Weakness- The TA's did not typically grade in a just manner. Some TA's were much more strict than others, and when they were asked to rational their grading they became very defensive. The head TA, Caitlyn Moss, was fantastic though. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: recorded lectures were clear, virtual discussion sections were a good opportunity to ask questions and solidify knowledge with practice questions, problem sets were fair, and lots of help, in the form of review sessions and office hours, was available. Exams for the most part were fair.
Weaknesses: more practice problems and more frequent problem sets could have been helpful to prepare for exams. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professors taught mostly clearly and teaching staff was very responsive and had many offerings of office hours and review sessions. Weaknesses: PSETs could have been more comprehensive; they were only 3 questions long, and there were no other practice problems given. It would have been nice to have more material to test our understanding of the material outside of the exams. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weaknesses include difficult office hours that would be inconvenient for students and hard to access TAs. TAs also did not have access to the problem set answers which led to students having incorrect answers due to TA office hours. The grading seemed arbitrary for exams, with similar answers getting points off and an apparent lack of standardization between graders. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: live lectures with experiment-based questions really provoked thought and challenged students to apply knowledge as if in lab environment; content of class is great preparation for research-style thinking; Professors Hatzios and Yan were also excellent in teaching the material, clearly knowledgeable, and very willing to assist students
Weaknesses: sometimes questions on exams were difficult or exceeded scope of class; terminology was sometimes confusing too <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professors are great, there are a lot of office hours available to go to. Grading is pretty nitpicky, as most biology classes are. I liked that there were psets included this semester to help with distributing grade weight away from exams, but sometimes it was hard to get help on confusing questions and I felt like that made it hard to learn. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: strong and responsive teaching team, manageable psets, midterms are fair, took into account COVID (multiple opportunities for grading, get to drop a pset and midterm which was new this semester)
Weaknesses: you have to adjust to the change in professor halfway through the semester, the content itself can be confusing/difficult especially for Prof. Yans lectures but the textbook is helpful to refer to as well, I felt grading was a bit strict at times and TAs weren't as helpful with answering pset related questions

Not a weakness but something to keep in mind: this class covers a lot of information so you need to stay on top of the lectures in prep for the final <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I absolutely LOVED this class. The material was interesting and combined other scientific knowledge from other classes (intro bio, biochem, genetics, molecular bio, etc.), which I always find to be rewarding. Even though the course was taught by two professors, there weren't huge discrepancies in the ways that they taught, and so the consistency was nice. There were a lot of office hours and review sessions available for us to utilize as well. I would have loved to see more material on viruses. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths:
- lots of opportunity for interaction with teaching staff

- good/respectful recorded lecture duration
- the interactive sessions were great, very helpful in prepping for exams and generally understanding course content
