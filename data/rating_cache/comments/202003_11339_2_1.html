<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths are the content and effort of Prof. Davila in teaching the course. Guest lectures were also really interesting. Improvements on teaching style - Prof is not great at explaining/teaching. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â They expect you to know how to code and use R/Python without ever teaching you. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths- You cover a lot of interesting topics, and get a lot of skills if you're looking to go into the field.
Weaknesses- New course, so I think the prof didn't measure well how much we had to cover with the time we had and sometimes felt rushed, overwhelming. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: course content was very interesting; Weaknesses: none, really <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The class appeared to be oddly paced. While it started out excessively slow, the class picked up very fast at the end. This made the tail end of the class much more difficult than anticipated, and could easily have been mitigated by pacing the class more evenly. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â ECON 251 is one of my favorite classes this semester. The course is well-structured and well-taught. Prof Eduardo really explains every idea in a clear way. He also used anonymous forms to receive feedback from students and made adjustment in teaching accordingly. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Pace is pretty fast, the homework is more plug and chug and doesn't do a great job of reinforcing an understanding of concepts. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Davila is probably one of the best econ professors I've had. He is really receptive to feedback and puts a lot of work into making sure that he is making the classes accessible. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I enjoyed how the lectures were recorded so that I could go back and re-watch confusing materials. Professor Davila also provides a lot of practice questions that are really helpful to learn the material. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course felt very dense. If the list of topics were shortened and gone through in more depth it would be a more favorable, less stress-inducing experience. It was easy to fall behind and constantly feel like one was playing catch-up. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Davila is really good at explaining complicated concepts and really cares about his students. The lectures in this class were informative, but also very dense. Especially during the second half of the course, it was very easy to get behind because of the amount of material being covered, and often required multiple rewatchings to fully grasp the material. I also thought the essay portion of the course, while letting me and my peers do some research on an interesting phenomena in the financial world, seemed really random and ultimately inconvenient at a time when classes were coming to an end. The problem sets were well timed and well crafted to test knowledge of the course. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There were a lot of practice problems available for completion in preparation for the exams. The problem sets felt relevant to the course material. However, I felt that the course moved too quickly and tried to cram too much material into a finite number of lectures. Oftentimes, I felt like I had to teach myself the concepts covered through completing the homework and studying for the exams. Also, we were only allowed to attend our TA's office hours (i.e. not allowed to go to other TA's office hours, even if they work better for your schedule), so if your TA had office hours at a time that didn't work for you, it was just a "too bad" kind of scenario. There were not many accommodations in place for pandemic-related learning difficulties. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course gets very difficult at points and it is clear that the class often did not understand what was going on the first time around. The problem sets weren't too burdensome and provided good practice. The midterm and final were difficult and required deep conceptual understanding of the topics, often beyond what was covered explicitly in class. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Covers a wide range of topics and gives a great foundation for finance 
Weaknesses: A bit too challenging at times <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Great course, very structured, a lot of good material, no weakness really <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course is way too theoretical. I do not want to get a phd in financial economics, so a lot of the stuff seems pretty useless. Some of the biggest models we learn are concluded with one line at the end of one slide at the end of the lecture saying that the model fails. It seemed as if the course was set up to try and get you ready to go into phd level financial economics - as opposed to a really solid understanding of the applicable part of financial economics. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is really fast, so you must take caution but overall, if you've had prior finance experience, or dabbled into stocks and the market, then this class should be fine. The professor is really passionate about the topic and the office hours really help you understand the content. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: Davila is a really fair professor and tries to explain everything clearly. If you don't get it, he'll go over it again. Also, the slides are very clear and helpful. In particular, the questions on the exam are pretty fair and are relevant to what's taught in class. The two guest lecturers were really interesting!
Weakness: some of the harder concepts are pretty difficult to grasp, even with the slides and extra explanations (particularly the SDF section). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course material covers a lot of ground and it is generally interesting if you are interested in finance/economics; the professor is very knowledgable and tries to listen as much as he can to the feedback that people give him in class. The weakness is that there is not much support for people who don't understand/need more help. The most the professor interacts with his students in class is with a poll to see if people understand the concept or not, but if the majority of the class doesn't understand the concept, he doesn't do much more explaining before moving on anyways. Also, you are only allowed to attend your TA's office hours, which really restricts the amount of OH you can attend, which is especially inconvenient if you have an OH after or way before the homework is due. <br/></div>

Weaknesses: There is A LOT of information covered in this course and it can feel quite overwhelming at times if the subject matter is brand new. Because there is SO much to cover, the professor has to speed through things at time which can be tough.

Professor very welcoming to feedback and students' suggestions. Extra materials provided for those interested in exploring specific topics further. 

Weaknesses: psets were very short (in comparison to other intermediate level econ classes), so exams seemed to catch some people by surprise. The class as a whole may have been helped by the additional accountability of longer psets (maybe 10 questions instead of 5). Personally I did not find this to be an issue though, as I did concept questions each week along with the psets, which felt sufficient to keep up with the material. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The only strength to me was the class organization -- psets were quickly graded and expectations were clear. In addition, ample practice material was provided. The class had a few major weaknesses. For one, I found the syllabus to be too theoretical for my liking (and thus I feel I gained fewer applicable skills than I would have liked). Since this class replaced Intro to Corporate Finance, many of the subjects in that course were glossed over or left unmentioned (and this is what would have actually helped me in life as an investor and in my career path). Further, the course at several points attempted to cover dense theoretical math such that only those who studied linear (like myself) knew what was going on. Few of these subjects were ever tested. This was not helped by Professor Davila who sometimes struggled to explain some of the more complex topics to students. Although Professor Davila clearly cares and has a love for finance, I didn't find him to be a very concise or clear instructor at parts. This course could generally be improved by covering more financial accounting and drawing more specific connections to real market happenings (beyond just sending articles in Slack which I appreciated). Professor Davila also included a few pset questions in Python and requested students use LyX or LaTeX for their papers, neither of which I had any working experience with (and I didn't know this coming in). Projects in excel were more effective. In general this class seemed to be directed towards those aspiring for an economics/finance PhD, which at this point I don't see myself doing. We also did not complete the full material and had to watch additional asynchronous videos on some of the more difficult topics (Black-Scholes, etc.), which was a weakness (although we had understandably a lot of material to cover in little time). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I believe this course is definitely catered towards people who have had some previous exposure to financial economics beforehand. I eventually stopped going to the live lecture because the professor would go too fast and things would just fly over my head. The homework is not representative at all of what the exam will look like because they are too easy in comparison. There is also so much material that it felt like it was up to luck if I remembered what came on the test, since a lot of the material is memorization. A lot of the homework also required knowing coding and R, which I did not and made my life so much harder. Taking an R class beforehand should be a prerequisite and not just a recommendation. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Depending on your personal preferences, you may find the topic mater this class in and of itself to be a strength. Anyone can download Robinhood on their phone, link their bank account, and invest/lose boatloads of money in a matter of minutes. This course helps you to understand the "why" behind the mechanisms at play in this simple phenomenon, teaching students about dynamics such as risk vs expected return: pricing an asset based on risk, volatility, and covariance; and why there is "no free lunch" in investing. Another strength of this course is the abundance of practice problems to use when studying for exams and the organization of the course "blocks". 

Weaknesses: I find that this course primarily suffers from a lack of truly engaging lessons. Many of the would-be "wow" moments in lectures were simply brushed over as we found out that a computer is needed to actually utilize that great financial mechanism. Additionally, the course covers a lot of content and uses a lot of equations which include a lot of symbols which stand for a lot of different abbreviations. These equations, symbols, and abbreviations are, of course, like second nature to professor Davila, however they are not super intuitive and made me spend a lot of time deciphering the lectures before really understanding what was happening. Overall, I felt like I needed to attend lectures in order to keep up with the definitions of the latest symbols/equations introduced rather than attending to understand some really interesting aspect of finance. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professor was clearly very knowledgable and passionate about teaching this course, but I felt he covered more breadth than depth than I wouldve liked. Many of the topics were glossed over and when asked about the reason/theory behind certain concepts/equation, he would either just refer us to the derivation worksheet he had uploaded on Canvas or say that he didnt have time to explain it. 

While he did upload all of his slides with about 9-10 modules (we covered 9 and didnt have time for Futures), I felt that it wouldve been more useful to choose a select few and focus more on those.

Lastly, the exams were not necessarily difficult but they were a major time-crunch. Im not sure if I didnt allocate my time efficiently but I definitely had to rush the last 10 questions for both my midterm AND final. It was a test of knowing which equations to use rather than a test of your comprehension on the subject. Admittedly, however, this is an issue with many mathematics courses here at Yale. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It is difficult to find an introductory finance course, so it was very nice that the course introduces the students to all of the essential finance terms and concepts without assuming that they have any previous knowledge of them. The course is trying to cover a lot of material, and I think it did a good job of giving a good foundation of knowledge. One improvement that could be made is to allow students to visit office hours of any TA (which seems to be how it is in most similar Economics courses). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Eduardo Davila is simply excellent. I can't think of a weakness about this course. Strenghts: Lots and lots of practice questions, lots of support and feedback, lots of opportunities to do well. Very good course and this is coming from someone who got a B+ in the course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: very relevant subject matter.  Problem sets and the writing assignments were fair.  Lectures were recorded so you could watch them again later.  Cool guest speakers.  Professor is nice
Weaknesses: sometimes we didn't get back problem set grades quick enough.  Midterm was pretty hard. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Too many words and information on the slides. The practice problems dont follow the style of exam questions, especially the conceptual questions. <br/></div>
