<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It will take a drastic restructuring to make introductory lab classes into a useful experience, rather than something people only ever do to complete a requirement and forget about. I think all of the skills we learned could have just as well been learned within a week of working in an actual lab, and it felt pointless to do activities like mixing to solids together and spending a couple hours separating  them again. It would be much more engaging if the lab could be designed around an actual project, to make it clearer how the lab techniques would actually be applied in a setting other than a basic and unhelpful STEM requirement. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures were engaging but the TAs had way to must free reign on how to grade, there should be an established rubric that is also shared with the students so they know how to properly write lab reports and what is expected from them. The final exam carried too much weight in the overall score. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths are that the lab is really fun, and always relevant to the material you're learning in o-chem. The weaknesses are the sheer amount of busy work assigned and the emphasis on graded assignments that do not accurately assess a student's competence in a chemistry lab. Every week, you'll spend 4-7 hours outside of lab completing assignments that are (a) just busy work mostly (b) harshly graded and (c) decide your grade. You are sure to be depressed at some point during the week thinking about this lab and the vast amount of graded assignments that are mostly useless. The class would be far better organized if an exam at the end wasn't a quarter of your grade, if students were provided the hazards of materials and the procedure of the lab rather than having to write it themselves, and if the TAs did not grade so arbitrarily and harshly. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: honestly enjoyed the course, prelab video demonstrations were very helpful
weaknesses: none that come to mind <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: DiMeglio is amazing and very clear, translated pretty well online (I felt like I was still learning even though I never got to actually go into the lab)
Weaknesses: how dependent your grades are on your TA -- I had a super tough and picky grader, so I had to spend way longer than many of my peers in other sections just to get the same (or even worse) grades. It is curved by TA at the end, but it was quite stressful/time consuming <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Labs online are really tough. This is not the ideal format for a lab at all, but with the circumstances, it was a fine experience. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is very strong in actual lab technique and understanding of what is in front of me. The assessments also extrapolate to different reactions, compounds, etc. that are similar, but perhaps the instruction part of the course could focus a little more on this point (for example, lab notes could contain a full mechanism for a similar reaction to the one studied in a given week). The assignments for each week were definitely helpful, but it would also improve learning (and lab notes) if the experimental plans were due early enough (perhaps a few days before the lab) that the Teaching Fellow could have time to grade them beforehand in case the student was understanding the experiment incorrectly. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course TAs grade really unequally across different sections. My section might have an 8.5/10 average for an assignment, but others might have a 7/10. Super hard to know how you are doing in the course as well. Especially in the virtual setting, it felt like points were being removed for arbitrary reasons. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: comprehensive education in lab safety procedures/etiquette, well designed &amp; set up experimental procedures, excellent support &amp; guidance

Weaknesses: Work discrepancy between online and in-person students, length of pre-lab and post-lab assignments, harsh grading for minute errors in formatting/description <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The labs are quite engaging and fun. I was lucky enough to be able to take this class in person, and really enjoyed the experiments we ran and felt as though I learned/improved quite a bit. Dr. DiMeglio is amazing, and my TA was very helpful. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Overall, the course was well organized. However, I would have liked it if the TAs had been more clear with what was expected from us on each assignment. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professor provided a lot of resources and reference material. These were extremely helpful at explaining the labs and also in completing the assignments. I wish the professor would have hosted at least one live session with students who were remote. 

The workload of this course is not accurately reflected by the amount of credits it is worth. Receiving 0.5 credits for a class that gave me much more work than other seminars I've taken in the past (even some DS classes) is crazy. I don't know if the instructors can change anything about this, but this is a serious problem with all chemistry labs at Yale (I've have the same experience with all other chemistry labs). 

There also needs to be more transparency and consistency in TA grading . Although the professor would post rubrics with clear outlines/expectations, there were times that I would be penalized for including/excluding something that was explicitly mentioned in the rubrics. Later, when I would bring it up with the TA, they would say that the professor "changed the requirements." During no time were these changes ever announced by the professor or teaching staff--I would just be penalized. This happened to me on several assignments. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think this course did a good job presenting the material and showing me what to do. I think the quizzes were stressful because of how limited our time was, but I guess quizzing is an unfortunate necessity. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I don't think my TA in particular did a good job of going over the details of each lab before the section. I had a really hard time on the final because we never talked about some of the stuff we needed to know for it.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Dr. diMeglio is super nice and helpful in lab, and often goes around checking to make sure everything is going alright in our experiments and making us feel welcome. The videos she filmed of doing the experiments in lab were also very helpful for letting us see what we should and should not be doing while performing the experiment. These videos also gave us a visual of how to properly handle the equipment.

Weaknesses: the workload for this class is very heavy. There are extremely specific guidelines for pre-lab assignments (which are called experimental plans in this course), post-lab assignments (which are called lab notes), and lab reports (which are called post-lab assignments). There are often a lot of things that need to be included in these assignments, some of which seem like busy work (ex: searching up the specific density and molecular mass for every reagent, even when these numerical values aren't employed in lab or in other parts of the assignment for most reagents). This leads to lengthy assignments that take up quite a bit of time, and the grading is very loose, meaning that the TAs have freedom to deduct points for whatever they deem as unprofessional (so if you get a TA that grades harshly, you often find yourself nitpicking over tiny details in your lab assignments to avoid getting points off, contributing to the high workload of this class). I think the teaching is fine and the labs themselves are not especially demanding, but the workload for this class does not feel like a 0.5 credit. <br/></div>

Between the TAs involvement during lab, pre-lab readings and videos, and post-lab assignments, I think that our growth and learning in Lab was very thorough. I enjoyed being able to know exactly what I am doing before entering the lab, as it helped me prepare myself for sometimes an overwhelming lab experiment. This class ends up being a fairly large workload for a 0.5 credit, but the work definitely aids in the lab process. Pre-lab and post-lab assignments were graded fairly stringently, but it helped me adjust quickly to the scientific writing model/style. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One big strength of this course is that there is a lecture before beginning to do the lab, and there are people who are ready to support you when you need new materials or do not know how to do something. Learning how to become a better scientific writer and use proper formatting was also another big strength. One weakness of this course was that sometimes the expectations for EP's and PL's were not really stated as well in the beginning and there was not a specific rubric tied to each so it was hard to understand how exactly to write them in the beginning. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength is definitely that your class size is quite small, so you can get help immediately. The pre-lab readings were supposed to have all the information required for that weeks lab but they rarely did. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Overall they did a great job with structuring the class. The videos made by Dr. Dimeglio were so well done and very interesting to watch each week. TAs were very helpful. 

Weaknesses are the quizzes. They had such a short time limit so it was hard to even think of the right answer even if we knew it. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â An immediate strength that comes to mind is the high level of organization and comprehensiveness within the course; course materials on Canvasincluding assignments, reading assignments, lab videos, quizzes, and other fileswere largely consistent, readily available, and navigable. However, there were some discrepancies in chemical compound names and lab procedures between some weeks' reading assignments and lab videos, and the small differences led to confusion and the need for clarification throughout the semester. Ensuring that the information presented in the reading assignments and videos is identical will aid in making the course more user-friendly, especially in a virtual format. 

I also find thatwhile the exams and quizzes accurately apply concepts discussed in sections and reading assignmentsstudents were not allotted enough time for assessments, especially the final exam. Providing only 60 seconds (quizzes) or 96 seconds (exam) per question creates a significant time deficit, which induces high levels of stress that can cloud rational thinking. Even as a student who read thoroughly and studied consistently to ensure full comprehension of the course material, I found the quizzes and exam to be rushed, and I do not feel that testing conditions allow for an accurate reflection of student comprehension and effort across the semester. Given these timing issues, I found the weighting of the final exam to be particularly severe; missing a single question on the exam equates to getting a 0/10 on an experimental plan or lab notes assignment. Given that these assignments often take several hours to complete (in contrast with the 96 seconds per exam question), I found the 10-point penalty for missing an exam question to be disproportionately high. A student with exceptional performance throughout the semester and mediocre performance on the exam due to timing issues could watch his or her grade turn from an A to a B+ or B within minutes. I find this alarming.

I am sure that I am not alone in my concerns, and I urge the course coordinators and/or instructors to reconsider the merits of allowing students more time to formulate their answers on quizzes and exams. If this leads to retroactive adjustments for students enrolled in the course in the most recent semester, those changes would be equally welcomed and appreciated. <br/></div>

The deadlines were always consistent, and I always knew what was expected of me during a given week. The content was also well organized so that each lab built upon the previous week. In person labs were engaging.

Weaknesses- Even though I only attended one virtual session, it was definitely a bit harder to be engaged (through no fault of the instructor, Zoom is just a difficult platform for a lab).

Being able to discuss the chemistry and the procedures with my TA in person was so educational, and the act of conversing about the topics made a huge difference. There was also a sense of independence and responsibility instilled in each lab student, which I enjoyed. I think I acquired a lot of practical knowledge, and of a wide breadth, all while being very intrigued and engaged in the lab. The only weakness I could point out is the occasional subjectivity of grading; sometimes points would be taken off for the smallest things, often issues that were not previously discussed or in the rubric. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The experiments themselves were fun and informative. However, especially with EPs and lab notes, the grading scheme was stressful and incomprehensible.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The labs were never too long or convoluted and the pre-class assignments were relatively sufficient to prepare us for lab day. The labs are also quite forgiving, and if you don't meet a certain percent yield or recovery you don't have to restart the lab over or get docked points.
Weaknesses: There are no rubrics or explicit guidelines for the EPs, LNs or PLs so you just learn how you should write them through trial and error (meaning you get docked points and then figure out what you should change next time). This was a bit frustrating in the beginning, but for the most part you learn by the end of the course how to get the points.  I think if they gave us a little more guidance in the first few lab days how to structure them it would make the course a little less stressful in the beginning. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I enjoyed the online format of the recorded lectures. Although the EP's and Lab Notes were incredibly tedious, the work was manageable. I did not like how we were given no time for the quizzes to prevent cheating online (6 minutes for 5 questions), but it wasn't the worst. The main negative was that I didn't find the live lecture with a teaching fellow useful at all and was kind of just a waste of time. Also, the grading of EP's and Lab Notes seemed very arbitrary at times and points would be taken off for unimportant and unquantifiable things such as phrases not being short enough or procedures not being paraphrased enough (though for some really inconsistent cases the inconsistencies could be pointed out and the points would be given back). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â As a remote student, watching lab videos and writing lab notes and pre-labs was a little frustrating, since I was doing a lot of work to just watch a video instead of being in the lab (more a weakness about this year's situation).

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I think experiments are set up well and you will learn quite a lot about synthesizing products, extracting them, and evaluating their purity. The engagement (at least for my TA. It varies though as I have heard otherwise from my friends) was pretty high for my section and you do have fun doing all the experiments. Weakness: The grading is very up in the air and you really have no idea what you scored until after the final (which is a huge huge portion of your final grade). The experimental plans and lab notes due before and after each lab section respectively were also very tedious and sometimes seemed unnecessary. The TAs were very picky and ambigious about what they took points off. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A glaring weakness in the class is the grading scheme, rather than being based on your knowledge of the chemistry behind each lab, most of the points you lose will be due to minor mistakes (missing citation, not using the correct terminology, not restating the question in your answer, and at one point even beginning a sentence with a number) that add up to non-zero portions of your grade. Because of this scheme, this course actually presents a surprising amount of workload that comes from double and triple checking work for any errors that could enough up as docked points. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The in-person laboratory time was always fun, engaging, well-organized and well-paced and very conducive to learning. I feel like I grew a lot in confidence with regards to preparing solutions, doing the basic different types of experimental setups, and collecting and analyzing data. Weaknesses: A lot of busywork outside of class involving a long pre-laboratory reading assignment, writing up an experimental plan, watching a video of the experiment, preparing for the lab notes, and preparing for the post-lab quiz. A lot of it felt very redundant and did not add much to my learning or lab experience. The assignments were also graded quite unfairly as they didn't give us a rubric to follow exactly, and points were taken off for things like font, format, or color, which was really frustrating. There were also so many exam questions to prepare for for the quizzes, and the quizzes themselves were so short that every question had a lot of weight, which made it extremely discouraging to receive 3/5 or 60% on a "short quiz" that took 2 hours to prepare for. It did NOT feel like a half-credit class and probably had the most workload among all the classes I took this semester. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: this class fosters a supportive environment that encourages intellectual curiosity and the development of instrumental experience in the lab. It accompanies the lecture course very effectively, and the course provides a variety of different techniques and reactions that are essential to the foundations of organic chemistry. 

Weaknesses: the grading of this class seems ultra-specific to the TA, and while they do curve assignments according to TA, I find that the grading system seemed quite random at times -- some weeks you would lose points for not including something, and then the next, when you do include, you would lose points for "unnecessary information"; I would have liked to seen a more clearly structured grading system. 

In addition, I am not sure how this can be changed, but the number of students who collaborate illegally on EPs and LNs is quite disheartening -- those who worked ethically (including myself) were often hurt in the grading system (losing points in formatting and occasionally content) because we did not break the rules by allowing people to review our work for general formatting errors and content/word errors before submitting. <br/></div>

Weaknesses: doing the assignments for this class often reminds me of banging my head into a concrete wall. The experimental plans and the lab notes are each worth ten points, but those points aren't given for what you did right, they are taken away for your small mistakes, often formatting-related. Sometimes I wonder if it would be possible to receive negative points on one of these assignments. Three small mistakes and you have a C on the assignment. This was my average. Four small mistakes and you are down to a D. While the post-lab and the final are worth much more, completing these ten point assignments is demoralizing as you put an incredible amount of work into learning the material for consistently mediocre grades that don't reflect what you know. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I thought everything was really coordinated. I though the assignments were short but full of information. It is not as much work as general chemistry but the concepts were a little harder especially if you had no ergo background. I liked that the recorded labs were clear and short. I also liked how our first attempts at the assignments did not count towards are grades and were there instead to give us feedback on what to do for the next assignments that did count.

Weakness: Grading. This is more hearsay than by own personal experience. But there is a lack of consistency in grading. And although we are graded within our section and not across the entire class, I would like more consistency. There is nothing wrong about "hard" grading and I welcome it but it comes down to what is being graded. It makes no sense that one group gets feedback on presentation + chem while others don't. The grading of content should be the same. That means other students have to prepare more and look out for pieces of info to include that others would not have to worry about. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I believe that there is too much of an emphasis on small grammatical errors when grading labs rather than the content. However, the grading and feedback was always very in depth. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The retention of information was very high because the amount of times you had to write out procedures, use them, discuss them, etc really helped ingrain them into my mind. 
Weaknesses: They weren't always clear with what information they wanted exactly so there was always a feeling of panicking over whether we had done assignments correctly. Assignments also took extremely long and I personally think there probably could have been a more efficient way of doing things, even if it was having better communication so students wouldn't spend so long agonizing over details that didn't matter. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength of the course was our TA -- Jaehoo was great and always willing to answer questions. The lab environment, maybe due to it being so small because of COVID restrictions, meant that instructors were always walking around willing to help and explain WHY things were happening and why processes were being done the way they were. However, a weakness was that a lot of the class seemed like busy work and just unnecessarily time consuming. This class was super stressful for no reason. Then, on top of that the grading was super harsh, literally taking things off for formatting. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The class was very well organized using an online format, and the material for each week was given well in advance and there was plenty of time to complete all of the assignments. The weakness of the course was the grading policy, as the TAs were entirely responsible for grading our assignments, where the grading policies/expectations were not always known beforehand. For example, policies regarding grading for references and technical terminology changed without prior notice, as they would be accepted on one assignment but not on the following without warning of this policy change. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class is hard to translate effectively into an online format, making it hard to learn sometimes.

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Dr. DiMeglio and my TA were always really helpful and understanding when mistakes were made in lab. They also did a good job of connecting the chemical concepts to what we were doing in lab.
Weaknesses: None. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength is the pre-loaded content which is accessible early-on and neatly organized into week folders. 
Weakness is the occasionally inconsistent grading format. Following the directions too literally can lose you points. But the instructors were fair and upfront 99.9% of the time. 
The final exam format unfortunately was geared towards concepts emphasized in lecture rather than specific lab experiments. Compared to the practice exam, the actual lab final had less questions pertaining solely to lab. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength is that the labs were recorded so they could be rewinded, but this was also its weakness as a recorded lab is not the same experience as an in person one <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths were having very helpful TA's, small lab size with social distancing, very good preparation (with pre-lab readings and lab videos), as well as clear feedback. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength - amazing professor, pretty clear explanations. Has compassion, loved taking her course, such a fair course. 
Improvement - a little more support with feedback. Making it clear about having some type of office hours to help with assignments and get feedback before due. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The biggest strength of this course is its organization. In addition to recorded lab videos, there were also often additional documents outlining what needed to be completed in each assignment (e.g. a guide on scientific formatting in lab reports). All documents were easily categorized by week, which made Canvas very accessible. Within the lab videos themselves, DiMeglio did an excellent job at carefully articulating each step that was being taken, and she remained engaging. The subsequent live discussion sections enabled students to actively discuss the lab protocol and ask questions. I have no critiques for this course. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The in-person component was definitely a highlight. This was my only in-person class, and I was grateful for the experience! It never felt like hours in a lab; I was always fully immersed in the experiment. I also appreciated the clear course organization and expectations/deadlines. One drawback, however, was the workload. Even though it was only worth half a credit, I spent the most amount of time preparing for this class. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really enjoyed the lab course and learning how to perform various techniques. I liked how there was an EP before every lab, which ensured we knew what we were working on during the lab, and then the mini lab reports at the end of each lab. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The assignments in the class were very thorough, forcing us to understand completely what the lab is about. The grading in the class could be very harsh. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - it was a very well-structured course with top-quality teaching
Weaknesses - the grading was erratic and varied far too much among TAs. So many points were taken off for small rubric infringements that a well-written lab report with a few errors would score as poorly as a poorly written lab report. Hours were spent trying to perfect the EPs and LNs, but points were taken off wantonly, and they did not really affect the grade at all <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course corresponded well with the regular organic chemistry lecture and concepts were well-explained. However, more direction could have been given during the first few sessions. <br/></div>
