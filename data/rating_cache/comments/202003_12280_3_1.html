<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked splitting up into breakout rooms to work on the labs. Having the DIY kits was also helpful for the post lab activity <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Having to watch someone else do the lab wasn't beneficial. The analyzing component worked well though, as it was pretty similar to when we had in person labs. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professors actually understand that we are in a pandemic, and act accordingly <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The DiY post lab activities were really fun and low-pressure. Great balance of recorded and in-person learning. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The virtual labs were quite successful and well prepared. The Post Lab Activities were a bit confusing at times and their purpose could be clarified. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I enjoyed the use of breakout rooms to simulate an in-person lab experience. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The technique of placing students in breakout rooms to work side by side on virtual activities was very effective and allowed for collaboration in a way normal lab courses never do. The unique style of the videos for the course, both main and extra, also contributed to engagement with the material. However, the virtual TA lectures did not translate effectively, and the content was often made more confusing rather than less by them. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Succeeded: breakout rooms during the lab were helpful for us to work in small groups
Could be improved: most of the labs consisted of watching recorded videos of the professor performing the experiments for us. This made it hard to stay fully engaged in the labs, since we could not perform the experiments ourselves. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The breakout rooms are a good idea, but maybe have us pick our own groups or have us do some sort of freebie icebreaker activity together so it's less awkward!
I also really disliked the use of LoggerPro when we had to record our own data from videos. The premade data LoggerPro files were more easy to work with.
Sometimes it would get a bit long to sit in the same place watching physics videos or doing lab calculations/data recording for 3 hours. A shorter lab activity (max 2 hours) would be preferred. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I feel like I missed out on a lot of the hands-on experience, but I still gained a lot of knowledge. I got the most out of this online lab that was possible given the circumstances. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think how they have adapted the lab is great. It allows students to be able to get a lab experience wherever they are. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â We were given really cool kits of physics equipment at the beginning of the year, and I know they must've been such a hassle to assemble and distribute, but I do feel like working with my hands helped me visualize the physics. The pre-recorded videos were also super helpful (and funny!). <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â the workload was unnecessarily high for a half credit. It is already difficult to manage so many online classes during a pandemic, and i felt that this half credit course consumed way too much of my time. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â successes: videos for lab were easy to follow and understand as were the lab packets, TA engagement with section was good and help was received when needed during and outside of lab via virtual correspondence or zoom

improvements: more structure for post lab assignments; i opted for watching videos over the physical experiments because i had no idea how to design one different from the one in lab videos or how to set up somewhere at home in a way optimal for a physics experiment <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked how there were videos of the lab for those learning virtually. But delivering lab supplies was inconvenient as the delivery service kept on damaging the supplies. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really appreciate the consideration that the professors and TFs put. The SindeyKits were phenomenal and helped the learning experience. However, I think it could have been improved if we had more guidance on how to use the materials. The breakout rooms were also pretty successful since I could interact with other students and ask questions. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Something which was a great addition were the Post Lab Activities that actually allowed us to physically conduct experiments ourselves. We were given a series of lab materials and several experimental suggestions to facilitate our own work. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course succeeded in allowing us to have some hands on experience. It was less engaging, however, than it would be in class and was not as helpful to learning via watching others do demonstrations. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course succeeded given the difficulties of a lab class during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lab kits and prepared labs by Prof Cahn and the rest of the teaching team made this class enjoyable. I don't have any notes on what could be improved. <br/></div>

I understand how extremely difficult it must be to grade things during the pandemic, but perhaps this might show how there should be less PLAs or Lab reports if my TA cannot finish grading the majority of my assignments.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the small group break-out room format was very helpful because lots of people asked questions, and I don't think that would have been the case if the entire class was in one big room.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Post-lab assignments could be improved. I think there was a very rigid structure for post-lab assignments, and although the handouts say that you should spend about 1.5 hours on it tops, that's an additional 1.5 hours on top of the 3 hours of lab, 0.5 hour of pre-lab reading, and 3-4 hours on making the lab notebooks neat, organized, and including everything that needs to be included.

I really liked that one week where we completed the lab ourselves and wrote our answers on worksheets. That took a lot of stress out of rewriting lab notes and was one of the only times I finished lab within the allotted timeframe. <br/></div>

It provided a comfortable setting in which to speak to peers, ask questions, and work through the lab together. The recordings of labs we would usually do ourselves also worked surprisingly well; even though we couldn't do many labs ourselves, watching and analyzing the videos or data provided to us was still interesting and informative. Perhaps next semester the balance between recordings and labs we do ourselves could be improved/altered so we can gain more experience actually doing labs ourselves. <br/></div>

The PLAs stressed me out I can't lie. I'd rather do some more of the interactive content during lab time than outside of it. All the computer stuff and worksheet-style material can easily be done outside of lab I think but the more engaging parts are in the kit. In short the kit deserves a lot more attention. <br/></div>

Frankly, they didn't add anything to my learning experience than had already been obtained via the live lab sections. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked the way the live session was conducted--first, the TF would talk briefly about the lab, then we'd go into breakout rooms and begin the lab while the TF went to different rooms in case anyone had questions. The kits were a great help. Overall, I think the instructors and TF adjusted very well to virtual learning. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The videos we collected data from were fantastic and interesting to watch. I am learning remotely from home, so I received a kit of physics equipment to run my post-lab assignments. I only used the kit for my final lab practical exam and aa few of the labs. For post-lab assignments, I only used the ping-pong ball and thread provided. Having break-out rooms for lab was nice and encouraged me to finish the labs / graphing components in class (as opposed to later in the week when finishing my lab report). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The videos Professor Cahn made were really helpful in demonstrating the lab, and it was really nice to see such clear footage of a succesful lab. I think the Post Lab Activities were also nice because they encouraged us to still get hands on experience. I also liked the Sindey Kits we received, although I only used about half the materials I received, so I'm not sure it's worth all the effort it must take to distribute such large and complete kits to everyone in the course.

I think the interactions between students early in the semester could be improved because the first few weeks were drastically more difficult than the last few weeks, largely because we didn't feel comfortable asking each other too many questions in breakout rooms and we were still not used to the format of the class. I did really like how we had the same lab partner every week because it created a sense of continuity and gave us more chances to create somewhat lasting relationships with at least one classmate, but I also never contacted my lab partner outside of breakout rooms in class. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was obviously dampened by the online format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We had to watch pre-recorded videos by the instructor and analyze data that he made, which was slightly dull. However, a strength of this format is that we don't have to worry about errors that we students make, nor worry about putting the setup correctly and waste time making mistakes.

Additionally, we were provided with kits of objects that we could emulate the experiments at home with. These were useful in clarifying the physics concepts and made it a bit more fun, although sometimes it was tedious.

The PLAGs/WTFs (extra experiments in addition to normal physics lab) were honestly unnecessary and repetitive, and mostly a waste of time. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â To move a lab course is a challenging thing. I really appreciate the work put in to distribute experimental kits. Using tactile experimental tools for some experiments in combination with the video watching was helpful for 1) to force me to think creatively about the experimental approach 2) become more accustomed with seeing physics concepts in real life. That being said, the work-load of the course at times felt daunting. Post lab assignments were helpful in solidifying concepts, but it did add a significant amount of work during weeks that it was due. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I enjoyed the watching of videos and analyzing of data using LoggerPro version of the class a bit better than the building a physical apparatus version of the class. When we had to build something, it took so much time and gave me a lot of anxiety that I wasn't doing it correctly or why it wasn't working. The watching of videos was very easy to follow, especially since this class was one of the best organized classes in terms of the Media Library I have seen this entire semester. I think the final exam was very nerve wracking because of time and the nature of the experiment. Anything that has to do with balance is very precarious and ate up a lot of my time, so I would avoid having a final like that in the future. Also, I don't know if building in breaks or something would be helpful because sitting over zoom for 3 hours straight was really hard to do as the semester went on. <br/></div>

It took less time because we didn't need to set everything up each week like we would have done had it been in person.  Our TA was very helpful as well.  Sometimes it was boring if group members were just muted and camera off the whole time.  Also, the practicum were not too fun to do in my dorm room.  I preferred watching the videos already prepared and doing the LoggerPro. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â As mentioned above, I certainly believe that things like the PLAs did not fulfill the purpose for which they were created in the first place, and instead made the course feel more draining and tiring. The WTF videos and assignments were also probably one of the most vague assignments I was ever assigned. I did not find them to contribute towards my learning experience in the course, and they sometimes felt like somewhat of a joke. If they were to be implemented again I would try to make the aim of the assignment much more clear to the students and try to deliver the WTF videos in such a way that make students search for specific mistakes rather than not knowing what to point to first in a video that feels completely wrong and chaotic. <br/></div>
