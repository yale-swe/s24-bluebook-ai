<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - organized syllabus; facilitated communication between professors, TFs, and students; transparency in assignments and expectations 
Weaknesses - lengthy required weekly readings, disorganized class discussions and recorded lectures, unaddressed confusion about certain philosophies, prolonged silence during class discussions <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really like the pre-recorded lectures on the philosophers' work, that was very helpful to understand the big picture. I wish there was more connections made between different philosophers and more emphasis on non-European thinkers. The course is called "Foundations of modern social theory", so it doesn't mean that all the modern social theorists are European-centered; if we are only looking at European-centered theorists, it shouldn't be called "modern social theory" because it doesn't include the diversity of all thinkers from different places. 
The class is quite big to have formal discussions, so the class environment wasn't made encouraging enough for people to actively participate except for about 10~ people out of 40~. I understand things are different with Zoom, but I hope we could have a smaller environment for discussion. The thing with break-out rooms is that it was difficult to get conversation started without a TA/ instructor, and conversation quality varies depending on who the people are in the break-out room. I think it would be better if there is more lecture part in the course because the pre-recorded lecture isn't enough to get to the details of the works. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the strengths of this class are the recorded lectures and the synchronous sections led by the TAs. The live virtual lecture often felt like a waste of time and only seven people consistently spoke out of a class of almost 50 students. It's really not necessary to have both live class AND recorded lectures. A possible fix would be for the professors to teach the recorded material live in real-time but also have recordings available for those who cannot make lectures all the time. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One strength of the class is just the works themselves. They're super interesting and I think most students taking the course engaged with them really well. An additional strength was that discussions really made the works easier to digest. One major weakness was that the works were not as varied as they could have been. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This was one of my favorite classes this semester but I do think that the way the class handled race/difference was a bit elementary. Many students of color in the class, including myself, often felt uncomfortable due to the way race was treated in the readings (which is to be expected when reading the canon), but we were dissatisfied by how those details were just glossed over in class. Even more so than the uncomfortable treatment of readings, it was the response to students bringing it up in class that made it truly worse. While I'm grateful that we created a space in class to have the discussion, it ended up being a hostile situation and I believed the instructors ended up playing the part of white victims (to some extent). As a student of color, there were many times when I had to prioritize protecting the feelings of white peers and instructors over my own discomfort, and I don't think I was fully heard. However, I do think the instructors of the class are capable of much better and that this can be fixed with a bit more thought pertaining to the criticisms we gave in class. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths of the course include the papers we had to write--these papers allowed for a deeper analysis/reflection on concepts by one (for the first two papers) or several (for the final paper) theorists that we went over. Weaknesses of the course may mostly have to do with its virtual format; see #5 for feedback on these issues. The amount of reading required was definitely not low and sometimes verged on being too much, but for the most part was manageable. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The teaching fellows are phenomenal and the recorded lectures were also helpful in facilitating learning. The syllabus really needs to be improved and I hope that there is more of an intersectional lens to the class, rather than just bracketing discussions on race and gender. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this class. The course featured one perspective heavily- that of white, European men and neglected to discuss others. Due to the title of the course and its role as the only theory class required for the Sociology major, I was pretty disappointed. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course will develop you as a writer. Reading theory, analyzing it, and synthesizing it is not an easy task, and you will grow from the experience. However, this course is heavily dependent on Western thinkers, who often have problematic perspectives on race, gender, etc. which influence their theory but were not discussed in the class. Additionally, many of the readings are old and thus hard to understand. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course instructors were knowledgable and approachable. I learned a lot from the peer tutors and received great recommendations for future courses to develop my understanding of social theory.
The virtual lectures were not lectures so much as discussion times. I wish we had a little more time to receive in-depth expositions of the authors before having to guide our own discussions. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I believe the biggest strength of the course was the constant push to think beyond the thinker. I had never taken a class where I was always trying to come to my own conclusions. It was daunting because we are thinking about people who have work that we are not reading and reputable. 

The biggest drawback was sometimes the readings were difficult, and there was not always ample discussion or context. I also believe we should read more thinkers with a variety of thought. I understand that white men are the backbone of Western thought, but it would be nice to challenge them a bit more with other contemporaries. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professors are very good at explaining complex theory.

Weaknesses: The class was at times very emotionally draining due to the stress created in the class in regards to the topic of critiquing the theory we were reading. The syllabus was also a weakness as we spent almost the complete semester talking only about limited canonical theory written by cis white men and then spent a much shorter time on later theorists. For example, we spent probably a total of 10 minutes discussing Judith Butler in contrast with the hour and 30 minutes devoted to Simmel. Coupled with this was the fact that reactions to questions about the limited scope of the class and the lack of addressing racist theorists pasts were very defensive. The class felt highly constricting and at times blatantly ignored the problematic nature of many theorists. de Toqueville's genocidal tendencies had to be brought up by a TF, if they hadn't been they most likely would not have been mentioned. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The syllabus should be restructured to include readings that contextualize and critique the selected authors, replacing the less crucial, sometimes trivial parts of some unnecessarily lengthy selections. This would make for a more constructive and purposeful discussion. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class was provided a good overall conception of Western modern social theory. Concerns about the content of the class appeared throughout, but I am of the opinion that if this class was meant to provide a baseline understanding of the social theories that construct the discipline of Sociology, then primary focus on the works and theories of the likes of Marx, Weber, and other white Europeans is justified. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Discussion sections and lecture discussions. 
Weaknesses: The syllabus perhaps didn't lend itself to a more global or inclusive understanding of modern social theory. There could be more texts from non-white theorists. There could be more discussion of the very outdated aspects of the theory that we did read. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A big weakness of this class this semester was the time constrain for discussions. We had a pre-recorded lecture for initial background on the theories and the theorists. During the live lecture a lot of our time would quickly be consumed by simple questions which made it difficult to obtain an in-depth understanding of the theories discussed. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I appreciated the professors' efforts to generate engagement. I felt the syllabus of this course was very limited and I wished we had more opportunities to read a more diverse list of authors. Theorists were studied with regard only to the portion of their text that was assigned and were not looked at holistically. As a result, the theorists' other works, personal beliefs, and potential contributions to racist behavior were not acknowledged. When students brought this up to the professors, many of the students' concerns were listened to, but ultimately dismissed. This created an environment that made it difficult for students to want to participate. However, on a positive note, I did feel that section was an opportunity to critique and challenge theorists in a way that had not been given room in lecture. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths would be the TFs, the pre-recorded lecture, and sometimes section. A weakness was definitely the lack of diversity in the curriculum and the awkward synchronous lectures where only 8 students and the professors talked. I really did enjoy Prof Erickson; she made a point of reaching out to all of the students to hear about our takes on the class. She was also super kind and understanding. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course had a very limited syllabus. Most of the authors were white and male despite a number of POC and female theorists existing that could have been included on the syllabus. Not only that, but some of the authors were racist, and rather than having a truly constructive conversation regarding this, one of the professors fiercely defended the author and the syllabus that she'd created. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the course would be better if it reverted to the standard lecture format that it uses in-person and those that want more discussion can use office hours. The breadth of the readings was interesting, but I think some of the assignments could be better paired to prompt more critical analysis of each author. <br/></div>
