<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: it is a great survey course for AI
Weakness: I think the TAs were a bit lost in a lot of ways. First, they do not have access to the exams, so their review sessions were quite messy and were of minimal to no help. Second, I think some of the communication for the class was largely mishandled. They would make changes to the PSET and announce it via an Ed post that may not be communicated to all students. Rather, I think Canvas announcements should have been used. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â lectures well broken down into different topics, lecture slides thorough and contains a lot of examples <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The PSETs for the course were often messy and disorganised. You are only given one week to complete the assignments and the provided starter code was often incorrect for the first 3 or 4 days. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Great course, and very knowledgeable professor. The lectures could feel a bit standardized at times since the instructor followed very much the same format and preferred questions to be saved for the end, so interaction lacked a bit.. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Lectures focused on just the right details. Prof. Scaz is very good at explaining difficult concepts in a crystal-clear way. The course was also practical, and the discussion sections and lectures on AI Ethics were very interesting.

Weaknesses: Time to stop for questions in the middle of lecture would increase engagement. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Honestly the logistics were messy. Having no practice material for the final exam, plus the fact that almost every PSET had some kind of important typo or error that wouldn't be fixed until asked about on Ed (and then the solution would be released as a new version of the starter code and if you already started you would need to somehow merge the new code with your existing code), was stressful. 

But the content was very accessible and engaging! <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The psets are almost all trivial, so we don't really get any practical experience from them. I don't know how this is a 400-level course that graduate students can also take, because we don't go that deep into the material (though this means it is a good course for first or second year undergrads interested in AI). Sometimes the course tried to cover AI societal topics like ethics, but these lectures always tended to be speculative and shallow, i.e. the professor's opinion on what the future will be like, and more fit for a TedTalk than a lecture.

We do cover a lot of non-modern topics, though, which is cool. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Engaging lectures, reasonable psets
Weaknesses: Because of the wide breadth, some topics were not covered in that much detail <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: highly structured lecture notes and topics. Weaknesses: did not go into any depth in the topics. Hard to review for midterms as it was unclear how material learned the class would be applied. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â If this is an indication of the future of AI, we dont need to worry. Poorly written code and half-baked algorithms arent taking over the world anytime soon. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A solid elective in the CS curriculum. This is a survey course, so you don't learn about a topic in great detail but you do get exposure to a variety of topics, which helps you pick out which ones pique your interest. It would have been helpful if we got practice with problems in the later half of the course. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One of the strengths of the course is Scaz, who is an excellent lecturer. Another strength is the relevance of the material to computer science. However, a weakness of the course is that it is very hard to know how well you are doing, since no indication of what counts as an A / A- / ... is given. Additionally, the exams are very hard and feel like they are on a completely different level than the homework assignments. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This was a good course, and I really feel like I learned a great deal about the different facets of what is really a complex and broad field of computer science. I was slightly bothered by how little we were allowed to participate, particularly the fact that we as students were not allowed to ask questions during the lectures except at the very end made it difficult if we were confused but later on forgot our questions or had to go to another class right after AI. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The problem sets were horrendous - poorly organized and often with confusing wording. They were easy to do but not all straightforward. I would often have to spend several hours trying to understand the organization of the starter code just to end up writing two lines of code. There was also a frustrating lack of support for the midterm and final, and the professor didn't give us any information about the format of the exams or the types of questions there would be, making it very hard to study properly. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The piece sets were occasionally super super frustrating and grading was unclear at times. They were also often borrowed from other schools' AI homework, which made adaptations difficult and annoying. 
The course straight up followed the textbook chapter by chapter, which felt a bit... odd and unoriginal.
Exams were ridiculous. The first exam was too easy and impossible to study for the second exam was ridiculously hard and impossible to study for. He spent one slide on Baye's rule (a single slide!) and then dedicated an entire question to it on the final exam. On an AI exam! A Baye's rule question!!! That was frustrating. He also said final exam would be cumulative but, and I quote: "only because I can't test the second half of the course without testing the half because they build on each other." Turns out, HALF OF THE QUESTIONS WERE BASED SOLELY ON THE FIRST HALF WITH ABSOLUTELY NO RELATIONSHIP TO THE SECOND HALF OF THE COURSE. He straight up lied and it ruined my grade on the test. I did almost perfectly on the second half and still didn't do so well because I didn't study the first half because why would I need to? He implied I only needed to study what was built on. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The problem sets and exams seemed disconnected from the lectures and were in greater depth than had been covered in class. This made them very challenging; however, most problem sets did come with starter code, which was helpful. I really appreciated the discussion of ethics in the course, and the lectures were interesting. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I felt this was a great introduction into AI, but its a survey course. You never really go on depth in any topic. This also meant the psets jumped around a lot in terms of difficulty <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths is the presentation of the material and the psets overall. This is a good survey course of AI techniques. If you want a deeper dive into a particular AI topic there are other classes, but this is a good intro. I loved the AI talks that we had in class and our professor should absolutely consider holding them in future offerings of the class <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course mainly just covers the textbook. The textbook is pretty good, and Scaz is a pretty good lecturer, so I would say that the actual content taught was probably the biggest strength of the course. For a survey course, I thought it gave a pretty good idea of various AI techniques.

That being said, I thought that the problem sets were done very badly. Some of them were directly lifted from UC Berkeley, and these were pretty good, but the other ones were simply poorly designed. I didn't feel that they helped my learning at all, the writeups were confusing, and they were often filled with bugs. The TFs didn't help very much, often seemingly not knowing the correct answers to some of their own questions. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The entire course is shaped in a natural cohesive manner. This makes it possible to build connections between topics that you've seen earlier on in the course. Weaknesses: We cover a ton of topics very briefly and so it is difficult to feel as though you really understand certain topics. <br/></div>

The one weakness of the course were the office hours. There were only 6 total hours offered of help each week for a class of over 100 students. I found it was hard to get help, and I had to ask all of my questions at once, because I could not see a TA twice on one pset. However despite the scarcity, office hours were helpful when I could talk to a TA. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Prof. Scaz's lectures are solid and they do a good job of giving an overview of the topics. However, this course suffers from being extremely unorganized in terms of the teaching staff. I've heard plenty of complaints about the office hours not actually having a TF at the right time. PSETs also suffer from being either copied from Berkeley or just too simple to actually learn the material. A huge weakness of this class is also the content on exams and their grading. Often times, the questions on exams seem to come out of nowhere and are definitely not covered in lecture, and then to add on to that, the grading is often ambiguous, with no clear reasoning why points were taken off. The point distribution on exams also generally doesn't make any sense, and a 1 sentence answer can somehow be worth 12/80 points on a midterm. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course felt very disorganized. The biggest weakness for me was the problem sets and the amount that we learned from them, which was very little as we were only replacing a few lines of prewritten code.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The assignments are very well constructed, but more can be done in terms of providing practice exam questions.

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I found the homework assignments quite challenging and often a bit confusing, as they required students to pick through a series of instructions and edit or append pre-written code. This was unlike any other homework I've done at Yale.  I wonder if there would be a better way to help ingrain course concepts.  

I also thought that the exams could be improved, or that lecture/homework could include more examples whereby we get to practice techniques or concepts covered in class.  Homework assignments were usually 100% coding --- but there was no coding on either of the exams.  Though I thought the exams were fair, a few more concrete preparatory examples would have been much appreciated. 

With all that said, I really enjoyed the course and found it a fascinating gateway into the world of artificial intelligence.  The material was among the most interesting that I've studied in college, and Scaz does an excellent job presenting it and inspiring students to care about why artificial intelligence matters. Even the TA's were good --- responsive and helpful. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I thought the sequence of topics was really effective, and each subsequent topic built on the ones prior really nicely. It was great to learn about recent developments in the field-- the last few lectures on current topics were really engaging. 

Weaknesses: the Psets in the second half of the course seemed to be a little too surface-level; the ones in the first half of the course, pre-midterm, were great and prepared us well enough for the midterm exam, I felt. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The problem sets for this class were extremely weak and disorganized - there were several typos and the problem sets often involved filling in the blanks in the PDF or starter code which required no understanding of the concepts being taught. I left the class feeling like I couldn't do anything practical at all with the information I had learned. Scaz seemed very uninvolved with the creation of the problem sets, and was condescending towards students who had clarifying questions about the clearly ambiguous instructions. The TAs also seemed to care very little about the students' experience, and were completely unprepared for office hours as well as review sessions. The strengths of this class are the organization of the lectures, and Scaz's own expertise in the area which is great to hear about during the AI "chat sessions." <br/></div>
