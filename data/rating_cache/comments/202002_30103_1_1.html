<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures were very good, and the instructors seemed to really care about the course. Joanna was very kind and made sure to take our mid semester feedback to heart (and it was kind of her to even have mid semester feedback for a summer course, which most courses I've taken haven't done). I think it really showed that she cared about the student experience of the course which is a lot more than I can say for other instructors. I do wish we could have gone over more material but I understand not wanting to overload students during the summer given the limited amount of time and pandemic situation. It was probably one of the most compassionate courses I've taken at Yale (1 day extensions could be received without needing to go into detail with reasons, grading was fairly lenient with emphasis on written works being understandable rather than "sounding smart", and although participation was graded, it wasn't forcefully instituted) which I'm sure all of us appreciated given the current global climate and the online nature of the course. Although I understand that group discussions are important for philosophical courses, sometimes it felt as though with 60+ students the discussions could overtake the class and more material could have been covered during that time. Sometimes the questions our small groups or sections were asked to cover were a little too easy to answer and there was some left over time. I did think it was structured well though, with a different theory each day, but I also think some of the "what makes a good experiment" questions were a little too basic for a college level course, and could have been more quickly summarized. I think in that way it could have been more challenging. The TFs were great and the interactions with the chat were great (many professors struggle to keep up with the chat during class so it was nice to have both the TFs and Joanna paying attention to those questions and conversations). <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One strength of this course was the consistent positive attitude espoused by the instructor and TFs. There was never an occasion where Professor Lawson or any individual TF acted in a way that did not consist of kindness, respect, humility, and honesty. In addition, the three independent research assignments were monumental in providing students like myself the ability to apply the concepts learned in class to other mediums of academia, such as a podcast, movie, or novel. I found these reflections to be incredibly fulfilling and intellectually rewarding in my pursuit toward understanding human consciousness. One weakness of the course was the lack of feedback provided on writing assignments. As someone who takes constructive very seriously and attempts to use such feedback to improve future compositions, I found the lack of feedback on reading responses and independent research assignments to be a bit of a disappointment. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One strength of the course was that Joanna asked the students at the beginning to help her form the course so it will be better for us. By asking our advice, the class was more enjoyable because we were able to give our input. It can be improved by adding more interactive activities that allow for collaboration. I know it was difficult this summer because it was all virtual and there were some activities that did this, but I think more would be better. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â All of the teachers were amazing and understanding. The course material itself was all strengths. A good mix of readings and the assignments were perfectly designed to get a better grip of the concepts. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The greatest strength of the course is the definitely the wide array of activities in which we engaged in that helped keep us busy but also engaged in the course actively. The readings were also quite enjoyable and the assignments required work but were very straightforward but varied in scope and enjoyable to do. The TA's were extremely helpful and I never felt frustrated or unclear with anything concerning the assignments.  It was impressive that I was able to enjoy the course as much as I did considering it was online but I was pleasantly surprised. I don't really have any particular weaknesses to address personally. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The class has a great professor, super helpful TAs, and relevant readings. We were also given so many resources to explore the subject more on our own if we want since there is just so much to cover. I do wish we went a bit faster though. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course lie in the variety of concepts explored. Within the limited time-frame of a YSS class, we were able to engage with many theories of consciousness and consider the strengths and weaknesses of each. The in-class discussions were insightful and engaging, and definitely the most enjoyable aspect of this course. The professor's lectures were thorough and well-explained, and the following discussions within our sections (led by the TAs) helped us answer questions and analyze the content in depth. Joanna always made time for discussions after lecture, and encouraged every question or thought presented by students. The class environment was welcoming and friendly, making it easier to engage with others. The TAs were extremely helpful, both in the large lectures by answering questions and engaging in detailed discussions with us, but also in the smaller sections where they helped us collaborate with our classmates and guided us through the questions of the day. The reading responses before each class not only helped us learn the reading material, but also posed interesting questions that required critical thinking to answer. The Independent Research was a pleasurable experience, where I could explore various media relating to consciousness and analyze them. I particularly enjoyed applying the theories we had learned to each piece and finding new questions to explore. This is a class that engages your curiosity as you explore the mysteries of consciousness. It presents no solid answers, but encourages students to consider which theories seem most promising to them. The limitations of this course were only the time-frame of a summer class, I wish we could have had more lectures and tried looking at newer, obscure theories! <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was extremely engaging, and allowed for a variety of learning methods such as lecture based, group activities, personal assignments, reading responses, and independent research. I love the change in teaching styles as it made sure that I could enjoy the course at any given moment. One weakness of this course was difficult speaking in discussions involving the entire class, and this could be improved by placing more time and energy into smaller group discussions. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Well the strengths of this classes are mostly the ones I mentioned above, it brings a lot to our personal development on many aspects not online the knowledge it brings but also on the skills it helps develop. I guess that if I had to name something else I would probably mention the teacher of this class that is incredible: not only does she have one of the most contagious enthusiasm about what she teaches, but she really listens to us and what we think would make the class better, she is always here for your personal development if you have questions even if they are complicated and take time to answer, she finds all the resources necessary to answer and help you... 
To be honest I don't really see that big of a disadvantage this class has, maybe the amount that we were was a little intimidating to participate but then it would have been completely different if we were all in the same room, the situation being exceptional, it is understandable. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was a shame that the course was all online, but it is totally expected and unavoidable during these crazy times! I loved the TA group system so that in the course, I had time to voice my opinions in both small and large group settings. I also loved the mix of discussions and lectures. I think the main weakness came from the imbalance of science and philosophy - I wish we spent a couple more classes on the philosophy aspect of consciousness, as I think that scientific approaches can be studied in ones spare time while philosophy needs a group discussion to fully comprehend an idea. I think this can be done by minimizing the housekeeping on the first day and jumping almost straight into the course (I felt like we barely learned anything the first day). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I took this course during the summer, so it was only 4-5 weeks long, as opposed to a full semester. I felt like we covered a fairly large amount of material, but not as much as a full semester -- though I also don't think it would be physically possible to go through an entire semester's worth of reading and writing. I thought it was nicely paced, challenging but not overwhelming, and really well-organized. One of my favorite aspects of the class was how organized Professor Lawson was, especially in structuring all of our meetings. She always had a really clear schedule about what we would do and when (e.g., lecture at 2:00, small group discussions at 3:00, and so on), but was also willing to change it to allow for discussions and confusions. I also really appreciated the types of assignments we did, including reading responses, short essays, and lots of reading; I felt like I learned a lot of information. The use of Zoom tools was really well done; Professor Lawson utilized slideshows and lectures, Zoom chat, breakout rooms, and Canvas fluidly and in a way that helped my learning. One thing I personally did not love was the chat feature, because I sometimes felt distracted from the main discussion, but I know other students found it useful. I also felt that sometimes when other students answered questions it wasn't clear whether they were correct or not, and I think it would have been more helpful if Professor Lawson had just said, "Not quite, here's why" and not let discussions get quite so derailed. However, she did always make sure to get the right explanation to us at some point, so it wasn't too big a deal. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the course was extremely well structured. The material was all interesting, and the lecture/section balance was pretty good. I think one thing that would have helped (weirdly) would have actually been a little more reading (even if not required). I felt when writing my papers (especially the pro/con and view) that having more than one reading per theory would have helped a bit. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of the course is how well organized the materials are as well as how nicely thought out the lectures are. I can tell that Joanna really took time on course planning, and laid out the materials in a sequence that really helped us maximize our understanding of the sources. Philosophy is very challenging, but Brielle and Joanna were helpful and supportive. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really enjoyed this course so I don't know if I can name any weaknesses. I think maybe if we had more time, I wish we could have gone through each theory a bit more slowly and thoroughly, as I felt behind or lost a couple of times, but it didn't end up being an issue. I liked how the energy for the course was very up beat, the TAs were lovely and excellent at answering questions in the chat box. I loved having PowerPoints during lecture, as that is something I know to be very helpful for me specifically <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The class title is a misnomer, there were two days of reviewing normative/philosophical topics and the rest was spent on descriptive theories. It was much more so a Cognitive Science course than a Philosophy and Cognitive Science course, which is neither a strength or a weakness, but in the future the name should be changed to make that clear. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This is an excellent and comprehensive course. However, I expected more philosophy than neuroscience, even though I understand the purpose and importance of addressing neuroscience. The course concepts have a lot of complicated information to obtain. By extending the program and going over the theories further and relating the theories and concepts to more real-life situations would be helpful to follow. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Joanna gave the perfect balance between group work and lectures, which made the 3 hour sessions much more engaging, and the breaks helped the class remain focused. The small groups and sections allowed me to better understand/explain the readings and theories proposed throughout class. My TF, Josefine, and Joanna both gave me thorough feedback on where my writing/explanations could improve and kept my small group actively engaged in conversation, making sure everyone spoke. Examples and rubrics for the assignments were available to all students, as well as briefly explained in class, so the expectations for each writing piece was clearly communicated. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The main strength of this course was the instruction. Everything was delivered in a way that kept students engaged, especially for such long sessions. Parts of the reading that could be confusing to understand were always cleared up in a satisfying way by the instructors. The TAs were also alway open to meet and were consistently available for the students with clear expectations being communicated by them. The biggest weakness, however, was a lack of difficulty in reading material. While we had multiple papers that needed to be written, I would suspect that the actual amount we were required to read in the class summed up to less than a 100 pages (although I do not know that for certain since I didn't count up the pages). This lead to my understanding of the class material feeling incomplete, as I didn't feel that we read enough to really understand much about the problem of consciousness. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The materials covered in the course are well-chosen, which are challenging but interesting and present a broad picture of what consciousness means from different perspectives. 

A lot of guidance are provided: students know the agenda for the day at the beginning of each class- which outlines the three-hour class in detail and makes it easier to follow- there are in-class notes and powerpoints every day for students to review, the instructor and TFs remind students of assignments coming up and offer a lot of help like having a writing workshop and writing samples, and finally students find themselves connect with other students with small group discussions and with their instructor/TFs, which they can easily reach out to with email or in scheduled office hours. 

The course also effectively keep students engaged with interesting in-class activities, like designing an experiment and coming up with exam questions, thorough lectures in which the instructor clearly dissects the reading in an easy-to-understand way and in a sense of humor, and finally with the assignments that are well scheduled one after another and keep students alarmed all the time in order to be able to finish them well. 

Students receive a lot of feedback from this course which marks their journey in this course. Students have reading responses that check their understanding of each reading, which again keeps them engaged, the instructor actually comments on students' outlines before writing a major assignment and the TF provides detailed feedback for each writing assignment, from understanding of the content to writing skills.

Weakness: no weakness in my opinion. <br/></div>
