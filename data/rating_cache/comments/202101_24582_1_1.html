<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the structure of the seminar could be tweaked. Definitely keep the breakout discussions as those were the part of class I enjoyed and could speak freely and candidly about my thoughts on the film. If the class had followed the breakout room instructions (where there is one speaker to present to the class) I think it would have gone better. Unfortunately,that broke down and it ended up being every single person had to say something to show participation when the questions they were assigned to answer clearly didn't have enough substance to necessitate 4 people talking for 3-5 mins each. I'm not sure the mini presentations by each person in the class gave me anything. The midterm paper having three shorter essays was definitely better than the final paper which I really struggled with as it didn't have a clear question to answer like the midterm did (I'm sure this was done to give us more room to choose a topic we want, but when you don't have any ideas it's hard). <br/></div>
</div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Ive been eagerly awaiting my opportunity to write an unfiltered review. Firstly, I would like to say I found the class material fascinating. At times, the readings came across as overly paranoid, trying to extricate seemingly insidious undertones when none exist, but on the whole, the films and readings provide an interesting perspective on a ubiquitous element of our culture. I also liked my classmates. They were cool people with whom I wouldnt mind taking future classes at Yale.

Unfortunately, these pros dont outweigh the problems. Yale should never offer this class again. 

Why, you may ask? John Garofolo.

He establishes himself as someone who intimately understands the writing process. He frequently cites his experience as a writing instructor for the Coast Guard or as a published author. But I found his own writings to be flawed. His instructions were riddled with grammatical errors (including improper subject-verb agreement and capitalization) and his writing style was akin to something I would have written in an on-demand essay in high school. That is to say, his own simplistic writings would not receive a high grade in his own class.

To be blunt, Garofolo is not a good writer. He insists on formulaic constructions of a thesis statement, for which sophisticated writers and thinkers do not have to be tethered. But further, he sees accurate thesis statements as not truly thesis statements for whatever strange reasons he may have. He pontificates at length in class on supporting arguments and the importance of having an arguable claim. These aphorisms akin to the wrappers in a fortune cookie dont attempt to constructively improve writing. It only boosts his ego in finding rhetorical deficiencies in Yale students. He also cares nothing for writing style. No discussion is made about the benefits of stylistic flare beyond an opening hook which is as banal as it is uncreative. Is there any wonder that his essay arguing that the Coast Guard should be moved to the Department of Defense was never accepted for publication?

Garofolos lack of writing ability raises an interesting question: how can he be called upon to grade his students if he himself is a substandard writer?

Easy! He nitpicks papers based on his own personal opinion on whether he agrees with an argument, and harps on the alleged non-existence of a thesis statement. Quite frankly, he only comprehends the existence of an argument if it was spoon-fed to him in his own writing style. He doesnt care about the points a student justifies. He says he does not expect us to be film critics. Fine! But provide substantive ways for us to improve with actionable goals (dare I say, provide an arguable claim to your own argumentation?).  But instead, he mysteriously held his students to near-insurmountable standards. Of course, he never described how he arrived at his grade determinationshis comments, whenever provided, were sparse and often incorrect to boot! For example, a noun and verb exist as a common homophone in the English language. He made a point of editing my use of the verb, replacing it with the noun! These types of edits made me seriously question how rigorously he graded papers. Beyond this, his comments on papers were frequently condescending, degrading, and wholly detached from the reality of good writing. Im sorry, but he made someone in my smaller group almost cry when discussing their grade because he was so insulting in the comments (which, mind you, lacked any substance). 

I had a terrible experience in this class. I took this to learn more about the world but instead learned of one mans desire to feel superior to his students. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: carefully picked out movies that all brought good discussion to class, breakout rooms for discussions 
Weaknesses: sometimes presenting what we discussed in our groups to the class wasn't as engaging as the class discussions on a certain idea <br/></div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the film list was well developed and this was a strength of the course. I also generally liked the essay assignments and thought our class did a good job building community over Zoom. I also liked the breakout discussions as it allowed us to meet each other. In terms of weaknesses, I thought the essay grading was fairly harsh and confusing and I struggled to really see myself improve across the semester. I felt Prof G had a very specific argument/perspective he was looking for in each essay, and if we strayed from this, we would not do well. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - the level of participation was very high despite us all being on zoom, which was nice. 
Weaknesses - Since we can only watch/discuss a limited number of films in class, students felt disappointed in a few of the movie selections. However, the overall movie selections and supplemental readings were awesome. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Movies were great, format was great, readings were the first time in a seminar Ive taken that i did not feel like they were arbitrarily given just to make students have something to read

Weaknesses: assignment instructions were sometimes unclear <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - the professor knows a lot about the topic, essays really help guide your thinking about the material. 
Weaknesses - too big to be a proper seminar class, breakout rooms could have been shuffled around better. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - good discussion prompts, fun breakout rooms, excellent films for screening 

Weaknesses - occasionally slow to start the real discussion in class <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength is the high engagement level among students.  The 3-4 people breakout room discussions involve everyone in a more intimate setting where you can get to know classmates' interpretations and explanations fairly freely as opposed to the full seminar setting where it is sometimes harder to engage with so many people. 
The weakness could be the hit or miss quality of conversation based on personal convictions on movies and limited weeks to evaluate films. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Great course, organization, selection of films, and engaging discussion and discussion format. One weakness: Professor Garofolo isn't too open to any other ideas or narratives other than the one he has formulated for the course. If students have other perspectives, it is better to deem them as interesting or creative rather than "right" or "wrong". So, it is good to think outside of the box, especially with such an interesting course that invites unconventional discussion. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the class was well organized and executed, with interesting content and movies I would not have otherwise watched. For example, I love the movie In Harm's Way, and definitely would not have picked it up on my own had I not watched it for class. Granted, the rest of the class voted to cut this particular one, but the overarching point of my comment stands. The class already gave feedback about specific movie and reading choices to the Professor during our last class. One thing I would say is that for a student who plans ahead and does not procrastinate, this class can be a bit hard to plan for. Readings are often not posted until three of four days in advance, not the customary week, and readings are changed or added with less than three days notice, sometimes the day before. I felt bad bugging Professor Garofolo on weekends about readings, but I had full days on Monday and Tuesday (starting at 5:50AM) and my preference was to get work done for this class (which met Wednesday) on Friday or Saturday. The movies though were posted in advance for the entire term, and extras were posted as well to supplement our essays or just to watch for fun, which was great. Overall, I really enjoyed this class and appreciated the opportunity. <br/></div>
