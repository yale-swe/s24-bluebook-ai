<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The problem sets were very well designed for understanding all the material. Good introduction to a lot of different topics in CS while still keeping it somewhat cohesive. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: focused on basic programming concepts. Racket isn't a complicated language so I could focus on understanding the concepts rather than trying to learn its grammar.
Weakness: The live sessions are often a repetition of recorded lectures. I think the live lectures would be better utilized if they are more devoted to example problems. I also feel like some of the more complicated concepts were not explained very clearly, e.g. machine von Neumann and its different parts. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The weakness is Racket and the scope of things being learned is too broad. In my opinion, it would be better to focus on less things and dive deeper into some of the concepts. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths were that a lot of important information was covered and the Peer Tutoring Hours were always very well run and very helpful. A weakness was that sometimes the lectures were a bit confusing and the homeworks weren't explained very well or very well connected to what was being taught. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: a good overview of the basics and introduction to data structures/algorithms. 
Weakness: I really did not enjoy the oral section of the exam although I could see the necessity for it during a virtual format. Psets are not collaborative but are a reasonable amount of work. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The main strength of this course were the 7 psets. They were useful for consolidating ideas and more importantly a joy to complete.
The teaching style was overall effective, but due to the lack of a textbook and the large list of at times disparate topics, this class was more of an overview of a bunch of different ideas. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â As everyone says, the language is useful , but the psets are quite fun and the workload is fair. The first two exams were an insane time crunch, and most people were unable to finish. Then the third exam was a cakewalk. So be prepared for that. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Overall a pretty good introduction to college programming, not too much of a difficult class if you've had some prior high school experience with computer science

Weaknesses: Felt like the live lectures didn't really teach much material compared to the recorded lectures, so the recorded lectures were the main source of learning. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I'm copying-and-pasting from question 11 here: My biggest issue with this course is the tests--the tests were 10-12 questions each with 50 minutes to do them, giving 5 minutes or less to write, test, and copy a working Racket procedure for each question. Then you have 5 minute oral exams...I don't understand why they tested us this way, there's no time to think in either scenario. On top of that they switched the weight of assignments and exams in the middle of the semester without any announcement. 

I also had some trouble with the way the questions were worded, which may just have been a personal thing, but most of the time I went to office hours was just to clarify what the instructions were asking for because I didn't understand the way they were worded. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really enjoyed the PSETS! I think they were great, except for the fact that in the beginning psets, there was often one question that was exceedingly difficult for seemingly no reason. I think that needs to be adjusted. I understand wanting to challenge us, but that sort of challenge should come in the later psets, not in the beginning when the learning curve is really steep and people are freaking out and spending 5-6 hours on a single problem. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The live sessions frequently felt like a repetition of the pre-record, and it felt unnecessary for them to be small. The course would have been better if we just had one large lecture section that included both the contents of the pre-record, then break out rooms to go over what we typically did in live section. This would have made it more engaging. Additionally, the time management for the lectures could be improved. However, the was sufficient help and time to complete psets and all the materials were easily accessible making it easy to review materials and study for tests. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Racket, because it forced me to learn how to use recursion effectively. The ULAs were also an invaluable resource, and the "Review with Rob" sessions were a lifesaver.

Weaknesses: Also Racket, because literally no one uses it outside of this course. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The live lectures were only 25 minutes long, so they were often used as supplements to the prerecorded lectures. However, we often did not get through all of the examples in the live lectures and I think that sticking with a 50 minute lecture would have been more productive. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Give a warning beforehand on how the exams will be tight on time <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weaknesses -- recorded lectures were not very well-explained. Often time instructor just read the slides, especially in the computer architecture unit. I had to rewatch recorded lectures more than 2-3 times to get a full understanding of the concepts. <br/></div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - psets and review workshops
Weaknesses - time constraint on exams were very difficult and I wish there was more practice in reinforcing concepts during the live lecture <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weaknesses: The split lecture format was really weird and made it hard to keep up with the class. I really would have preferred for it to be one or the other. It ended feeling like shorter vaguer lectures and then office hours. The split class was also really weird; I get it was for the interest in time but it made class sessions short. Also, the test format was just personally not very enjoyable. As a person without a strong STEM background, how intensely timed the tests were made it really difficult to get things done even if I already knew the answer because I'm a slow test taker. The third midterm, although closed book was a lot better. My suggestion for the future is to maybe throw in a couple more multiple choice if the tests are going to be so short. 
Strengths: Virtual office hours was really successful. The recorded lectures were easy enough to understand. The provided files and resources were also really great for review. <br/></div>

Overall, learning was incredibly boring the way this was taught. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Characteristic of Yale, more theory-focused and you will struggle to see immediate applications of your skills.

Biggest potential difficulties:
- Class is graded on a CURVE
- Problem sets have extra test cases and so you could be caught with a lower grade than expected
- MIDTERMS will determine your grade by quite a large factor, so be sure to study. The second midterm in particular was quite challenging for many students. <br/></div>

The homework assignments took a fair amount of time to complete, but I found that they somewhat felt like a separate entity to the lectures and exams. While I understand that the instructors wished to engage in smaller groups of students and chose to split the class into four groups, I believe that a weakness of the course was this structure. Each live lecture was only 25 minutes long which was insufficient for the instructors to fully explain concepts for students. Often times, it was difficult to finish covering all of the material in that short time limit. <br/></div>

This class could have taken advantage of a programming language like C which would have proved to be more useful moving forward.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Very well organized in my opinion - I really liked how there was a prerecorded lecture and then more discussion-based synchronous part. This allowed us to learn the new stuff at our own pace and then get to apply it in the live sessions. The problem sets were fair in terms of difficulty and I found them very interesting.

Weaknesses: I know this is just how the course is designed but it did feel strange sometimes, because the Racket programming didn't have any immediate applications. I now know that's the point of the course, because you have to learn to adapt to whatever new language comes your way as a computer scientist, but clearly this is not what you're looking for if you want an intro to coding (go to CPSC 100 ("CS50") for that) and I'm not sure they make that clear enough in the course description. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I thought the problem sets were all very well-made and conducive to learning, and I generally enjoyed the class format.
Weaknesses: The way of accessing office hours through one-to-one appointments (which I'm assuming was to maintain the "no collaboration on psets" rule - a rule I do think was helpful for my learning because this is an introductory class but also felt quite restricting) discouraged me from asking for help. This one isn't quite a weakness, but our first homework assignment placed emphasis on computer science as a humanities class, and there was an effort to work that in through talking about CS history in recorded lectures, but I think that if this course professes to care about this, the homework should also include humanities-oriented sections. Finally, I feel that the psets could have better prepared us for exams by having more theory as well as just coding. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course covered a wide variety of topics giving us a view of the computer science field as a whole. However, due to the virtual format, the course was not particularly engaging. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: really covers a lot of ground with fundamental computer science concepts. Even as someone with a lot of higher-level programming experience, there was still a lot I didn't know about lower-level CS theory. So the breadth of 201 is a huge strength. Having a live lecture section in addition to short lecture videos was helpful for asking questions and for overall engagement. The programming assignments were very well designed, especially when it comes to building simulators of Turing machines or assembly code, which was a great way to put into practice these models which often stay theoretical (and Racket was a great choice of language to accomplish this).
Weaknesses: some of the exam questions can be better written and better formatted. Canvas never quite worked very well for writing code on exams. The time limits can be very restrictive and slightly unnecessary. otherwise this course is pretty solid. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The biggest strength is Professor Rushmeier. She is very nice and willing to teach. The biggest weakness is the office hours. I lined up for hours before a ULA comes. Then, the ULA either doesn't know how to answer my questions or doesn't finish helping me before leaving. Sometimes, I even suddenly get deleted from the queue without any ULA coming to help. Joyce Wu keeps avoiding my questions and says that she has to help other people in the queue as an excuse to abandon me, even if there is nobody else left in the queue. When I questioned that, she ignored me and left my zoom immediately. After many times, I think she actually doesn't know how to answer my question. Because of ULAs like her, I felt so lost, frustrated, and helpless. I'm writing all this not to blame anyone, but to let the Yale computer science department know that in order to encourage students pursuing computer science, they should pick the right ULAs. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Using Racket is both a strength and a weakness. Racket is not commonly used in the industry, so it may seem "irrelevant". But it forces the student to adapt to a new language they probably never seen before. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Interesting material and psets
Weakness: We consistently ran over the allotted time for the 25 minute live lecture or didn't get to discuss everything that we wanted to from the pre-recorded lecture. We would also usually rush through the material we did cover because of this time constraint. 

Making the live lecture a longer portion of the allotted class time would allow more content from the pre-recorded lecture to be discussed in more depth. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The autograding feature provided confidence to homework problems.

The course offers little help from the instructors and it is left to the undergraduate learning assistants to help students understand the content. There is also no feedback at all for what was done incorrectly, either on homework or exams. <br/></div>

Weaknesses: Some of the material is not taught as well as the other topics in my opinion (specifically the unit with logic circuits and some of the von Neumann architecture), and Racket isn't the most useful language. Also, the exams go by super quickly. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professors seemed invested in moving the class to the virtual setting.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the problem sets were a strong point as they always required one to think and come up with a variety of solutions to many different problems.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class covers really important material, necessary for any computer science major. The psets were also very well done despite being quite challenging and time consuming.

However, the three midterms were very definitely a time crunch and hard to do well on. This year especially, we had lots of issues regarding the midterms because they were administered asynchronously through Canvas. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would like to see more collaboration between peers. I'm not sure if I entirely understood why we completed the homework with absolutely no collaboration. I think being able to bounce ideas off of students would enrich the learning experience in homework sets.  
The timing for tests also felt very short. My coding background was limited, so this crunched time feeling could also just be a result of me needing more coding practice. Nevertheless, I feel that more time would help students do better on the tests. 

The avenues for help, like office hours, discussion posts, and CS201 email were always quick to answer. The class was also extremely well-structured in that everything felt like it was building on top of each other and even with my limited background I never felt extremely lost. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the workload is fair, supplemental notes are provided for many lectures, and office hours are extremely helpful in getting you over pset problems where you're stuck.

Weaknesses: I didn't think there were many. However, the second midterm an outlier for almost everyone and much harsher than other assignments. Some questions on the test required justification, or no credit would be given. This was the first time we had done any written problem of the sort where we were expected to fully write out our reasoning: it would have been helpful if we had more practice problems where it was clear how much justification we actually needed to provide. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The problem sets of the course were very engaging and were very useful in understanding what was taught through lectures. Besides, the instructors and peer tutors also provided valuable help when preparing for exams and solving the problem sets.

Weaknesses: There seemed to be a lack of coordination and organization between the faculty members heading this course. For all three exams, students had to ask for a review session a few days prior to the exam dates instead of the instructors directly communicating with one another and making it happen. In addition, the live sessions were very short. Most of the time, we were not able to even get through what was planned for the day. We were also not able ask some questions due to time constraints, and sometimes, insufficient responses were provided. Besides, the exams were poorly designed as they were Canvas quizzes with very limited amount of time given to complete them. More often than not, these exams seemed to be aimed at getting as many students wrong as possible, instead of actually testing their understanding. I was able to see previous exams from past years online, and the time limit as well as the questions given on those exams were much better and more reasonable. I understand that this drop in the quality of exams may be due to COVID-19, remote learning and as an effort to prevent cheating. However, I still believe that it could have been done better. The weights given to each question could have been more reasonable. The exams could also have been administered live through Zoom calls (like other classes) without having to compromise the amount of weight given to each question and the amount of time given to solve each question (like the exams from previous years). <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: All the lectures are recorded so you can always go back and rewatch them. The class was split into smaller groups. The homework prepared well for exams and I learned a bulk of the class through the homework

Weakness: Because the class was split and different groups had different profs, sometimes there would be explanations or things one group gets ahead and learns while the other doesn't. The fact that we also couldn't work with students on the homework also made the class a bit difficult. Many times I would get stuck on how to approach a problem and talking with my peers would have helped me get started on them. I also think being able to work with others means you get to learn different ways to approach coding an algorithm, so it was disappointing to learn that there is a strict no collaboration policy in the class. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength is it covers a lot of different areas, so it's comprehensive. The weakness is, personally, I think that the material isn't that interesting. Maybe it's because the fundamentals are always a bit boring, but overall I feel like I wasn't solving challenging problems, and I did not come out of this course with a sense of accomplishment. I know this course isn't coding based, but I would like to code/build something interesting throughout the semester. Also, in homework, I often get points deducted for marginal cases that aren't mentioned in the homework, which is annoying. <br/></div>
