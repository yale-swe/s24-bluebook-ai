<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course has so much potential because it covers such an interesting period and civilization. That said, there was what seemed to be a complete lack of organization and a disconnect between the professors and students. For example, the professors refused to post lecture slides prior to the lectures out of fear that it would incentivize students to skip lecture. This made no sense to me, and I found it to be quite the opposite. I would rather skip the live lecture and watch the recording with the slides in front of me than watch the live lecture with no slides. It made lectures incredibly difficult to follow. Additionally, there was no clear purpose to each lecture, as they all went off on tangents about specific artifacts. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The class was fairly straightforward in terms of what it required of students. Although lectures at times felt haphazard, with the information in lecture not always aligning with what the professors wanted us to internalize about a given topic. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weakness, some of the lectures seem to cover events randomly. As a student who has never taken an Egyptian history class before I found I learnt a lot more from the textbook than the lectures as the information in lectures was not always chronological. It took me a while to wrap my head around the chronology of the events we covered. I think the course also tries to cover way too much history within such a short class. We covered nearly 3,500 years worth of history within the class, and were expected to know the information and historical context of most of the kings, monuments, and events from this timeline which was very difficult to remember for the final exam. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The content of the class itself is really interesting, and the lectures were quite pleasant (despite the fact that they completely lacked organization). I looked forward to going to class each week, and I could feel the passion of the professors and appreciated their dedication to teaching us. The papers we wrote also felt feasible and were not graded too harshly. That being said, the class would have maintained this pleasant nature had it not been for the final exam. This consisted of several essay questions, and although the exam on the day-of was not terrible, the preparation for it was a huge undertaking given the chaotic manner in which the class had been taught throughout the semester. In order to improve this aspect of the class, I would say that the professors should consider making the exam open note, as I do not think my memorization of the topics aided in my understanding of ancient Egyptian history. It would also be more fair, in my opinion, to give us less potential essay questions on the study guide. While this guide was super helpful and definitely necessary, preparing for all fourteen essay questions (when only about 5 were on the exam) seemed like a waste of time after the exam was done. Going back to the lectures and class content, I think the class could be improved by moving chronologically through the course or thematically. The professors attempted to do both  first giving us a whirlwind tour through all 4,000 of Egyptian history followed by scattered thematic lectures. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength of this course is the integration of lots of different types of sources, like literature and art along with material history. However, it was really difficult to tell which details were important and make sense of the sheer breadth of the history we cover. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: v gutty/low maintenance  only a couple of short papers and a final exam that we had all the questions for beforehand. Some of the info was interesting. The profs are nice. Section was helpful
Weaknesses: tries to do too much at once. You cannot fit 4000 years of history into one semester. I constantly felt like we were learning irrelevant details instead of overarching themes. No one went to the lecture because it was kind of useless but it was better than the textbook, an archaeological text that was incredibly dense and spent way too much time explaining the measurements of various tombs. A bit disorganized and it felt like we were never given a foundational explanation of ancient Egyptian ideology before descending into the minutiae of the various states. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Lectures were engaging and the course gave a good overview to ancient Egyptian history. However, I felt like too much history was covered during the semester, forcing us to just skim over a lot of what could have been really interesting information. The readings also tended to be a bit dense, but they always felt useful (especially when we went over certain primary sources in section.) <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course did a good job of dividing lectures between broad overviews of ancient Egyptian history and more specific, thematic focuses. This allowed for the course to cover ancient Egyptian history in a semester without only covering over three millennia of political history. 

At times I felt the course was focusing too heavily on archaeology rather than history, but overall this did not detract too much from the course as the two subjects are closely linked when studying ancient Egypt. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Cannot think of either; had no incentive to show up to class. I went the first lecture and got bored. Should've dropped when I had the chance. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The final exam was a weakness in my opinion. I feel as though I wouldve learnt much more towards the end if I was able to write a cumulative final paper with proper sources and outside information, rather than just cramming for a final exam that expected us to know a large range of topics. Besides the final exam, I absolutely loved the class. The lectures were a strength, Prof. Manning and Moeller were very passionate and enthusiastic about what they taught and it made learning very fun. I hope they restructure the final to be a longer essay and not a timed exam - I think students would get a lot more out of it. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The biggest strength of the course were the two professors, who were both very kind and inviting. The biggest weakness is that the information was taught a little too fast, and it was really difficult to absorb the content going at that pace. <br/></div>

-pretty interesting content

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I felt that this course was not very well structured and I felt that it was difficult to pinpoint what exactly we were learning as the information we got was quite scattered. It was difficult to follow lecture as we were covering so much ground but not in a well defined way. Because of this we would spend time in sections going over any confusions. This aspect of section was helpful, but it took away from what we were actually meant to be discussing during section. This meant that some things on the syllabus (like the key objects) often went undiscussed. Additionally, we would sometimes have extra reading or work sprung on us fairly last minute (less than 2 days in advance) when there was no mention of it in the syllabus. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the professors were engaging and clearly excited about the material. It was fun to have guest lecturers too. It also worked great having two professors, and I enjoyed the casual conversation style they had.
Weaknesses: the course was a bit weirdly organized and it could be confusing between lectures, knowing how it was all tied together. We were also expected to know a lot of strange details. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The biggest strength of the course was the two professors. Professor Mueller and Professor Manning were both super knowledgeable about the topics discussed in class and very receptive to student feedback. They also complimented each other nicely with one of them being more focused on Egypt and the other being a great historian generally. The biggest weakness of the course was that sometimes lectures could be difficult to follow. There was so much information, and I felt that sometimes lectures moved to fast between topics to where I was not able to take everything in. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course material was interesting and lectures were generally informative. One weakness would be that assignments and our grade wasn't directly related to class lectures and we sometimes had to rush through class lectures. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength was that we were able to learn a wide variety of stuff, and the professors are very engaged with the course materials and always come to lecture very excited to speak and teach. They bring a lot of enthusiasm to the course, and often make it feel like telling stories rather than listing of facts. 
The weakness was a bit of disorganization and confusion. Throughout the course, it was tough to follow how we were progressing through topics, and what we were supposed to be gaining from lectures. There were lots of readings and lecture covered a huge amount of info, so it was tough to pull out main concepts. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course had some really excellent moments. In particular, the guest lectures were engaging, and some of the discussions of artifacts were as well. However, it felt like most of the time we were fed facts without much connection or analysis. I walked away from this course knowing little more about Egypt than I did before it began, and the syllabus didn't really live up to its promises. Lectures seemed really disjoint, and there was little focus on constructing a historical narrative. Moreover, the assignments felt completely unrelated to the work we did in class, and I felt like I learned more writing the papers than I did from any of the class readings. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â for whatever reason the professors taught the entire history of egypt in the first six weeks and then spent the last six weeks covering individual topics related to egypt. while it was nice to learn about those random topics, the first six weeks felt very rushed to cover the entire history of egypt. <br/></div>
