<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is exceptional. The singular complaint I have is that it was online and thus inherently less interactive. Brad is an incredible professor who has developed a system and style that stick with students for long after the class has ended. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor is extremely knowledgeable and very engaging, always keeps the class interesting and fun. Course content is very interesting, current and relevant.
Weaknesses: Feedback for assignments is delayed considerably. <br/></div>
</div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I definitely got enough out of the class, but would have benefited from doing all the readings. Strength: Brad is very engaging and energetic. He's not the typical Yale lecturer. Weakness: you don't get back any graded assignment until the very end. Not sure if it's just me, but I haven't gotten back the reading responses, nor my midterm grade yet, and it's reading week. Another weakness is that the readings are a bit much, although Brad points out which ones are absolutely necessary and which ones you can skim. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - Brad is a very, very smart man who says random one-liner pearls of wisdom that you will likely remember for the rest of your life.
Weaknesses - Literally everything else. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Brad, his teaching, and the class discussions. Weaknesses: took a while to return grades and provide feedback on written assignments. <br/></div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths are definitely the professor (although he will try to convince you that you shouldn't take the class if he's "too much" for you). This course also introduces you to law in a way that I feel most political science courses fail to (even though this is a CPSC course). One weakness is that this scam of a school refuses to give him more TAs so we never get grades back (not Brad's fault). I didn't receive graded feedback until after the last class of the semester. The midterm also kinda ruined my halloween (I know, corona, but it is my favorite holiday and was supposed to be my one escape from this hellhole) so that was sad so maybe if it was not over halloweekend I would have had a better time. This isn't really a strength or a weakness but THIS IS NOT A GUT! The readings take a while! <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Bear in mind I was digital b/c of COVID-19:

Weakness: Zoom lectures are inherently terrible--they kill all sense of live sharing of space, and draining and hellish. but that's not Brad's fault. 

Strength: Brad. He makes the material engaging and interesting. I have no desire to be a lawyer, and this class (read: Brad) makes me reconsider it. He is a phenomenal professor, and I wish i could've taken it with him live.  To any prospective students, Take this class. If you're able to wait to take it in person, do it then. If not you will still learn a lot. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Entertaining, insightful, fun
Weaknesses: No grades, have no idea how you're doing in the course, unbearable amount of weekly reading <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of the course are the useful examples Brad provides when teaching the legal concepts. He can explain complex ideas in a way that makes them more manageable to understand. However, I felt like this course did not have enough support. There were limited office hours and no feedback was given on any of the graded assignments. It was very hard to know how I was doing in the class and what I could do to improve my performance. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures were terrific but feedback was insanely slow and hindered my ability to improve the analytical skills with which I engaged course materials. <br/></div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Material is cool, instructor is lively and engaging, workload is manageable. Only possible improvement would be more timely feedback. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I learned so much in such a short period of time, Brad is extremely smart and explains things very well.
Weaknesses: the Zoom format made it harder to participate in class <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the material is highly relevant and I found it pretty interesting. Learning the legal basis behind tech innovation, privacy, censorship, etc. is a very powerful tool and something that everybody should understand. 
Weaknesses: it is possibly the most poorly organised class ever. We didn't get a single reading response grade all semester, and we only got the midterm grade during finals period. We had no information at all about the final project, and it was eventually made optional. Readings were posted on Sunday evening for Monday class, giving us no time to write reading responses. Also, the midterm was ABSURD. It was a take-home essay question format, and the word limit was 7000 WORDS. This is not an exaggeration. Most people wrote over 5000 words, and that was definitely the necessary amount. The readings are also absurdly long, but you can skim them/not do all of them. 

Brad warns you that you should take this class only if you like his personality -- and he is absolutely right. If you are not a fan of his teaching style and personality, you will regret taking the class. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Brad is the strength of this course -- he is an incredible lecturer and instructor and does a great job at coaxing out individual opinions from students (which I think is a big deal, when most courses just want students to understand the material and write good papers). His hypotheticals really made me question my own opinions and the law as a whole. One weakness of this course, however, is its lack of organization. Nothing was ever posted on Canvas, and no grades or comments were ever returned to me, until the last week of classes. Readings were posted on a separate website, but there were a ridiculously large amount of them and it took me forever to get through them. I bet a lot of other students didn't even read half of them, as they were not required readings for the most part. I mostly embraced the disorganization, but there were definitely some moments (for example, the final reading responses are due at the end of the semester and only a few weeks before the end did I find out that we could only write one per week... there was some frantic writing going on!) where I felt more than a little stressed from the disorganization of the course. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The biggest strength of the course is the content. The topics covered in the course are very interesting. Brad is also a great professor. The biggest weakness of the course is the lack of structure. Lectures can be hard to follow at times, and grades are not returned in a timely manner. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â We received no feedback at all on any course work the entire semester. I had no clue how I was doing on assignments, and therefore couldnt have done anything to improve them if I was missing the mark. Considering we turned in a midterm and at least 5 papers, I find this utterly ridiculous. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class and its material are very interesting, and the professor was extremely charismatic and engaging. Unfortunately, the courses setup does not transition well to a virtual format. Student engagement was less than ideal, and a handful of highly interactive students led the majority of the discussions. The class benefitted strongly from the virtual format by creating a relevant scenario in which cross-internet relationships matter. 

Overall, one of the biggest cruxes of this course is that it relies on high student engagement, by virtue of being centered around student discourse. It is hard to form these relationships virtually, and a tangible effect this had was the ultimate cancellation of the final project since it usually was done in groups that had naturally formed throughout the course of the semester. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Interesting readings, a good mix of pop-culture readings and actual legal information.

Weaknesses: I never received feedback on any work until after the end of semester.  I still don't have any feedback on any of reading responses.  The class lacks structure. There is no roadmap (like most classes have) dividing the class into chewable sections. It's all one big cluster of info. This made it difficult to study for the midterm. The professor never asked for mid-semester feedback to correct any of this. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of the class was that it was easy to digest. The various readings and videos we used were very memorable and funny (a lot of them being comedic parodies), so I made a lot of flashbulb memories of the material in this course. The weakness of this class is that it is difficult to execute online. A lot of the hypothetical situations were made awkward by the lack of participation and awareness you couldn't really see how other people reacted to a given situation, so it was hard to start discussions. Despite this, I also argue that the online-only format lended some strength to the class, allowing people to easily share files or XKCDs to the class that they enjoyed and found relevant, and the fact that videos and online media were easier to present in an online only format made the class transition much more smoothly. 
The lack of interaction was the greatest weakness of this course. Besides student-student interaction and professor-student interaction in the class, I had no way to gauge how much I actually knew in the course. We wrote response papers that we never got feedback on, and our midterm was returned weeks after it was due. The lack of feedback on the response papers (i.e. something that could gauge how much we understood the material) interfered with my midterm as I had no idea as to how confident I should be about the material on the exam or where I was neglecting other information. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I can't really comment on the strengths and weaknesses of the course because this year was so weird. Some of the memes were stale, which I get is necessary, but also like a FIVE minute youtube video from 2011 is not always easy to enjoy. <br/></div>
