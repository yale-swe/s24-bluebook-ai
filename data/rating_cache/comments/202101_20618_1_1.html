<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The recorded lectures were very clear and helpful. It was also very easy to ask questions via Ed Discussion. I just wish we had gotten more practice problems to prepare for the types of problems we might see on the quizzes, but overall it was a great class and very well taught! <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The teaching team was fantastic! They were super accessible and easy to talk to, but I feel like they did little to accommodate other time zones in terms of office hour times. This is obviously a COVID concern, and hopefully will not be a concern in future semesters. Other than that, all the TFs and instructors were awesome. I loved the set up of quizzes and homeworks and it made the whole course very manageable and stress-free. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The videos were good and so were the discussions. The final project could be communicated better. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - the dropped discussion section, homework, and quiz grade. those really came in clutch. additionally, having an open note policy for all the quizzes was so nice. the embedded quizzes and due dates for the lectures motivated me to actually watch them on time and pay attention. having the slides printable was also helpful. 
Weaknesses - having the benchmark and pset due the same day. I'd suggest having one due on friday and the other due on Saturday. other than that, I can't really think of any other weaknesses. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I feel like the course set up was effective and beneficial to me because it gave me flexibility when I wanted to watch the lectures if I was particularly busy one day. I feel like the way the final project was set up was helpful as well and made sure we were not flooded by work at the end of the course. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weaknesses are that the lectures are asynchronous, it was difficult to stay engaged. Strengths: the peer tutors' office hours really helped a lot with understanding the concepts and reviewing material for the quiz! <br/></div>

<b></b>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course overall is very strong. The quizzes were conceptual, so studying for them helped to grasp the concepts that I couldn't simply gain from a textbook reading. Also, the enrichment sections held by Prof Loreng went a long way in helping me cement my knowledge. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought lectures and sets and discussion were quite good. I was disappointed in the final project not be clearly tied into the course at all points and teh lack of mentorship I got. <br/></div>

Weaknesses: The quiz questions are obscure and stray away from scientific convention to prove youre a scientist who truly understands the concept. There have been times where the quizzes flaunted questions that were the OPPOSITE of normal convention. Another issue is the faux focus on explanation and open-ended quiz questions. Several questions on the quizzes are multiple choice with little recourse for partial credit. Very few of the questions end up being explanation based. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Of course, there is always the difficulty of online recorded formats being daunting to get through each week.

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I think that the bulk of professors for this course (especially Prof. Koelle who was my favorite!) were extremely knowledgeable and always willing to help students out. The recorded lecture format was very accessible to work at my own pace, and the lessons were very smooth and well-explained. I also think that there were a tremendous amount of opportunities to improve grades for this course through assignments other than quizzes!
Weaknesses: Firstly, the information, modules, videos, PSETS, benchmarks, and files were FAR too all over the place compared to my other courses  some centralization would be appreciated. While I appreciated the vast array of professors, I think it made the lectures incredibly inconsistent, and thus, I would say that having 4 professors was actually a weakness for this course. Additionally, not all professors were created equally, obviously, so some were definitely kinder and more willing to admit mistakes than others. Also, the workload for this course, along with most .5 credit courses at Yale, was FAR too much for credit we received. The final project seemed a little like busy work, but not having an exam was certainly preferable, so I really cannot complain about that. And lastly, there always seemed to be a problem with the synchronous quizzes, which was incredibly frustrating. <br/></div>

The homework problems and final project, including the benchmarks, supplemented learning in lecture, and helped improve student's performance on quizzes. One of the weakness of this course was the discrepancies between the teaching of the various instructors, as well as the lack of a clear grading policy, which should have been presented in the syllabus. <br/></div>

The quizzes and homework were also pretty easy if you watched the lectures (even if you didn't do the textbook readings), and they didn't have gotcha questions. Not having a final was also nice. 

Weaknesses: Writing the short essays for the final project was a drag, and it took a while for them to give feedback on homework.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Since all the lectures were pre-recorded last term, it would have been helpful if the professors had released all of them and allowed us to work through them at our own pace. The lectures were released on Monday and we had to finish watching them on Wednesday, which gave us fewer options for spreading out the work than if we were able to work ahead (or even had the weekend to start watching them).

The word limits for the short answer responses on quizzes were sometimes quite restrictive. While I agree that the ability to explain a concept concisely can be a sign of true understanding, the 30-50 word limits meant that I often spent far more time cutting down my answers than thinking about the actual concepts. It became an exercise in tweaking sentence structure, which seemed less valuable to me than the content of my answer. It was also a strange that the sample answers were often far longer to the allocated word limit. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The entire teaching team is so helpful and this course provides a great introduction to complex biological topics. Also, the course was focused on teaching rather than grading which was so important to me. Also preparing the final project was a challenging yet fulfilling experience. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was phenomenally adapted to the virtual format. The weekly synchronous quizzes ensured that students were still learning the material while the transition of the final exam to a final project alleviated stress for students. The discussion sections each week were also a good "check-in" point that helped to make sure all students were still on track. This class provided immense amounts of student support and accommodation. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weekly quizzes are great because they push students to keep up with the material! Benchmarks for final project could get redundant at times. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of course is that with pre-recorded lectures it allows you to pace yourself each week as to when you watch the lectures to learn the information. While the course was recorded lectures, there were still synchronous Zoom oppportunities to interact with the professors and ask questions. The only weakness was that I felt some weeks the lectures were very long and draining to watch, not being in a class-setting, which made it a little more difficult to fully learn the information. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Many quiz questions had word limits that were way to short (30 words) to convey an answer in full which was difficult to do. The sample answers themselves were over the limit. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think that this course can provide more ways for everyone to participate in discussion section--sometimes it was just one person from a group who was able to talk. One strength was that there was support on ed discussion. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The class is really well organized. There is a weekly schedule that almost never changes, so it is really easy to develop a study/work routine. 

There is variety in how the different professors explain things or would like the students to explain things in our homeworks, which led to some discrepancies. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I found this class to be significantly better than I was expecting.  Strengths are that the recorded lecture videos were well-structured and content was generally explained clearly.  Although teaching styles varied, I sort of enjoyed seeing different professors in each video.  The final project, although it took up a lot of time, pushed me to think more about the ways in which Bio 101 concepts relate to the world around us.  I appreciated the option to choose our own proteins of interest.  For example, I am not much interested in human/cell biology, so I did my project on biodegradable plastic, a topic that aligns more closely with my intended field of study.  Also, I appreciated the weekly quiz format instead of having a midterm and/or final.  It allowed me to synthesize much more information without being stressed about memorization.  Weaknesses weren't significant, but I wish that some of the quiz questions were more clear and that not as much readings were assigned (watching lectures + discussion section + textbook readings + paper readings + problem sets + weekly project benchmarks + studying for the quiz took up a lot of time each week). <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course were the detailed lectures.

One weakness in this course could be the lack of information on the upcoming quiz. Maybe a small heads up on what would be on the next quiz would allow students to understand what they should focus on. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One strength of the course is that being asynchronous makes it more accessible for those in different time zones. I think that this course would benefit from having explanations to answers in the quiz so that students can understand their potential shortcomings. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was very engaging and had very easy to follow lectures that were a good length. The discussion sections found ways to apply what was being learned in lectures and applying it to real life research. The final project was also very fun in that it was nice to research something of interest while finding ways to apply lecture content. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I personally really enjoyed the format of the course because I learn best at my own pace. Even though all of the material was learned through pre-recorded lectures, the discussion section provided a balanced amount of engagement for the course. The grading and formatting was very reasonable, despite having so many people taking the course. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Within the context of this year's learning environment, a strength in the course was the prerecorded lectures. It meant that we could watch them on our time and at our own pace, and if we missed anything that one of the lecturers said, we could rewind and watch the lecture again. I also think the introduction to scientific literature was a helpful component, but it might have been more useful to read through more contemporary literature that does follow the modern standard format. There were not many glaring weaknesses to this course. I think that some more enrichment content throughout the recorded lectures would have been nice in breaking up the monotony of the lectures. I believe the largest weakness to this course was the strict word limits to some of the quiz questions. While I understand the need for a word limit, the limit was often so strict that I could not get my ideas properly expressed, and I think that the word limits should be more expanded for next year's quizzes. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked the online forum where we could ask questions. That was very helpful. Also taking quizzes that were ungraded helped me learn. <br/></div>
