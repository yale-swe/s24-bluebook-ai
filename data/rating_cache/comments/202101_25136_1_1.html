<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Having two star professors teach such a course was a real privilege. I was hanging from every single thing that Professor Christakis was saying. He was by far the most engaging lecturer I have ever had at Yale. Professor Nordhaus was also really good but certainly did not have the same command of speech as Professor Christakis. Still the conversations and engagements I had with both will remain with me well after my Yale years are over. The course is worth it only to get to meet these two amazing people. I feel like I have learned genuinely interesting information that is going to be useful in my understanding of global current events. 

Weaknesses: Even though the lectures were great, I cannot say the same for the 3 psets we had. They were really disorganized and I felt very lost every time I began solving one. For the next iteration of the course Professor Nordhaus should try to give students more guidance on the things they have to do and also try to make the math more straightforward. I felt like they were unnecessarily complicated and difficult. I had to exchange so many emails with the TA every single time only to get a basic understanding of what we were supposed to do. It should not be this way. 

On the other hand, the weakness from the part of Professors Christakis were the lecture slides. Even though he is an amazing speaker, his slides were very rudimentary and missed most of the things he discussed. This meant that we had to go back during exams and re-listen to the lectures in order to study. If this course is offered again he should make an effort to have more complete slides. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the subject matter of the class is sooo interesting and applicable right now. Nordhaus and Christakis are clearly very knowledgeable about their respective topics, and it was eye-opening to hear a bit from such experts! Section was also great, Simon cleared up some topics and made a lot of connections between the two. Overall the quizzes and psets were fair.

Weaknesses: Christakis was not very compassionate towards the needs of the students. We had an assessment scheduled the day after a break day, and two days after the death of Rachel, and it was not moved. He did not even address the loss experienced by the Yale community in class at all. It was very difficult for me, and I can imagine for other students, to have space to mourn but also have to focus on studying for an assessment immediately after, not to mention it was already not supposed to be held the day after a break day! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â At first, there was too much lecture and little time allocated to questions. This did change as the course progressed. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the small class size was the best part of this course. I hope that in future years, both professors can offer this class with a similar class size. It was a great gift to be able to ask questions and get to know classmates on Zoom, and if class sizes were larger, the course would not be as good. 

Both professors are also incredible. See more comments below.

Weaknesses: The readings in Prof. Christakis' section were packed too tightly in some places. For example, we would have to read 150-200 pages for a week, but only 15 pages for other weeks. Perhaps it could be possible to better distribute the reading load across lessons. It might also be useful to have TA sections that focused on the pandemic material. Simon was absolutely fantastic and did his best, but in future years, it might be helpful to have dedicated sections for the pandemics material. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The instructors are both very knowledgeable and clearly passionate about the course, which made lectures interesting. I do wish there were more practice problems given so that we could prepare for exams. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths are certainly the professors, a Nobel prize winning economist and a world-renowned epidemiologist. If anything, take the course to say you took a course with the two of them. That being said, this was the first iteration of this course. I did not like the quizzes. The questions were often vague. Even if you studied the material from class, you weren't guaranteed a great grade on the quiz because of this. The grading by the TA should have been a bit more lenient given the vagueness and time constraints on the quiz. That being said, the readings in the class were interesting and listening to the professors' thoughts was great. The class sessions were very long and being on Zoom definitely was not helpful when it comes to maintaining focus during class. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course is organized into alternating sections between the two professors, which leads to the aggregate sum of the course material being a quilt of fairly disconnected concepts. The continuity between topics isnt emphasized and the class feels like two survey courses at once. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really liked the lecture-seminar style of the course. I appreciated how we had the opportunity to ask questions in class as we were learning the material; being able to hear what my classmates had to say definitely enhanced the learning process. I think the professors also did a great job trying to unify the course with some cross-cutting topics, but I do wish we went more in-depth with this.

I wish we did more in class simulations  maybe with DICE models and more on Breadboard  I feel like those activities would be engaging and help students remember the content more. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of the course is the legendary instructors. Nordhaus and Cristakis are among the most respected members of their respective fields, so it was an honor to be able to listen to them and pose questions to them. However, given that this was the first time the course was offered, it was rather unstructured. The material didnt feel all that cohesive across the climate change and pandemic sides of the course. Although I feel like I learned a good amount of information, it felt rather scattered. I would not say there is a cohesive narrative that links all the aspects of the course together. <br/></div>
</div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Nordhaus and Professor Christakis were extremely knowledgeable, not just about their particular areas of focus but how everything fit into the big picture.

The only potential weakness is that it's a high-level overview rather than a specific / technical course, so you won't for example be going over the details of the DICE model in depth. The material is provided if you're interested, though, and I think knowing that these topics exist and how they fit into the bigger picture is enough to do your own investigation! <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought that the content of this course was fascinating and timely. I had never really considered climate change from an economic perspective, nor taken any kind of medical or sociological course before, and loved to hear about them from true experts. While the problem sets could have benefitted from a bit more guidance and took a very long time, I felt that they reinforced class content well. I think that the sociology part of the course should have had some low-stakes assignments, too, however, in order to balance out the workload. Also, the readings ranged from wonderfully relevant to I-don't-understand-remotely-why-we-were-assigned-this. Quizzes and the final were very fair questions (though, I wish we were given more specific feedback in grading). Given that this was the first iteration of the class, this turned out to be a very strong course! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths are the professors, no doubt. I don't think there's another opportunity to have two such phenomenal professors co-teaching a class that is so relevant to the status quo. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Both professors are experts in their fields and had special insights into the topics that you don't get from other courses. For example, many of the topics were based on their published research. The structure of the class in terms of problem sets ever so often and 1 quiz per part of the course were good at keeping us accountable to the material. Professor Nordhaus and Christakis have pretty different lecturing styles, which can be a bit jarring when switching from one part of the course to another (I think this might improve because this was the first year the course was taught). Also, I wish that Professor Christakis's two parts of the course were more related to each other. I think the second part of the Pandemics portion could have referred back to pandemics a bit more (it did, and I know why that material was important, but the material could relate to both climate change and pandemics and it wasn't presented that way in the syllabus). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I like that the course covers a lot of ground. I don't like that the lecturers tried to include so many readings but only used them minimally in the course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths were the quality of lectures. Professor Nordhaus' lectures were always very informative despite being fairly casual, and professor Christakis' lectures were always very-well spoken and engaging. The concepts in this course made focusing very easy since the topics are very relevant. It is hard not to be engaged in lectures about climate change and pandemics when half of CA is on fire and Covid is still keeping students from attending classes in-person. This was a pilot-course so the professors' casual attitudes and willingness to have conversations with students during, after, and outside of class made the atmosphere very welcoming and motivating. I hope this quality continues. Also, having the other professor sit-in during lectures from the other was always fun because they would hop-in and ask interesting questions or offer insights from their own respective field. Another great upside was the quality of our TF, Simon. At the end of every week he always gave a concise breakdown of what we had been learning througout the week and always added in interesting concepts from papers he had found in his own free time that were relevant. A downside would be that being a pilot course, the assignment structures could be a bit more polished. The econ-half of the course had psets due every couple of weeks that were primarily in microsoft excel and given with arguably ambiguous instructions while the sociology-half of the course had no psets at all. Also, at the end of every 4-ish week-long set of lectures from one professor, there would be a quiz at the end of class that we were not given much information about to help us prepare. The feedback given by the TF's during section or on the quiz results were always helpful, though. <br/></div>
