<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: detailed lecture slides, TA help sessions, practice exams <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I would really ask the teaching team to seriously consider recording their lectures even next year. I cannot fathom how I would have understood anything in this class if I did not have the recorded lectures. I consider the recorded lectures to be a huge strength. 

Weaknesses: The sheer volume of material. There is so much stuff. One of the professors mentioned this, and I think it's true, so it's worth repeating here -- some members of the teaching team have been teaching this material for several decades (not an understatement). As a result, they know the material quite well! Unfortunately, this is my first time seeing the material. If the teaching team could try to put themselves in a first-time learner's shoes, I hope they might consider slowing down the presentation of the material. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â occasionally going to TA office hours is hard; a lot of people are competing to ask questions and most of the time TAs will not know the answer. a strength is that the instructors have made this course friendlier by eliminating the curve &amp; encouraging cooperation, which has been a huge relief on my mental health. they are really here to help you &amp; their OH are very helpful as well. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the amount of material covered is astounding. The most up-to-date science is presented, and, by the end of the course, we were able to deduce mechanisms provided experimental data. The lac of a curve made for a much more collaborative atmosphere in the course, and the professors genuinely seemed to care about our learning and impressions of them. The professors are very willing to answer questions during office hours. 
Weaknesses: the p-sets are often outdated-- not relevant to this year's material-- and take a significant amount of time but are only worth three points. They require attending peer tutor office hours as they cover content not previously studied. <br/></div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Wow. So much information. I cant imagine doing this course without being able to rewatch the lectures. I like that they listen to students. It would have been great if the problem sets included some simpler problems that were just content based instead of all test-like questions. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the Professors and TAs were excellent, and the content of the course is super interesting. The course definitely pushes you, but you learn a lot! I also really appreciated that, although the expectations were very high in the course, there was a lot of support available. Office hours were frequent, the Professors and TAs constantly offered individual meetings, etc. 

Weaknesses: lectures went pretty overtime quite frequently, which was frustrating because the class already has SO much content. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course are definitely the instructors, all of whom are excellent, engaging, and highly enthusiastic. They are all highly accomplished and know the material like the back of their hand. The slides are highly engaging and the class quizzes are a very smart and useful idea to improve engagement. A weakness of this course is that there are no answer keys for the problem sets, so it's somewhat difficult to understand the level of detail expected in a good response. A strength / weakness, depending how you look at it, are the highly comprehensive and difficult exams. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strenghts - The professors are extremely knowledgeable and can answer any questions on Ed or during office hours. Having the class graded not on a curve is very conducive to effective learning, which I and many others appreciated.
Weaknesses - I felt that the course was slightly less organized than 300. The Problem Sets were oftentimes not written that well/poor wording. Lastly, while I am thankful for the TAs, I felt that the TAs for 301 were not extremely knowledgeable about the topics discussed in 301. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really enjoyed the professors - they were all very knowledgable and they explained concepts very well. Also, the organization and the structure of the course was amazing. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: really helpful as an MB&amp;B majorI feel like I really learned a lot about biochemistry and about genetics. Weaknesses: Can be kind of hard to swallow all the information given at times, especially with all the names of various factors, etc, that we have to memorize! <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: This course covers a lot of material. Weaknesses: This course covers far too much material. For the first half of the term, all three instructors rushed through all of their lectures, making it impossible to absorb all of the information in real time. After mid-semester feedback was submitted and asked the instructors to slow down, Christian slowed down, and his lectures became much more helpful. But Joan and Franziska kept rushing. Joan once showed a slide on protein ubiquitination for a grand total of 10 seconds, skipped to the next one, and still wrote a test question on it. Moreover, even though the name of the course is biochemistry, this course was just molecular biology, with almost no actual chemistry featured at all. It was just memorization and no skill. The course could be improved if the instructors cut out a lot of content. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It requires a ton of memorization with little help from professors or tas. You learn a great deal of information that is interesting and relevant to research today. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought that this course was great. 
Strengths: the teaching staff were all incredibly knowledgeable and engaging, as well as being accommodating about COVID-related things, such as granting extensions on p-sets and quizzes. 
Weaknesses: I think it would have been useful to put the biology of eukaryotes and prokaryotes closer together. We learned about transcription, translation, etc. in prokaryotes, then took a few lecture break, then learned about it in eukaryotes. I think it would have been less confusing if the transcription lectures were right next to each other, as both processes would have stayed fresher and it would have been easier to compare. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: So many!! Professor Schlieker and Steitz were sooooo amazing, and even though Professor Bleichert only taught a few lectures, they were also really good, especially considering this was her first time teaching the course. They were not only great lecturers (which of course is very important for such dense material), but also were very accommodating/understanding (+ open to feedback!) and clearly cared about the wellbeing of the class, which certainly is not the case in a lot of STEM classes. Additionally, I thought the course was extremely well organized, which I always really appreciate. I also want to shout out the TAs for being so incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, and responsive. 
Weaknesses: Honestly, there was so much material covered that even though the psets weren't very time consuming, studying for the midterms and the final were an extreme time drain. I don't think there's anything that can really be done about that though. Similarly, it was difficult to sit through the whole lecture without a break because of how dense they were, so maybe a one minute break in the middle would be beneficial. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Wow I was extremely surprised with MB&amp;B 301. I found Dr. Schlieker, Dr. Bleichert, and Dr. Steitz to all be so helpful and accommodating during the semester by always offering help and being willing to push back deadlines for assignments. The TAs were amazing! They all were so on top of what was happening during class and were always able to answer questions. I thought that the instruction team were a huge positive aspect of the course. My biggest gripe is with the extent of detail which we are expected to remember. Many of the problem set and exam questions centered on minute details from lecture. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the professors, peer tutor help sessions, learning about experimental techniques, covering a wide variety of material, grading was not on a curve, the class felt very collaborative (especially when making study groups)
weaknesses: sometimes the lectures were a bit disorganized which made them difficult to follow; many experimental techniques or famous studies were presented very quickly which made it hard to follow the conclusions of the studies; many questions on the exams seemed to test small memorization facts from the slides rather than more important concepts that we had spent longer discussing <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: material is interesting (albeit very hard), I liked the focus on learning rationale and developing intuition rather than memorization, the range of topics covered was really broad and engaging, the peer tutors were a great help

Weaknesses: the psets were often 5-7 pages long if not longer but would only count for 3 points regardless, sometimes there was too much content in each lecture and we would consistently go over the allotted class time by 10 minutes even though the professors were already choosing to breeze over some slides, the final exam was extremely hard for no reason <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The instructors, TAs, and peer tutors are all so knowledgeable and very willing to meet with students. Ed was also a very useful forum for discussing problems.

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The professors are definitely a strength. Staying after lecture to ask questions was super helpful and their office hours were as well. The peer tutors are also great and really help with the problem sets. The problem sets are really useful to understand the material better. 

Weaknesses: To be very honest, I thought the TA's could have been more helpful. Most of the questions I asked them during the discussion sections they just had no idea about (not kidding, my other friends in the class comment this as well) so I ended up not going to the sections, except for Katelyn who was an amazing TA. It's really frustrating that not even the TA's know what is going on and that I had to scramble to make it to the professor OH just to get my lecture questions answered. Also, the peer tutor office hours are only 2 hours a week total. I know that MB&amp;B 301 has fewer students than MB&amp;B 300 for example but it is also significantly harder. Because each tutor only had 1 hr this also meant that the whole hour went to talking about the psets, thus there was no time to talk about lecture questions (especially because the TA discussion sections on Tues/Wed were totally useless, hence why only 2 or 3 people went per week to those compared to 8ish for the Thurs section). I also would have liked there to be answer keys to the psets and quizzes. <br/></div>
