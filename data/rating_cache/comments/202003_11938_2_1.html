<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Watching the prerecorded lectures of doc g doing the lab and then the TA do the same thing on lab day was pointless. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Very little strengths.  The actual lab itself was interesting, but working without a lab partner was difficult.  The online labs were terrible.  The lab was taught robotically and to do well you didn't have to be a scientist, but a computer. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the course was very organized and the assignments were very clear. The labs usually correlated with the topic we discussed in lecture. A weakness of the class I found was the post lab quizzes. While the pre-lab quizzes were very helpful and made sure I understood the material, I felt like the post labs were tedious and did not contribute much to my learning. I tended to do lab reports right after finishing the lab, so after a week has passed, I felt like I had to relearn the lab alongside a new lab. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â You will learn how to function in the lab. The instructions are extensive and you will be required to keep to the guidelines. This is very helpful because with so little room for error, you learn how to function well. However, the work load of this class is very high, and frequently a lot of it feels unnecessary. Because of the virtual environment this year, everyone had to watch long pre-lab lectures, these could be 1-2 hours long. While the lectures were useful, I often found the videos that just walked you through the lab to be unnecessary for someone who would then be performing the experiment with the help of a TA and a detailed lab manual. 
The lab repots were also very long and take several hours to complete well. You will understand the data, but parts of the report can just feel like box checking. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lab work was usually fun and engaging. The lab reports were brutal and sometimes graded very unfairly. There was too much deviation in grading that didn't depend on the work itself, but rather the TA's who graded them. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course could have done away with the majority of its assigned busy work, which was truly not helpful in the least. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the experiments themselves are quite interesting and fun to conduct. Weaknesses: I understand in real scientific papers that the details must be very meticulous, but the grading was too meticulous, so much so that the points I lost had nothing whatsoever to do with my conceptual understanding. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: personally, I thought chem lab was very enjoyable. The work load is a lot but manageable. This should not be thought of as a half credit course. <br/></div>

</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths of this course include the in person labs, the resources provided before each lab session, Dr. G, and the labs themselves which were challenging, but mostly engaging and exciting. Weaknesses include the workload, some of the TA's, and the grading which could be variable and very rarely reflective of true learning. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â the course can improve because most of the work is front-loaded towards the day before the lab day. The fact that the post-lab and pre-lab quizzes are only made available the day before the lab made it difficult to juggle lab work during the week since most of the assignments were not made available until the day before. It was quite difficult to manage during the semester. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: A wide variety of lab experiments gives a good basic yet broad overview of lab work. Both Dr. G and my TA were great at being available to help with anything I was struggling on both in the lab and outside with lab reports.

Weaknesses: The post lab quizzes often had questions that the lab class never specifically taught, and it was assumed that students had either learned it in their Gen Chem lecture class or from previous high school chemistry background. However, different Gen Chem sections went at different paces, the units in our lecture class sometimes didn't align with the concepts of that weeks experiment, and people come into the class/lab with varying levels of high school chemistry background. For a General Chemistry lab that is supposed to be designed as the intro/starting point for a student in chemistry, the quizzes are sometimes unfairly biased toward students with previous/more experienced chemistry backgrounds. I personally have a very limited chemistry background so I often struggled on the post-lab quizzes because of the basic fact that I was being tested over something I had not previously learned in detail yet. The time restriction also did not help because showing all our work meant typing out equations and subscripts in an organized fashion into Canvas. I appreciated that Dr. G gave us an extra five minutes because he understood that the online transition slowed things down, but it wasn't enough and I often found myself running out of time mid sentence. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Honestly, just deal with it LOL. It's Dr. G, everyone has to go through it. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I learned a lot in lab and it was structured well. But, I did more work for lab than some of my other classes, and it was frustrating that the lab is just 0.5 credits for all of that work. Lab reports were very tedious and I got many points off for graph details, which I know I need to do correctly but can still be frustrating. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One weakness to the course I think is that in order to test the students' knowledge base having timed test works against what this course ought to strive for. The time crunch for prelab and post-lab quizzes are very spotty. As educators, it is given that students all work at different paces so it's unfair to reward only those that are fast workers, not those who actually are learning from the class or those with the most correct answers. This practice goes against building practical chemistry knowledge. The way to improve this is to collect data and see what is a reasonable time in which the 75th percentile of students are able to complete this quiz and maybe use that as a starting point for how long a quiz should be. Or better yet, have untimed quizzes. <br/></div>

Preparing for and completing weekly labs and lab reports was challenging but very manageable. Valentina, my TA, was also a really great advisor during and before we started labs.

Weaknesses: I think the grading among T.F.s was EXTREMELY inconsistent. I received excellent grades on horrible lab reports from one TF, and horrible grades on my best lab reports for minor mistakes from another TF. The final grading system is designed to be a weed-out course, with poor grades for many students who may have actually done well. The fact that I can get an A by the numbers, but get a B depending on how my classmates performed is absolutely ridiculous. Also, the fact that there is no separate lab for 163 and 161 is horrible. If you are in 163, it is essentially like taking two different, independent CHEM courses since the topics in 163 and 134L do not even come close to lining up. We were learning the about quantum mechanics while doing titrations in chem lab. Additionally, the first few post lab quizzes were incredibly difficult, and the work for this course honestly exceeds the .5 credits for which it is allotted. Either the university needs to recognize that this course is worth more than .5 credits, or the course needs to be dialed back. I'd prefer the former. <br/></div>

The weaknesses of this course was the lack of time necessary to do well on the post-lab quizzes, as well as all lab assignments being due on the same day of the week.

There is also a lot of work and stress associated with the quizzes (some of which are too long for the allowed time) and the long lab reports. The grading of the reports are also sometimes very unreasonable and emailing the TFs is often not helpful. It is better to go directly to Dr. G about a grading question.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength is that you do get a very basic introduction to doing a chemistry lab (or pretty much any wet lab in general). It's very valuable to learn all of these skills with pretty low stakes experiments (even just things like lab dress codes, how to use a buret/other equipment not in many public high schools, how to write a lab report). The biggest downside of this course is that it is way more work than 0.5 credits. Purely time-wise, we have many hours of prelab videos, prelab quizzes, lab for several hours, postlab quizzes, and then lab reports. This meant that often students had to sacrifice truly learning the material for trying to get through it quickly because there was so much. <br/></div>

I learned a lot from this course, and I do not think I could have truly understood the concepts I was learning in Chemistry lecture without Chemistry lab. However, this course is very demanding, and the workload is definitely the same as a full credit course, not a 0.5 credit course. Because of this, I think that adjusting the quiz format to be more fair to students would be great. If there is any way for the quizzes to be taken on a paper format (i.e. scanning and uploading the quiz), it would immensely help students to apply their knowledge without having the difficulties of typing up complicated calculations or potential technical difficulties. In fact, because of a technical issue, I lost all of my work for a quiz, and with a paper format quiz, this would not be a problem. I hope that this suggestion can be taken into consideration. <br/></div>

Given the large role the lab reports played, this dominated my experience of the class.  I understand that formatting is important for science, but I find the focus on things like first person pronouns to be misplaced. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weakness: The Grading is TOOO harsh. I got points taken off for things like not creating the table chart boxes in the same size, which was impossible because when a phrase is too long, it goes to the next line, making the box size bigger.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The weaknesses of this course is that it should not be counted as a 0.5 credit class due to the insane amount of work and preparation that needs to go into obtaining the grade you want. In addition, I felt grading was unfair and inconsiderate to students who come from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM (especially those who had never taken a rigorous chemistry class before) because your grade was based on a curve. The average grade which corresponded to a B was calculated given the scores of everyone taking 134L, which included people in Chem 163 who had more background in STEM. There were also a dissonance between the professor and some students taking the class in regards to the timed pre-lab and post-lab quizzes that were not indicative of the mastery of material given that you had to show work/calculations to get full credit which took double the work considering it was typed. The strengths of this course were the TAs who made Chem Lab as enjoyable as possible, especially to those of us taking the course virtually. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There is a lot of preparation time needed to get ready for the lab. A strength is that during this time there are many resources that are needed. A weakness is that for virtual labs these resources are ineffective . By this I mean that the virtual lab doesn't allow for the same level of learning as in person labs. Another weakness is that the lab reports are to be done alone, but working together would lead to better learning and understanding of the topics. <br/></div>

Also the pre-lab lecture videos, experimental videos, and slideshows were all extremely helpful and provided great context/info for each experiment! I appreciated that they were all very detailed. 

Weaknesses - It was often hard to follow experimental procedures since instructions were lumped into large blocks of text; little guidance was provided during experiments; instructions for lab reports were extremely specific, and any slight deviation from them resulted in lost points; it was a bit difficult to understand quiz content and background knowledge for the experiments and lab reports for students who are not currently enrolled in the lecture course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The weakness of the way I took this course was the virtual nature of it. It is hard to be in lab without actually being able to do anything about it, but I understand this year's constraints very well. The professor and TA did their best to accommodate the needs to the students.  I will admit that the amount of coursework was challenging and it was very easy to lose points in lab reports and the two quizzes per week, but ultimately, students need to learn how to laser focus. Strengths: amazing Professor G who is always on call to answer questions, TAs are wonderful individuals who truly care about students learning. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: As someone who has had no previous laboratory experience, this course introduced me to a typical collegiate laboratory environment for the first time. The experiments were ordered in such a way that only a few laboratory instruments were introduced at a time, allowing me to become proficient in utilizing the laboratory instruments without becoming overwhelmed. Performing the experiments with the chemical concepts gained from my high-school chemistry course in mind was also extremely interesting to watch since I already possessed a knowledge base for what was occurring in each experiment.
Weaknesses: While the lab reports were helpful in allowing us to process and make sense of the data that we had collected in the lab, they were also extremely tedious and could be shortened in order to better fit more of a half-credit workload, particularly with the post-lab questions. I feel that many of the post-lab questions could be removed from each lab report without sacrificing the quality of the lab reports. The pre-lab and post-lab quizzes felt like typing tests rather than chemistry tests at times; I think these would be best improved by increasing the time limit of a few of them or by allowing us to answer the questions on paper and upload a legible copy of our work and answers. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was very difficult to feel especially engaged in the course over Zoom, as lab session mostly just consisted of myself watching the TA conduct the experiment. In reality, some of the lab sessions felt relatively superfluous, since most of the coursework could be easily accomplished by reading the lab manuals and using the data provided by the TA. That said, TAs tried very hard to make these lab sessions engaging, sometimes converting these lab sessions into office hours to better explain some of the concepts being applied to the experiment. In any case, I did derive some value from observing the experiments in action. The visual aid helped supplement the written manuals, and the lab reports themselves were a welcome exercise in applying course material. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Mathew TA was very helpful and accommodating! He took the time to really help students and make sure we understand.
Weaknesses: The lab report expectations and grading system is very arbitrary and it is difficult to know what is expected. Oftentimes, points are taken off due to unclear instructions or questions on the lab report and things unrelated to the actual chemistry/math of the experiment. Additionally, instructions or lab reports included intentional mistakes in which students were penalized for. Secondly, you are expected to watch multiple long pre-recorded pre-lab videos before each lab date. These were often difficult to follow and disorganized. It wasn't clear what information was actually important and what was not important. <br/></div>

Also would have been much nicer if the material actually followed what was taught in the 161 lecture course. I was marked down on several quizzes for not knowing basic chemistry material that was taught in subsequent weeks in the lecture course. Labs would also occur either several weeks before or after they were covered in the lecture, so I believe better synergy could be achieved with some simple swaps in the experiment order. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I loved being in the lab - there are many instruments, devices, and compounds that were fun to work with. Dr. G and my TA were also extremely kind and helpful - there was never a moment when anyone was left completely lost on what to do. Most people are finished with lab in around 2-3 hours.

Weaknesses: The limitations of gen chem experiments. There are some exciting ones like titration, but otherwise most of them were pretty boring. Also, this is more of a warning than a weakness, but the lab reports can be graded extremely harshly by some TAs. <br/></div>
