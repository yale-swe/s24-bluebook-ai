<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Koelle &amp; Simon were great profs, very clear and articulate. The study guides were also helpful when studying for the exams.  

Weaknesses: I felt like this online teaching format was an excuse to dump more material into this course because they could just keep adding more online videos for us to watch. In in-person teaching, students can modulate the pace of teh course, by asking questions in class or just by giving quizzical looks to the prof, who slows down. In online teaching, this feedback isn't possible, and I felt like the course went along at a terrific / breakneck pace just bc the profs could. The live zoom was supposed to take care of this, but that's just not true. The live zoom was helpful, but in no way did it modulate the pace of the course. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Good course. Lecture load was alright, even including the live zoom session. Coverage of material was very thorough, although could be nit picky at times. Weakness mainly centers on having three different lecturers with very different styles of teaching/coverage of material. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class goes extremely in depth while maintaining a wider perspective, allowing for deep and broad understanding. However, the graded material focuses mostly on the minutiae of deep content, so much so that any broader insight gained feels like a bonus. The three instructors also each had three very different styles, which meant that the three sections of the course lack a feeling of cohesion. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of this course is the textbook (Lehninger is great!) and the professors, who are also really great. Teaching/instruction is very clear overall, and I appreciated that during COVID the professors were great about being accommodating, making pre-recorded lectures interesting, and keeping me engaged with the class through live sessions. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: definitely the professors and TAs. The lecture materials were presented in an easily understandable and digestible way, and it is evident that the professors put in a lot of work to make sure that was the case. I appreciated that the exams were not memorization based, instead, it is more application based, making it more enjoyable. The TAs also played an important role in making this class more manageable. Not only do they do an amazing job reviewing the materials, but they also put in so much time leaving comments on Powerpoints so we have them for future reference, making up practice questions, holding review sessions, and holding multiple office hours, all so that we can succeed in the class. 

Weaknesses: One minor weakness is that the live lectures could include more practice questions instead of focusing on reviewing materials. Personally, I think the recorded lectures have already done a very good job covering all the materials necessary, so the lectures can focus more on applying what was covered through the recorded lectures in more of a question format. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course requires a great deal of memorization, although that is typical of any biology course, which made it difficult for exams. There was seemingly unnecessary details about membrane structure that was not really evaluated. That being said, the professors were all experts on the topics and brought enthusiasm to teaching. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Gaining a good conceptual understanding of biochemistry. 

Weaknesses: We all know that there should be one professor teaching the class, and we all know which one at that <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The recorded lectures were incredibly clear, engaging, interesting, and informative. Because the lectures were prerecorded, students could watch them at any convenient time and replay sections of the lecture to better understand the material. The live Zoom sessions were great; the thought-provoking poll questions and discussions in breakout rooms were very helpful, and made the course as enjoyable and interactive as possible. The supplements (non-tested information presented at the end of each live Zoom session) were all incredibly interesting. All three professors were very clear in their lectures, and they gave detailed and clear answers to any questions asked during the live Zoom sessions. The problem sets were thought-provoking and interesting, and took up very little time, which was wonderful. The tests were all fair, and so is the grading. The only arguable weakness of this course is the amount of time it takes up (recorded lectures, a live Zoom session, and a live discussion section every week take up a lot of time), but this is made up for by the fact that the live Zoom session and discussion section reinforce the concepts covered in the lectures very well. Overall, this was a great course! <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: professors and teaching staff were very accommodating to virtual learning and did not make synchronous attendance of lectures part of the grade/required. Everything except sections were recorded and TAs were very responsive to email and piazza. most but not all videos had captions which made them easier to follow given much of the video was a powerpoint slide that albeit informative, could be difficult to follow when it was just a picture/figure requiring close attention to commentary. study guides and learning goals for each lecture were provided well in advance as well as tips for how to successfully navigate exams, including practice exams and keys to prepare students for what to expect. Overall course climate lended incredibly well to transitioning from in-person to virtual learning and made the class one of the most enjoyable to be in from quality of teaching to professor compassion for current circumstances.

weaknesses: some lecture videos did not have the clearest slides to follow or captions to better accommodate students who learn better with reading, especially important when all there was to rely on for the most part was lecture slide videos that could differ from the textbook at certain points. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: We covered all the biochem information that is on the MCAT. Professor Simon was a great professor to start out with. He taught clearly and in an organized fashion. The PSETs are very helpful for test preparation since they, themselves, are old test questions. 

Weaknesses: There is a lot of material covered in this course, and it isn't always clear what needed to be studied. Some professors were better than others at clearly emphasizing the important concepts. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: incredibly well-organized, fascinating material, accessible teaching team, plenty of practice resources
Weakness: grading ambiguity-- it is so frustrating to be told that the class is "not on a curve" but then not receiving any firm cut-offs and being told that the course typically sees a 25-25-remainder breakdown <br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Overview: Overall a really fantastic course. The first half is a lot of review from other courses, but still interesting (and the profs add a lot of new details). Simon is a really great lecturer. Paulsen goes really fast but does teach you a lot of content. Koelle does a really great job explaining metabolism but a lot is packed in to this segment of the class.

Main weakness: I did not find breakout rooms during live lectures helpful--I know they're meant to encourage participation and discussion, but I would rather just think about the problem on my own for a little bit before going over it as a class; much more time efficient so we aren't just waiting around. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I give the teaching team major props for pulling off this class so well. Honestly as intense as this class was (a lot of information and material gained), it was even more rewarding and encouraged my passion for science. I was deciding between this class and MCDB300 and I am so glad I picked this class-I highly recommend it over MCDB300. The professors are some of the kindest teachers I have had at Yale and truly cared and tried to make this class a really great learning experience, and spent a lot of time helping us. The asynchronous lectures were probably too long at times and information-packed so this class took up a lot of time on a weekly basis to watch the lectures and come prepared for class. However it was a really great learning experience and especially the metabolism with Michael Koelle was really cool and interesting, and Prof. Koelle would make super helpful Piazza responses. I think all the professors did a great job making the lecture videos really high quality, with subtitles and quiz questions (you get an automatic 100 if you do them, its to learn the content better). The psets were really helpful and I thought this class was really transparent and great. Matt Cook would make review packets and we would have practice tests for everything which took off a lot of stress. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: taught very well, organized lectures and schedule, engaging and challenging questions, the Piazza forum, and the ability to drop a pset and midterm made studying less stressful

Weakness: I honestly loved this course, aside from the grading. It was somewhat discouraging to see how strict the grading rubric for exams could be (and the exams, though most of the questions are fair, were very challenging under a short time limit). I frankly think it's ridiculous to tell students to focus on learning and enjoying the material when you know that the grades aren't curved...Despite learning the material, I was highly stressed about how'd I do on exams (because a point can literally make such a huge difference). I have no idea what my grade will be in this class. But my one advice is to just stay on top of the material and work hard. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the pre-recorded lectures were excellent and the office hours held by the professors were also great to help answer any confusing questions. Piazza was also extremely helpful to clarify any confusion. In terms of improvement, I did think I was spending way more time than I had thought for the course from the combination of pre-recorded lectures and live sessions. It felt like ~3 classes per week instead of 2 and it was hard to finish everything on time. 


If MBB 300 has to be taught virtually again, I would try to either do live lectures that are recorded or somehow minimize the live sessions. Overall, I don't have any other problems with the course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This was an amazing class. The biggest strength was definitely the teaching staff. Profs. Koelle, Paulsen, and Simon were amazing lecturers and made sure to answer any questions as they came up, were clear with expectations, and genuinely cared about our progress. The class was not stressful at all with grades, you always felt as if the class was built for you to learn rather than trick you. The TAs were decently helpful as well, and the peer tutors were great. A focus on conceptual learning rather than memorization was amazing, too. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course are the instructors in their patience to answer questions. I appreciated how they focused on the larger concepts rather than all of the details. I learned a lot this way, and they made sure we had a lot of problems to practice with so we knew what to expect. For improvements, I just wish there were more clear solutions on our actual exams, especially the multiple choice problems. I also liked Professor Koelle's format of lecture quizzes the most because they were not just straight recall but they made you synthesize and problem solve based on the lecture material. <br/></div>

The lectures were presented clearly, and were clarified further by slides and study guides being posted alongside them, as well as by the embedded mini-quizzes. The order of topics made a lot of sense. While the class asked for very little prior knowledge, it didn't feel like it was just repeating things I'd learned in other classes (or at least taught the same subjects in further depth, with the possible exception of the membrane content). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class was one of the best organized and best taught classes I've taken at Yale! I thought the video quizzes were a good way to keep students on track with watching lectures and also helped check our understanding of the lecture material without adding too much stress. The live sessions and discussion sections were a good chance to have more direct interaction with the professors and TAs, and the live sessions would be recorded, which were helpful for reviewing before an exam. We also got practice tests and TA-led review sessions before each exam, so I thought every exam was pretty fair and there was never any confusion. Even though the 3 professors had slightly different lecture styles, the content still felt cohesive and each one of the professors were really good at breaking complex topics down to terms that were easy to understand. The TAs and professors were also very responsive to any suggestions we gave through Piazza and always addressed our concerns in a timely manner, which I especially appreciated since we were all adapting to the new online format. The organization and the teaching of this course were genuinely superb, and I really could not have asked for more. <br/></div>

Professors, be wary of the way you structure questions on Canvas quizzes.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was really nice that the instructors put in effort to connect with students and they made sure that everyone understood the topic by having different types of assignments (quizzes and problem sets) <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really enjoyed the course and felt that it was taught really well remotely. The professors were super helpful and there were many resources for us to use. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The recorded lectures were well-taught and comprehensive, the live lectures were engaging (the polls were particularly effective), and professors were very reasonable and understanding. The study guides were extremely helpful for test preparation and lecture summary. The PSETs were also great practice for solidifying lecture material.
Weaknesses: The recorded lectures were extremely long (and took a very long time to digest). I wish that the office hours with professors were a little longer. The initial midterm also could have been shorter to allow for more time per question. However, the later midterms had a good time per question proportion. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The teaching team for this class was incredibly kind and accommodating during an unconventional semester. They worked hard to ensure that students gained a thorough understanding of the material, provided extensive materials for review and office hours, and made sure students' opinions were heard. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Despite the circumstances, the course did a very good job of providing structures for students to do well in. The fact that the course deviated from memorization, and rather focused on concepts was a step necessary in light of the current circumstances. The problem sets were helpful in reinforcing the concepts that were taught throughout the week. If there was one note I would make, that would be that the exams were promised to be more so focused on big concepts and fundamentals and present them in challenging ways, but many times through exam questions it appeared that they were either ambiguous or reflective of very specific and seemingly unimportant details in the scheme of the course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: nice to watch most of lectures on own time, good ways to ask questions live through TA

Weaknesses: too much material covered in too short a time, some material was not taught well in class and was very TA dependent in turn  I understood things so much better when I switched my TA which shouldnt necessarily be the case even though it worked out for me <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought all three of the instructors for this class were very engaging. They explained the material well and clearly cared about students' learning. The lectures were definitely information packed, but I thought they did a good job of explaining what was important and giving us a solid biochemistry foundation, as well as going deeper into some of the pathways we learned about. The class definitely is challenging, and there is a log of material, but I think it was all useful and well-taught. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Very organized, frequent office hours, review sessions with the TAs, peer tutoring, and study guides all made success in the class very doable. Especially enjoyed the teaching styles of Prof Simon and Koelle but I felt that Prof Paulsen's lectures were really rushed (a LOT of info to memorize and understand crammed into each lecture, more so than in others, and a lot of info included that I found out in OH were really not required for us to learn)

Weaknesses: Prof Paulsen's teaching style. Also felt that some more transparency in the grade cutoffs would have been nice. <br/></div>
