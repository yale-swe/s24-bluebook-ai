<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â If possible, when going over the theoretical concepts of the models, it would be great to explicitly states the implications of the mechanics of the models that may not be so obvious at first. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This is purely simply an INCREDIBLE class. I never thought that I would learn so much of -- and understand so much of -- machine learning in one semester. The class strikes the perfect balance between theory, coding and applications. We never went too depth into the technicalities (so no hard math or complicated proofs), but still went deep enough to actually understand what is happening. The assignments, quizzes and exams might take up a lot of your time, but they come together beautifully to maximize the learning that you will do in the course. My only suggestion would be to reduce a little the number of evaluations for this class. There was not a single week that we did not have either an assignment due (the assignments take up quite a bit of time), a quiz or an exam. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The progression of topics we covered throughout the semester made sense, because each subsequent topic was building on some of the previous topics we had discussed. Problem sets helped us practice the concepts we had learned in lectures.
Weaknesses: Details about the grading were not as clear as I had hoped. Also, the course was a little too fast-paced, with concepts not being explained enough in depth. This left many questions unanswered. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths:
1. The materials are broad and cover a lot of methods.
2. Professor Lafferty is very patient to explain every question regarding the material.

Weakness:
1. Not suitable for students who don't have much mathematical background.
2. Not suitable for students who haven't used python before. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Lafferty is a great teacher and the course is well-structured.  I think the course's greatest strength lies in the sheer volume of material it covers--you'll at least touch on most of the major ML models, and you'll become comfortable with many of the important concepts.  After taking this course, you should feel comfortable reading more advanced ML literature, or taking more advanced ML classes, on your own.   The course's greatest weakness, from my perspective, was the sloppy nature of many of the quiz and exam questions.  I don't believe I took a single exam in this course that didn't have at least one error/ambiguity that completely changed the meaning of a question, and I know several students who lost points as a result of ambiguous/faulty prompts.  Of course, this is still a relatively minor weakness in the grand scheme of things, which just goes to show how good this course is. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think this course was very strong. One weakness was that lectures were still up an an hour and 30 minutes long. Watching an online lecture is not the same as watching a recorded lecture. I wish professor lafferty broke up the lectures a little more, or did maybe inserted time for "breaks" in the middle of lecture. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures were generally clear and helped students understand topics with appropriate level of detail. It was accessible to a non-data science major. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was very well-planned from the start, with a lot of attention being given to learning effectively despite the virtual circumstances. The integration of practice and theory at every point in the semester was very helpful in solidifying my understanding of the concepts covered. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course provided a great overview of a lot of the methods in ML. Sometimes it was a bit hard to find a balance between enough explanation for the way certain algorithms worked and confusion because of too much detail. Overall though it covered enough information for us to understand and then implement the methods. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This was a really tough course, one of the toughest I've taken at Yale. I (and most of the other students I worked with on assignments and review sessions) barely absorbed any knowledge after the third week or so. The only students who seemed to understand what was going on were the students who already had experience in ML, in which case why call this an 'introductory' course. I get that ML is very dense, but I think the professor could do a lot better job at making the information accessible for students who may not have done an internship utilising ML, but still meet the course pre-req's. The coding assignments were pretty accessible (especially given that they were in Python). I know that it does get a lot more theoretical and harder than what we were exposed to in this course, but I do think that the course could be made more accessible (without just referring students to medium articles). <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â We thought that the first assignment, was a little bit too much. It was actually the longest assignment throughout the semester. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Lafferty is a great lecturer, interesting problems on the psets, equal focus on theory and practice of ML
Weaknesses: The testing cadence seemed like a bit much with 4 quizzes, two midterms, and a final on top of the psets. Feedback on psets also wasn't always the best <br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â At times I wish the course had been a little more thorough with the math, without being as workload-heavy as 365 <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course include the well-written slides, example code, interesting assignments, and extremely helpful TA. I was able to ask questions at any time and receive quick and detailed replies, which greatly helped my understanding of the material and my completion of the assignments. However, the directions given on the assignments and exams were sometimes rather unclear, resulting in a lot of easy points being lost. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Overall, I found the course to be well organized and well taught. I liked the format of the 24 hour take home exams, and I really appreciated the fact that the exams were open note as I feel like the format more closely reflected a real world situation. Professor Lafferty was clear and thorough in his teaching, and the problem sets were fair and covered material discussed in class. I wish that there had been more TAs or office hours to help specifically with debugging code. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The TAs were incredibly helpful; the problem sets were interesting and relevant (although the problem sets were too hard at the beginning and rather easy by the end of the course); the course materials were pretty interesting.

If anything could be improved, perhaps the lecture slides could have used better graphics to communicate the concepts. I think some of the concepts were hard to grasp at first, but this was because the professor couldn't tell how well we understood them (due to the nature of online learning). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was really strong. The one thing that could improve is more applied problem sets throughout the year. The first couple on Covid and Zillow were very interesting and applied and it would be great for more to be like that. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the material was interesting. I think that the watering down of some of the concepts was actually a weakness. I think there needs to be more of the math involved in order to fully appreciate the topic. I know that 365 exists, but the course was a mess this semester and I really like professor Lafferty, so I took 355. Personally, I think that there should just be one class (combine 365 and 355), and meet in the middle. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Learned a ton - like a python and coding class combined. 
Weaknesses - Should focus more on teaching python, particularly in the beginning. The first couple of psets were very daunting because we had to learn the ML concept, apply it, and teach ourselves how to code. Another issue was that this was like a coding class in the beginning, but CS classes have soooo many more office hours and TAs than we did, so it was difficult for us to fix an error in our code when there were only couple of office hours and countless kids in the room with different questions. The one on one office hours helped a bit but those often filled up quickly. Wendy was a gem in answering our questions if we emailed her. She was amazing. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is very demanding but also very rewarding. Professor Lafferty is a wonderful lecturer, and the TAs this semester (especially Wendy) were incredible. I believe that its emphasis on coding via problem sets and take-home midterms is a good, practical focus. I definitely learned a lot about coding in Python. 

However, the workload this semester was too demanding. The problem sets are difficult but reasonable. However, the take-home nature of the midterm exams, which included timed short answer and 24-hour coding questions, was difficult both in terms of their time demands and their content. I suggest that the professor rethink these midterms, because when combined with the constant problem sets, they were overwhelming. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Super, super well organized. Lectures were straightforward and clear (and presented at an appropriate level for people without an extensive background in machine learning). The overall structure of the course was logical and it felt like topics built well on each other. Professor Lafferty is a gem, a kind soul, and a deep repository of knowledge about this topic; his enthusiasm for the material made the course that much better. This is a small thing, but I also really appreciated that the recorded lectures were trimmed to cut out extra time before/after class. Also! The TAs! This of course varies year to year, but Wendy and Jerome were truly incredible, providing clear explanations, answering Piazza questions crazy fast, and hosting really valuable review sessions and office hours. They took the class from good to great.

Weaknesses: This was mentioned in one of last year's reviews, but the difficulty of the psets felt like it varied wildly. This may just be because I hadn't had any exposure to Python prior to the course so the learning curve was necessarily steep, but the first one felt nearly impossible and the last few ended up testing our conceptual understanding more, so there was very little coding involved. I don't know if this format was just a function of the type of material we covered (e.g., for some of the later topics the code was pretty straightforward so it probably did make more sense for us to write out what each line was doing than to generate our own), but it would have been nice to have a little more support for learning Python at the beginning of the course. That said, I know that people come in with different coding backgrounds (I'd done stuff only in R before) and to some extent you do just have to dive in, so not sure there's an easy fix for this. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Since the course was at 9 AM Eastern and everything was recorded, by Halloween I stopped attending live, and watched the lectures in large chunks at 2x speed before the exams.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Introduction topics like regression and stochastic gradient and descent are fundamental and feel vital when studying neural networks later in the course and are all taught well, but topic models and language models feel like they come up out of nowhere and unrelated to much else in the course, and were more difficult than they should have been. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course gives a fabulous overview of the dominant topics in machine learning, with statistical theory, coding, and examples of real-world applications. I loved how tangible the assignments were, as we got to manipulate real COVID, public transportation, weather, Shakespeare, and music data. I have recommended this course to many friends in the years below. My main objection to the class is that I think it is trying to cover too much ground as an Intro to ML course, especially as it focuses heavily on both the theory and the coding aspects. I think it should focus on one more than the other, and for students' general interests it should be coding. The theory was a little intense for students with rather low exposure. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Lafferty delivers great, focused and easily understandable lectures even for a novice in machine learning like me. His psets were also great at reinforcing the ideas of the course, though they really are a considerable time sink. Make sure to have plenty of time set aside to finish assignments. I didn't like the format of the course too much when it came to testing. Apart from significant psets due every 10 days, there were also 2 midterm exams and a cumulative final. I think that if you're gonna have psets that are a majority of the grade and that involve significant coding, perhaps it would be better to only have 1 midterm and a final. Apart from this, I think the course was really well-organized and Professor Lafferty is very understanding. <br/></div>
