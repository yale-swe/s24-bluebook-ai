<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the course was a great overview of a variety of machine learning topics, and I appreciate that Professor Negahban brought in academic papers and articles that related to the course material. This being said, the material itself was definitely challenging and caused me many frustrations throughout the semester. You often need to review notes or turn to supplemental materials in order to fully grasp the concepts, as attending the lectures is not enough to do well. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would absolutely never recommend this course to any undergraduate student.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think so. If you want to really understand what's going on in data mining and machine learning from a mathematical and statistical perspective, definitely take this course. If you're more of a coder instead and don't really want to get into the weeds, then take 355 instead. If you like lengthy, difficult problem sets more than you like exams, this is a good move too. I found problem sets to be much more manageable than examinations in a virtual environment. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Do not take this course with Professor Negahban. It was disorganized, difficult to follow, and often stressful as we did not receive timely feedback or have good references to help with assignments. It did not feel like students were able to learn useful or foundational theoretical material effectively, despite having such an interesting range of topics to cover. The only reason I do not completely regret having wasted a credit on this course is that it counts toward my major, but if I could do it again, I would not choose to take this. This is by far the worst course I have taken at Yale so far, and I dont believe this is only because it was online. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Not in the way that it was taught this semester. I think the professor might have been going through some stuff during the term, but it was just too disorganized for anyone to actually learn anything. It's a shame because the subject is so cool and Sahand is actually very knowledgeable about it. I don't think I learned too much tbh. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â ABSOLUTELY NOT. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE CLASS.  I have waited very long to write this review. This is a long read, but if you are seriously considering taking this class, read this fully. I do not want anyone else to suffer like I and many others did. And this is coming from someone who has done well and is quite confident of getting an A in the class. I regretted taking this class so much. Learnt absolutely nothing, though I got almost perfect scores on the assignments. The assignments were terribly designed, extremely confusing, didn't test your grasp of the material but rather your diligence in pestering the TAs and trying to figure out what exactly the question wants. 80% of the time was spent trying to figure out what the question wants. That's how I did well. TERRIBLE ASSIGNMENTS! They teach you nothing! LECTURES WERE IMMENSELY FRUSTRATING! Trust me, I have friends in the class, and EVERYONE (I mean, every single one) I know does not understand 90% of what Sahand is saying. He just talks to himself, reads equations off the slides, does absolutely no explaining, and skips to the next slide. Lectures were soooo frustrating to attend or listen to. At one point, I had a phobia of even attending Sahand's lectures, because I just knew I'd be confused and misled the entire time. You may ask, how about ask questions on Piazza? Haha, yes, indeed, guess what: He gives you one-word replies, or says he does not understand the question, and then links you to Stanford's ML course and notes. I then proceed to watch a Stanford lecture for 3 hours, trying to figure out their notation. It's much better delivered, but the notation Stanford's Andrew Ng uses is completely different from Sahand. So it's a terrible mess. And excuse me, you're supposed to be teaching the course, not just redirect your students to another course video. We're paying tuition to Yale, not Stanford. Also, Sahand simply ignores some Piazza questions! Essentially, TERRIBLE PIAZZA RESPONSES AND EXTREMELY IRRESPONSIBLE PROFESSOR. The midterm was horribly designed, barely tested what we learnt, instead focusing on calculus. Quizzes were a joke, they were so trivial and just involved copying the slides. Psets were confusing and time-consuming and taught you nothing. REALLY TERRIBLE ASSESSMENT. Office hours were a JOKE - I did not find a single good office hours throughout the semester. ULAs could not help at all. Sahand cancels and reschedules office hours as and when he wishes, giving zero consideration to his students' schedules. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING! Finally, this is the class with the WORST logistics and organization EVER. In case you think I'm just ranting, let me present some evidence. The following are quotes from the syllabus, followed by what was actually implemented:
1. "Assignments will be posted roughly every week and a half". This corresponds to about 9 assignments. Guess how many we got? 5! Some took 20 hours, some took 3 hours. There's so much inconsistency. No idea when the next assignment is going to be, everyone's just guessing, Sahand doesn't say a single word, everyday's like playing Russian Roulette.
2. "Mid-semester exam, which will just basically be a homework assignment that you not work on with anybody else.": It was not a homework assignment. It became a timed assessment. Also, it was given right before thanksgiving break. That's not even midterm.
3. "The exam will also include a portion where you will discuss a random solution with the teaching staff.": No such thing was given.
4. 5 quizzes were promised. Only 2 were given, and only 1 was graded.
Quizzes are 10% in the syllabus, and then Sahand later says that they "don't matter". Promises to give grade estimates by midterm, and then goes offline and uncontactable for a week. Promises to upload Python notebooks, and then uploads nothing. Promises 1 more quiz and 2 more psets after thanksgiving, but none were given. What a joke. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Not at all.  Please avoid this course if you can. This course is probably my biggest regret in four years at Yale.  

I came into this course excited to further develop my Python and machine learning skills.  I had taken online classes last summer that solidified my ability to code in Python and taught me to use a variety of common machine learning packages and techniques at an introductory level.  I thought I was well-prepared and well-positioned to take this class and dive deeper into this foundational knowledge.  

After an entire semester of this course, however, I am no better at understanding how and when to implement specific machine learning techniques in the most optimal situation, or how to best apply any machine learning package to data in order to solve a problem.

If youre looking to develop those types of skillsif youre looking to become more adept and fluent in building and implementing machine learning models, then this course is not for you because it does not teach those skills.  Instead, it swamps you in mathematical derivations taught by an arrogant, unhelpful instructor.   I literally cannot name a single skill or specific insight learned in this course that I think will be useful in graduate school or in my career.  Instead of helpful Python hints, a general familiarity with various machine learning packages and models, or a framework for thinking about data and model-building going forward, this course consists of confusing mathematical notation, homework assignments that ask you to do things youve never seen before, and an instructor that cannot lead a coherent lecture to save his life.  Somehow, the topics are covered in a way that is simultaneously too deep and too broad.  What I mean to say is that Sahand will seize upon some niche aspect of the math and spend entire lectures deriving various layers of the parameters of a particular model, leading the class down a confusing mathematical rabbit hole before suddenly moving on to the next topic without ever actually explaining the broader ideas or implications of the previous one.  We jumped between models and concepts, and I never felt like I understood why any of them were important, or how I could actually go about using any of the techniques whose ridiculous derivations I had halfheartedly been able to follow. 

Amid all the math, when we actually had to write code, we were assigned what felt like busy work.  For example, we learned about the KNN algorithm in class, and then we were assigned to build our own KNN algorithm on the next homework, even though there are half a dozen Python packages with built-in KNN functions and various capabilities.  The philosophy, I suppose, was that by building our own KNN algorithm wed develop a solid understanding of its nuts and bolts.  But this only serves as an exercise in frustration when dozens of students barely know how to use Python, much less build a pretty damn complex algorithm from scratch based on shoddy, mistake-filled and vague instructions.  

The problem with this course was that we focused too heavily on the nuances and nitty-gritty mathematical details, rather than broader understanding of how to actually get excited about and leverage machine learning using the multitude of tools that already exist.  Until this very premise of the course is fundamentally reimagined, I would advise any student to avoid it. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I DO NOT RECOMMEND. I'm a CS major, and I thought that this class was even worse than CS 323. This was the most disorganized class that I've taken at Yale. By the midterm drop deadline, we had finished 5 assignments but had only received 1 grade, and the piazza questions about grading were left unanswered. No schedule was given for the homeworks and quizzes, so they were just assigned at random times throughout the semester, and you could never anticipate your workload for the upcoming week. I never had any idea of how many more homeworks and quizzes were left in the semester, and the professor gave no indication of this, until the last week of classes when the number of assignments we had already completed just ended up being the total number for the semester. Lectures were okay, but the homeworks involved a lot of new material that you had to figure out on your own. I had to read ML lecture notes from several other schools to understand what was going on, and office hours weren't very helpful. The material was extremely difficult, but I would not have minded it so much if the class was actually organized--if I knew when and how many assignments were coming so that I could allocate the time for completing them. I'm not a S&amp;DS major, so I expected the difficulty but not the disorganization. Also, I was initially excited about the combination of math and coding presented in the syllabus. I thought that I would learn the math behind a variety of ML concepts/tools and then implement them in the homeworks. Turns out, this was basically just a math class. The homeworks involved a ton of linear algebra, calculus, and proofs, with coding as a small addition. I didn't really gain any Python ML knowledge. I remember writing a function that just replicates an existing package for 1 coding homework and filling out a few lines in a Jupyter notebook for another. At the end of the semester, Professor Negahban did say that he would focus more on Python ML package usage in future iterations of the course. All I can say is, if you're a CS major, don't take this class. It will involve a lot of stress, the psets will take a lot of time, and learning how to take log derivatives of matrix equations or define the inner-product for a Hilbert space is not super useful in my opinion. If you're not a CS major, definitely make sure that you're comfortable with calculus and linear algebra. This class requires a strong math background. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The material in this course is captivating and very interesting to learn, but I wish Sahand didn't teach it or taught it better. If he teaches it again, the good news is he is very receptive of and always looking for feedback, so hopefully he improves. When he taught it this semester, the class was incredibly disorganized -- Sahand basically disappeared for a few weeks in the middle of the course, something like 3 weeks went by without a problem set being released, and not even the TAs knew what was going on. Grading was an absolute mess and results were almost never released, so much so that we didn't even have a good sense of our grades before the drop and Credit/D deadlines. The midterm in the course took place 3 weeks after the midway point in the semester, the drop deadline. It was abysmal, honestly. Otherwise, problem sets weren't too much work, and I enjoyed having a math and a coding component to each of them, but wish there were more coding. This turned out to be a very linear algebra-heavy course. <br/></div>

The balance of mathematical and coding assignments skewed heavily toward the math, which I liked because the coding and libraries are easier to learn independently, but other students may have different goals. The assignments were challenging, more in their linear algebra content than in statistics, but they were all manageable. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â No. Not with this professor. And I say this not because this course was difficult (it was). Let's be real here, machine learning is a tough subject and I knew that coming into this course. On top of learning a difficult subject, the disorganization of this course made this course super challenging for reasons that could've been avoided. Most of our live lectures were cancelled this semester for no reason. It took many weeks for our assignments to be returned with a grade, which made it challenging to determine our standing throughout the semester. In one instance, before the course drop deadline, a grading scale was provided to us when we didn't even have our grades back for several assignments. Overall, this course was just very disorganized and messy. The professor is a nice person and I think he had good intentions for us. But come on, this course needs an overhaul and it should be planned out much better in the future, especially since we're learning a difficult subject. If you're gonna take this course, be prepared to handle insanely tough assignments without a lot of hand holding. And also make sure your linear algebra skills are good. <br/></div>
