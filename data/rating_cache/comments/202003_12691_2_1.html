<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weakness: Book per week; I had to rush some readings, so I feel guilty. A lot of Mexican-focused content.

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course itself was very interesting and covered a variety of subjects, ranging from the history of Spanish in the United States to Puerto Rican student protests. The readings we completed tended to be interesting and generated fruitful discussion in class. I appreciated having Professor Pitti invite the authors of several books we read to class. The final project, which consisted of creating an exhibit proposal, was also one of the highlights of the class. While the assignments themselves were not too burdensome, the reading is this class was excessive. Having students read a 200-300 page book a week, while it allowed us to delve into the topics covered, was quite unreasonable, particularly in the middle of a pandemic. Shortening the readings, or at least suggesting that students focus on a particular section, would have led to more cohesive and productive discussions overall. The structure of the class was also a bit confusing and at times frustrating. This class is NOT a seminar. It is very much a small lecture, the only difference being that sections were built into class time. I found myself having very limited interactions with students outside of my section and Professor Pitti. While TAs for this class were absolutely wonderful, it was also a bit weird to see one group have Professor Pitti as their section leader. Clearer guidance would have also been helpful when completing the course assignments, particularly our primary source analysis. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â ALOT of reading, it's a little unrealistic to expect 300+ pages of reading a week when students are taking several other courses <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength of this course is that we are split into discussion sections, giving us the opportunity to be more engaged with the topics being discussed, contribute to discussion more frequently, and have a tighter-knit learning community. A weakness of this course is that the number of pages assigned for reading each week (mostly entire books) is not necessarily feasible and it makes discussions less specific due to the fact that in an attempt to cover everything we read, we talk about the books more broadly. It would be more beneficial to read specific chapters from the books. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Prof Pitti and the TAs were amazing. They were really understanding during the election and any other hard things going on. They truly care about the students. The discussions and books were also overall very rewarding and insightful. 

Weaknesses: sometimes the lectures were a bit too long as well as the readings. I thought when we were given specific chapters to focus on, they felt more manageable. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Prof. Pitti and the TAs were all great, kind, understanding of the difficulties of this semester, and super excited about making sure we got a lot out of the class. The readings were fascinating and the final project of putting together a museum exhibit was a lot of fun. Weaknesses: quite a bit of reading but towards the end we were told to focus on certain chapters which was really nice. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was thorough, thoughtfully designed, and fun. 
While I appreciate the idea of focusing on a book each week, it felt a little unreasonable (and unrealistic) for a lecture course, during COVID especially. Giving more focused readings, or at least highlighting areas of important within assigned books, would likely have fostered more engaging conversations in section, because students would be more likely to all be on the same page. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Many of the readings we did for this course were engaging and informative. Prof Pitti organized the class well and did his best to accommodate everyone despite being on Zoom. Section TAs were all very committed and well-liked as well. I learned a lot about Latinx history in a variety of areas. Discussions and lectures were often very interesting and thought-provoking, and I thought that it was a great idea to do sections during class time rather than at an additional time.

Weaknesses: I think it might have been better to have more variety in the readings offered in the course. We read a book every week, but it might have been better to assign chapters from books along with other articles to give more perspectives and knowledge. I also wish this class did not focus so much on Mexican experiences. Although those experiences are important, I was really hoping to learn more about Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Central American experiences--which were each given about 1 week each. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really loved the readings for the course, most were very interesting; section discussions were also enjoyable and intellectually stimulating. Since the class is emphasized as a "Latinx History" course, I think the course would benefit from more emphasis on the role of non-mexican hispanic groups in history (the class often felt like a Mexican history course). <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The biggest strength of this class was its focus on telling history as multiple histories. I think that this helped me see myself in the course material and understand how different moments/places in history interlock. This course could potentially be improved by the referring to some of the feedback students gave in the last class about what books we liked the best, but I think that Professor Pitti's intentionality really came through in the syllabus, which was well designed. <br/></div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class was a joy. The books are all excellent, and we were lucky enough to be able to "meet" many of their authors, which added so much to the discussions. The final project was one of my favorite assignments I've ever done at Yale, because it is incredibly open-ended in terms of content, yet forces you to do the nitty-gritty work of a historian. As someone who is Latinx myself, all the time I spent in this class felt so important and I think I grew not only as a student but as a person. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Addressed too much Mexican-American history; no engage with South America at all (and during a semester when great revolutionary change was being led by Bolivians. Chileans, and Peruvians). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The sheer amount of reading made this course difficult for me, but I also think I've learned more in this course than any other single course. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course lie in the instructor (Prof. Pitti), its structure, and the skill-building assignments. Prof. Pitti is an extremely knowledgeable and empathetic listener and mentor; he always makes himself available to clarify course content, respond to your weekly reading response, and provide guidance for any of the assignments. The class has an easy structure to follow -- you read that week's book or chapters, write a response, and come to class ready to discuss it. There are overall three main assignments that build on each other -- the first teaches you how to search for primary sources in a database, the second teaches you how to analyze several sources on a topic, and the third asks you to build a museum exhibit using many primary sources. It could be improved with better timing of the assignments, in my opinion. The museum exhibit project felt rushed toward the end of the semester, even with the prospectus several weeks prior to the final project's deadline. It'd be great to have more guidance as far as when we should have our primary sources picked out, when to meet with a librarian, when to have a draft done; unfortunately, since this project was our final, many of us procrastinated to the point of doing all of these steps in the last week of classes. It would have been so much more enjoyable to have started finding sources earlier on in the semester should we have been more proactive; while taking this initiative was definitely our responsibility as students, it would have been great to structure the earlier assignments around the exhibit project, perhaps, or to provide "guidance" deadlines to keep us on track throughout the semester. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I thought that the lecture-seminar hybrid was really effective, and the TFs were great. 
Weaknesses: This is not so much a weakness as it probably is a limitation of the scope of the class, but the works we read do tend to be skewed toward the US Southwest and Mexican-Americans; however, this is not Professor Pitti's fault and is perhaps more due to historical and demographic reasons of Latinx populations within the US. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really liked the learning environment of the class, Professor Pitti and the TA's did a great job creating a comfortable and engaging classroom dynamic, even over zoom. I also really enjoyed the books we read, that were for the most part, extremely interesting. However, after reading a long academic book every week, I experienced a lot of burnout and often was unable to complete all the assigned reading. I would have appreciated some different kinds of readings that weren't only relatively-dense academic non-fiction, perhaps some fiction, poetry, music, essays, films, etc, that would offer another way to consider Latinx history. Furthermore, I would have appreciated more readings specifically about Indigeneity and Blackness within and in relation to Latinidad, especially by Afro-Latinx or Indigenous-identifying authors. I did really appreciate the focus on queerness and gender in migration. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Pitti and the TFs were a major strength; they were all very kind and accommodating.  The assignments were all doable yet also felt meaningful, and the final project (a museum exhibit proposal) allowed for more creativity than usual term paper assignments. I also really appreciated the opportunity to interact with the authors of the books we read.  

My only criticism is that the class straddled an odd structure at times-- somewhere between a seminar and a lecture. I think the large class sessions might have been more effective if Professor Pitti had lectured a bit more, and then we left the discussion for our smaller sections instead of having a 60 person discussion. I really enjoyed the days, usually on Tuesdays, when Professor Pitto would ground our readings for the week with some videos, images, extra content, etc. I would have liked more of this content within the main group meetings. 

I would also recommend highlighting certain chapters to focus on for each week's book (some of the 300-page books were a bit much to knock out in a week). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really enjoyed this course. Professor Pitti is great and his TFs are just as good. I enjoyed the readings and discussion sections. While all the readings were interesting, I felt that the weekly discussion posts were sometimes more tedious than fun--maybe cutting down on how many discussion posts are required would help. I also felt that the greater focus of this course was on Mexican history only rather than Latinx history, which is encompassing of many other peoples and countries. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course would be improved if there was a greater focus on Latinx communities with heritage from South America. There was not a single reading about a country in South America, which was a bit disappointing as a majority of the readings throughout the semester focused on Mexican, Mexican-American histories. Another improvement would be having a lecture from the professor about the context of each week's book. A strength of this course was having the books' authors give a guest appearance in our virtual classes. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I appreciated the array of texts throughout the semester, but I often found it difficult to manage reading essentially a whole book per week. I think making the readings shorter or less frequent could have helped me digest the content better. Furthermore, I wish the class had included more Central American and Afro-Latinx voices in the readings. Finally, the grading rubrics were a bit vague, so I was not sure how my presentation/projects were evaluated. Overall, I really enjoyed the class and learned a lot from it. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The mix of lecture and discussion within the actual class time was a great way to learn about the books we read from Professor Pitti, and also get the opportunity to discuss them ourselves. The very varied assignments also made the class a really enjoyable experience in that sense. However, I'd say that a weakness of the class was the sheer amount of reading asked of us. A book a week is a lot, and it was definitely an opportunity to practice "skimming" which at times was frustrating as the books were so engaging at times.  Furthermore, while I understand the desire to follow a somewhat chronological history, by focusing so heavily on Mexican American histories in the South west in the first month or so, I felt that the scope of the class was naturally limited. The books in my opinion should be more mixed and give voice to different histories more equally. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the course covers a wide array of subjects. When Stephen lectures, its nicely structured and engaging. Weaknesses: the reading load and class structure. Every week, we were required to a read an entire book - not short 100-200 pages ones, but 300+ dense books. We were given no direction as to what we should focus our attention toward. Since each book was extremely comprehensive and chronicled a profusion of historical events, discussion section was aimless, and it felt like students were battling to discuss the parts of the books they had read. Perhaps, if clearer guidelines and expectations were given, then discussions could have flowed better - but this depended  on the teaching assistant students were assigned. And it seemed like the professor was still trying to figure out syllabus given this was the pilot semester. The class met twice a week, and class would open with stephen giving a lecture. Midway, wed break into our assigned sections for discussions. As the semester progressed, less and less time was devoted to lecture. Instead, we engaged more with our section and teaching assistants. It would have been nice to have more exposure to other classmates and teaching assistants - or even to have been in Stephens section since many students signed up for this class expecting more instruction from him. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â First, the fact that the instructor planned and taught this course during the pandemic is already an incredible strength; COVID-19 tested the limits of virtual instruction, and the ability for this course to remain organized is a testament to this strength. Also, I think varying the forms of instruction between lecture and seminar was insightful because it provided a change in pace every so often. However, while these varying forms of instruction were beneficial, it was difficult to enjoy this format at times because of time scarcity. Lectures would go into seminar times, which would truncate discussion time and make it difficult for peers to bounce ideas off on another and get to know each other. Being mindful and/or shortening the length of lectures could be a solution but would be detrimental to instruction. Perhaps creating a section for this class and dividing lectures and discussions into separate time blocks could be a better alternative if possible. Another weakness is the class readings, of which half center a specific Latine population and the other half only have 1-2 books discussing other populations. Of this problematic half of six books, there are repetitions in themes and histories that other books within that group of six already discuss and it would be more beneficial to switch out some of those books for others that address Latinidad in places like South America, which was discussed rarely, if at all, or in Black and Indigenous populations/nations/communities. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was exceptional, though it could be improved with a lighter weekly reading load, which students often struggled to keep up with and condense a whole book's worth of information per week, especially given the online format of the course which already serves as a deterrence to engagement. <br/></div>
