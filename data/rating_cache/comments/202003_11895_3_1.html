<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The midterms were all in a poor format and they forced us to be on Zoom with the 200 other kids while we were taking the exam. Since the material wasn't taught well in class we all had to self study and then when the exam came around it was really hard to engage. It just wasn't the appropriate learning or test-taking environment in my opinion. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Recorded lectures and live sections were good 
The testing was terrible though -- I haven't heard of any other online class having 2 midterms and a final (all closed note, on Zoom, timed at 1 hour each (2 for the final)) counting for your ENTIRE grade. All of our homework was only 10% of our entire grade, so it literally all depended on those tests. the tests were also all multiple choice style on Canvas, which means there was no partial credit, so I feel like my grade did not reflect the work I was putting in (at least 2-3 hours every day of the week) or my knowledge of the material at all. They also had no syllabus and came up with all of this stuff on the fly -- so stressful and time consuming <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was so unaccommodating and run as if we weren't living through a pandemic. The professor and preceptor proctored our exams at 9 AM EST, meaning that folks on the west coast were forced to wake up at 5 AM to make it to their 6 AM exam. They also decided to remove one of our three exams, giving us only two options to decide our fate without the option to drop any exams and instead make the final worth 40% of our grade. There was no empathy from the professor and preceptor. Honestly, this course only exacerbated the stress of living through a global pandemic and I could have really used the support and instead found only anxiety. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lecture format was terrible. Dr. Jorgensen sounds better on 2x speed and he merely just reads from prewritten notes. The level of engagement at 9am was outstandingly low. Any other lecture formate would have been better than the methods used for the Fall 2020 semester. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I did not feel like the live lecture was engaging. It would have been more engaging if the professor had written out examples while lecturing instead of showing pre-written PDF pages. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was very helpful to have the lectures recorded and have important notes uploaded to the Files section. The lectures were not very engaging and often hard to follow due to the Professor and his hard-to-read notes. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The keys for all of the midterms we take in the class should be posted on Canvas. I would get answers wrong and even though I went to my discussion section to understand, I lacked a clear rubric outlining the steps of each question. Section is also only 50 minutes, which does not give enough time to properly review each question. The lack of these rubrics/keys had a significant negative impact on my learning. Secondly, there is only so much professors can do given the circumstances--I also understand that each professor has their own preferences. At the same time, I feel that there were many opportunities where there could be more student participation during the lectures. Students could only ask question by running them by the instructor. I've taken other STEM classes at Yale and the lecture style was more engaging.

I appreciated how there were peer tutoring hours almost everyday and that the TFs also had lots of hours. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A lot could be improved. The teaching style was not tailored to learning during the pandemic. Organic chemistry is not a regular math or chemistry class where you can just learn numbers. Its all about models and applying your knowledge. That is hard to do over a screen. If the professor had put in his own effort to get an iPad or use models or actually show us more practice problems in class rather than subjecting students to 1.5 hour long monotonous lectures, I believe the course would have worked out better. The teaching team did put in the time to provide office hours and TA sections. I do believe that was successful for those who utilized this resource. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course did negative amount of work to help us as students in a pandemic. The exams did not test us proportionally to what was covered in class and had multiple trick questions. There were sometimes two entire chapters chock full of difficult material stuffed into one week of class (two 1 hr, 15 min windows). The only virtual engagement there was were normal office hours, but no study halls. Students in different time zones either needed to wake up or stay up at odd hours of the night to take the exams since there was very little sympathy from Prof. Jorgensen and Dr. Clark for students going through a difficult time during the pandemic. Other students were also refused their requests to take the exam at another time that would have been more convenient for them in terms of time of day. (Several students had to take their exams around 6 am or later,  but far earlier than 9am, because of their time zone differences.) They also paid very little attention to exam formatting feedback, where we asked that the exams may be given in a written format and then uploaded to Canvas instead of having mostly multiple-choice tests. I know this isn't too much to ask for: the past exams we were given as practice for our own exams all contained questions where we could explain our work or draw it out instead. In short, our exams did not compare in difficulty, material, or format to past exams. 

I need to leave the TF's and PT's out of this because they were really great and helped the students who were struggling and set up great review sessions for us, but the instructor and head TA Dr. Clark were not helpful and did little to alleviate our concerns for our academic year in the context of the pandemic. And it isn't that there was nothing else they could do; professors in other hard science departments at Yale give it their all when it comes to supporting us as students and making sure our academic resource needs are met. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Recorded lectures are always helpful, especially when one wants to come back and review material. I do think the exams could be improved upon, where more specifically, I felt that multiple choice exams are okay, but if they have a written portion, then that should be considered take-home to allow for completion and reduce the time-crunch and time-pressure when also trying to answer multiple choice. <br/></div>

The one strength of the course was the way exams were administered, particularly the last exam (as the prior no-free response/partial credit exam seemed to have some issues, but the professor/preceptor course-corrected remarkably well after hearing student feedback). By keeping everyone on zoom with mics on and monitoring when students left the canvas page, I believe they were able to minimize academic dishonesty as much as is reasonably possible while also allowing for a testing environment that did not add significant stress over what an in-person exam would have produced. <br/></div>

Instead, they were already written down for us, which is not as helpful for comprehending and retaining the information.

Also, the constant issue with the Saplings were annoying. I liked how the lectures were recorded but the professors didn't seem to understand that students would also watch the recorded lectures and made negative comments about students not attending lecture despite students being in different time zones. The lectures also definitely could have been more engaging and informative.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Live lecture was a good move for this course.

Professor should change the lectures notes formateither use more color and clearer handwriting, or take notes live while lecturing. It was overwhelming seeing all these structures and mechanisms drawn out already at once, and many times you didnt have enough time to write down during lecture because he underestimated how much time it takes to write down each topic during lecture. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The online components of this course were relatively successful in conveying information in lecture. As expected, some professors may have trouble adapting to technology, which was a slight hindrance in this course (opening windows, minimizing and maximizing screens for visibility of material being presented, Zoom audio, etc). It may be helpful to offer additional training oriented around technology for professors who may benefit/want these. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Of all of the courses I've taken since the beginning of the pandemic (or perhaps the beginning of my academic career), this may have been the worst pedagogical experience I've ever encountered. I don't expect a super high level of professionalism from these online courses, and I understand that the professors don't have much support in making them, but I do expect a little more than a poorly scanned assembly of hand written looseleaf that I suspect in normal times would be lecture notes for the benefit of the lecturer and not the students. I mean, at least make it full screen. I also resent the course's maximum security approach to online testing. Of course, academic honesty and cheating are serious business, but the automatic assumption that your students are scumbags by nature is more than a little off putting, and no other department feels the need to make their students jump through anywhere near as many hoops. All that aside, if the questions on the test are really so fragile that anyone with access to a book or a search engine would totally invalidate them, then why even bother? Surely any subject actually worth learning should be about understanding concepts and their applications, not memorizing the steps of one particular reaction. For example, the challenge in synthesizing one compound from another should be in framing the problem in terms of chemical concepts and processes, not seeing who can memorize what products permanganate forms at different temperatures. Again, this is just a thought, but any test that's incredibly sensitive to cheating  (i.e. memorization based) probably wasn't engaging much of the mental capacity of the students anyways. I'm here to learn chemistry, not mnemonics. Time to take a page out of the physics department's book here. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The variety of sections and their times worked well to allow students of all regions to easily fit into a spot. The course was well organized and easily allowed people to catch up via the recorded lectures. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The amount of office hours were extremely helpful.  

The live, synchronous midterms and finals at 9am EST really does not accommodate for students in other time zones. The teaching staff said that it's because a lot of the class is pre-med and that pre-meds need to be prepared to get up at early/odd hours anyway, but it's not really fair for students in other time zones. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Personally, I felt that this course had several problems within a virtual format. This was a large lecture, and very few (if any) students ever turned on their cameras. Watching one instructor talk for the entire lecture was often very disengaging. For this reason, I believe that breakout rooms should be incorporated into the live lectures more often in the future. 

The greatest problem, however, was the poor translation of exams into a virtual format. Writing organic chemistry mechanisms is an artistic skill that cannot be truly showcased in a multiple choice format. Personally, I believe that the best test format was the second midterm, which combined a multiple choice/fill-in-the-blank timed section with a take-home written section that students later scanned in. However, this formatting would have been even stronger if students were allowed to submit a pdf of their work on the timed section as well, as I believe that having the chance to show ones work could have enabled students to gain partial credit. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Improvement - Discussion Section!!!! Make TA's go through topics as if teaching kindergarteners. More students would get more out of discussion section if it wasn't meant for people who already knew the material. Instead of having students individually go through practice problems, teach them how to do an example yourself and then allow space to do a different problem. Give practice problems. Have a bank of practice problems that were not on an online format. I was doing problems that I did not know were too easy for the course, so I was struggling when it came to the final exam because all the hours I studied were based on practice problems given to me, but also from the textbook that were easier than the exam was. Be straightforward about what's being on the exam. <br/></div>
