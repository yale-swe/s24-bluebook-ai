<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the course was built well and the curriculum was interesting. I think the paper being due right after Thanksgiving was kind of unfortunate. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Being virtual is any obvious point of detriment, but not due to the instructors at all. It could perhaps be improved by altering the weekly assignments so that students could have clear and frequent feedback each week to know if they are following course lectures properly and learning at a sufficient pace. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: doable workload, passionate Professor, helpful TAs and peer tutors
Weakness: lectures can get long, very broad topics make it hard to know what to study for <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - Very engaging professor and Piazza.

Weaknesses - There were only two exams for the class, two PSETs, and two writing assignments. Compared to past BIOL classes, I would have preferred if there were more quizzes/PSETs to demonstrate our abilities instead of having our grades to be mainly determined by the two exams. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Very clear that Prof Edwards put a lot of effort into creating interesting lectures, good logical flow. I originally thought that taking a midterm prior to the election was dumb, but given how stressful the election was, I'm very glad we did. 
Weaknesses: Didn't quite understand the logic behind making the exams closed-book, particularly since most of us will not study ecology past this course. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: professor is amazing! She was the best professor to teach during covid and made everything about this class so engaging. The material is the most interesting and definitely the best class in the entire Intro BIO sequence
Weaknesses: There were writing assignments instead of PSETs for the last 4 weeks of the class. It would have been helpful to have some sort of PSET instead of the writing assignment so we could keep up with the classwork and the material on a weekly basis. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lecture format was great and clear; writing projects were also creative and informative without being too overwhelming. Sometimes the open-ended questions on exams felt too open-ended though (it was unclear what exact wording/answer they wanted). <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really enjoyed the pre-recorded lecture videos as I think they facilitated more diligence in focusing on the lectures since you could watch them when it was convenient for you. The course also allows students to be introduced to EEB. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of this course was Professor Edwards and all the TAs. Professor Edwards has been the most involved professor that I have encountered throughout the modules. It was very refreshing to have a professor who truly cared that you learned the material in the best way possible, without throwing unnecessarily large amounts of facts and figures. All the information presented was directly correlated with the course content. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was MUCH better than a typical bio sequence because I was able to actually slow down and learn the material at my own rate rather than being lectured at as quickly as possible <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The class honestly made me want to major in biology so don't have that many suggestions on improvements. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It wasn't clear how much we needed to know for the final. 
The lectures were really engaging and well done. <br/></div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: strong lectures 
Weaknesses: Very few examples of ecological topics in lectures and less reliance on textbook <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths- This was the BEST format for virtual learning. Dr. Edwards video style was PERFECT, I was able to soak up the material very well. 

Weakness- The exams were unnecessarily long. I wish quizzes were used instead, or the exams were shorted in length. <br/></div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â AMAZING PROFESSOR!!!!!!!!!!! The best STEM class and lectures I have seen at Yale. Professor Edwards is AMAZING! Even with recorded lectures, she is just so thoughtful and hardworking and caring, I actually enjoyed watching them. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â While the course felt very rushed and that we were jumping from one topic to the next, that was the only way we could've covered as much information as we did. I felt that the writing assignment was a very nice change of pace as it allowed everyone to choose to study information that they found interesting.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I thought the class was taught in an order that really solidified concepts. The TFs were really helpful and the papers we read helped reinforce the concepts we learning. Most importantly, I really like the lecture style. Not having slides and having to listen and take down notes was great. But, I think that works because you can replay the lectures. 

Weakness: I think ensuring all the explanations for each topic was difficult because of the online format. So, the professor would have to instruct people on new information during the review sessions and if you didn't go you would miss out on this information. And in regards to the review, I sometimes came out more confused than before 

Improvement: Just prepare more for lecturing. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The content was very interesting, and the chalk-talk style lectures were more effective than I expected at clearly communicating exactly what information we were expected to know. 

On the other hand, I thought that format did make the material feel more abstract at times, because there were fewer of the small, short examples that slideshows tend to be full of; at the same time, there were a lot of great examples, but because we tended to focus in detail on a few examples it was sometimes hard to distinguish the overarching principle from the specific example.

Another strength of the course was that the exams felt very fair and satisfying to take. I didn't enjoy the writing assignment homework as much (though that might just be my personal taste), and probably would have preferred traditional psets to reinforce the material.

Lastly, I thought that the last section of the class, while full of interesting topics, seemed to jump around a bit without a unifying theme. This wasn't a big problem, but did feel a little odd. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really liked this course overall, and I personally found it to be the strongest module of the bio sequence. I really liked Professor Edward's chalk talks, since they were a lot more engaging than lecturing with PPT slides as she would often insert demonstrations or actually present physical examples of certain plants she mentioned. In general, Professor Edwards is wonderful since she's a clear lecturer and she brings a lot of nuance to the course content. Plus, you can feel very clearly how passionate she is about her research. I also found the 2 problem sets to correlate well with the material on the first midterm. The writing assignment was a good chance for students to learn to read and analyze scientific literature, and I enjoyed that we had a lot of freedom in choosing which topic we'd write about. I also thought all the exams were very fair since the lecture content prepared students well. Overall, I also found the content of the course pretty engaging since ecology and evolutionary biology is one area that I personally did not have a lot of background in, and it also takes a very macro perspective unlike BIOL 101-103, so it was a nice change of pace. Finally, I think the papers we read for BIOL 104 were much more interesting than those for any of the other bio sequence modules. I really could not find any weaknesses with this class since everything was made clear from the start, and I thought the teaching team did a wonderful job this semester! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - plenty of opportunities to ask questions, phenomenal peer tutors 

Weaknesses - I had a few frustrations with this course. The first is that the professor used a "chalk-talk" style rather than slides, and although I get that the "chalk-talk" style might in theory force students to pay more attention during lecture, I think just seeing pictures of animals or structures with often zero text was very detrimental to learning even for someone who is very engaged during lecture. Watching lectures was SUCH a slow process because I had to write SO much down because zero info was on the screen-shots we were given of the lectures as "slides", and it forced me to constantly pause and restart. The lack of test on slides also made it really hard to figure out what terms were key terms to know and be able to explain during the definitions sections of exams; key terms are usually noted on a slide or in the study guides that are provided for all other bio modules, and this course had both no slides and no study guides. Another really key frustration was the ways in which exams were approached. I am sure that this is not an issue without COVID, but we were given a really long period (36+ hours) in which to do the 2 hr midterm and final, and the instructors shut down all communication (Piazza, meetings with TAs/peer tutors, etc.) during that period. This meant that by almost two full days before the exam was due, we couldn't ask any questions at all. I understand that time zone flexibility is important, but I think 24 hours would have been much more reasonable, as it is often just not possible to complete one's studying and clarify questions so far in advance of the exam's due date when students have so many other classes and commitments. This exam structure was particularly upsetting for the midterm because the instructors did NOT make students aware of this policy until the night before all communication was ceased. The instructors also did NOT make clear until 12 hours before the midterm opened on Canvas that it was closed note (I spoke with many other students about this issue and all were under the impression that the midterm was open note). The lack of communication was very frustrating. <br/></div>
