<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Unfortunately this was one course that despite amazing course content and lectures, did not provide a sufficient support given the ongoing COVID pandemic. Professor Snyder overloaded the reading amount. This is supposed to be an intro survey lecture course but I have never read more than I have for this class-- sometimes over 500 pages a week or 200 pages per lecture (we had two a week). And despite the material being interesting, the most difficult part was Professor Snyder's requirement that we take handwritten notes on all the material and submit them to our TFs by section. While the purpose of this note-taking exercise is acknowledged by students, we all suffered from physical and mental health due to this task. As Yale students we are meticulous notetakers, especially since this was relatively new material to everyone. It was stressful to submit so much work on time when the readings were by no means structured for introductory lecture. Had this course been a seminar, and all of us hoping to become Eastern European historians/specialists, this density of work would have been understandable. But the pandemic continues and it just unfortunately seemed that Professor Snyder increased the workload rather than adjust it to the pandemic at hand. Of all courses that ever needed a midterm feedback form, this was one that REALLY needed one so that students could communicate with Professor Snyder that this approach was not working; he himself was never very available besides minimal office hours that were at difficult times. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â the recorded lectures were nice, but I also felt like I never connected with the professor, which is kind of sad
Also, I like the format of a 24-hour exam theoretically, but the assessments (final and midterm) were WAY too long and intense for 24 hours. I was up until 6am every time, after working all afternoon and evening, in order to finish them. Very stressful and exhausting <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was too much being forced to take notes to every reading and handing them in. Also the recorded podcasts were okay but made me feel very alone in this course, I think a video recording would have worked better. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Way too much work added for Covid. Handwritten reading and lectures notes, a new massive final assignment, and midterms that took entire days to do when Prof. Snyder said they would only take an hour or two. Fantastic course but really didn't like how much work was added during an already really difficult and stressful semester. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think a hybrid between podcast and zoom might have been better. The podcasts worked but I still don't really know what my professor even looked like which I find somewhat disappointing (not that that is important but it highlights the impersonal aspect of the class). <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class became almost entirely asynchronous since Professor Snyder chose to make lectures in podcasts. His intention with this was for us to be able to take our eyes off the screen for a while and maybe take a walk. This was likely also meant to lower the stakes for us. However, we were required to take notes on lectures and turn them in every week.While I think it was well-intentioned, what ended up happening was that I would sit down with my laptop and pause constantly to take the notes rather than staying away from the screen and walking. I think if notes were not required for the lectures, this would have worked better. However, I appreciate that I can go back to these podcasts and refresh on the history. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the podcast form of lectures was great. It was very instructive and I was able to go back through the lectures to replay various parts I may have missed. I think the readings could have been more concise and chosen better as there was simply a mountian of literature to go over and not all of it felt particularily effective. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The podcast format made for a welcome break from staring at my screen for hours a day of Zoom classes, and the flexibility of the asynchronicity made the work much easier to balance with my other courses. Being able to slow down or re-listen to the podcasts was incredibly helpful when navigating through complicated series of events. That being said, it would've been nice to have at least one live meeting with Prof. Snyder to bridge the asynchronous disconnect. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Perhaps it was the virtual nature of the class, because of which Professor Snyder had to come up with a different way to grade participation and engagement with the course materials. Since there were no lectures, only podcasts, he had no way of knowing if we listened to them and thus required us to hand in notes for each lecture and reading. I cannot stress how much of a burden this was. People absorb information in different ways, and to be given a prescribed way to engage with the material was very difficult. 

I would suggest conducting virtual lectures, and marking attendance instead. Scrapping out the chronology assignment or making its requirements so that is doesn't waste so much time. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Pro: Less time on zoom this was great and really helped alleviate fatigue; but would have loved to have video recordings of Snyder actually giving the lecture (would have felt more like a class and been more engaging). 
Cons: Handwritten notes for all of the readings this helped with engagement for a little while, but by the middle of the semester they became quite tedious and unmanageable as other courses (like seminars that justly have more reading) began to pick up. It was also quite clear that some TFs were stricter on the quality of notes than others (not from the fault of the TF, but from Snyder being pretty checked out of Yale as he was in Austria all year). Pandemic Empathy Break Days were respected for the most part (lectures and sections did not occur on Break Days); however, because handwritten reading &amp; lecture notes were still due regardless of there being a break day, you never actually had a meaningful break from the course. I don't know if this was a clear violation of Break Day policy but I would probably think yes. In general, there was low empathy for students throughout the course. Snyder had office hours twice a week (one in the afternoons on Thursdays which was reasonable and then another slot starting at 6AM on Fridays please tell me who is actually attending that). He was also completely unreachable by email (his yale.edu email) unless you were just looking to hire him for an event, find out how to purchase his books (of which he already made all of his students purchase two of them). I also ultimately ended up having to credit/d/fail this course because of the organization of the last 2 assignments (40% of your grade left up to the last week of classes) in which we had to turn in a 100 date chronology after having no checkpoints/checkins from TFs or Snyder the entire semester. The chronology was bad for a lot of reasons but the reason that was the most destructive for students &amp; the reason many ended up not taking the course for a letter grade was due to it being due on the Monday of the final week of classes while requiring a quote/citation from each reading we did throughout the semester while not allowing us reading week to actually go through the course packet/novels/books with ample enough time to complete this assignment on top of the other assignments due during that time. This is the ENTIRE point of reading week! How can you have a reading load that includes a 589 page course packet (closer to 1000 pages of reading because of the scans), 3 novels (probably around 700 pages), and 3 books (probably around 800 pages) and NOT GRANT EXTENSIONS OR SET DEADLINES FOR AFTER READING WEEK??? This was a reading intensive course and there was no time to have that reflected because of poor course planning. 

I have so much more to say about this but in general-- It was bad given the pandemic. In any other year, I doubt there would have been the same problems BECAUSE Snyder would be forced to be in New Haven and be available to HIS students who he is being paid to teach and engage with. Really, really disappointed in this class, professor snyder, and the entire teaching staff. Students had a hard time in this class, and it's really unclear to me whether any of them cared. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I would have preferred a recorded lecturer rather than the podcast format. My level of engagement was lower in part because it was difficult to remain focused on the material without actually seeing the instructor. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I did not like the podcast-style lectures. While I understand the rationale of wanting the students to focus solely on the professors words, I think the lack of a live lecture, with absolutely no visuals (even just his facial expressions or hand gestures) meant it was hard to stay engaged with the lectures sometimes. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked the podcast recorded lecture format, I think it provided a good amount of flexibility for students. Additionally, I thought that by submitting the notes by the end of the week helped me to not fall behind. I wish I could've done the notes either typed or written, especially for the readings since I normally type my reading notes. <br/></div>
