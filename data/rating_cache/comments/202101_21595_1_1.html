<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is unfairly hard. It is only 0.5 credits, but the course load is not reflective of that at all. Either the credit needs to be 1 full credit, or the course load needs to be decreased. Most course work was tedious and not necessary, so decreasing course work is definitely doable. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There are no strengths. Solely weaknesses. 

The class is unrelentingly harsh, filled with trick questions, abuse of break day policies, and 
 teaches you nothing. There is no practical knowledge on how to properly write lab reports or to learn the material: if it isnt in Naramshins desired way (which sometimes rejects scientific convention) you will suffer academically. 

The class eats up hours of time, even in a virtual format. There is no oversight on Naramshins absurd policies and pace of work: pre-lab quiz, post-lab quiz, and lab report all due on the same day. To top it all off, the rigor and stress of the class is masked as Naramshins passion for chemistry. This is anything but true. He has single-handedly transformed chemistry into a harsh discipline instead of an interesting one. Every day that Naramshin continues to teach is a day that students are pushed farther and farther away from chemistry. If the goal is to turn people off from chemistry, Naramshin is a superb pick. 

I refer to Naramshin synonymously with the class as he is the driving force behind its awful structure. He is singlehandedly responsible; he refuses to let TAs stray from what be thinks is best, removes points if you dont follow his specific (and scientifically incorrect) rules. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The quizzes I think are too hard overall. With all the prep for them, I still think they are quite difficult. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: some of the experiments were interesting.
Weaknesses: the instructor is not very helpful or responsive to problems; the lab reports take a ridiculously long time to complete; the number of videos required for each class is ludacris; grading is somewhat unfair; lab reports are dinged more points for wrong significant figures than actually having wrong answers; lab report grades also vary greatly by TA so be wary of that; quizzes are nearly impossible to complete in the time limits and the material covered on the quizzes was often mentioned in passing in one of the millions of videos. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of the course are the TAs and the breadth of the experiments we get to do. The weaknesses are that it is not exactly aligned with the general chemistry syllabus, so you work on something in lab before seeing it in lecture. <br/></div>

</div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â S: Individual TAs doing lab. Easy to get help.

W: Not actually doing the lab. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: instructor is readily available to help students, lab reinforces concepts learned in chemistry class, a wide variety of skills are taught, course materials are very organized

Weaknesses: no partial credit seems to be given on quiz questions that have multiple parts to them. Why? 
The workload is a lot - maybe too much - for a half-credit course. I spent more time on this class than some of my one-credit classes.
It takes a long time to receive feedback on assignments and quizzes. I think there was only one lab report graded by the middle of the term. It's hard incorporate feedback if we don't receive until two weeks later, after which we might have made the same mistake on the week before's quiz or report. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class was very organized, with the lab manual being a great resource! I was also very appreciative of the formatted lab reports so we knew exactly what to provide. I believe the timed quizzes were given with too little time and on topics that were not clearly presented and/or present in the lab manual/pre-lab videos. It also took a long time to get feedback on lab reports, so I didn't know how to improve for the first three lab reports. 

I took Chem 163/7 in the fall/spring. This course does not align well with the lab. I often found myself self-teaching the concepts of the lab because these courses do not align. I didn't mind teaching myself but feel others would benefit more if the courses aligned their topics to occur consecutively or have the lab portion follow the topic background in lecture. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was well adapted for the remote format. I wish we had more time for the pre-lab and post-lab quizzes. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Dr. G and the TAs were very passionate about helping me learn Chemistry and keeping me engaged. Also, the fact that some of the labs paired up with each other was nice because it gave a week off from lab reports and lessened the workload for the class. However, one point I didn't like about the class were the weekly pre-lab videos we had to watch. While they were very informative, they took way too long and made the day before lab much more stressful, since not only did we have to watch the videos, but often had to do pre and post labs and at times the lab report as well. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Seems very redundant in the virtual lab format. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course could absolutely be improved by in person class. Also, pre lab lectures were lengthy and often repetitive to what we watched our individual TF do. This meant that we'd often have 4+ hours of instruction per week for a half credit course which seems excessive. I hope this could be rectified by just having in person lab. Additionally, the pre and post lab quizzes were also excessive. They just added stress with minimal value for online learning. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The TAs were great and make the lab run smoothly 
Weaknesses: Dr. G is terrible and adds additional, unneeded stress to the experience. In addition, all the labs were the exact same as when partners were allowed (before COVID) so the labs took twice as long for us to do since we had to do them all alone. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One weakness of this course is the difficulty of the lab reports. Completing the lab reports was very tedious and the questions asked did not aid my understanding of what the experiments entailed. Focusing on more relevant questions and calculation would make the course more enjoyable and less stressful. <br/></div>

The engagement during virtual lab sessions was also a strength of this course. The lab reports and quizzes supplemented what was presented in the videos and the zoom lab sessions. The course could be improved by lowering the workload, as well as ensuring that each person has understood certain experimental techniques, as the lab was conducted virtually for some. <br/></div>

Very helpful to have so many experiments and lectures recorded, useful in preparing for experiments and filling out lab reports.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Honestly, virtually, it was kind of boring. There were a lot of pre-lab videos which got the concepts across very well, but sometimes felt too long but that was necessary for the content. My lab section felt like it just rehashed all of the information and was simply to get data to then write the lab report. 80% of the lab report feels like busy work and 20% is actually understanding the data and helping my understanding of chemistry. However some of it was useful practice for exams.
However, the course is very useful if you are in Chem 165 because it is synced perfectly and provides very useful concept review. <br/></div>

Weaknesses: Gen chem... it's too varied in the topics that it hits, you may be learning a lot of things for the first time, and it doesn't help that you can lose points on your report for the smallest errors / missed detail (double - no, TRIPLE check those sig figs!). The most stressful part was probably the prelab/postlab quizzes, but work hard on your lab reports and it should balance out nicely! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â CHEM 136L is almost too reliant on the strengths of its Teaching Fellows. I had an amazing experience with this course only because my TF was so engaging, enthusiastic, patient, and kind. While my excellent TF made the course both enjoyable and enriching, students' experience with the course should not be completely decided by the TF they are assigned to. Here lies the weakness of this course. The actual foundation of it does little to involve students as the lab reports themselves are formulaic and designed to test whether you're able to name-drop details of the procedure rather than whether you actually understood the content. The quizzes are similarly confusing, once again focusing on minutiae like the color change of a specific liquid. Moreover, the pre-lab quizzes often include calculations that were briefly touched on (and once not mentioned at all) in the pre-lab reading. Often, only after doing the lab report (so a week after taking the pre-lab quiz) would I understand how to answer some of the pre-lab quiz questions. This makes the course itself feel like a chore, rather than encouraging deeper enthusiasm for and understanding about chemistry, it focuses on whether you can memorize obscure facts. Perhaps that's the intention with the class but I don't think it should be. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I think the biggest strength of this course is that it's broken up into sections, and that the section T.F.s are extremely helpful (or at least mine was) when I had questions regarding the course material. Additionally, even though he has a reputation for being tough, I do believe Dr. G has each and every student's best interest in mind. He always makes himself available to teach students when they don't understand something, and I believe he has a true passion for chemistry.
Weaknesses: There were many weaknesses with this course, but I don't believe that many were specific to 136 vs 134, especially since 136 was online for me, and 134 was in-person. The quizzes were considerably more difficult than last semester, but I think that overall, they were fair. As always, there is a severe disconnect between the amount of work required for this course and the amount of credit you receive. I don't know how many students have to say this for Yale to listen, but it's honestly disappointing that they are still under the assumption that this class should be worth half of what a lecture is worth, especially given the fact that I consistently spent 5x the amount of time on lab than lecture. I know that specific change is larger than a decision that Dr. G can make, but it would be wise for Yale to reevaluate the rigor of this course and accredit students accordingly. Secondly, I do believe that there was inconsistencies between how the T.F.s graded lab reports  I believe I consistently produced equal-quality lab reports, yet, my grades varied up to 10 points. Lastly, I think that the purposes section on the lab report is redundant and not at all conducive to learning. The point of it is to make sure that students fully understand the methods and objectives of the experiment, but that is well-covered in the quizzes and the rest of the lab. Instead, it ends up being a place where you lose points over missing, quite literally, a single word. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The grading of lab reports should be less nit-picky; I think we should be tested on how well we understand the course material in lab reports, not how closely we followed guidelines of the lab report for things like graph formatting and proper use of significant figures. You can easily do poorly on a lab report despite understanding all of the concepts and procedures due to improper formatting (graphs, sig figs, etc), which I don't think is a great test of our knowledge of the concepts learned in the course. 

Pre-lab lecture videos posted online were very very helpful in taking the quizzes and understanding each lab! So is all of the background info in the lab manual and the example calculations. Also, despite being more work, the quizzes before and after lab were helpful in reinforcing course concepts as well. 

Also, despite the fact that this meant some of the lab reports were very long, I preferred having fewer lab reports in total (only 6 in gen chem lab II as opposed to 9 or 10 in gen chem lab I) , because this gave us weeks off where we didn't have to submit anything, which was super nice! For this reason gen chem lab II was actually much more manageable and less stressful than gen chem lab I. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Through this course, I was able to visually and experimentally witness many of the concepts discussed in the accompanying lecture course. I was able to see a few of the experimental techniques discussed in the lecture course (e.g. the van't Hoff analysis, acid-base titration) performed in real time. The prelab lectures are overall beneficial for situating the week's experiments into a broader context and in order to disseminate key information in an auditory format. That being said, the benefits of this course end there. This course is simply too much work for the amount of credit that it is. The course is quite literally more work than the accompanying lecture course, even Chemistry 167. The lab reports are very involved, which is inherently not detrimental, but when coupled with the fact that there is a prelab quiz for every week's experiment as well as a postlab quiz accompanying each lab report that was often just as difficult than exams in the accompanying lecture course, the involved lab reports (up to 15 pages of work when all was said and done) become overwhelming. Not to mention, the prelab and postlab quizzes often felt more like typing tests rather than chemistry quizzes considering the nature of typing calculations into a computer. While I appreciate the sentiment of teaching all of us the applications and usefulness of chemistry in more of a real-world context, there is absolutely no reason for this course to be more work than the accompanying lecture course. Additionally, in this semester specifically, there was some redundancy in having to watch the entire experiment be performed by the instructor as well as select aspects of the experiment be performed by the Teaching Fellow in every session. However, the experiment being performed by the instructor during in-person instruction is a useful tool and a strength of the class when the class is in its in-person iteration. <br/></div>
