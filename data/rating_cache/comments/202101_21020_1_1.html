<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course often took large tangents away from the core material. It would have been nice to save these as optional at the end of class or for extra days. It often made the material more confusing and application in psets more difficult. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths:
Very clear lectures during which the professor was always willing to answer questions or clarify content. Covered interesting material and makes you a much better informed citizen, as the stuff talked about in this class is constantly in the news. PSETS had a nice mix of theoretical and data handling questions which both helped understand/extend the theories in class as well as see how they corresponded to real world empirical phenomena. The structure of the course by and large was good, with us moving on from a model after we saw its deficiencies and progressing to a model which clarified those deficiencies. 
Weaknesses:
The biggest weakness I would say is that although generally good, the structuring sometimes felt a little bit unmotivated. This was especially true in the inequality section, where although the information was quite interesting, it felt somewhat detached from the other two parts of the course. Maybe this is inevitable, but if so then it was weird to put it in-between the short and long-run sections of the course which somewhat naturally connected. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: psets are really helpful, Fabrizio cares about his students (he tries not to pace himself too fast), and Pedro is a gem!
Weaknesses: perhaps the final is weighed a bit much, but I think it is very fair <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths:
- Very fair
- Clear, structured content
- Very communicative
- Section helpful

Weaknesses:
- Some parts of exam were all or nothing which may not be good for curve <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was everything that I expected it to be, it had clear lectures and weekly problem sets. Overall, there were many resources and the whole teaching staff made learning macroeconomics quite enjoyable. One improvement I could suggest is to decrease the weight of the final exam which is worth 50% of the final grade. This could be a source of stress to many students but I understand that the course is graded on a curve so it is still a fair policy. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - fabrizzio is a great lecturer - he paced the content at good pace and explained everything intuitively.
I wish we did more real world applications. Not sure the significance of all this. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The class went very fast--I think Professor Zilibotti treated us more like grad students than undergraduate students. The tests were also very difficult. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â - strengths: the tfs were all wonderful and tried their best to teach us the material even when it was really confusing
- weaknesses: 1) there were no actual review sessions for either the midterm or final and instead they just held office hours; I feel like this arrangement made it much harder to study for the exams 2) sometimes the tfs would not even know the answer to some of the questions on the practice exams or couldn't really explain some concepts; made it very frustrating for us as students to understand it if those who were teaching us didn't know what was going on either <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The ppt slides contain relatively few information, making it hard to serve as a review material for the exams. But other than that, I've learnt a lot about macroeconomics and really enjoyed the process in the course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Instructors really cared about student feedback and lightened the course load, which was really appreciated. It can feel like a lot of work and overwhelm you a bit, but overall the virtual format was well taught. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was taught well and the topics were interesting. The TAs were extremely helpful -- sections and office hours were great. The p-sets were a bit on the lengthy side given that they were due each week rather than every two weeks, but other than that, there is nothing that could be improved. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Well organized, teaching was very clear, and Prof Zilibotti made the material interesting. I appreciated that we could drop two psets. 
Weaknesses: The problem sets were fairly inconsistent in length - some were really long. Also, I thought that on the psets (and sometimes exams too) there was perhaps a bit too much emphasis on doing algebra correctly instead of the economic principles <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Fabrizio was very kind and genuinely wanted students to enjoy learning macroeconomics, and the TA's and peer tutors were great. That being said, this was likely the hardest course I've taken at Yale. Even though I met the prerequisite and reviewed over break, I did not feel mathematically prepared for this course nor expected to have so much Excel graphing without that being taught in class. I had not taken intermediate micro (not a prereq) but I feel it was assumed we knew some of those skills. Sections were devoted to learning how to actually solve problems rather than review, and I would not have gotten through this course without attending multiple office hours every week. I prepared extensively for the exam, but did not feel it completely paid off. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is strength was its organization. We spent a few weeks on long run, a few weeks on inequality, and closed the class with a few weeks on short run. One weakness of this course would be the slides and presentation of course material. Oftentimes, methods outlined in class would deviate from methods outlined in section which would also deviate from what we saw on our problem sets. There was also not much time given to the intuition behind models, and more time spent evaluating what types of problems we could encounter when using the model. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked the instructor and the teaching style. I think that the class should have been cut with more assessments, like a second midterm -- it was too much to have 50% rely on the final. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I do not think I got as much out of this class as I could have. Now I have a lot of sympathy for professors teaching during the pandemic and I'm sure it must be hard to hold lectures over zoom, but there were some issues I had with the class. First, I think Fabrizio has a very indirect way of lecturing where he will introduce a model, but then 3 slides later, say that the model is incorrect and the real model is as follows. This will effectively make all of my notes up until that point useless. This is something he does for almost every model he introduces in the class (sometimes re-teaching a model multiple times within the same class), and as a result when I went over my notes to study for the final, I found them to be very disorganized and almost useless. I ended up rewriting my notes in a more organized manner just for the final. On a similar note, I found the lecture slides to be rather disorganized and difficult to distinguish the key concepts from the less-important material (eg. scratch work for deriving an equation). For example, we would often spend a ton of time examining some line graph (which ended up never being mentioned again in the rest of the semester), before rushing through 10 slides about a concept that was crucial to the problem set. I think this could be improved by periodically including summary slides or key concept slides to highlight the important takeaways (this is something he started doing later on in the semester, and I think that was a step in the right direction). The final for this class is also worth 50% of the grade, which is understandable since it is cumulative, but I personally thought it was too much since combined with the midterm it made the problem sets in the class worth almost nothing. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is extremely difficult. I think that the depth of the teaching in lecture often did not match the difficulty of the problem sets or exam questions. I often found myself having to rewatch the lectures multiple times, research topics on my own, or pursue hours and hours of separate office hours time to stay on top of the course material. It is misleading to think that this course requires only two lecture slots and a section. I would say I had to dedicate about 50% of my studying time to this course, even though I was taking four other classes this semester. Another major weakness was thatwith a number of notable exceptionsthe TAs really did not know how to answer many of our questions. They worked really hard on ED to answer everything, and the students really appreciated that, but they often didn't know the answers to Problem Set questions because they were just too hard. I think this was more of an issue with the overall difficulty of the course than the economic knowledge of the TAs. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was well structured and interesting. Professor Zilibotti was very positive and helpful in responding to asks for help. There are lots of TAs and office hours available during the week. ED (online platform where we asked course related questions) was also helpful. 

The course is almost perfect, with the exception of how stressful it is. I enjoyed the problem sets and didn't mind the high workload throughout, but the tests were extremely difficult and made the course stressful--they go far beyond than what was just covered in lecture. Even though the problem sets all made sense, the exams themselves were still difficult even after a lot of studying. Moreover, the curve for the course does not seem to be that generous because some people do well on the exams. Given pandemic times and the fact that everyone is studying under different conditions with different home life situations, the curve (which evaluates you against other students) does not seem to be fair. <br/></div>

Weaknesses: psets could get really long sometimes and they were really lenient with grading which was bittersweet because it was good for boosting that 20% of our grade but meant that using the psets to study off of wasnt helpful sometimes, the EXAMS omg no exam should be worth 50% of your total grade and the fact that the final was intentionally too long for most of the class to finish AND we didnt get our grades back we just got the final grade <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weakness: This course was basically a glorified algebra class. Although it was better than intermediate micro, the number of times where I was just doing rote algebra was frustrating. It would have been much more interesting to have a better understanding of the big picture of different concepts before delving into the more tedious algebra.

Strengths: Better insight on how the FED uses monetary policy and the government uses fiscal policy to affect inflation rates and causes recessions or booms in the economy. It was also somewhat interesting the learn the Solow and Romer models to understand factors for short and long-run economic growth. If Jihoon is still a TF, definitely attend his section and office hours! He was always so prepared and an absolute gem. Not only could I have basically learned the entire class from simply attending his section, but I was able to understand and complete my problem sets during his office hours. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course focuses a lot on the theory of what we study which is great. When it comes to the midterm and final, however, it is by far the mathematics that somewhat applies to the theory that is being tested. This makes it very punishing for students who might slip up once and instantly fall significantly due to the high curve. Instead, if a lot more theory was tested a lot more economic thinking would be tested instead of math ability. This is an econ class after all. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course did a great job teaching students about the macroeconomics behind the COVID-19 pandemic while sticking to the material taught in past lectures. The faculty did a great job accommodating students who had a difficult time learning virtually and setting up private meetings.

Still, the course could have been structured better. First, the lecture titles and numbers were so disorganized that it made reviewing exam material very difficult. Some of the lectures were even combined into one massive lecture with over a hundred slides towards the end of the course. Second, the course needs to do a better job of facilitating group work. Despite being assigned to a study group, I had to work on problem sets alone due to a lack of responsiveness from other students. Beyond assigning the groups, the course staff needs to find a way to check in on them in order to ensure that students like myself are not at a disadvantage. Third, the professor did not do a good job of clarifying what exam material we needed to know from the lectures. Some of his lectures were completely irrelevant because they were about current market events not being tested or his own research. <br/></div>
