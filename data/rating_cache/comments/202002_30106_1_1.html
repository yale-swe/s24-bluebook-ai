<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths:
- Professor Demaree-Cotton and all of the TAs
- Level of engagement with the material
- Readings
- The polls! <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Joanna really knew how to run an online course well! Everything was structured in a very purposeful way, and it made it very clear what we were supposed to learn from each segment of class. That being said, she also allowed a lot of time for us to discuss and learn from each other, really taking advantage of zoom and break out rooms so that we had different size group discussions throughout one class. 

The one weakness of this course may have been grading, but only minimally. For essays, it was hard to pinpoint exactly what caused a lower mark because there were no rubrics and just feedback on individual things within the paper. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The format of the course was obviously carefully thought through with regard to how to adapt the course for an online learning environment. Use of polls and breakout rooms were especially helpful to engage students in discussion and thought on the material covered. I think one topic I wished we would have covered toward the beginning of the term was the difficulty surrounding how to define and conceive of technology. For me, I found myself really intrigued by the thought of what does and does not constitute technology (like are clothes technology? fire? anything made by people? what about the way animals use basic tools?), and I would have liked to develop those thoughts more with others in the course. <br/></div>
</div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths:
- Lots of discussion, even online
- Lots of ways to engage, via polls, raising hands, etc.
- TAs and Instructor were very available
- Slides were very detailed and a good source of review
- Good feedback on papers

Weaknesses:
- Writing resources earlier in the class <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Of course, since this was a summer course, the turnaround for papers was quick. I wish I had had the chance to spend more time considering the prompts and revisiting my ideas. This isn't necessarily a flaw of the course, but rather a significant detail about the reality of a 5-week summer writing credit that one shouldn't overlook. As a writing credit, I think I would have benefited from the opportunity for rewrites, even if it wasn't to significantly change my grade. This would have allowed me to better my writing, which is the ultimate goal. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Uniquely with zoom; polls, chat features, and breakoutrooms all felt like they improved the the course expiernece. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Great organization, structure, timing. Course was divided into interesting and engaging sections. The mix between discussion and lecture was helpful and interactive. The material was thought-provoking  and important for any student and global citizen <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths are definitely the interactivity and the participation, as well as the reading selections and the structure of each lecture (breaking down reading, defining important terms, discussion). I do think that some of the readings were on the long and dense side. This can be useful, but it's also important to note that only two readings were assigned per class as a result, and thus we maybe only had access to one or two perspectives on the issues at hand going into class. Obviously, I'm not asking for more work (I think the amount of work in 2 readings per class was perfect), but perhaps shorter less substantive selections might be something to consider for certain issues? <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths were the discussions we had in groups. One weakness was rarely having enough time to get to everyone's points. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Good group discussion, and easy-to-follow presentations and activities. The readings were also interesting.
Weaknesses: the large size over zoom is not great, but that isn't something that can really be improved unless this class was turned into a seminar. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The grading is absolutely stupid. This is an intro class but they treat us like hardcore philosophy majors. They say they use the yale grading scale, which says that C should be the grade a good paper should get . Really harsh for no reason. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the only weakness with online summer classes is that they are so fast paced, but there is also a quick turn around of grades and assignments. I think a strength of this class is that the time we spent learning was very engaging. We used breakout groups and polls to really understand and stay focused on the material. I know I talked to some students and they were concerned about only one TA grading their papers (they brought up fairness concerns), but I didn't specifically see a lot of the issue. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think it was all good <br/></div>

</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think a strength was that we had a lot of discussions which simulated thought and encouraged positive disagreement. This is not necessarily a weakness, but participating in larger breakout rooms was out of my comfort zone. However, the smaller breakout rooms made up for missed conversation. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course is the wideness of issues we tackle, well-structuredness, and the clear guide of the discussion. Maybe the course could be improved if it provided more opportunities to review what we did in the preceding class, because I heard my fellow students in the breakout room finding difficult to recollect what they did in the past class. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths are great TAs (they are very fair and seem unbiased to different opinions in discussion)
Good participation between myself and classmates, and the prof and TAs would clarify that they understood the point you were trying to make

I don't see any weaknesses in the course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A major strength was the way that the class was organized. The expectations and assignments were clear, and I feel like the organization of the course really helped with my learning. A weakness was that sometimes, the smaller breakout discussions were pretty awkward because no one would want to initiate conversation. I think that in the future, having at least 5 or so people per room would be optimal. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Overall, the course was run neatly, and the progression through different topics was well organized. For the most part, the readings presented ideas in an unbiased way. In my opinion, the main weakness was that there was little feedback to our writing assignments. Tips and strategies for writing philosophy papers were given in class, but not much on an individual basis. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the readings and workload was very manageable, which promoted deep engagement and focus on singular concepts and ethical concerns, all while making philosophical writing very digestible. The mini discussions we had in breakout rooms were very helpful in giving us time to think about the points that classmates and author were putting forth, and gave time to respond to them to help us develop more informed and nuanced perspectives. The personal reflection project were super great and gave us opportunities to directly connect these sometime abstract concepts to our own real worlds. 

I honestly have nothing that I would change. I almost wish it was longer so we could go even deeper into the topics we discussed to give them the time and focus they deserved. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I'm hesitant to comment on the weaknesses of the course, because I think a lot of it stems from the class being online which I think makes a philosophy class in which you would like to be able to freely engage slightly more challenging. I thought Joanna did a great job giving everyone different times and spaces to comment to help with some of that feeling. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strength: Literally love this course so much. Joanna is extremely friendly, and more than willing to help you if needed. Many times through the course, I met with her for 15 minutes during office hours, which turned into an hour simply because she cares about her students. Then, hours later, I would even get an email recapping the call, or any lingering thoughts. So incredible, so dedicated, so kind. Joanna makes this class great.
-joanna recaps readings throughout the class so even if you miss a reading/don't understand one, it's very easy to participate in class. love this and wish more professors did this.
weakness: kinda work-heavy. the work isn't necessarily hard, there's just quite a bunch of it. but if you have the time to dedicate to the class, it's definitely doable. writing credits tend to take up a lot of time, so this is expected. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the course is well-structured overall, but it did seem that the classes were largely unrelated one-to-the-next, and it was sometimes difficult to locate materials on the Canvas page. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I think the TAs did a wonderful job of moderating discussions in breakouts. I felt after each discussion, even when I was initially unsure of my own opinion, I left feeling more convinced thanks to the prompts the TAs provided and the pertinent questions they raised. 
weaknesses: the reading required for each class was quite a lot, but still manageable. 
- I think it would also have been helpful to receive more feedback on written work (not every piece, but the more important ones) to see specific instances of effective and ineffective writing on which I can improve . <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I don't think it could be improved. It was great, every class was engaging and awesome and all the TAs were so nice and helpful at any moment during this course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the course was taught very well, given the online circumstances, and I really enjoyed the material. I thought every reading was fantastic, which is rare for a class, and I enjoyed our class discussions. However, I wish there was more emphasis on how to write a philosophy paper. I had taken an English class last semester and used my knowledge from that class to write the first paper for this class. I did not know that prior writing skills are not easily translated to this philosophy papers. I wish we had been given more instruction on the stylistic and contextual components of philosophy papers, as it would have helped me sharpen certain skills. Ultimately, I really enjoyed the course and learned a ton about a very interesting and relevant topic. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths are the discussions and the way that we get to engage with the material. It is not like a lecture at all and kept me very engaged for 3 hours early in the morning. Also the size and number of TAs allowed people to actually get questions answered in detail. The only weakness was maybe in the beginning the reading assignments seemed quite long but I felt like it got better. I do wish the reading assignments were due at midnight the night before rather than 9 because I personally was very busy during the day. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course's material was incredible. Really enjoyed the readings. I feel we could have benefitted from deeper conversation on a lot of issues. It seemed like wee spent a lot of time talking on the surface, doing polls, waiting to get to the meaty stuff but then never actually getting there. The readings clarified a lot of the context for us, so I would have liked the course more if we had spent more time actually getting into the issues we were discussing. Power point is inherently pretty boring, as it remains on the surface. That said, I recognize it is a huge challenge teaching a course on zoom, and also that this is an intro level class with students of different levels of comfort with the nature of the course, and I'm sure many of the issues I've pointed out would be solved had I simply taken an in-person philosophy class at school. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think that this course was amazing in that the workload was not overwhelming and was really respectful of the fact that we are dealing with a pandemic and that summer school was not the only thing in our lives. I also believe that the class made the most of Zoom and handled a rough situation to have class very well! 
I think a bit more facilitation during discussion could have been helpful sometimes because in the small breakout rooms I was frequently with people who refused to speak or participate and it was painful to get through. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course has an amazing curriculum, teaching staff and method of teaching. One of its biggest strengths is how much discussion is included into the class time, and the guided yet still very free nature of these discussions. One weakness is that it plunges into writing too fast without much guidance, which I think is difficult for people who have never taken/only taken a few philosophy classes. There is also not too much detailed feedback given on essays, so it is a little difficult to improve on your writing greatly. I think that, instead of loosely structured, often unengaging workshops, more time should be given for TAs to give detailed feedback and meet with students either during class or after to make sure that the writing process goes smoothly as possible. <br/></div>
