<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Sometimes it is very hard to 'put all of the pieces to the puzzle together.' Often, I understood each individual pathway/step in a reaction but then seeing the bigger picture and linking them together proved difficult. I guess this was due to amount of material condensed into a short period of time. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Clay makes mistakes when she tries to teach us material. The lectures are also very confusingly formatted and seem to not go in a logical progression, which makes the material harder to learn. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I wish there was a more broad outline / overview of the material and how many of the processes fit together. I felt like the slides delved into specifics before even discussing the major important functions and LOCATIONS of certain pathways and cycles. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Initially, I disliked the narrated lectures and problem sets during class. I think mostly because I wasnt sure which information I needed to focus on. However, as the class progressed and I got a better understanding of what material was important, the narrated lectures were helpful for me to learn at my desired pace. I would suggest reorganizing some of the concepts as it felt like some of the lectures jumped around a bit. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I enjoyed the flipped classroom, it helped me stay accountable and keep up with the course. However, it could have been spaced out a bit better, some lectures were short but some were incredibly long. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength of the course is that it gives you a decent overview of biochemistry. I believe that the flipped classroom structure of the course was challenging at times and that it was sometimes unclear what the most important concepts were, which made studying for assessments very challenging. I believe it could be improved if there were more transparency about the most essential topics, given the structure of the course and how short a time frame there is to learn everything. I also believe that the professor taught too much towards the MCAT at times, which was slightly frustrating for a non pre-med student. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The information chosen and the topics covered were always important, interesting and felt relevant. Professor Clay is also knowledgable about the metabolism section (not so much on thermodynamics or protein synthesis though), and she often increased my curiosity for the subject and explained the basis for a lot of medical conditions. 
Weaknesses: This course will beat you down and make you feel consistently inadequate. You will spend upwards of 5-10 hours on every lecture at home (flipped classrooms suck) and you'll stress out about the quizzes. I would often go into the dining hall for breakfast at 7:30am in the morning and meet my sleep-deprived classmates stressing over these daily quizzes. Although I generally liked Prof. Clay, she would blatantly lie about what was expected of us on quizzes - she would say to 'avoid minutiae and focus on concepts' yet the quizzes would subsequently test you on the littlest detail on eg slide 47 of part I of a lecture from the night before. The absolute biggest weakness, however, was the TA. He never once showed up to class and was ridiculously strict on grading the exams and quizzes. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: a summer class so you can fully focus on the material, flipped classroom lets you repeat the material as much as you'd like and really forces you to learn, the intense nature of the class helps you put together a comprehensive picture of what's happening your body 

Weaknesses: there is a ton of lecture/information to get through on your own, students must stay self-motivated to keep on top of the information, the daily quizzes have no drops, so there are no breaks, Professor Clay moves pretty quickly and expects you understand what's given 

The one policy I really did not understand was having the 5 extra minutes for finishing the exam after classes. People openly cheated, and we tried to talk to Professor Clay about it. I understand that we are under honor policy, but that feels like it flies out the window when people are openly not following the rules. A simple fix would just be to do the extra time right after the exam, seeing as the class would end at the same time regardless. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: interesting material
weaknesses:
a lot to digest in a short period of time. the daily quizzes were helpful because they forced you to stay on track, but they also were often more difficult than they needed to be and very stress inducing.

professor Clay was not good at explaining material. Even though she had good intentions, her explanations often did not make sense. It felt as though she was saying something she had memorized once, without really understanding the material. sometimes she would give us explanations that were blatantly false. the class would speak up, saying that the explanation did not make intuitive sense. She would then emphatically repeat the wrong thing she had said, without actually thinking through the problem at hand. only days later did she send us an email saying she was wrong. 

professor clay also very much buys into the premed mentality of grade-obsession. this is helpful because she is pretty transparent about grades, but she also doesn't seem to really care about students deeply understanding the material. If you asked her for feedback on an exam and you scored at or above the median, she would dismiss your questions saying: "but you did well!" it seemed that professor clay did not believe students could want to learn for the sake of learning. 

Prof clay was also very dismissive of questions in class. When she would answer a question, she would either give a cursory explanation or not answer the question at all. This was especially problematic in a flipped classroom where the whole point of class is for students to ask questions.

Her lecture slides with audio were incredibly confusing. They did not seem to have any clear structure. I often found myself writing down lists of things that seemed to have nothing to do with each other. Her verbal explanations were slow and unhelpful. 

Professor Clay also used the r word in class frequently--- not in the context of talking about people with mental disabilities. it was uncomfortable. she also made inappropriate comments about whitening creams, saying that the Asian and "African" women in the class are probably always told they should be using whitening creams. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of this course was that it was only 5 weeks because it was the summer. The weaknesses abound. Biochemistry should NEVER have been a flipped classroom. It makes sense for problem based classes like math or physics, but for something as memorization-based as biochemistry, it did not make sense. The slides that Nicole Clay made were garbage - they were full of errors, terribly organized, and included audio clips of Nicole Clay's voice. These clips often were mostly "ums" and "ers" rather than actually information, which when you're sitting and listening to them is ridiculous. Additionally, the problem sets were not helpful because we didn't even have time to do them fully in class. Getting into groups was unproductive and resulted in me only learning the problems that my group completed but not the problems that other groups completed. The quizzes during each class were similarly ridiculous, since they were testing the material that we had listened to the slides, not material that we had gone over together in the problem sets. They were often badly written, cryptic, and very detailed. Nicole Clay constantly said not to study too much or not to know the "minutia" but then exactly test the minutia on both quizzes and exams. In fact one time, she specifically told us not to study the initiation factors of transcription, but then there was an entire problem on the exam asking us to describe initiation factors. The exams were fine but very harshly graded. Nicole Clay did this super cute thing where she gave nearly the entire class an extra 5 minutes of time on a test AFTER she had lectured for over an hour, and everyone CHEATED by looking through their notes while she was lecturing. Several students went up to her before the tests were handed back out and asked her not to give them back since everyone had cheated, but she completely invalidated the students concerns, dismissing them by saying that the students who were looking at notes during the lecture were "conscious of the honor system" and wouldn't change anything. She even gave answers to the some of the exam questions while she was lecturing. Additionally, Nicole Clay was extremely offensive and mean in class. During the interesting facts introduction, someone gave their home town as their fact, to which she responded, "that's the most interesting thing about you?" She laughed in people's faces when they got answers wrong to questions. Once only one person raised their hand to a certain multiple choice answer, and she scoffed "You really thought that was the answer? Good for you! It's wrong!" She also once was looking for someone to answer a question, saying "Let's call on [name] because he's annoying." Nicole Clay also made several homophobic comments during pride month. When referring to transketolase, she said that you needed a ketose and an aldose, because you "can't have two girls together or two boys together." She also constantly medicalized race, by speculating that the differences in "Eskimos' metabolism" had a biochemical origin, and similarly with "American Indians." When talking about "Asian women, and I guess this applies to Africans too" and the practice of skin whitening using arsenic, her only comment was "Arsenic is the worst way to die! What a way to go!" <br/></div>
