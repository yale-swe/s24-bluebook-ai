<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course is strong at engaging students in a higher level of thinking and applying what we learned directly into the real world. The course could have been better if it was in person, but I understand the precautions taken due to COVID-19. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weekly writing assignments were helpful and really forced you to engage with the assigned readings, but I found the online format of the course really difficultyou're on zoom for 3.25 hour sessions twice a week. Hard to stay engaged for that length of time, particularly over zoom. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength is the format of the lectures with several breaks and discussion breakout sessions. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths of the course: the teaching team is absolutely phenomenal. Claudia is not only an expert in her field but a fantastic, personable professor. I want to take more of her classes. Also, all the TAs contributed a lot to the material of the course as well. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weakness: Not much specialized knowledge.
Strength: Professor was great. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths are the format was engaging and the material was great- really appreciated the non-Western focus. This is probably just due to the condensed nature, but I wish that there was more integration of the readings into class and just more time in general to sit with each area. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Only strengths, no weaknesses. It was engaging, interactive, important, and thoughtfully planned curriculum. I only wish it could have been in person :( <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: AMAZING interesting content, and Claudia is a great teacher. You can tell she is so passionate about what she's talking about. 
weaknesses: Honestly none! discussion was made a little difficult by the fact that we were online, but besides that it was great. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â literally only strengths. its perfect for a non stem person like me with zero interest or ability in science. I was super engaged the entire time and was genuinely interested in the subject material. The stuff we learn is super relevant to helping you live your best life <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was a fantastic learning environment, Claudia and the teaching team really cared about the students and built the course load considering the needs of the students. The meditation at the beginning of class really helped me feel focused to begin learning. I was sad we were not able to have an in-person version of this class as I'm sure it would have been even better. The only weakness I can think of is that the classes were a bit long, though I think the breaks really helped. So if I could change one thing, I think I would prefer shorter classes over a longer period of time. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Claudia is amazing. She was such a breath of fresh air every time we met, and her passion and care for the topics and her students made the course so much better. The expectations in terms of grading were clear. The workload was very manageable.
While it could not be avoided, I do feel as though 3 hour classes online were a bit much. Other than that, though, this course is pretty well organized and taught. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â While this course certainly did a good job of highlighting the social aspects of evolution and science, much of the lecture felt either far too complicated or entirely trivial.  I feel that this class easily could have had less than half of the lecture time and covered the same material. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course does a great job of making evolution and biological anthropology feel personal. It could have been an abstract study of these topics but every session found a way to relate to our daily lives. I found myself sharing so much of what we discussed with my family each night because it was so fascinating. This entire course provides an evolutionary context for the way we live our lives, which I am grateful for, and which I think so many people would benefit from if they had a chance to take this course too. Modern humans are just a blip on the giant timeline of this planet (#deeptime) and we are the products of natural selection. Also, more people need to understand that variation is OK and that western, industrial, educated, rich, and democratic societies are not the pinnacle of evolution or science! 

Weaknesses were that we did not have enough time to discuss these topics in break out rooms. Even though the course was already split up into really big chunks of time, it would have benefited from a (optional) section. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Prof. Valeggia's lectures, and her care/concern for students and for making the class an equitable space were great. Weaknesses: lectures felt really long, even with breaks, but I guess that was a byproduct of the class being offered online. Also, THE EXAMS WERE WAY TOO LONG! They took me +10 hours and I find that to be way too much and mentally draining. I would've much rather preferred a timed exam. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the course included a lot of opportunity for discussion, and the reading questions were open-ended and encouraged you to engage with the material. It was a great way to learn, especially in an online context where it's easy to feel isolated from the learning community. Thinking about universally relevant concepts like reproductive health and sleep was also a great way to apply the material and consider how it affects us in daily life. 
I really appreciated that the course started with a lecture on ethics. 
The breakout rooms were great - I loved getting to know a small group of people (especially considering the online context) and actively engaging with the material.
Weaknesses: the course focussed a lot on human medical/health issues (understandably). It focussed mainly on how environments have shaped humans; I would've liked to also consider how human evolution and biology have shaped environments/our relationship with the "natural" world (for example, the cyclical relationship of agriculture/human health/ecosystem health). 
That being said, it was interesting to learn about some basic medical concepts as a non-premed student! <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The interactive levels of this class were really well done. We were frequently put in breakout rooms to discuss issues and all students had the ability to speak up during class to ask questions and participate. All the TAs and the professor were very knowledgeable about the issues and very comprehensive in teaching the class material. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weakness: Just very long class time. 

Strengths: Professor Valeggia was a sweetheart and was very passionate about the topics which made the material engaging. The flash talks were also a good way to apply learned topics! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course is Professor Valeggia! She's one of the best instructors at Yale. She's super engaging, and I enjoyed her use of breakout rooms. She was incredibly considerate of different people's circumstances at home, which made the environment comfortable and personable. I also really liked the readings. I thought they were engaging, and, even as a non-STEM major, they were digestible. 

I think some of the earlier readings were somewhat lost towards the end of class. I wish we discussed later topics in the context of the readings from the first two weeks. Otherwise, I think the early textbook readings were somewhat useless, since they weren't practical or applied to future concepts. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures weren't very engaging, but Professor Valeggia is really a gem, and she's very invested in your learning and well-being. This is an intro level class, so don't expect too much in=depth material. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professor is engaging and amazingly sweet. She very obviously cares about her students and is willing to make time to talk and lessen whatever stresses they have about the class. The subjects are just very interesting. One weakness of the course is that the grading of reading responses is really arbitrary sometimes. They have "rubrics" that are extremely vague and the TAs have marked many people off on points that aren't explicitly indicated on the rubric. Also, since the course was online, the breakout rooms were basically the only time people had to participate, and there weren't that many. The topics of the breakout rooms when we did have them were not really what was interesting about the lecture (i.e. not synthesizing) but were based on activities that really didn't contribute to understanding. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: very broad, survey class that covered a lot of material, and the readings were especially interesting. Claudia is just a very interesting person, and her passion for the material makes the 3 hours pass by pretty quickly.
Weakness: I didn't like the breakout rooms very much  the conversations lack depth and dominated by a few people. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Claudia and the entire teaching team were very kind and clearly super passionate about the material, and topics were very interesting.

Perhaps the class could be modified to take place three times per week, two hours per session instead? <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Claudia and the teaching team! They were so very helpful and supportive and wanted to make our learning experience the best possible despite the complexities of having class over zoom and with so many students. The class also covered a broad array of topics which I really enjoyed and I appreciated how Claudia wanted us to not just learn content but really be able to think critically about the things we read and heard. Very organized as well which was impressive considering how many people there were and it was over zoom. 

Weaknesses: Grading standards were a bit confusing to me but the rubrics helped a lot. <br/></div>

The teaching faculty were extremely helpful and willing to assist with both the workload and in understanding of the material. However, this is partly because of the online format, but participation was difficult since there were so many students and the breakout rooms did not last very long. <br/></div>
