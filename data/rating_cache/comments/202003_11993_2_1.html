<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Having pre-recorded lectures to allow students to watch the lectures was excellent such that students could pace themselves.

However, there are far too many problems with this course. The first few quizzes were written absolutely terribly will little to no clarity. Considering this is a biology class that values conciseness and clarity, it felt antithetical to have questions that could be interpreted in various ways. Grading among TAs seemed inconsistent and there was no mention whether or not grades would be scaled based on how a TA grade. (For example, in CHEM 222L/223L (Organic Chemistry I/II Lab), grades would be scaled based on how harshly a particular TA graded but there was no mention whether or not this applied to BIOL 103.) [In brief, there is a general lack of clarity behind grading.]

Instructors and/or teaching fellows oftentimes muted Piazza posts asking for clarity about when quizzes would come out or how grades would be determined and this can be extremely stressful for students. On the first day of class, Prof Irish announced that the top 20% of students would achieve an A in this class. This arbitrary cutoff can only make students feel more stressed about their performance to do well in the class. Given that assessments were open note, students' grades were probably going to be in a tighter distribution than if closed book examinations. Further, this only promotes a competitive environment where students feel less inclined to help each other as grading is relative to peers. 

Another major problem with the course was the lack of preparation for quizzes. I understand one goal of the BIOL sequence is to teach students how to write a research proposal. However, not providing students PSETs/practice questions for quizzes makes it especially hard for students to feel prepared before taking a quiz. Thus, the class could be improved by providing practice problems/practice quizzes. If the class would like to continue with a research proposal assignment, I would recommend better pacing and perhaps making example grants available to students. Alternatively, asking groups of students (2-3) to write a proposal and having PSETs similar to BIOL 101/102 would better prepare students for quizzes.

This course could be improved by providing students with greater clarity in the grading and changes in assignments (as aforementioned). <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â the lectures often covered too much information, and it was hard to gauge what was relevant (due to various examples, concept, etc.).
grading of quizzes was often slow, and you wouldn't know how you did until last minute.
the quizzes themselves often had oddly worded questions, it was hard to know what each question was actually asking. in this way, there seemed to be a gap in instructor expectations and student results.
the teaching team did a good job organizing everything given the situation! <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The structure of the class was odd (each week had lectures, an open note quiz, and a discussion section), but that was probably inevitable for distance learning. I think more clarity on the grading structure would've improved the experience and made it feel less "cutthroat" when the quiz distributions were released (maybe I was the only one who felt that way...)

I didn't find the proposal writing homeworks interesting or helpful (for me they were more frustrating, but perhaps that can be chalked up to my personal preferences). I definitely would've preferred more standard problem sets that engaged directly with the material. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the course content is extremely interesting and the hw assignments are really relevant to our future careers. A lot of useful and relevant feedback.
Weaknesses: A larger workload than I was expecting. The lectures + papers + sections + hws was a lot <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: professor provided lecture slides and study guides which were quite helpful. Piazza was a good tool to clear up some confusions that may have come up during lecture

Weaknesses: some of the quizzes were poorly designed - oftentimes misleading distribution of points and confusing wording of questions. Discussion sections didn't feel very useful and felt unnecessary <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Irish is awesome. Even with the online format, she made her slides and lectures interesting, the topic was good, and she taught it well. There was a lot of great structure (thanks to Prof. Lin) which made the course go smoothly.

Weaknesses: The Quizzes were on either extreme. They were either pretty easy, or had random, in depth questions that really weren't a good reflection of the lecture. The quizzes take a lot more work than you think to study for, and its hard to get a good grade on them for those who don't have a strong biology background. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The grading had a pretty quick turnaround and clear expectations at the very beginning of the semester. However, a few weeks in the grades started to come in very slowly and we would often be 2 weeks behind on quiz grades which made it really difficult to evaluate our performance in the course. In addition, there was not much response to feedback. The lectures were interesting, but the course organization was a bit odd. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I enjoyed the class and the pace of lecture content. I think Professor I wish explained things well and was very transparent in her teachings. One thing that I would improve is test question format. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The teaching team is amazing. Professor Irish is a wonderful lecturer and I cannot say enough good things about Professor Lin. My TA was also fabulous and was so responsive to emails and questions. Professors and TAs are very active on Piazza. 
Weaknesses: Because this class was online and the lectures were pre-recorded, I think there was a disconnect between Professor Irish and the students. I wish there had been an informal office hours of a Q&amp;A section during normal class time so we would have some in-person contact as opposed to just pre-recorded lectures. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Irish does an inredible job at making real world applications to the content that we are learning about and I am so grateful that the homework assignments are so application based. However, I do think that there could be a bit more clarity in terms of what is expected of students in drafting their research proposals, as for many of us it was our first time and some more guidance would have been appreciated! <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths were that it was very organized, and the professors and TAs explained everything very well.  However, the main weakness was that the quizzes were sometimes confusing, and we didn't have very much time to complete it with thought-out answers. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was well organized to faciliate understanding, quizzes were a little difficult and could benefit from being explained better (in terms of the wording of the questions to prevent any ambiguities). <br/></div>

I also thought the content was pretty interesting. The homework assignments, while challenging early in the semester, were very interesting and fun. I found the grant-writing portion of this course to be super rewarding. 

Weaknesses: Quizzes were extremely stressful, in part because they were open-note and the average was generally pretty high. As a result, the distinctions between A/A- for this class will largely be arbitrary (very easy to slip to an A- by misreading 1/2 quiz questions). So in that regard, it was a frustrating course to take, although I doubt that these issues will carry over when the class is in-person again. It was an odd choice to refrain from answering most logistical questions on Piazza. It was also suuuuper aggravating to take quizzes without knowing our scores on the previous  2 quizzes. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The only strength that I found for this course was that the pre-recorded lectures allowed us to work at our own pace.

Other than that, I did not enjoy this course at all. Professor Irish's explanations were not always clear. Many times, students would be left extremely confused after the lecture videos, often having to resort to Piazza or other YouTube videos to learn about the lecture content.

The weekly quizzes were extremely stressful and confusing. Most of the time, I would have to guess at what the question was asking. These questions seemed to be designed to trick students. Even if I had studied every day for 10 hours, I do not think my quiz grades would have improved at all. Instead of having us spend so much time on research proposals, I think we should have received problem sets that had questions similar to the quizzes. At the very least, we should have gotten practice problems. The quizzes were 60% of our grade, and I thought it was extremely unfair for us to have to take these quizzes without any practice.

I also thought it took way too long for our quizzes to be graded. Many times, it would take TWO WEEKS for us to receive our quizzes back. This was very inconvenient because it made it hard for us to learn from our mistakes in time for the next quiz.

We were also left in the dark about the grading policy. At the beginning of the semester, we were told that only the top 20% of grades would receive As. This led to a very toxic environment, as students were not always inclined to help others, as their own grades depended on their peers' grades.  

Before this class, the field of genetics seemed very interesting to me, and I even thought of pursuing it as a career path. However, this course gave me 6-weeks of unending stress, and it has caused me to lose almost all interest in genetics. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Some strengths of the course were definitely the research proposal we wrote and discussions of different papers since that really helped us develop scientific reasoning and questioning skills. However, the quizzes were often extremely confusing and stressful. Lecture content always seemed straightforward, but we never had any chance to practice our application of that knowledge, making the quizzes really difficult. I don't have a problem with the fact that the quizzes often made us extrapolate or apply the knowledge in an experimental setting, but I do think that it is unfair to do so without giving us any resources to practice these skills. 

Releasing grading for the quizzes was also slow, so we weren't getting feedback quickly enough on where we stood in terms of our understanding. Sometimes, it would take up to 2 weeks to get back our 30-minute quizzes. The grading curve was also super unclear, adding a lot of additional stress. Also, quizzes made up 60% of the grade, greatly outweighing any other work, and further adding stress to students. <br/></div>

Rubric for HW assignments was posted promptly at the start of the semester
TAs were accessible and the course coordinator did foster class community sentiment by hosting lunches
Weaknesses:
At time, quiz grading seemed more based on the ability of the student to guess what precise terms the instructors wanted rather than an understanding of the question. The class also was not well-integrated with the other biology modules such that the HWs and quizzes reflected a cumulative understanding. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures were pretty straightforward and there wasn't a lot of lecture material. Most of the quiz questions were fair but some probably should have been read over a few times by people looking for ambiguity before releasing them to students. They did not set grade cutoffs prior to the course and so it was clearly competitive. It's entirely possible they scaled down as they were ambiguous in how letter grades would be assigned from the beginning. I sincerely hope they rethink this competitive policy in the future, as it is not supportive of collaboration and potentially drives students away from STEM at Yale. <br/></div>

SInce most of the class hasn't written a research proposal before, the profs were very understanding and wanted us to know that we were going to be confused since it was our first time, but Prof Lin really did help through additional sessions. However, I do think that the quizzes were kind of very specific and asked of us things that I didn't know we were supposed to explicitly mention, but otherwise the class I think was overall well done. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of the course were the topic materials and the lecture information by Professor Irish. It was difficult to take the quizzes due to the wide range of interpretation for each question. I found myself spending more time trying to decipher what the questions were asking than focusing on thinking through the question. Similarly, I found that studying and course engagement did not correlate as much with the quizzes as with past bio modules. This could be improved by adding more problem-set based questions or going through more content during discussion section. The course could also be improved by including a semester feedback tool or something similar. It was difficult to have no place to give feedback until the end of the semester. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Irish is a very good lecturer, even online, and I did enjoy her recordings. Out of the four aspects of this course (lectures, section, homework, and quiz), the lectures were by far and away the best part. 

That being said, this class was lacking in actually engaging the students in the class. I'm not so certain, but I don't think that a single lecture a week + boring section that talks about a paper remotely related to the topic of the class + homework that doesn't relate to the material is the best way to teach the course material, especially when it's so technical and difficult. The class was too ambitious, in my opinion, in trying to make the students develop their own hypotheses and conduct their own research. Maybe an entire BIOL class dedicated to biological research would do this job justice, but trying to do that AND teach genetics is too much. In addition, section, like in previous BIOL sequence classes, felt too disconnected from the main material and was even outright boring at times (though this may have to do more with the section leaders than the material).

And don't get me started on the quizzes. Other than Q4 and Q5, the other 4 quizzes were outright confusing and convoluted. I'm not sure exactly what changed between BIOL101 and 103, but the quizzes in 101 were much easier to comprehend and answer. The quizzes in this class felt like I was deciphering an enigma code before answering the actual questions. I appreciate that you are trying to really test our understanding and not just surface knowledge, but there's only so much deep understanding you can examine in a 10-question, 30-minute quiz. If you want to do that, why not add midterms and finals to the class, where we can have much more time? I think it's not fair to the students to disguise these quizzes as quick and easy tests of knowledge and throw out extremely convoluted questions, where the tiniest mistake can get you 3.5 points out of 4 off. 

Finally, the grading in this class. I'm writing this after the grades have been released, but I can't view it yet since I haven't submitted this form yet. A genuine concern that I have is that I might not end up with an A in this class even with a 96 average. This could be a stupid fear to have, but valid when considering that this class is percentage based in grading. Why make an introductory class 20% A when most of the students are also premed? Do you understand the kind of culture you create when you do something like this among the most competitive portion of the student body? Without a doubt, BIOL103 was the most toxic class I've been in. 

Maybe the class is more engaging and enjoyable when live instead of remote. However, I kind of doubt it. The only thing that would severely be affected by being remote are the lectures and sections, and the lecture, as I said, is the best part of this class; and section, from my experience in 101 and 102, aren't really that much better live. And unless something is done to change the culture and atmosphere of the class, the class will continue to be a cesspool of toxicity and unnecessary competitiveness that shouldn't belong in an introductory class. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the lectures were effective at explaining the material and the papers for discussion section made valuable ties between course material and real-world experiments. The research proposal was an intense time commitment and I think the Saturday extension was really helpful. It was hard to know where to draw the line between real-world evidence and research for the proposal and more hypothetical or arbitrary connections between for instance our gene of interest and the transcription factor. I think it was a valuable way of learning how to work with genetics databases and do background research and learn methodologies, but it would be helpful if the expectations around the project as a learning exercise versus a realistic proposal were more clear. <br/></div>
