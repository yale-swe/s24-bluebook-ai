<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Unfortunately this was one course that despite amazing course content and lectures, did not provide a sufficient support given the ongoing COVID pandemic. Professor Snyder overloaded the reading amount. This is supposed to be an intro survey lecture course but I have never read more than I have for this class-- sometimes over 500 pages a week or 200 pages per lecture (we had two a week). And despite the material being interesting, the most difficult part was Professor Snyder's requirement that we take handwritten notes on all the material and submit them to our TFs by section. While the purpose of this note-taking exercise is acknowledged by students, we all suffered from physical and mental health due to this task. As Yale students we are meticulous notetakers, especially since this was relatively new material to everyone. It was stressful to submit so much work on time when the readings were by no means structured for introductory lecture. Had this course been a seminar, and all of us hoping to become Eastern European historians/specialists, this density of work would have been understandable. But the pandemic continues and it just unfortunately seemed that Professor Snyder increased the workload rather than adjust it to the pandemic at hand. Of all courses that ever needed a midterm feedback form, this was one that REALLY needed one so that students could communicate with Professor Snyder that this approach was not working; he himself was never very available besides minimal office hours that were at difficult times. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: Professor Snyder is a great lecturer and very helpful at office hour too. He is definitely a world-class historian and you can learn so much from him. The selection of reading was great too. There was certainly a lot of reading (goes from 100 pages per week to whole books for a single lecture, probably 200 pages per week on average), but they were very helpful and certainly a great addition to the lecture materials.
Weakness: Professor Snyder sometimes jumps around in his lecture. I understand that given the time constraint of each lecture he cannot go into every detail, but sometimes it gets a bit confusing when he skips over information. All the missing pieces would be filled in by the reading materials though. Also handwritten notes were worth 20% of the grade, which is great, but to a slow writer like me it was a painful process, and out of all my courses this part was definitely what I spent the most time on. I liked the idea of taking notes from reading but would have appreciated the option of typing them. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: interesting lectures; 
Weaknesses: often excessive readings that had to be reflected in the turning in of handwritten notes every week (would scan as a PDF and upload to Canvas) <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: super interesting, amazing professor, great lectures and readings 
weaknesses: so much work!!!! the midterm, final, and final project were all so exhausting, and the weekly submission of notes (for a copious amount of reading) was very draining. It helped with my learning of the material, but this class almost always felt like wayyy too much work. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Snyder is a great lecturer, and I really enjoyed listening to the podcasts he made. However, I think the structure of the course this semester was a bit patronizing. The demand to turn in handwritten lecture and reading notes felt belittling, and it reflects a poor understanding of how to increase involvement. Professor Snyder said he was doing this to increase engagement, but workload and engagement aren't the same thing. The chronology assignment was interesting, but that also disrupted the experience of the readings, because I often found myself just skimming for dates. Finding 100 dates and an underlying theme that runs through all of them just didn't seem realistic. If he really cared about us thinking about how the events fit together, there should have been fewer dates and more emphasis on how they fit together. A lot of the work just felt like stuff you would do in high school. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Timothy Snyder is an effective lecturer, and the content was well-organized and connected.
Weaknesses: Way too much work to assign to students in a pandemic. The same goal of the hand-written notes assignment could have been accomplished in a less punishing and severe way and the chronology could have been considerably condensed. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The sections made for a good discussion of the material for the week, but the fact that we had to take notes for every reading and turn it in was too much. Having to read 300-600 pages a week was a lot of work but then when you have to take notes carefully for everything to turn in to your TF it is too much. I spend at least half of all the time I spend on classes on during reading for this class. The midterms were also a lot. Going from what should have been 2 50min in class test to 2 ca. 4000 word essays in 24 hours was very stressfull, I had to skipp my other classes that day to be able to get through it. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths - just how much you learn. It can't be understated. Snyder is a great lecturer but I found myself learning more through the reading.

The weaknesses - THE WORKLOAD. Each week consisted of several hundred pages of reading, which you have to turn in notes for. There are two midterms that are intense, and the final project (100 date chronology) was due the same week as the second midweek. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The chronology was an absolute disaster. Since we had 250+ pages of reading to take actual notes on every week, there was no time for me, a student taking 6 classes, to do the chronology piecewise. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Snyder is a great lecturer and explains not just what happened but why it happened. I wish, however, that it would be easier to book office hours with him or a way for all of us to ask questions in an office hours session like there was in some of my other lecture classes. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I wish we could have interacted with the professor a bit more. The podcasts were nice and I'm glad I can re-listen to them but that being said it almost didn't feel like I was taking the class. This was especially dangerous because i was taking it Credit/D <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A lot of empirical history. I thought that primary sources could have been utilized much more at the beginning of the course. The course provides a great array of sources, as well as literature later on. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was extremely informative not just in a region of the world that is seldom taught in depth, but also in general concepts such as nationalism, communism, world economics, and the fall of empires. This made it by far my favorite course of this semester and even led me to change my major from History of Medicine to History. However, the readings for this class were excessive at times, especially for the very little information that some readings contributed. This course required me to turn in notes on every reading, every class and this resulted in almost 20 pages of notes every week for an introductory lecture course. I think many of the readings could be cut down or eliminated. On the other hand, I think we recieved a disproportionate amount of reading on certain countries. I think we lacked readings on Ukraine beyond their famine of 1932 and readings on Bulgaria and Yugoslavia before Tito. This overload of readings made it difficult to get a grip on the history at times and leave with a clear idea of what factors were at play within each country. Another strength was the list of vocabulary words Professor Snyder paired with each lecture. This was especially helpful for spelling purposes, for visual learners like myself, and also to get an idea of the main concepts I should be focusing on. Lastly, I only met Professor Snyder once during the entire semester because of the podcast format. I would have liked more direct engagement with the professor. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is very content heavy. The reading load is extremely substantial, and at times a bit too much. The required weekly handwritten notes was also time consuming. However, these are not necessarily negative things. I learned a lot and most of the readings were quite interesting. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Snyder is a brilliant historian and his lectures were engaging and illuminating. He recorded lectures as podcasts and uploaded them at the beginning of each week, which gave me a lot of flexibility in planning. However, I wish we could have had some live, synchronous lectures with Prof Snyder to create more of a sense of community. I definitely felt like I got to know the people in my discussion section, but outside of sections it was challenging to feel like you were in a class with other people because of how the course was structured. Not a huge downside, and definitely wouldn't be a problem in a normal, non-pandemic year. I want to sit in on this class when it's back in person! <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: great lectures
Weakness: way, way too much reading, and the handwritten notes for lecture and readings that we had to turn in were absurd and created so much extra work. The "there hour exams" took me 11 hours each, and this was normal for the class. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths are that the instructor had students take and submit notes. While rigorous, it did force students to have a higher content standard than in other courses in the history department. The weaknesses is the 'podcast' style lectures, which are completely apersonal and make this course seem as aloof as possible from an active instructor. TA made up for it, but oftentimes felt like TA was the real professor of course. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Prof. Snyder was unable to meet the demands of an online course environment. The workload expected from students was delusional. The midterm exam had a suggested word count of 3500 words, and was intended to be done in 1-2 hrs. I felt bad for the TA's who had to read the nonsense that is produced when a college student tries to cram such volume into a time frame like that.

The lectures were pretty good though - Prof. Snyder has a very methodological approach to thinking about 20th century history that is lacking in most scholarship on the topic. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Snyder's podcast lectures were great, and his books are fantastic. The content of the course is something that isn't focused upon enough in history education and it brings a new perspective to understanding the core events of the 20th century. The exams were challenging, but the chronology was just a bit of a chore. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - fantastic lectures, fascinating content, good pacing

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weakness: (unnecessarily intense/tedious workload)

1. The course required submitted notes for each lecture, and each reading weekly. These notes were graded and had to be handwritten. This was an enormous burden in terms of workload. 

2. The chronology assignment - the final assignment was to create a chronology of 100 dates between 1914-1995 we thought were most significant. With 150 word descriptions for each date, this meant the assignment was 15,000 words! We had a final exam to top it off. The chronology was cumbersome and tedious- citations for each date were required but ONLY from the course packet. So i spent hours scouring the pages to find the relevant date and reading. If this assignment is to be offered in the future, I would recommend not requiring citations from the course readings, but from any readings. The course packet is pdf of scanned pages, so you cannot search for text or highlight in most cases. At the end of it, I came out feeling like I didn't learn from the assignment at all, and spent 36 straight hours trying to get my citations in order. 

Strengths -

1. The TA was great, and made the discussion sections as innovative as they could. They came up with new ways to engage with the material each time and section was always fun 

2. Professor Snyder has a knack for story telling and explaining very complicated historical events, and details in a manner that can be smoothly taken in. However, there was huge disparity between the level of detail in the lectures and in the readings. The lectures were great and fun and could be made sense of. The readings were dense with historical detail, and many a time completely out of reference with the lectures. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I don't have the energy to keep writing the same things for all of these questions so i'm just going to copy and paste from other responses &lt;3

Strengths: Prof. Snyder is a top class orator and explainer &amp; you do learn a lot about the subject (I didn't learn 100% of what I was supposed to given the speed at which we moved through the second half of the period and the intense reading load, but in general you will learn). 

Weaknesses: basically everything else.
List of complaints: 
Non-searchable pdf course packet (it was almost 600 pages long and we were meant to cite from these readings on the 100 date chronology &amp; exams)
Reading assignments were completely unmanageable for a lecture course (easily fixable through better planning)
Assignments due on break days
Midterm exam took 7 hours outside of allotted class time (supposedly meant to take 2 hours)
No reading week, 40% of grade left up to final week of classes
No extensions granted beyond final week of classes
Did not formally state that it would be foregoing reading week on syllabus
Read his books on your own time
First  of class repeat from other course
He will not answer your emails (it is an automated response; email him literally anything and that is what you will get)
6AM OFFICE HOURS BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN IN AUSTRIA ALL YEAR

Quotes from other course review questions: 
"The chronology was bad for a lot of reasons but the reason that was the most destructive for students &amp; the reason many ended up not taking the course for a letter grade was due to it being due on the Monday of the final week of classes while requiring a quote/citation from each reading we did throughout the semester while not allowing us reading week to actually go through the course packet/novels/books with ample enough time to complete this assignment on top of the other assignments due during that time. This is the ENTIRE point of reading week! How can you have a reading load that includes a 589 page course packet (closer to 1000 pages of reading because of the scans), 3 novels (probably around 700 pages), and 3 books (probably around 800 pages) and NOT GRANT EXTENSIONS OR SET DEADLINES FOR AFTER READING WEEK??? This was a reading intensive course and there was no time to have that reflected because of poor course planning."
 
" I am leaving this course knowing the same level of thought/planning was not put in to executing this course on Snyder's part (repeated readings on the syllabus, no clear plan for Break Days, and an obvious lack of communication to TFs), and ultimately I am extremely disappointed. You will learn from this course (especially if it is not taught remotely again), but I think Snyder really dropped the ball this semester and students ultimately suffered because of his lack of care and engagement." <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Tim Snyder's expertise is unmatched. I also really enjoyed his lecture style, though I wish he dwelled a bit more on post-2014 developments in the region

Weaknesses: it's a big challenge to complete all the readings with lecture notes each week. Some readings seem very narrowly focused and require background information to follow, usually the earlier readings in the course packet <br/></div>
