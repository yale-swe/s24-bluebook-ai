<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I am an S&amp;DS major (third-year), and this is the best course I have taken in the department so far. 

This is largely thanks to Professor Brinda's dedication to student learning/educational pedagogy as well as the comprehensible, well-organized textbook he wrote for the course. Unlike most other professors in the S&amp;DS department, Professor Brinda eschews long, grueling problem sets in favor of meaningful, basics-driven assignments. It was clear from almost every homework assignment (almost all involving coding in R) that Professor Brinda put thought into the most effective ways to reinforce concepts from class through example. Rather than being frustrating and borderline learning-inhibitive like some of the 40-hour psets I've had in other courses, I enjoyed our assignments and felt that I genuinely benefitted from doing each one. I cannot emphasize enough how incredible this was, and how surprised I was that shorter, slightly less challenging homework was actually more conducive to learning. I wish other classes would follow suit! 

Another strength of this course was the spaced repetition via Anki flashcards we did each week. Professor Brinda prepared us weekly batches of exercises from his textbook that reinforced core concepts from lectures, and we were encouraged to practice these regularly in exchange for a perfect score on one of the week's two in-class quizzes. I had not tried a method like this for a math course before, and it was really effective. I enjoyed how the decks were not too challenging and thus not discouraging, but rather built up muscle memory so we could better apply fundamentals (like properties of orthogonal projection matrices) to new material. 

I only wish this course were longer, or that there were a Linear Models 2 offered at Yale. We spent a fair amount of time building strong foundational understandings of key linear algebra concepts, which I fully appreciated. But this means we had less time left at the end to go over statistical concepts related to randomness and predictions. It would be great to have a second linear models course taught by Professor Brinda on offer, as I felt this was the first S&amp;DS course at Yale where I was instructed well enough that I would leave feeling confident about the material and excited to apply it. There are certainly more complex linear modeling topics that one could cover in a second course and it would likely be fantastic to study those with Professor Brinda.

Finally, the twice-weekly quizzes were short and often not made to be difficult, but I found it occasionally stressful to try and complete a question on the spot, photograph and upload it to Gradescope within a timed (short) window. Luckily, Professor Brinda always asked for feedback on quiz difficulty and I felt he responded well to student input. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The primary strengths of this course are: 1) Prof Brinda, who is extremely helpful with assignments and very skilled at explaining difficult/abstract/theoretical concepts; 2) the material, which will allow you to see linear regression and linear models in a completely new, geometric way; 3) Prof Brinda's textbook, which is very concise and very clear; 4) the homework assignments, which are reasonably short and give you the opportunity to apply the theoretical concepts of the course to real-world data sets.  There are no real weaknesses. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Covered things throughly, but sometimes went a bit slowly and felt like repeating LinAlg jargon over and over again. Textbook also could be fleshed out a bit more at times - in places it just felt like one formula after another after another <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Brinda was the strength of this course- the pace of the course was not too fast nor too slow, and Professor Brinda really took care to make sure that all of us were understanding the material. His textbook is well-written as well and was of great help throughout the course. The weekly quizzes made sure that we were keeping up with each week's lectures. Overall, a great stats elective. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Dr. Brinda did a great job of pacing the course content. He also designed very manageable and engaging problem sets that helped me learn content. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Brinda is such a strength for this course. It's clear he's been honing the syllabus and course format over the several years he's been teaching it, committed to making it better for students with each rendition. The textbook and "variables picture" approach was so helpful in being able to visualize what is happening when fitting a model (vectors projected into subspaces). I feel leaps and bounds above where I was in terms of interpreting and understanding what is happening when running "lm" in R. Professor Brinda also spends the first portion of the class going over the important linear algebra concepts to set the stage before introducing random vectors, which was helpful both for those who took linear algebra a while ago, but also to set a clear foundation before introducing randomness. There were 2 weekly quizzes after class for most of the semester, but if you practiced the flashcards with the given exercises, your lowest score for the week was given a perfect score (and, of course, you were more likely to remember the concepts/be prepared to do well on the quizzes). The homework assignments were structured really well, with the clear emphasis being to reinforce the ideas of class, rather than have you reinvent the wheel. I liked the incorporation of R as well.

Weaknesses: We didn't receive grades back for some of our quizzes until the very end of the semester (though one of the original graders needed to step away from the course). There were answers posted, but not specific feedback for ours until much later. Beyond that, I genuinely can't think of any. This course was well structured for my learning style. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â the course was mildly interesting, though I think the lectures could have been a lot more efficient. I'm not sure if I learned that much new stuff on top of the (admittedly many) stats classes I've already taken. It was fine for a busy semester, but I still think more could've been covered (e.g. different types of regression and linear models). However, a strength of the class is that everything was very fair, and Prof. Brinda provides opportunities for you to make up for poor quiz grades through flashcards (graded for completion) and corrections on the midterm. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the lectures closely follows the textbook, the Anki card problems help with grasping concepts, and the hw assignments and exams are all very reasonable <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Brinda is a really good professor! clear, moved at a good pace; psets were cool too, unlike other assignments I've had in the S&amp;DS department
Weaknesses: the quizzes were annoying at times for sure, but I think they were still overall helpful <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think that the course was balanced pretty well. Lectures covered course material and sometimes got challenging at times but students were free to ask clarification questions. Homework assignments weren't very long and helped us understand what we learned during class. The professor's textbook was really helpful and had everything that we would need to know to complete assignments. The weekly quizzes were really short and most times doable. But we were able to do flashcards to get full points on one of the weekly quizzes anyways which was really fair. Piazza was also utilized well and aided us on homeworks and exam clarification questions. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I understand the use of the semi-weekly quizzes, but they were kind of rough--I'm never good with a 15 minute time limit. It might be better to switch up the format of the quizzes--say, once a week, with a 30-minute window and posted to Gradescope for submission at any point on a given day, rather than being part of lecture time. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths:
1. An overall solid course with a nice professor and interesting content (if you like modeling/lines).
2. Being able to drop 1 quiz each week.

Weaknesses:
1. Timed quizzes after every lecture that you often failed 50% of.
2. Really hard to do the course if you didn't take 225, because there's a lot of assumed theoretical linear algebra knowledge. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The examinations should not be take home. At least, students shouldn't be given an entire week to do the exams, but maybe a couple of hours or one day? The means of both exams were incredibly (almost artificially considering how difficult both of the exams were) high. I was very disappointed to see that I was below average in the final exam even though my score was really good and I have been doing very well in the class. Something needs to be done about this. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Was tough sometimes to apply class knowledge to homeworks but the lectures were very informative and teacher did a great job with explaining the theory part of everything. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The homeworks could be more clearly written and the grading could be more prompt. The daily quizzes were great especially this year because they kept you very engaged and you didn't have an opportunity to fall behind. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of this course was definitely Professor Brinda. He is a concise lecturer who cares deeply about his students by stopping to ask and answer questions. The assignments were relevant to the material learned in class without being too difficult. The grading was also very fair and lenient. I guess one small weakness of this course is that I would've liked to see how the material we were learning is applicable in the real world. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Dr. Brinda is an excellent teacher and very responsive to students questions and concerns. The only weakness would be that we had an in-class quiz due on piazza at the end of each class. Given the virtual mode of learning, I thought having a quiz due at the end of class was unnecessarily stressful. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Brinda is a great lecturer who goes at a good learning pace. Because he writes everything out by hand, records lectures, and uploads lecture notes, it was suitable for online learning as well. I loved that the psets were all in R with a mix of both theory and coding application of the material we learned in lecture. Brinda teaches to the textbook that he wrote so it's easy to find and review material that was covered by reading an accessible textbook imo

Weaknesses: The material at the end of the semester was harder to understand but we took equal or less time on it so it would've been nice to spend more time on the harder textbook chapters towards the end. The final was also quite hard as a result since we covered the final concept on the exam in 10 minutes at the end of the last lecture. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is very well organized and taught. The lectures were clear and informative, the homework was well suited to support our understanding of the material, and the quizzes and exams were fair and well written. I also appreciate that Prof. Brenda provides his own textbook for this course which makes it easy to follow along. In many courses, textbooks are extraneous or supplemental. In this course, reading the textbook and working through examples was a helpful and integral part of the class. <br/></div>
