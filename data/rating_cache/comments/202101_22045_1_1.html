<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> This course is very good if you want to learn Java in a small period of time. There were ample resources to help you as well. There were office hours all the time even late at night and I really liked using Ed discussions. However, in my opinion this class moved way too quickly. There were was too much information to learn that it felt like I was constantly sprinting from one idea to the next, instead of fully understanding the previous information. This made it quite challenging. <br/></div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> It was very difficult for me that the lectures were released on Fridays and then we had quizzes on them on Monday, forcing us to watch the lectures over the weekend. I didn't hate the flipped-classroom approach to this course, but the fact that the lectures couldn't be done during the week was painful. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> The problem sets were very enriching and covered a variety of interesting areas of application with Java. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> I feel like the recorded lectures were quite helpful, but I didn't find the discussion sections to be quite as helpful. I feel like sometimes we were thrown off the deep end to complete certain practice problems, which is really difficult to do considering the short time we have in sections. Instead of going right into practice problems, I feel like the TAs should explain the concepts more in depth as some students may not have understood the material strictly from the recordings. <br/></div>
</div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> The class moves extremely fast, especially if you're someone who has no experience with programming. The TAs are amazing and are always super helpful in section and in office hours. The recorded lectures were very well organized. Still, the distribution of time spent on psets will vary significantly from person to person, because plenty of people taking the class already have coding experience. There are also recorded lectures to watch outside of section and much time will be spent on homework. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> I enjoyed the section format of the course, as it really allowed students to get involved with the material and collaborate with other students to understand everything. The class was amazing and extremely helpful as far as teaching people to code, but the main area for improvement is the workload. Between the problem sets, the lecture videos, and the quizzes, I was spending approximately 10 to 15 hours a week on this class, and that made it a bit tougher to manage my time. I completely understand that the depth of the material covered necessitates that students spend a sufficient amount of time on the subject, but I think changes as small as capping the pre-recorded videos at 30 minutes instead of 1 hour will go a long way in giving students some time to work on other things. Additionally, I think it would be helpful if references to the textbooks were provided throughout the semester, such that students know what chapters to look at when trying to understand a concept in more depth. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> The strengths of this course would have to be the office hours on discord and the optional sections that the TAs host. They had a bunch of times throughout the week which allowed most students to come into office hours at least once per week. The weaknesses that I would say this course had would probably be the lecture videos. Normally the videos were supposed to be uploaded the Thursday prior to next week's sections on Monday and Wednesday, but throughout the semester the lecture videos were uploaded Saturday and Sunday which made it rushed to learn since the material is expected to be understood by Monday. The only improvement would be uploading the lecture videos earlier. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Weakness: moves too quickly and there are way too many assignments, so it's hard to really understand what's going on in the class. I felt like I was just doing assignments and from midterm on, I would often get stuck on assignments for hours and relied on TA help. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Strengths:
The one strength I can say (though it leads to a major flaw) is that the psets were very interesting and well thought out, but they, for the most part, do not belong in this class.

Weaknesses:

The class constantly impeded learning. 

The first mistake is to start off beginner programmers with Java. Java is a terribly clunky and complicated language to learn as a beginner.  

The class often impeded learning. There was a major disconnect between what we were learning in class and section and the psets. The psets were overcomplicated, long, and not actually good for learning the material. In particular, the psets often went outside the scope of the class. It's better to master the basics first before moving on to applying basic concepts and learning about something outside the scope of the class. 

The class if not conducive to learning for beginners. Even though it's supposed to be a class for people who have NEVER been exposed to programming, it seems the course organizers foolishly thought it was a good idea to make it challenging even for the people who have had plenty of programming experience. This was a pity, as lots of actual beginner programmers dropped out of the class by the midterm. As I said, the psets are overcomplicated and should actually provide exercises so that students can thoroughly learn a concept and use it in different contexts. Instead they were behemoth projects that could take upward of 15 hours, yet not actually make you learn the concepts well. 

I'm not sure why the lecture were often posted late. I'm also not sure why they were often much shorter than the allotted time that the lectures are supposed to take. Usually, but often not, all the lectures would be posted on Friday (sometimes much later) when in a usual semester they were to be shown on Monday and Wednesday. The usual lecture time for each week ought to be 150 min, instead it was sometimes much less. In general, the material was rushed through both in lecture and macroscopically in the course. That is, the topics up to 2D arrays (the midterm) probably could have been spread out for the whole semester in order to ensure that beginner students were really mastering each concept, and the Object Oriented programming stuff could have sprinkled in here and there. Instead, this class offered a terrible, discouraging introduction to programming for any actual beginner to programming. 

I highly recommend you not take this class as a first introduction to programming, unless the class changes dramatically and the organizers realize that there no doing one any benefits by structuring the class the way they are, and instead get experience on your own or maybe start with CS50. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> It is a lot of work. But that is a strength. The TA availability is awesome (so are they) and the course is design so that you get back what you put in. I'd love if they put up the lectures a bit sooner and had a more set schedule, but overall the class was fantastic. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> I liked that the course was self-paced, with asynchronous lectures. However, I felt that one weakness was the quality of feedback on the homework, as the graders didn't leave many notes or explanations. However, there are a LOT of office hours for this course, so anything you need can generally be addressed easily. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> The organization of this course is a major weakness. While the problem sets are honestly pretty entertaining but time-consuming, the professors were at times difficult to reach. I was lucky to have section leaders I really liked, but some of the TA's would consistently give me wrong information in office hours. This course is a good intro to programming, it just needs better organization. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Strengths: Wonderful TAs and professors were helpful in one-on-one meetings.
Weaknesses: Sections. I think there shouldn't be extra activities; rather, I think section time should be used for problem sets. Additionally, problem set solutions should be posted. They weren't, and I didn't know how to check my work or get viable solutions without pestering the TAs or professors. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> At times, when I went to office hours, the TAs told me that they had never learned java before in the classroom and/or didn't really understand what we would learning themselves. This made it take hours longer than necessary to complete the coursework. These TAs were also teaching our in-person sections, and it often felt they did not understand what was happening (the answer to a lot of questions was I don't know).
The lectures need to be improved and cannot vary in length so much that it is impossible to budget time. Also, the TAs should have better training. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> It was very inconveniently set up, video lectures were never posted at the same time, and it was hard to figure out where any information on the course was posted. All in all, I was often left very confused as to what I needed to do each week. Although we were told that every week there would be a quiz on the lectures, sometimes one just wouldn't show up, and it was very stressful trying to figure out whether one would be posted on short notice. Also, needing to watch recorded lectures over the weekend was unpleasant. This is, however, a great basis for learning programming/java, the organization skills just seemed a bit lacking. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Strengths: I think this is overall a good introduction to CS. I had some background is CS-ish things (MATLAB and R), but no true programming experience; I found everything understandable. I enjoyed the lectures and the psets overall. 
Weaknesses: I have two major complaints. First, the psets often demanded a knowledge of subjects other than CS. N-body (knowledge of college-level physics) and GuitarHero (knowledge of music) come to mind (these probably *could* be done without prior knowledge, but certainly are *much* more difficult -- you'd have to do a lot of physics learning). CS has a reputation that it's for "mathy" people and that it's really hard to break into if you don't have a coding background from high school (that's the reason I waited until my senior year to take it; I was scared). Please don't make the class any more difficult than it has to be for people without strong STEM backgrounds by making the pset require an understanding of material that's not directly relevant to CS. My other comment here is just that I think people who are professors of or getting degrees in CS really underestimate how difficult, for example, the N-body problem is for someone who isn't that.
Second, the lectures were posted *very* late. The idea was lectures would be posted Monday, we'd have the week to watch them and take a quiz due the following Monday, and have section on those lectures that second week. However, the lectures would often come out Saturday, meaning we'd have 48 hours to do the quiz. We'd never know when they'd come out, so we'd have to keep checking and checking, and when they were finally released. Sometimes, we'd get told Monday that the lectures were just posted, and the quiz was moved back to Wednesday. This meant we had to rearrange our schedules for the week, on zero notice, and that section wouldn't make sense (it was supposed to be a review of lecture). 
Again, overall a good class; don't get me wrong. But these things need to be improved. <br/></div>

-Appropriate emphasis on broader programming concepts rather than Java specifically. 

Weaknesses
-Psets tended to be more difficult than the practise activities in section <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> The problem sets were very interesting, real-world applications of Java and were very fun to code. The lectures were also very clear, and engaging. Some lectures covered a lot of new information in a short span of time, but it was still easy to follow. The discussion sections were also helpful to cover any areas of confusion in the lecture and learn from other students in the class. One weakness of discussion sections though is that the problem sets we had to code collaboratively seemed too difficult for the limited class time. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> It was entirely virtual, and while on the surface that may seem like a non-problem for a computer-based class, it most certainly was. Having no easy way to display or share code privately or otherwise, receiving constructive feedback was often incredibly difficult. Group projects were thus particularly loathsome.
The strengths of this course include easy-to-understand guidance on how to learn how to code in java and write organized, understandable programs. <br/></div>
