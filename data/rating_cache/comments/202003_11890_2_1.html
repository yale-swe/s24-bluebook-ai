<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course offered a wide range of support resources to help students succeed, such as many office hours and private tutoring sessions with our preceptor, TFs, peer tutors, and more. Everyone was more than happy to help and was very accessible. One weakness of this course was the platform used for exams, which did not allow for partial credit. Using this platform did allow for exam grades to be received quickly, however many students lost points for things that in a normal year they would have gotten partial credit for. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: Nilay's lectures, the resources provided by the teaching team to help students
weaknesses: Sapling exams, Microsoft teams <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Nilay was a great lecturer who strived to engage with students even in such a large class. Hannah was an excellent TF who clarified things exceptionally. There are plenty of resources to help you succeed and improve in this class, especially Hannah and many of Peer Tutors who were very helpful.

Weaknesses: The lectures did not always help with the problem sets and you would require not only reading through the textbooks but also seeking other examples in youtube videos or other external resources to help you with the problem sets if you could not make it to peer tutoring. TAs during discussion section are not the best both in explaining concepts and giving us supplemental materials. Midterms (particularly the first one) felt significantly more difficult than problem sets and practice materials. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The discussion sections could be improved. I thought the professor was great and engaging though. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: NILAY! He was an amazing professor and Dr. Hannah Lant is so helpful. I love the website she made that gave us extra practice problems. 

Weakness: It was sometimes difficult to keep track of when office hours were occurring. When Nilay would post poll questions, students who watched the recorded lecture could not see the answers and the questions. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths of this class include above all Nilay, as well as Hannah and the TA's, the Sapling homework site, the recorded lectures, and the fair examinations. The only weaknesses would be that the review sessions were not recorded, and occasionally it was hard to read/understand Nilay's notes. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Lectures are great, Nilay is awesome, notes are awesome.  Discussion is also a strength of the class.  Only weaknesses are the tests.  I only lost points because of easily avoidable mistakes I wouldn't have made on in-person tests.  No partial credit was also frustrating. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: All lectures are recorded so you don't need to attend the class synchronously, there are also a ton of resources, peer tutors and TFs that can help, Nilay and Hannah are both SUPER responsive and I can tell that they both really care about students. 
Weakness: It is incredibly easy to zone-out during lecture, I don't think this is really any fault of Nilay's because of the nature of online classes. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I found this course had many more weaknesses than strengths. Although some lectures were well put-together, the overall testing policy was inherently INEQUITABLE. Absolutely NO partial credit was given, and the testing was high-stakes and anxiety-inducing. The instructors did absolutely nothing to improve this, and Id have to say this was the worst class I took this semester. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Nilay! Also the format of teaching in clear sections related to the textbook really helped organize learning. The online notes were EXTREMELY helpful.
Weaknesses: the content is not very engaging but it's basic chemistry so that's expected <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Nilay's lecture is amazing. Very engaging, great pace, and I love the music when we first come in. He is really great. Hannah and all of the other TA's are also awesome. I really appreciate all of the support and resources we are given. I also really liked Sapling, although I would've loved if there was more partial credit on the midterms, but I understand that was hard this year and Nilay did his best. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I feel like explanations should be more focused on examples and less verbal conceptualizing. Going to study sessions virtually is already difficult and when a student asks a question and the TA's decide to explain a difficult concept that involves calculations verbally with no visual aid (though the capability was there), it's just disappointing. I felt like most were teaching with the mindset that everyone here wants to be a chemist or is a chemistry major. When people asked questions and had a blank stare after the complex verbal explanation, I found myself leaving study sessions because they were kinda demoralizing and just confused me even more. I'm passing the course, but it was literally from getting help online from sites that could explain it to me with great visuals. And that's just disappointing. Lastly, this final exam was unacceptable. Our learning and testing was all completed through Sapling. Now the final is hand written and it was completely unlike sapling. The homework and tests on sapling are more geared toward assessing a basic introduction of these concepts. The final and its questions seemed to test for a thorough knowledge with the most ridiculous questions. I feel like we should have either tested and did homework according to sapling the entire course, or hand-written homework, midterms, and final according to how he wanted us to grasp the knowledge and apply it. Because the final (and just looking at his old hand-written mid-terms on Canvas) versus sapling testing, it's like taking two different levels of this course. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Nilay was very engaging as a lecturer and Hannah was very helpful. Sapling is the largest weakness to this class, since it often made exams impossible to receive partial credit on. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Overall, the lectures were great. Nilay did a great job explaining concepts and answering questions. All the posted resources were also very helpful. Discussions sections, however, I felt moved very slowly and could have provided more time for actually discussing the material. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Sapling homework.................did not reflect completely on what we would be tested on. I get it though it's chemistry. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course were that the lectures were interactive with students mostly because of the polls done to check our understanding.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course are that there is a great support network if you need help. You could attend a meeting to get more help every single day if you wanted to. The weaknesses of this course was probably the layout of the lecture. All you did during lecture was watch what the professor was writing on his iPad and then copy it down. I wish they provided more images and illustrative examples of what they were teaching instead of just handwritten notes. I felt like the notes also made it confusing to see how topics were connected together. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It probably provides a good foundation for future chemistry courses, but the material wasn't very engaging or interesting. I don't know if that's because of the virtual format or just how gen chem is. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A weakness of the course is the repetitiveness in the mode of instruction.

I think a huge strength of this course is the outside resources such as bookable office hours and Hannah's website. I think that having outside resources is certainly more important than the lecture since a majority of a student's day will be spent outside of the lecture. <br/></div>

First, it would be nice to be assigned readings from the textbook every week just so students can have a better correlation between the textbook and what is taught in lecture.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Nilay is a wonderful, charming person, as is the preceptor, Hannah. They both worked tirelessly to provide easy access to instructors to answer our questions, whether through the multitude of office hours, the Teams forum where we could ask a question and readily receive answers, or through questions during lecture itself. The problem sets were the right amount of challenging, but many times they covered concepts we didn't touch upon in lecture.

The discussion sections weren't the best; because all we did were more practice problems, it just felt like doing another problem set. Also, Nilay isn't the best at explaining some of the foundational concepts that can be confusing to newcomers of chemistry; you'll know enough to do well on tests, but you'll never really fully understand the concept. Some may like Nilay's style of displaying his notes as he speaks; some prefer powerpoint slides. The tests also felt unnecessarily difficult, as if they were deliberately trying to trick us. These tests would give problems much, much harder than anything else we would have encountered in the course.

The class itself though is more like learning different facts and concepts; there's not much critical thinking involved, it's mostly just rote textbook knowledge. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was designed hypothetically for people who haven't taken chemistry, but in reality it was hard to follow if you didn't have at least a little previous chemistry knowledge.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The format of the lectures was consistent and organized, and the lectures were offered live as well as recorded which was very helpful.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course is very inclusive in terms of background knowledge. No prior chemistry knowledge is assumed by the professors or the TA's, although they are also understanding of the fact that most people in the course have taken chemistry before. The course covers far more content than most high school courses so it is still very beneficial to those who do have a background. The main issue with this is that if you come in with no prior background, it seems like it would take a lot of work to keep up as things move very quickly especially in the beginning. I think by cutting some of the more extraneous content, students could get a deeper understanding of the more fundamental aspects of chemistry. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was nice not to have much work outside of class but I might have benefited from having homework due more often. Sometimes I could forget completely about what happened in lecture until it showed up in Sapling, so maybe more synthesis of the material could have helped. For example, short reading quizzes/example problems (for a grade or not) due on the day of lecture each day. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths were that it is a good overview of chemistry and helped me feel more prepared for the courses I plan to take in biology. Nilay is a great professor and made the class engaging and was really open to listening to student input. One weakness was the way that midterms were assessed. It was done on an online format called Sapling which allowed for virtually no partial credit. (This isn't how it is normally done, but the way they tried to make testing possible for this virtual semester). However, after students gave their input about how this testing format didn't work for them, the professor and preceptor changed the final exam to a paper format. So I think the willingness to listen to students and be flexible and accommodating was a definite strength for this course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think a weakness of this course is that it's online (which is something that I do not fault the teacher or school for). I just think the online experience really took away the experience and the beneficial aspect of my learning. I definitely think I would've performed better had this course been in person. Another weakness was the way that midterms were graded. I think that the tests should have been on paper the entire time just like the final exam. I think that the paper would allow students to show their work to earn partial credit and potentially do better on the test. It also allows professors and TAs to get a better idea of areas students are struggling with based on how they approach the questions and show their work. I also feel like I didn't know what was expected of me. I didn't know what the read when reading the book. I also didn't really know how I was doing in the class, which was a weakness for me. I also think that more resources should be made available in the Canvas site as well. I struggled to find some of the resources I needed because they were posted in the Teams chat, but not the Canvas website. I just think that posting it in both Canvas and Teams would be better and less confusing for students looking for those resources. I think one strength of this course was the concepts taught. They were not necessarily too difficult to understand or too overwhelming. The concepts were basic enough for me to understand, but also hard enough to challenge me (with my limited high school knowledge). I also think that Sapling was good for homework. It helped me understand the concepts in class and taught me more about applying the concepts. I do have to say that understanding the concepts seems easier in class than it actually is on my own, which could be considered a weakness of sorts. <br/></div>

Weaknesses: Did not feel like the discussion sessions were helpful. For some reason students did not collaborate well in break-out rooms. In pretty much all sessions I attended, nobody wanted to talk unless I started the conversation. Almost everyone preferred to stay on mute and off camera and work on their own and this was not helpful. And then there was very little time to go over the actual problems in class. 

The lack of partial credit for the mid-term exams was also very discouraging. <br/></div>
