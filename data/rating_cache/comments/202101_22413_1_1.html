<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I found that the first 6 weeks of this course were quite boring. I did not like the way that it was being taught and found I was not being given proper motivation/justification for what we were doing. However, after this, the course became excellent! it was intellectually challenging and I enjoyed how it was taught. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The weekly psets were exceptionally difficult, and took a ridiculous amount of time to complete (~8 hours per pset). <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Prof. Cohn is amazing. He is very knowledgable and a great positive influence. It was a lecture, but it felt like a seminar in terms of the engagement. The readings were very well-written.

Weaknesses: <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of the course is that the premise is to use mathematical objects to model musical ideas. In practice, this is efficient and pragmatic. At times, however, the reliance on pictures and/or "black box" techniques to convey concrete mathematical ideas was less effective. The course, in theory, could be presented from the perspective of a trained mathematician, who is fully interested in the rigor and maturity associated with high-level mathematical topics; but this would on the other hand alienate people not interested in the formalities of pure math. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think this class would've really benefitted from having sections. It felt like I had to teach myself most of the material through the psets instead of in lecture. Professor Cohn is incredibly knowledgable about this topic, though, and I enjoyed learning from someone so passionate. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Prof Cohn is great. He's really passionate about the material and just gets excited teaching it, which makes class nice. The problem sets really helped me get a handle on the material and made me internalize the concepts, which was a huge help for making the class make sense. 
Weaknesses: I feel like I didn't learn that much about music in this class. While Cohn made a good effort to motivate all the things we learned, I think we focused on very niche and contrived examples. But the math was cool! <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Ability to ask questions during lecture and office hours.
Weaknesses: Weekly problem sets were overwhelming, as was the final exam. Questions that are open ended felt impossible to master without more direction and guidance. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The problem sets were wonderfully thought provoking and I looked forward to them each week. The course was well-structured, giving time for a music theory refresh in the first month before naturally moving from topic to topic. However, there were times in the course where certain topics seemed overly abstract and unmotivated, so I think it is important to refer back to musical applications as often as possible. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course started off strong for me because it was very exciting to be able to put a mathematical structure to the music. As a cellist I had often thought about the mathematical structures of music while I was playing, and it was quite satisfying to begin a more formal investigation of things that I feel like most musicians have contemplated. I was always eager to see what was coming next, because I thought I would use these mathematical ideas to have an aha moment where I could better understand a musical idea. However, I feel like at times we became quite disconnected from music. We spent a lot of effort to put musical ideas into mathematical definitions, but I don't think they deepened my understanding of subject. For example, we were making graphs of diatonic 2 note space and made the observation that it was a torus. I was left with the feeling: "great, but so what?" Because we spent so much time moving musical ideas over to a mathematical domain, what I really wanted to see was the use of developments in the mathematical domain to aid our understanding of music. Is there some theorem from topology that helps us to understand some feature of music? What new is in this course that I wouldn't be able to understand through a more traditional music theory class?

All in all, math of music was still one of my favorite classes of the semester. There were ideas that were new and surprising to me, and the class is exceptionally well taught. I just would have liked to see some more rationale/application to music/payoff from our mathematical investigations. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength of the course was that it was well paced - not too fast or too slow.  A weakness was that the textbook was being written by Prof. Cohn as the class went on, so there was really only one explanation/POV for each topic for the students. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The material is interesting and the assessment is fairly reasonable.  The textbook and TA were both extremely helpful. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One strength is that there was a progression of information being taught, so one concept more or less led to the next concept. The information; however, is not particularly applicable either for musicians or mathematicians because of how obscure they are. While it is interesting to know something most people in this world do not know, it is very unlikely that the information will come up in the future unless you study it in particular. The problem sets were also quite difficult and sometimes very time-consuming because there is essentially only one place to get information (the provided textbook) and sometimes do not have straight forward answers. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â In general the course was interesting, but there definitely needs to be some polishing. Some times topics felt unmotivated and couldve been explained better. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: well-taught, lectures and reading go very hand-in-hand, and professor was very engaged with the students
Weaknesses: problem sets could have better feedback, problem set solutions would have also been very helpful <br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The material is fascinating, and lectures are given in such a way as to facilitate comprehension, especially when the material is more challenging. The problem sets were very well-constructed to practice and asses what we had learned that week. The textbook (written by the professor) was good, but sometimes there was some lack of clarity about notation norms and things like that (which I'm sure will get worked out in future iterations of this course). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Grading was a bit unclear and ambiguous. Setting up the course so that there would have been a greater distribution of assignments and points within assignments would have made the course grade less sensitive to minor errors. Overall, though, I enjoyed Prof. Cohn and his enthusiasm about the subject matter. Hallie was a very helpful and kind TF as well. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â some problem set questions were essentially impossible to get right because there was no right answer. the professor would ask us to speculate about something and if you don't speculate the way he wants you to (which is impossible to predict) then there was no way to get it and the feedback on these types of questions was never helpful <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The main strength of the course is that Dr. Cohn clearly cares very much about the class, and is very enthusiastic and available to help students. The weaknesses of the course mostly stem from the intense workload and opaque grading. We would have a week to complete each homework (sometimes less) and I would end up spending probably between twenty and thirty hours on each one. Questions similar to "speculate how X could be interpreted in the context of Y" were relatively common on the homeworks, and on open-ended questions like these the grading was particularly opaque. It was not uncommon to see just a PDF annotation with a score and no elaboration for grading. Additionally, the graders' interpretations of definitions provided in the textbook were often inconsistent, both between graders and for the same grader on different homeworks. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course material is interesting at times, and every unit builds on the previous units. In that sense, I think that the curriculum is well-designed. However, the course material didn't offer nearly as many real-world applications as I would have hoped. While I feel like I learned some cool things, I'm not sure how much I've benefitted from learning these things. Some of the technical aspects of the course had minor issues, such as the relatively frequent typos/mistakes on the PSET's, which hinder learning and easily frustrates students when they are a bit too regular. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is an incredibly captivating recasting of musical truths taken for granted by musicians as echoes of the properties of the small numbers upon which different cultures build their musical and rhythmic systems. It allows musicians and friends of music to see musical theory from a completely new perspective and provides satisfying answers to many questions traditional music theory teaching leaves unanswered. The mathematical methods introduced are very accessible and require no technical knowledge above algebra, yet are likely to be new and exciting even for students with advanced backgrounds in mathematics. My one remark would be that the course introduces many novel ways of analyzing music, but discusses few actual examples of applying these analytical tools to real music. It would have been fascinating to see more examples of the ideas we learnt about at play in compositions from different times/genres/cultures. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was a fun course that introduced some topics of interest to both math and music people. It was extremely slow-paced for me but I was probably very over-qualified, which I knew going into it, so this isn't necessarily something that should change. <br/></div>
