<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I LOVED the flipped classroom, particularly for this topic. I didn't know much coming in, but Professor Mattingly's lectures along with the readings gave me plenty to confidently engage in section. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: virtual town halls with outside guests who are super knowledgable and passionate about Chinese politics, very interesting lectures and slides (really opened my eyes to everything about China), professor Mattingly is very knowledgable and passionate about China, interesting readings although a bit too much reading load, the professor and course materials were pretty unbiased 
weaknesses: did not find my TA to be helpful or useful whether it be writing my response papers or just help with class materials, I wish professor Mattingly held office hours, discussion sections can be boring <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The content of this course was very engaging. However, the fact that we were asked to watch about 1 hour's worth of recorded lectures (not including the time it takes to take notes), read the course readings well enough to answer weekly reading quizzes, attend a weekly discussion section, and show up to a town hall once a week was actually quite time-consuming and demanding. You'll learn a lot, but this class is a lot more work than it initially appeared to me. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - well-organized prerecorded lectures

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: great professor, very helpful TAs, truly interesting content. The organization of course materials is very logical and flows well. The final crisis simulation is a lot of fun while also integrating materials from the course. Workload is very manageable (after section presentations were cancelled).
Not really any weaknesses. It's a great class! <br/></div>
</div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Mattingly is engaging and I enjoyed the recorded lectures. We touched on all of the topics that are relevant right now regarding China. A lot of the readings were interesting too although I think a couple were overly long/detailed and could be eliminated. The weekly quizzes were easy if you did the readings. The final simulation was relatively straightforward and fun, although everyone seemed to do well so I am unsure of how it will be graded.

Weaknesses: At first the sections were not standardized. I found out that my section was way harder than others in that we had to do occasional powerpoint presentations that weren't on the syllabus. Later in the semester we did away with these presentations and I believe the sections became more similar to one another, but next time this should be the case from the beginning. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was a nice mix between recorded and live material in light of Covid-19 and I liked having the recorded lectures there to refer back to when completing assignments. All announcements were sent out very promptly and questions about the course were answered clearly. The content of the course was also engaging to anyone who is interesting in comparative politics and current events in politics, which I think is more relevant than ever now. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths great content, very interesting and enjoyable to learn about. Recorded lectures are absolutley integral to student learning during the pandemic. The town halls were amazing too (little to worry about for us students and allowed for a time that we could sit back, relax, and learn about interesting people/topics). Personally I thought this class was the best class for pandemic learning. 

Weaknesses none. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was really interesting and provided a great insight into China, a growing global power. All the topics we covered were really interesting and Professor Mattingly explained the concepts really well in his mini-lectures. The town halls and guest speakers were all fascinating and gave new valuable perspectives to the things we were learning. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Prof. Mattingly is a great lecturer. He is also young and energetic and his passion/knowledge about China is evident. The pre-recorded lectures were always great and I appreciated that I could watch them in my own time at my own pace. The workload is pretty heavy, but very manageable. 
No weaknesses. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really loved the layout of the course. It's really smart to start with some background in Chinese history before delving into the modern day. I honestly didn't get that much out of the town halls and probably would've just preferred more lecture from the professor instead of bringing in experts. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Grading structure was moved around a bit a couple times to standardize things across sections (probably a good thing). Curve is fairly generous. You can drop your bottom two quizzes but the quizzes are straightforward anyway. Teaching staff is SUPER receptive to feedback. No exams, just three short response papers (they have a clear rubric and TAs are happy to advise) and a fairly fun final simulation  Im not your typical MUN/ debate type but I just prepared in advance and still really enjoyed it! <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Very relevant course material and interesting sets of readings to accompany what we cover; in many ways, the course is grounded around understanding Xi Jinping and the last 10-15 years in China (while overviewing the historical context that helps explain contemporary China) which is a fascinating subject of study; doesn't involve anything too theoretical, a pro for me; Prof. Mattingly is great professor, knowledgeable, makes engaging lecture slides that integrate great photos and multimedia, always interesting to hear him share observations on China; Professor Mattingly also did a great job taking advantage of Zoom to invite lots of guest speakers -- we heard from New York Times/Wall Street Journal journalists, other academics, former diplomats pretty much once a week in short 25-minute talks on Zoom. Weaknesses: While I really liked my TF, I often felt that section discussion was very broad and just feel unproductive/uninspiring; I think feedback could have been a little more direct when it came to response papers and progress in the course. I'm leaving with a lot of new knowledge but maybe not much progress on reading/writing skills, which is fine. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths, Professor Mattingly is very respectful of your time, so keeps lectures at the corresponding length. The speakers give you insight into contemporary politics. Weaknesses, there weren't a lot of instructions for response papers, and the point of section wasn't clear and it was often unrelated to class. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths was for sure the recorded lectures. They were exceptionally clear. I just think maybe a bit too many. Section wasn't particularly useful. You could get by in the course without really paying attention there. I thought the final crisis simulation didn't add to my understanding of the material at all. The quizzes at the beginning of the course were unfair and difficult, but they got much better at the end which I appreciated. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: extremely relevant course material, top-notch guest speakers, highly diverse reading list, excellent professor. Final simulation was much preferable to an exam and enabled critical interaction with entire course material. 
Weaknesses: town hall meetings with guests were often only around 30 minutes long, too short to have meaningful and in-depth conversations. Lacking medium to interact with Prof. Mattingly except in office hours, assignments didn't really require holistic view of course materials. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I learned a lot from this course and Prof. Mattingly is an excellent lecturer, even in a virtual format. However, some of the readings were really long and not very well-connected to the mini-lectures, especially the ones that you had to write a reflection paper on. I received a lot of mixed messages on how to write the reflection papers for this course, so that made it difficult to do well. Prof. Mattingly brought in some great guest speakers, but there was not much time to discuss their lectures, even in discussion section. Overall, I learned a lot in this course, but we barely skimmed the surface of Chinese history/politics/current events. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: content is really interesting, professor is great, and the course structure is great. Loved the town halls and the recorded mini lectures, which were well-delivered, clear, and engaging. Readings felt relevant for the most part, and the quantity of reading was very manageable, especially if you've done some humanities before (e.g., Directed Studies).

Weaknesses: Discussion section was slightly annoying/boring, though it wasn't the fault of the teaching staff. The section was par for the course as far as humanities sections go. Many of the usual humanities discussion section dynamics were present, even in this virtual format. Students tripped over themselves to regurgitate some variant of the same surface-level understanding of the readings to try to impress the TA and get their participation points. Rather than listening to the unoriginal opinions of other undergraduates with a political science background that is functionally equivalent to my own, I would have appreciated hearing more from the TAs, who are serious students of political science and Chinese politics, and who intend to pursue this field as a career.

Thankfully there were few, if any, repetitions of the word "interesting" or "just to jump off/pirouette/somersault off of that point". But maybe this was just a strength of my discussion section. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think Professor Mattingly did an excellent job tailoring this class to our zoom circumstances. He deserves a lot of credit for constructing brief recorded lectures, using the fact that everything was online to get high-profile guest speakers who wouldn't be accessible in person, and using assessments other than major exams. I think the content of the course was pretty good. 

One thing that I struggled with was the response papers. I felt like we were given close to zero guidance about what was expected in the response papers, beyond a brief description in the syllabus. It's possible that other TFs set clearer expectations, but mine didn't. I felt like I figured out what the papers were supposed to be like over the course of the semester based on feedback from each one but I could have used clearer guidelines from the start. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was very strong in that it covered a ton of essential material via informative material. However, it was a bit disorganized in terms of content delivery, insofar as we had a number of modes of learning (virtual lectures, quizzes, live lectures, guest speakers, readings). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One strength of this course are the brief, yet highly informative "townhall meetings" once a week that feature prominent people that are involved in Chinese life and politics. Another strength are the discussion sections, which encourage engagement through open ended questions and allow for debate of the topics. 
One small weakness is the questions on the weekly quizzes - some quizzes had very specific questions that were difficult to answer because of their narrowness. This could be improved (and was improved in the beginning of the semester) by making the quiz questions more general. <br/></div>

Weaknesses: TA-led discussions and recorded lectures were sometimes redundant (I felt like the reading was the most valuable part of the course).  I also wish that the class offered a writing credit option to improve writing skills.  Finally, I think the town halls with guest speakers had the potential to be really valuable but I often felt like it was only a few specific questions that were asked.

To improve this course, I would say it should focus on improving writing, have more direction for the town halls, and try to make the recorded lectures more interesting/less redundant to the readings. <br/></div>

Weakness: You are required to write 3 response papers for this course in response to your choice of assigned readings. There seemed to be little guidance for the first paper, which led to some personal confusion on how to format and write the paper.
