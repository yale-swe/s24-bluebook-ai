<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course builds upon a lot of the content from 230 and provides a strong solid mathematical foundation in linear algebra, analysis, and proof-writing. This course could be improved with more timely feedback on graded work. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is very Pset intensive, which makes the learning repetitive at times. However, while this is a criticism, I can't think of many other ways with which this sort of teaching is possible. The course requires much practice on the part of the student, so a high workload is logical. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Pat is a great lecturer, although I think I liked his teaching in 230 better. This semester some things felt a little more hand-wavy/'you do this and then obviously get that'. Also, the speed of grading was terrible... everything was graded around two months after it was originally due. OH were usually helpful and gathertown was a pretty good way to do it/preserve the spirit of small group collaboration of normal/in-person OH. I thought this class was slightly harder/less intuitive than 230. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Great lectures, great instructor, but towards the end the proofs of complex ideas related to the Implicit and Inverse Function Theorem were breezed over and were very hard to understand. Felt like I wasn't sure exactly what was going on and kind of applied the theorems without a full grasp of what was going on. Other than that small issue, the first 9/10ths of the course were amazing. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the homework was very difficult, but the teaching was excellent and Pat is an incredible instructor. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Well, this class isn't being taught next year, but... Strenghts: Pat is extremely kind and makes math fun. Also, I feel as though Pat is better at teaching linear algebra than analysis, so the "bonus material" was better suited to the class // Weaknesses: Can feel a little disorganized. I don't really know why we did integrals so late. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: I think we have covered a decent amount of material and shown the connections between calculus and lin-alg
Weakness: sometimes the organization feels a bit chaotic, and we do not get in-depth on any of the topics <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The lectures are straightforward, and build upon the lectures we previously looked at, so you are always moving forward. All lectures are recorded, so you can revise information later if you did not fully understand the material in one class. The problem sets are challenging and push your mathematical thinking (as they should),  but there are plenty of office hour sessions for the students to make use of if you need support. The whole environment of the class is really positive, because the teacher is always upbeat and encouraging to the students (not to mention is flexible in his due dates if you have conflicting deadlines or something important came up/happened). The TA's are really nice and helpful too. On top of this, I found that the student body of the class was really nice and a lot of fun, and we helped each other better understand the material. Overall, it was an amazing course.

I cannot think of a weakness for this course. (Only one preference: the lecture notes are usually in a file format that is really small when you download it. If it is possible to make it bigger that would be great!) <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: 1. Pat is a gem of a person - he's helpful, accomodating and just generally a great guy. His lectures are always engaging because of his enthusiasm and his laidback style of teaching (which often features cameos of his three cats). 2. Many might deem this one a weakness, but the problem sets really cemented concepts taught in class, while honing the all-important proof-writing skillset. 3. The grading is pretty generous, and if you're working on problem sets with others, getting an A is not hard at all. Weaknesses: 1. This sequence is called Vector Calculus &amp; Linear Algebra, but content is majorly lacking on the vector calculus side of things - we didn't get to any of the vector calculus theorems, which is unexcusable given the title of the course. 2. It's a lot of work every week, but imo it's worth it. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Pat's enthusiasm and great explanations as always, problem sets were reasonable yet challenging enough for me to synthesize the material, and the material itself was interesting. Weaknesses: some theorems in class were proved somewhat less rigorously, and some lectures felt rushed because there were a lot of topics to cover. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength of the course was the wide range of interesting and difficult problems on the problem sets each week which helped me to solidify my understanding of the material we covered in class. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Teaching staff was enthusiastic and supportive. I liked Ed Discussion for asking questions and getting answers in a pretty timely manner, but I would've liked it more if posts were anonymous to instructors, not just other students. I often felt paranoid about the optics of showing that I didn't understand a certain topic or question and some anonymity would have helped that. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Pat's lectures are mostly pretty good, the TA's office hours are a life-saver. Weaknesses: the problem sets are almost unnecessarily long, sometimes the explanations on problems are not very clear and I would finish the problem not knowing what I had proved and how it connects to other stuff we're doing (you'll eventually find out that it does connect when Pat mentions it a few months later--but at that point it's not very useful). The class is overall a bit unorganized. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The biggest strength is pat. Also homework assignmentsthese were always challenging and at least as educational (in terms of learning new theorems and proof techniques) as lectures. I cant think of any weaknesses. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the topic is very interesting and learning about proof based math has been extremely helpful for me even though I dont plan on majoring in STEM. Pat is great in explaining difficult concepts and he genuinely cares about his students. Weaknesses: assignments and exams can be graded and returned faster. It can also be helpful to have a detailed syllabus listing topics, assignments/exams dates, etc. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths:
- challenging problem sets
- good presentation of info in lecture

Potential improvements:
- motivate proofs in lecture with important examples
- have supplemental office hours for specific topics
- ordering of topics could be more smooth I think <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It is a challenging but fun course, the Psets are pretty challenging but it should be fine if you attend office hours for help, which are available in multiple time periods across the week. We did not use a textbook this semester, so it may feel less organized if you are used to having a textbook, but the lectures are pretty well laid out and I didn't think it was a problem. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The level at which content is presented is a clear advantage of the course. You simply learn so much! The focus on proof writing is excellent for an introductory course to the math major, picking up some cool math along the way. There is a good mixture of proofs and examples provided (although I would like to see some of these proofs in more detail; the supplemental videos were helpful here). Pat is super caring, helpful, and a little chaotic; the class is less structured as a result (I personally like to have some reference text but the flexibility of the class did allow us to see many cool topics). There is a lot of work! It is quite the time commitment. Do not underestimate how long it takes to write out PSETs!! Collaboration and friendship are key to get through the year.

Grading feedback could be substantially improved. The quality of the feedback I received was very helpful, but it was significantly delayed. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was very well organized, with lots of office hours and extracurricular opportunities to enhance your understanding. I think one thing that could be improved would be a "checkup" every so often about proof writing style, since I felt like we didn't talk about this much after the beginning of the course, but it would have been good to work on being more succinct (in a way that's still clear). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course had many strengths. The community had the most inclusive culture I have encountered in a STEM environment. The material was fascinating and engaging. I believe this course could be improved by centralizing the material into an easier-to-review format in addition to the available lecture notes. Since this course built upon previous theories that we had proven in class to address increasingly difficult mathematical concepts, there were specific theorems that we were allowed to use on exams and in problem sets. I think it would be helpful to have a list of the theorems that were proven in class, because I often found myself combing through the lecture notes to find the theorem statement. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course contained a lot of information. Most classes were spent reviewing multiple proofs and/or examples that challenged  students to think deeply about the topic at hand. However, the subject material felt all over at times, jumping from one topic to another. The homework, while relating to the material covered in class, often asked students to learn concepts on their own. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Pat is a great teacher; everyone loves him and it's so easy to get to know him -- there are LOTS of office hours, GO! Pat makes the class very welcoming and encourages students to collaborate, and he being the professor of MATH 231 (the second portion of the sequence) was a great part of why I continued. A weakness would be getting feedback for your work--like homeworks and portions of tests, however, justing knowing Pat and the other AWESOME TAs, they would be more than willing to talk to you about it. Also, if you go to office hours, you already know if you are on the right track or not. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Pat is incredible, and refining our proof writing skills is really important in helping us improve the quality of our work. Two small weaknesses were (1) there aren't many applications/we don't get too much of a chance to do "plug and chug" problems which may be helpful to practice for "real life" (by the nature of the proof-based course) and (2) the ending of the course felt a bit rushed, and I personally don't feel like we really got full closure on the topic of manifolds. Literally everything else about this class is amazing--the community, the quality of the course material, Pat's emerald hair, etc. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The weekly problem sets, while pretty draining and occasionally stressful, create a necessary rhythm and keep the intensity of the course pretty constant.

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course had a huge task set for it: math 230-231 is supposed to be all about community, on top of introducing people unfamiliar with formal mathematics to it, all over a zoom lecture, with no meaningful breaks. I think that the class was a good class, but it was fighting an uphill battle, especially as everyone got tired, both the students and the instructors. I have immense respect for Pat's ability to run an engaging class, and I think when classes resume in person most of these problems will be solved. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Course organization is great, content builds on itself in a very logical way. Course format, in terms of how lectures relate to problem sets as well as the large availability of TAs and peer tutors, works great!

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Consistent, and although the workload is pretty heavy for every pset, you know what you're getting. Even if it took a long time, it's clear what the work required is in order to do well, and it's doable. You have several directions to ask for help from the many people that are willingpeers, pset groups, the office hours, online!

Weaknesses: Even though I learned a lot from 230, I still was often not prepared for the amount of time I needed to spend to finish and type up some assignments. Unless you're already pretty good at proof-based math, be prepared to spend at least the time required in 230, if not more for longer psets. Feedback on psets and midterms was sometimes delayed, which definitely could have helped me catch a mistake that I later repeated on the final... <br/></div>
