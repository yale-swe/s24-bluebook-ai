<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> The professor is great not only in organisation and selecting readings that build on and inform what we can accomplish in our writing, in addition to getting a chance to talk with some of the authors themselves, but in ensuring everyone's voice in the class is heard and validated, making each person feel uplifted and able to share as openly possible. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> This course has every strength and not a single weakness. Singlehandedly the best course I've taken in Yale and that is taking into consideration that we were limited to zoom calls due to Covid-19. Despite only physically being connected through a screen, this class had the most amazing community and the bonds I created supersede any in-person seminar I have taken. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> There is no way to improve this class other than for it to last longer. To highlight any one facet as a strength is to undermine every other quality, all of which are equally exemplary. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> There are no weaknesses of this course. From the syllabus to the close attention to detail in workshop, Prof. Hopper has designed this course to be one of the best I've taken at Yale thus far. This class is inclusive, and I truly felt a sense of family (despite never having met anyone in-person, since it was entirely on Zoom). Prof. Hopper's approach to writing is insightful and supportive. My creative nonfiction writing has exponentially improved having taken this class, and there is truly no other course like "Writing About Family." <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> The only way in which I feel this course could be improved is if it were longer than five weeks! Dr. Hopper made the most of every single class discussion, which I walked away from with a heightened awareness of writing techniques I could apply to my own work, empathy for my peer's experiences and perspectives, and a level of personal growth I did not believe an academic setting was capable of fostering. 

One of the strengths of this course were the three visits from guest writers: Jodi Foster, Vanessa Martir, and Minh Vu. Before these writers joined our class, we had read their acclaimed essays and prepared questions for them. To have the opportunity to converse openly about our writing process with incredible, published authors is rare. I benefitted enormously from the insights they shared, such as narrative techniques, how they revise their work, and how they decide which works to publish and when to keep their writing private. 

Another highlight of this class were the two collaborative essay workshops. In the first workshop, each student read all of the other students' drafts and commented on all of them; engaging in the revision process as a large group enabled me to both provide and receive specific feedback. One member of our class even highlighted a favorite quote from everyone's pieces in her comments. The second essay workshop was more intimate, as we read and discussed our drafts in smaller groups of three. The opportunity to spend more time with each other's essays and provide feedback in a conversational manner was no less meaningful than hearing the entire class' commentary. In addition, Dr. Hopper provided us with an opportunity to raise questions about our writing process at the beginning of every class, so that we could learn from each other's writing process. The "Elements of a Non-Academic Essay" handout she provided was also helpful as a framing tool when giving feedback. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> Strengths:
There is a lot of flexibility in this course, so whatever your experience with creative writing, personal writing or writing about family, might be, I feel like there is a lot of space to grow and explore. Professor Hopper chooses readings that are excellent examples about how different writing techniques, styles, etc can be used to tell a story, part of a story, or to retell a story in a new way. Dr. Hopper creates an environment that allows you to genuinely focus on the writing instead of checking off boxes, which I think can be necessary in confidence building for new writers or people who are exploring/re-exploring creative non-fiction. 

There is a lot of open "space" in the class. And by space, I mean flexibility in the assignments but also class discussions, and you don't have to subscribe to one notion of "family" throughout. Write about multiple families, if you'd like (I most certainly did!). That space also leaves room for people to learn about and acknowledge relative levels of privilege when it comes to storytelling and who has a voice, is allowed to have a voice, when telling the stories of their family. It can be used for some to be exposed to biases they didn't know that they have, and there seemed like to me to be space to begin the process of "unlearning" (especially for cis white women, which I'll elaborate on below).

Weaknesses/Things to be aware of:
This is the type of class where who's in it plays an important role. There is no pressure from Dr. Hopper to be "vulnerable" or to tell intimate details about your life, or to subscribe to a particular notion of family when you choose your writing subjects. But this is the type of class where you read and workshop other people's writings, and so be prepared to potentially deal with some intense emotions and extremely intimate details of other people's lives. My class did pretty okay self-governing ourselves when it came to be being a "safe space" but it's totally dependent on who is in the class. Not quite sure how Dr. Hoppper would have dealt with someone coming to her about feeling overwhelmed or out of place due to heavy content that was sometimes discussed; I think that is something you should be aware of when considering this course.

Another thing to be aware of is your positionality in relation to the rest of your class members. My class was full of predominantly cis white women--it was incredibly uncomfortable, and sometimes annoying, to listen to cis white women talk about families and parenting styles in Black families, Black queer families, etc. (as a non-cis Black person). While I think it can be important and useful to engage with discomfort, at other times it is just emotional labor. For example, one time one of my classmates mentioned that since English was not their first language they would like feedback on their transitions, and at least two or three people (aka, cis white women) responded with something along the lines of "omg, never would have known English wasn't your first language! You speak it so well, your writing is so good," etc. Moments like these, plus constantly being misgendered and people not owning up to it/acknowledging it made the class a bit of a drag. A lot of the white women did not seem to realize the privilege that they have in being able to trace their family history back multiple generations, something that those of us whose histories have been stolen or hidden from us due to colonialism, racism, and imperalism, cannot. 

Improvements that I'd like to see:
More intentional discussions about race, class, gender, and violence. This class is called writing about family, but I felt like not all of the short writing assignments (particularly the reading responses, which were only about a paragraph) needed to be focused on writing about our OWN families. I would have preferred if we engaged the diversity and complexity of works we read and had specific, centered discussions on those four issues. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;"> The biggest strength of the course is the wonderful group of people and the discussions we had together based on our readings. Could seriously not think of a way to improve it. <br/></div>
