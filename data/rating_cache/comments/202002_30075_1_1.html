<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought it skewed heavily towards earlier film history. It took us 4 classes to cover beginning of film up to the start of WWII (about 35ish years), but then it covered Regan era to present (40 years) in 1 class.
I'd say it could be improved if it were distributed either more evenly or perhaps even skewed towards more recent history. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This would have been a lot better if it was taught in person, not as condensed, and more lectures at a shorter length. 3 hours at a time on Zoom is too much. Overall, however, the course gave interesting insights into the history of film. Writing discussion posts about the films could have been better as it did not feel like there was much interaction between the posts. Additionally, I did not feel like there were many enjoyable/quality films on the syllabus. The last three were fine, but many of the others were mediocre or just flat-out boring. I would have preferred to have spent a lot more time on the second half of the twentieth century instead of the first, as the overall quality of film tends to increase over time. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The topics included in the course discussion are diverse and intellectually stimulating. The discussion environment is open and encouraging. This course is well organized, and the instructors are articulate and knowledgeable. The student received immediate and detailed feedback. 

Weakness: The course is too short. The time spend on each film genre was brief. However, the intense schedule is understandable for the summer semester. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Consistency. What the professor said we would be graded on was not what my TA actually graded us on. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course seemed to struggle with defining what its focus was on. It consistently switched between a focus on film history and a focus on American history. This switching led to confusion about what exactly the course was about. I believe a focus on American history and how this was reflected in the films of the time would be a better angle for the course.

There also seemed to be a discrepancy between what was said to be graded on papers and the weekly screening reports and what was actually graded. Assignments were returned by the TF graded for elements that were either not mentioned on the assignment page or were said to not be required. These discrepancies led to a lack of confidence in what was needed to succeed in the course. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â (1) Professor Jacobs was also very understanding of the challenges we might experience given the fact that this course is being taught online. (2) The syllabus is incredible! Not only were the readings especially interesting and thought-provoking, the syllabus was incredibally diverse. So many film professors teach "Great Films" and then only screen white, male directors. But that only reflects the historic biases of academia. In desiging this year's syllabus, Professor Jacob's has selected great films that are made by women and filmmakers of color. I really appreciated the thoughtfulness exemplified by her selection of films and I think the rest of the Yale Film Department could learn a thing or two. It's one thing to talk the talk, but having your syllabus reflect your values is walking the walk. 

Under Professor Jacob's leadership, this course is kind of perfect. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: 
Weaknesses: the readings could be made much more relevant to class, as half the time we did not discuss the readings in class or in discussion section, and it felt like they were a bit too removed from the topic of classes. there was also a lot of material condensed into single classes, and it felt like we were speeding through the material instead of sitting in it and enjoying it. a possible solution to the speedy pace of the course could be to assign readings covering the topics we skipped over/brushed over, in order to give students a fuller picture of the material/the history we learned about. <br/></div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I enjoyed all aspects of the course and would not say that it had any weaknesses. Despite the virtual platform presenting students from actually being there, I felt like everyone was engaged and active during discussions. I enjoyed the classs three-part structure (presentation, lecture, discussion), for it kept me active and alert during classes. I also enjoyed the chronological structure of each class that made the course very interconnected and a good representative of shifts in American society. Additionally, switching the programming every hour or so was a genius move that kept students engaged for over three hoursa task not as easy as it may seem! We had adequate breaks, and I was grateful that Professor Jacobs stayed on during the breaks and after class to answer our questions. I would not offer any suggestions to improve the class, for I do not think that it needs to be altered at all. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course material is very interesting and the films were very well correlated with the lecture material. I think the class being taught online made it more challenging to focus on lectures, but overall the material was engaging. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Very effective teaching style with good amount of participation. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Some strengths are definitely the professors - Carolyn and Melinda are wonderful teachers - as well as the overall format of the course. I enjoyed the student presentations as they allowed everyone in the class to stay engaged as well as learn something new related to the lecture for that day. Discussion section was also a great opportunity to further discuss the film we screened for class and to help gain a better understanding of the greater culture and context from which the film was produced. I think one weakness was the fact that it was a summer class; as with all summer classes, we had to cover a semester's worth of content in just 5 weeks so we definitely moved fast and didn't get to go in depth about certain topics that both students and the teachers would have liked to. Nonetheless, it was still a very enjoyable class and I definitely learned a lot in just 5 short weeks. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: So many. First, lectures were engaging since Professor Jacobs encouraged our input and analysis of the materials she presented. The feedback I received on papers and other classwork was also impressive. Melinda Stang, Prof. Jacobss Teaching Fellow, was my section leader, and she provided thorough, personalized feedback about each of my assignments. Even though Professor Jacobs did not directly grade my work, she also reviewed my assignments and provided constructive secondary feedback. Professor Jacobs and her TF also selected films for us to watch that melded very well with the current Black Lives Matter Movement, so many of our discussions focused on race, allowing this central and painful foundation of American history to take center stage. Prof Jacobss teamwork with her Teaching Fellow was also a strength. Although Prof Jacobs was the primary instructor, she welcomed Melindas input during lecture, and their friendly relationship created a positive atmosphere in our class. The student presentations were also a plus since our peers presentations provided a different perspective on the topics we discussed due to their personal experiences. 

Weaknesses: I cannot think of any. <br/></div>
