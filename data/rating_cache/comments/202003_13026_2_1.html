<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Lectures that were pre-recorded and those that were live were essentially identical, with only a few minor changes that made it necessary to watch both. That resulted in a big investment of time for largely overlapping information, without much opportunity for student interaction/engagement. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: it's clear that Professor McCarthy has taught this course many times and has organized it very well. The class website is well-developed and a good resource.
Weaknesses: The q-sets don't really promote retention of the information learned in lecture. I find that some smaller assignments related to the material might be better. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: interesting material and the QSETs are much better than midterms in my opinion (they're like open book, timed PSETs, so you spend 3 hours on them a week, in one sitting, and there are no midterms)
Weaknesses: the professor isn't the most engaging, and (at least this year) there was so much repetition between the live/recorded lectures that it was hard to always pay attention and retain the information <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: covers a lot of content in very little time; Weaknesses: goes over too much content -- might be better suited to a two part course <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I genuinely started succeeding in this class when I stopped doing what the professor recommended--we're asked to read and watch all of the pre-prepared lecture materials before coming to class each week, but it's a lot of the same things repeated with minor deviances so it's easy to get lost/confused or just overload the information. The time of the pre-recorded lectures alone doubled or tripled lecture time each week. The materials are all very well-prepared, they just need to be combed through better or there needs to be some sort of sign of what's most pertinent to the class considering how much content there is to learn. When I stopped looking at the materials before class, took notes on all that was mentioned and went back through the pre-prepared materials to fill in the gaps I started retaining and learning a whole lot more. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: having access to the lectures / notes before hand as to be able to go through them at my own pace and take notes 

weakness: this sort of made the live lectures redundant. but at the same time I was really glad to just be able to focus during the lecture rather than trying to write everything down so I'm not sure what the solution to this would be <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked how there were multiple resources tackling the same topic so we can have a better understanding. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor McCarthy was a clear lecturer and the material was very interesting. The course is phenomenally organized. The professor's website has all the lecture videos and notes conveniently located, and the PSETs were helpful in learning the material. He held weekly review session, and also held midterm/final reviews.

Weaknesses: There was way too much material covered in one semester. We would have hours of lecture video to watch each week, and then on top of that, we had additional live lectures to tune into. I think maybe the material and some of the experiment explanations could have been cut down. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â For every class McCarthy tells you to read a chapter in the textbook, watch ~2 hours of prerecorded lectures, read the lecture notes posted on his website, and attend a live lecture. All four of these resources cover roughly the same material, so doing all of them was excessive for me. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is difficult because it is extremely content heavy, and there is a lot of information which can be difficult to keep up with. However, the information is organized in an EXCELLENT manner. Everything is easily accessible on Prof. McCarthy's website and his notes are very easy to follow  and super helpful if you miss a lecture or to review.
Additionally, the weekly qsets are open note which really helps students focus on the material from the lecture and review it to build information to prepare for the final. I would say this is the best accessible course I have taken so far at Yale. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The class covers a lot of information, which is cool but can also be stressful if you aren't staying on top of the workload. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the course material was organized in an organized way and was taught clearly, not to mention the material of the course was simply fascinating (e.g., sleep, stress, etc)

Weaknesses: For a remote semester, the workload was too much. It is a lot to expect students to watch an entire prerecorded lecture and read lecture notes before actual live lecture. This made studying hard as well since there was so much different places the material was covered. Furthermore, the prerecorded lectures were often longer than an hour and thirty minutes. It is fair that students can play the lectures at a faster speed but it was still a struggle to capture all of the material and stay on top of the class. On top of that, there were weekly qsets that required students to chunk out 3 hours time. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There were no weaknesses in this course. I enjoyed the weekly QSets, which allowed students to keep up with material weekly. I greatly enjoyed the pre-recorded and live lectures, which all gave an encompassing view of every aspect of the course as well. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: fascinating content and knowledgeable professor. Weaknesses (not exactly weaknesses, just some things to keep in mind): HOURS of pre-recorded content, 3hr qsets, and lectures the reiterate the pre-recorded content. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: doable problem sets worth 70% of your grade, 5% participation grade if you do quizzes, passionate and knowledgeable professor
Weakness: lectures can be long and time consuming <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course is designed to allow students to thrive. Professor McCarthy has his own website with all the lecture notes posted, past recorded lecture and review sessions. There are also pre-lecture videos that students watch. With the multiple sources of notes available, students are setup to read and hear the lecture material multiple times.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I feel like this class is one of those that is definitely challenging but you are AMPLY warned by everyone who's taken it and by any review you read. It's difficult and there's a lot of info to learn but you know that going in. That being said, it seemed like a lot of people were confused about how much recorded content there was on top of going to lecture. It did total to about 6-8 hours a week, but there was also not a ton of reading, so I think it was fair. I just wanted to say that as a strength because you know what this class will be and the expectations are really clear. Another strength is that we could ask questions on Piazza anytime and get a good answer. Professor McCarthy would answer questions directly on there which is something I don't see professors do a lot. Also, he had separate review sessions each week and there were a lot of TAs with office hours, so you could always get help with something really easily. <br/></div>

The qsets were also confusingly graded, and I ended up getting points taken off for not saying enough about things when the question never specified how much we had to write. There was a lot of material to cover and I appreciate the depth and breadth of the course, but it was frustrating to watch the prerecorded lectures for sometimes over two hours only to have the same material gone over in less detail in class. <br/></div>

I also wish the in-person lectures had more new materials rather than almost a direct summary of recorded lectures. I also wish that more compassion and less - I don't think ableism is the right word, but something similar and worrying - was extended to the patients in cited studies. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Requiring us to watch two hours of recorded lectures twice a week and ALSO attend synchronous lectures made this class take up significantly more time than it should have as a 1hr 15 min class twice a week.

Prof. McCarthy is great as well. He knows so much and is very willing to help. 

Weaknesses: The final even (though it was open-note this year) was just a brain killer due to its sheer breadth of material. I highly recommend that this class maintains the Q-set format with still having a midterm exam to lessen the huge load that the final puts on the students. I studied for hours but still felt very unprepared when taking the exam. I have so much respect for the people who took the final on paper/in-person in previous years because it is impossible. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the sheer quantity of information covered, the professor's thorough and detailed lectures, resource availability for a more in-depth understanding

Weaknesses: For those who wish to take thorough notes and actually understand the content in the lectures, prerecorded lectures take up a considerable amount of time. (A 30 min video might take 1 hr to watch.) The information taught in prerecorded lectures is then reiterated in live lectures, making the class incredibly time-consuming.

Learning is rewarding when you are in the zone and are consistently engaged with the material at hand. However, during a pandemic, when motivation is already low and all classes occur via a computer screen, it can be very difficult to sit down at a desk for hours on end to watch lectures for a single class. The combination of readings, notes, prerecorded lectures, live lectures, and old lectures (even if you don't use all of them) becomes overwhelming. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The greatest strength and weakness of the course are strikingly the same: the ample, ample amount of material that is provided. Each 75 minute lecture came not only with a corresponding slideshow, but also with a thorough note supplement and 1.5-3 hours of pre-recorded material to watch before lecture. While this much material can be extremely helpful, given that repetition is key for understanding the anatomy and physiology of the brain, I often found the sheer amount of material to be both overwhelming and unrealistic (especially within a virtual setting where Zoom fatigue is very much a real thing). I quickly came to a point where I, as a student taking four other courses, had to selectively choose which content to focus on, and unfortunately this resulted in me only watching the pre-recorded lectures and rarely attending the live lectures (which were usually a less thorough review of the pre-recorded lectures). In order to improve live lecture attendance, there needs to be a simplification of material in order to reduce (if not completely eliminate) some of the pre-recorded lectures. I believe this simplification would also help students perform better on the final exam, as I found that materials that I focused on in the pre-recorded lectures were far more complex than the more fundamental understanding required for the test. Ultimately, I ended up spending so much time on the small details that I missed the fundamental cores, leading to a worse performance on the exam than I would have hoped for. <br/></div>

Weakness: I would have liked there to be more application based questions rather than just referring back to the notes and lectures. I also do not really understand the point of having recorded lectures and live lectures. The live lectures repeated what was said in the recorded and for the most part didn't include new information related to the topics of that day. Also, since this course was an 1 hour and 15 min and the recorded lectures were meant to be the main focus of the class, I would have liked them to shorter and more condense to fit that time slot which did occur more towards the end of the semester. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The recorded lectures and notes/pre recorded lectures were very helpful. However, the final was brutal and I felt unprepared and overwhelmed. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really appreciated how the lecture notes were given in advance, which meant that I could study ahead of time and also revise effectively for the qSets. However, I found the volume of content a bit overwhelming, and the time commitment required to engage with all the pre-recorded and live lectures was too much for me to handle. Personally, a more distilled version of the lectures would have been more helpful. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The prerecorded videos are extremely thorough and well-explained. 
Weaknesses: Extremely time consuming to get through all the material each week, and it takes a lot more time in the Zoom format than it would have in person. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There was a lot of material that we were expected to know in detail, and the class went very quickly. I don't know if this is a weakness or a strength, though. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths were that we learned so so much about the brain in this class! Weakness is that there was a lot of material, slightly overwhelming especially in the first half of the semester <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Very well organized: the website really facilitated learning and the prerecorded lectures were extremely helpful in grasping the information. There was also a very logical progression to the course. I can't think of how the structure of the course could be improved. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â this course covers a lot of material but it can often feel overwhelming, probably more so due to this virtual mode of learning <br/></div>

Weaknesses: Too much material. Recorded + live lectures combined was 4+ hrs of lectures / week <br/></div>
