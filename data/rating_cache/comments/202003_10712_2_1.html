<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures were super hard to follow and stay engaged in. They went too fast and didn't go in-depth behind the concepts. The discussion sections were, however, very helpful in doing the PSET. I don't think I could finish have finished the homework without them. There needs to be more help for students struggling I found it very difficult to get help when I asked for it. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course goes over a lot of material very comprehensively, and having the extra discussion sections with another professor really helped. I think the final exam was very hard, but overall I think the format of this class suited the material, and much help was offered. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Very interesting problem sets, although at times very difficult.

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The content was interesting, overall; some of the questions on the psets were interesting. Yihong seems knowledgeable. 

Weaknesses: Several topics were just not taught in a way so as to make the content digestible and applicable for students. Like in the past couple of weeks, I felt that his explanations of the MGF and best estimate were lacking. More context, more examples, and more clarity would be useful. It wouldve been really helpful if hed slowed down and gave some more examples that are similar to pset problems rather than just putting out/ solving for all these formulas without adequately explaining them. I dont think Yihong was an awful professor, but he certainly could improve, and to be frank, the course seems to get much higher reviews when Winston teaches it, so maybe he could make an honest comparison between his own explanations and Winstons, and use that to improve. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the class notes were good. This class is probably the worst math class I've taken so far. The material is ok; Nothing great but I didn't expect much more. However, the staff was absolutely terrible in my experience. First, the course manager thing was absurd in my opinion. Having this bureaucratic wall that pretty much doesn't let you email the professor makes solving a problem ridiculously difficult. You have to deal with the graders and things of nature and there's no higher authority you can turn to when you feel like you're getting mistreated. I don't know if the graders are grad students in math, but they sure did not look that way. It seemed to me like they had a set of solutions and went down a checklist instead of reading each proof individually. I had people take points off for all sorts of trivialities and when I asked what's up with that I was once told something to the effect of "this may be absurd but it's absurd to all thus it's fair." In every pset I had to email the graders in order to get the points I deserved and after a while that took a toll on me. I don't want to have to write an email explaining how my proof is correct when I've already written a perfectly fine proof. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Great class. Lectures were super packed with information and they could start getting really fast towards the end. I thought the material was very interesting and enjoyed it very much. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I loved this course. The lectures were well-planned and covered a lot of material in a short time. There were endless resources and office hours for students who needed extra support. The exams and problem sets were very reasonable and the course prepared well for them. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I guess since it's a math class it's just hard, but sometimes I felt like it was unnecessarily confusing. There were multiple times during lecture where the answer/derivation/proof was deemed "obvious" by the Professor and then glossed over, when it was not obvious at all. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I believe that while the content of the course was good, the professor could have presented it in a more helpful manner during class.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â S&amp;DS 241 is a very hard course with Yihong. By that, I mean that the PSETs were quite difficult (and sometimes felt impossible without the help from friends or Winston/Piazza). 

Yihong's lectures slides are immaculate and the textbook recommended for this course is also very well written. As for weaknesses, I would just say that it was very difficult to keep up with two major exams and 11 PSETs. It was very tiring this semester considering the lack of breaks (except Thanksgiving). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The class is a pretty comprehensive introduction to probability, and really has breadth on its side. Honestly, the unspoken fun of this course was the combinatorics. There were plenty of resources for students to ask questions and get help if they were feeling confused. Also, the textbook was amazing, and story proofs were unfamiliar but fun. Problem sets were also graded really reasonably. That being said, the material did feel pretty uneven. We started off really slow with probability axioms and the naive definition of probability and absolutely zoomed through crucial topics like the CLT. At times, too, the problems felt more like puzzles than applications. Problems often relied on finding the "hack," which was cool and rewarding on problem sets, but very stressful for exams. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A major weakness of the course depends on what Professor you get. While professor Wu is definitely smart, he appears to lack any real commitment to the learning of students. He bulldozes his way through his lecture slides and often skips steps in his proofs or work, assuming students will understand on their own. This makes the lectures very unengaging and often causes me to lack motivation to pay attention. Furthermore, the homeworks are often disheartening since the problems are extremely difficult and very hard to solve on your own(homework buddies help so much!). I usually spent 5-8 hours per p-set and more than once got frustrated enough to give up for that night. Although many of the concepts of the course are easy to grasp, the fact that the math or intuition required to solve many problems does not come naturally to people who haven't taken proof-y courses before does not help. At least the midterm and final are easier than the problem sets, but not by much,  and your lowest Pset is dropped. An upside is that although prof Wu is not the most clear or engaging lecturer, the slides are extremely helpful to look at on your own since they are very complete and clear. Also, the support from peer tutors and teaching fellows are very helpful since they can help guide you to the proper thinking, mindset, and math to solve homework problems or understand a concept. Winston, although was listed as co-teaching the course, was more of a course assistant. However, he was a tremendous help as he had review sessions/office hours twice a week where he will re-teach concepts or help get started on homework problems. He is such an approachable person and is extremely knowledgeable on the material since he and prof Wu take turns teaching the course every year - definitely take the class if Winston is teaching! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The content can seem pretty straightforward from lectures alone; however, problem sets were often unreasonably difficult and so it was hard to gauge exactly how we were doing in the class.  The strengths are that office hours and TAs are always helpful when problem sets became overwhelmingly hard; the main weakness of this course is the lack of transparency, clarity, and frankly, compassion from Prof. Yihong Wu. Each time a student asked a question with regards to grades or how they performed on an exam, it was almost always ignored or met with an ambiguous response on Piazza. I hope in the future, if someone takes this class, they will be met with more transparency, especially if it is taught in an online form again. The class being on Zoom lectures that are recorded asynchronously, it's even harder to express concerns to professors or form studying groups with other students. It was a tough grind to get through this class. <br/></div>
