<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the course is structured very well, and the content builds off each other. I only wish that we were able to focus a little bit more on how to use MatLab in the beginning of the course rather than having to do trial and error with the program on my own. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The instructors are pretty good and do a good job of explaining the concepts (although in reviewing the slide notes it's less clear). The TA's are great, and I think the balance of lecture, breakout sessions, and coding is very well balanced. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course does a good job explaining ODEs (ordinary differential equations) and how to set them up. However, the structure of the class was a little confusing, and I would sometimes struggle to see how a certain topic would relate the foundations we learned in the beginning of the semester. Another weakness was with the instruction of Matlab. Since the class is focused on modeling biological systems, we barely learned how to code in Matlab, and often times what we did learn was limited to what we were expected to know for problem sets. I just wish the class provided a better foundation for Matlab so I would feel more prepared going into the homework assignments. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Almost everything! I really enjoyed this class -- the problem sets were difficult but fair, TAs were helpful, the professors are great.

Weaknesses: The lectures felt a bit long sometimes. The professors tried to break them up with breakout room activities, but I think incorporating more would have been useful. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The professors were great at explaining every topic in the course, and the exercises and problem sets really helped us in understanding the material. The papers that they chose for student presentations were all also very interesting and easy to grasp with the knowledge they gave us in class.

Weaknesses: Some of the questions on the problem sets were difficult to understand without the guidance of the TAs, and some MATLAB concepts were not taught prior to using them on the problem sets (e.g., structs). At the beginning of the semester, it was also not clear when we were allowed to use MATLAB to solve a problem. To improve, the professors could write out at the beginning of the problem set or in each problem whether or not we are expected to use MATLAB. It would also be helpful to have a MATLAB "cheat sheet" of the most important concepts in MATLAB for those who have never coded before. For example, what anonymous functions are and how to use them, or what an ode45 function is and how to use it. While these concepts were taught in section, some students could not make it to the discussion sections, and these sections were not recorded. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This was the worst course I have taken at Yale. It was horribly organized and caused me significant confusion despite having learned the material well once before in the Biological Physics course. Psets are assigned every other week, often covering material from multiple weeks ago. Then it would typically take an additional month to receive those graded assignments back, essentially creating a 6 week gap between learning the material and actually receiving feedback on it. On top of that, typically 6 weeks after the initial introduction of the material, we were on an entirely different topic/unit/professor and the feedback was virtually irrelevant to the current topics. Additionally, I have rarely seen the alternating professor lecturing paradigm work well for a course- and it certainly failed here. If you need to have 2 professors teach the material, at least limit transitions between professors- not KMJ/TE/KMJ. Additionally, the exercises every other week were just busy work graded on completion and virtually worthless to the material being learned. Not recording all components of the lecture further compounded the confusing and disorganized portions of the course. This was especially annoying because everybody enters the course with different backgrounds (especially in coding experience) and for fairness, the coding portion should have been lectured on and recorded so that everybody would get the same experience. The periodic presentations interrupted instruction further (as if there weren't enough distractions from the material already!). Readings were assigned but not tested on (until the final) which I think was useless. The lectures themselves were a mixture of text slides and written material which I didn't appreciate - please choose one medium or the other or at least don't intermix them throughout the entire lecture. In addition, the questions on the problem sets and final weren't always clearly stated and communication with some of the professors/TAs regarding questions was an issue. Don't bother emailing them with questions on the final- they won't respond. Not even 1 of the 4 of them. I truly hope that if they do teach this course again, they focus on coherency and consistency (weekly shorter problem sets are more useful than every other week problem sets which test on 2 weeks of material). Stop interrupting the material with breakout rooms that don't work (for any class I've been in). This course was HORRIBLY organized and suffered from a serious lack of consistency (2 alternating professors, biweekly psets not returned for 4 weeks, busy work grades (exercises and in class coding), 4 random presentation days, poor communication between professors and students about psets/exams, neither synchronous nor asynchronous lectures, break out rooms, etc.). If you read prior reviews, other students have also had these problems with the organization of the course- the issues aren't just due to COVID, so I hope they seriously consider restructuring it because this format doesn't work. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was great! There wasn't per se a lot of independent material since a lot of it would build on top of each other. Also good MATLAB practice. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - the TAs were really helpful and the course content was relevant to those majoring in the sciences

Weaknesses - the problem sets were often very time consuming and the questions were often unclear or needed a lot of clarification from the TAs. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course definitely goes very fast when it comes down to understanding the math behind a lot of the problems. There should definitely be some emphasis on helping students with this problem. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professors are very kind and understanding. The TAs explain things in a very good way and promptly clarify questions about material and assignments. The content was interesting and not too much given the covid situation. The take-home final was nice for flexibility sake but too long.
Some lectures were not very engaging, which is likely due to the awkward nature of zoom participation. New workarounds gauging student understanding before, during, and after teaching concepts could be helpful. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think this class is overall pretty good. I had a beginner's background in R and no background in MATLAB, but I found learning MATLAB pretty straightforward (although I imagine it would have been a bit tougher, but 100% doable, without any background whatsoever); they didn't teach much MATLAB in lectures, but they very much taught MATLAB in section, which I think was helpful for people who didn't have any background. The material was overall really interesting. I liked the format of the class (primarily lectures, with a few student presentations on current topics in quantitative biology) and the assignments (regular psets, take home final). 

I think the biggest weakness of the course in the logistical organization of it. This is not to say the lectures or the material was disorganized (I thought the lectures were generally pretty clear and fit very well together). But the psets were often posted late and/or had mistakes the professors had to correct, I thought the questions were often poorly worded/laid out (it was often not clear to anyone what the questions were asking, and the TA's often sent clarifying/explanatory emails), and class frequently ran very late (we'd start required MATLAB "hacking" literally as class ended, which meant you had to stay late to get credit). Again, I think the actual material was very clear and organized; the logistics of the class, however, could be improved. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was interesting and deviated from standard MCDB or MB&amp;B courses. As an MCDB major, I had never taken a coding or engineering course at Yale. This class helped me think more critically about details that are generally glossed over in MCDB course (for instance, what does it mean for a signaling pathway to be turned on?). The instructors are wonderful, and class is engaging--frequently involving breakout rooms and small group discussions. I had no statistics experience, and was able to follow the course well, but I do think it would have been helpful to have a better background in statistics before taking the course. Additionally, I felt that the course was most clear when we related lessons back to physical biological systems. (the lambda phage class, oocyte discussion, glucose transporter) and sometimes the course became a little more difficult to follow when it became more abstract (discussions of oscillations, noise, or zero order ultrasensitivity). Perhaps tying those lessons more explicitly back to the physical systems would help make these lessons a bit more clear. Additionally, I was best able to follow the classes when there were reading assignments that directly paralleled class discussions. One of the weaknesses of this class is that there isnt a consistent textbook and reading assignments are often posted just a few hours before class, so often class was often the first time I had ever heard of a concept. It would have been useful to pick a few more reading assignments that followed class lessons. I understand there may not be one good textbook, but creating a course packet (as many humanities classes do) would be extremely helpful for students with less experience with the subject. Finally, the office hours for this course were a little bit inconvenient/limited. It would have been useful if Professor Miller-Jensen had office hours too! <br/></div>
