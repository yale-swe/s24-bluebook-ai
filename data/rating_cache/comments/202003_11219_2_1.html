<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â i personally didn't like the pre-recorded lectures but that's a problem of COVID. i think that it was not unbearable, though. i also like how professor bloom emphasizes understanding vs. memorizing random concepts. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was very flexible to each person's schedule and the in person discussion sections were good for keeping me on track. However, I do think the class expectations were often unclear. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Coursera is not ideal for learning, as even just having lectures that can be live or watched later are more interactive and enjoyable, in my opinion, although I really did enjoy the aspect of being able to watch lectures on my own time, and the transcribed audio was amazing. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I particularly enjoyed the discussion section of this course. The TA did a strong job of coming up with diverse learning exercises to supplement the things we watched in the pre-recorded lectures. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Great job adapting to the COVID format -- students could engage as much or as little as their time allowed with the extra material (office hours/guest speakers) without missing out on the core information from the class. It was clear that Prof Bloom was quite cognizant of how challenging this semester would be for some, and I know I really appreciate the efforts he made to adapt. 

Weakness: By virtue of being an introductory course, nothing will be gone into in much depth. As such, a lot of the material felt a bit shallow. It's also completely unnecessary to take this class if you got a 5 in AP psychology in high school, there's virtually no new information -- if you took psych previously, only take this class if its a requirement for something. Also, section was unnecessary -- TFs should hold office hours, but the material was not hard enough to justify live-sections. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â strengths: pre-recorded lectures are high quality and on coursera, light workload (short readings + 1 reading response every week)
weaknesses: professor Bloom isn't as caring and good at teaching as everyone else make him to be, the weekly reading response wasn't very good at making us think and wasn't fun to complete <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I loved the Coursera format, especially because the lectures were broken up into manageable chunks. I also loved having office hours and guest lecturers. Section was great, too. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the topic is interesting, the workload is extremely low. A weakness was relying on Coursera to deliver content, which made the course feel extremely detached and impersonal. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths were in the organization of the course, it was very clear. The course could be improved with the readings, because sometimes the readings weren't very engaging. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think that the strengths of these course was that Professor Bloom was very engaging even through pre recorded lectures. Also discussion sections were very engaging. I think that there could have been more ways to gauge if students understand the information or concepts. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â All the learning was asynchronous so sometimes it felt a bit detached. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course is a great introductory course. Its thorough without seeming like too much at the same time. It covers a wide range of psychological topics which are perfect to students who have no previous preparation in the subject. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I did not like the fact that all the reading and lectures were pre-recorded on Coursera. I could've just watched and read all the things on there and taken a different class. Definitely not worth it in the pandemic. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Since lectures were pre-recorded this semester, class time was replaced by optional office hours with Prof Bloom, which were incredibly enlightening  as one of the foremost psychologists today, his insights on topics ranging from evolutionary psychology to morality were always a delight to listen to. The mandatory section was also reasonably effective in engaging with the material at a deeper level.
Weaknesses: Only the final really tested ones knowledge of the course content, so it might have helped to have regular quizzes to make sure that one was keeping pace with the material (especially since the content was delivered entirely asynchronously this year). <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Section was engaging because of the TFs even if it was virtual. Professor Bloom is a great lecturer; his office hours were enjoyable. 
Weaknesses: The available section times were not the most convenient considering we had a lot of different time zones. Just a couple of sections for different time zones was not enough for the number of people in the course. Communication was a little sparse at times, like about research requirements etc. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: it was a chill course. Not much work to do. Interesting material. 
Weaknesses: felt like I was just paying for coursera. Pretty low engagement. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: interesting lectures, knowledgeable professor, extensive material provided to expand on any topic, section was very helpful, workload manageable
Weaknesses: none <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The class does a good job of surveying a wide range of subjects, which is helpful for discovering which fields you're interested in but frustrating in that you only get to spend a week on each unit, regardless of how big or interesting it is. I was a bit disappointed that we spent a week each on vision and language (without even getting much into how they really work in the brain), which meant also trying to fit an overview of all mental illness in one week. The lectures also spent a significant amount of time talking about moral philosophy, rather than actual psychology, in some weeks. I did, however, find most of the course material to be interesting and fairly engaging, and I appreciated the opportunity to discuss what we learned in discussion sections and reading responses. I think the biggest weakness of the course was its asynchronous lectures. They made me feel very distanced from the actual course, to the point that I sometimes didn't even feel like I was taking it. Even when the material was interesting, it was disappointing to get only a 50 minute period days  after completing the assignment to get to discuss it, as I had lost some of my initial excitement by then. It was also far more difficult to find motivation to do the work for this course than it was for my synchronous classes. I think the course would be much improved if the lectures were synchronous or if there were more live virtual time with the professor. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â TAking the course through coursera was not great, did not feel like a yale course and came across quite weird. Section also felt unnecessary with lots of times being barely related to the content we had covered in lecture or only focusing on a tiny part.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Good lectures and flexible engagement opportunities. Knowledge was very foundational--topics were covered on a weekly basis and then left behind, so this is definitely a course that introduces areas of psychology as opposed to diving in deep to any one specific area.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The mandatory discussion section was a strength because it was good to have discussion about these topics and hear from my classmates and my TF about their ideas and opinions. The weekly reading responses were also a strength because they got me thinking. Having the lectures recorded was also a strength because I was able to watch them on my own time and go at my own pace.
Weaknesses: I'm not sure if this is a weakness but part of me wishes that the lectures were live so that I could have interacted more with Professor Bloom, but he did hold office hours, so it's my fault for not taking advantage of them. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the sections were a nice place to discuss ideas (especially considering how there was no interaction during lecture, which was on Coursera), the reading response prompts were interesting
Weaknesses: the course is taught on Coursera, which I strongly disliked. Just because lectures have been recorded and are available online does not mean we should not be taught by the Professor during lecture timings. Some weeks the Coursera lectures would only be 20 or so minutes for the whole week. I'm sure we would've been able to learn more during the two lecture sessions of that week. Another weakness of the course was the final exam - it was unreasonably long. Reading period is a busy week (I had all my deadlines that week), and it was ridiculous to have to write 7,500 words for a single class. A midterm exam which looked exactly like the first half of the final exam would have made much more sense. Additionally, the syllabus claims there would be a final essay exam; instead, we got an exam with 25 questions and were only informed of the format the week the final was sent out. Yet another weakness was that information was not communicated well to the students. Since everything was on Coursera, it was all the more important that the Professor frequently updates everyone via email. In the last week of section, we were not informed there will be no reading response due (we waited for a couple of days to get this information). Almost no information about the human subject requirement was communicated. Even the reading response prompts were randomly sent out at some point on Monday. It would have been far more convenient to have the prompt in our inbox at a fixed time. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked how the course was organized: watch lectures, do readings, go to section, write a reading response.

This course could be improved by maybe including more (optional) supplementary materials in order to see how the concepts we learn are applied/seen in real-world scenerios. <br/></div>

I do not know if I would consider this to be a weakness, but I did not engage as much with this course as my others simply because I had less work for it and, as a result, spent less time on it.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think a major strength of the course was the online lectures and office hours. They were very easy to attend and the coursera website made it extremely easy to navigate and find the lectures. I wish that the discussion sections could be more engaging. The old discussion section format of sitting and only talking for 50 minutes straight is very hard over zoom, and I really enjoyed the weeks where we did something new such as do an online activity in breakout rooms or watch a video to stay engaged with the material. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the recorded nature of the Coursera lectures helped me watch the lectures whenever my schedule permitted me to, and the lectures being recorded also was beneficial in completing the reading responses or clarifying any confusing topics. Also, the weekly discussion sections helped review important concepts and gave me an opportunity to interact with my peers. The weekly reading responses provided incentive to keep up to date on the lectures/readings and were a good way to review concepts while doing them. 

The only weakness of this course is that our recorded lectures are part of an Introduction to Psychology Coursera course that is already available to the general public for a subscription fee. Although I did learn a lot this semester, I just feel that I got shorthanded by this a bit, as I expected a little more personally from a Yale class that I am definitely paying a lot of money for. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â content in my opinion was very interesting. concepts were not hard to grasp, yet they were still interesting. the content makes it easy to be engaged in this course; i enjoyed writing the weekly reading responses. workload was not bad (weekly online articles and reading responses, discussion sections). weaknesses were online format is less engaging than in-person, though this could not be helped really. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I believe that the course is very strong as it is. Perhaps one minor thing that I would change is the animations in the recorded lecture. I would rather have recorded lectures of the live professor. Otherwise, I think the course is great. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the course did a great job of explaining material and providing resources. It was also great speaking and hearing from Professor Bloom.
One issue was that the "office hours" were held on Monday, which made it difficult for some students to read all the lecture materials before the office hours; if the lecture was on Wednesday then people might have been able to ask questions that were more related to the week. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Everyday is a different workload, some days more than others. The optional office hours took a different interesting route in learning the material beyond the lectures. The discussion sections were broken into smaller break out rooms to interact with the material more. <br/></div>
