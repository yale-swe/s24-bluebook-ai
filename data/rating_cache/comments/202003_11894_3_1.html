<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Very good adaptation; loved study hall and the ability to pick our own breakout rooms <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Tim did a pretty good job of keeping us attentive during class. However, his warmup problems take up way too much class time. Most of the time, students wouldn't know how to do the warmup problem, so we would sit in our breakout room for several minutes in complete silence. Since this class is in the lecture format, it would be much better to teach the content during class, rather than spending time on discussion problems. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weekly TA sections were very very helpful. TA-led study hall sessions before exams were also very helpful. Lectures were definitely too fast, but at least they were recorded. There was a ton of work on Sapling which got to the point of being annoying rather than helpful (although in general, the Sapling tool was effective). <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â All the note sheets were uploaded to the Canvas site, which helped students greatly. Especially in Zoom classes, students may have a tendency to not grasp the underlying concepts as well, a fact that is not helped by the pressure to write down everything instead of deeply engaging with the lecture. That all the lecture materials were uploaded definitely helped during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effective use of breakout rooms to facilitate our own thinking as well as to get to know other students is another success.

An area that can be improved is making sure students have enough time in breakout rooms to fully discuss all parts of the question. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Discussion sections and virtual study halls were great aids in understanding the course material. 
In addition, Professor Newhouse would usually allow some time after lecture has finished for any questions which was very useful. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The live lecture and discussion section format succeeded in communicating content and giving out practice problems. It was harder to set up study groups with other students in the class due to the virtual nature of the course. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the socially-distanced in-person component was useful, but the breakout rooms were equally effective. I didn't feel like my learning was hindered in any way due to the pandemic. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the lectures overall were good, and my particular discussion section was helpful in getting experience in the types of problems we encountered on assessments. I think the Breakout Room format could be improved, as we often were not fully prepared to do the problems on our own and then really just ended up seeing what was went over, so I found myself often being overwhelmed and confused by the breakout rooms. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think that the breakout rooms were a great way to tackle team problems that were assigned, and it was also beneficial to see other people's different solutions to problems in the chat. One thing that I thought could be improved was the participation grade. It was based on people's engagement on zoom with regard to the chat, so oftentimes, there were comments that did not really add to the discussion, and sometimes it obstructed my learning because the chat kept popping up. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Tim handled online lectures well and kept them engaging for the most part. The many practice problems helped to maintain attention during lecture. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The breakout rooms definitely facilitated engagement. However, I would recommend hopping into breakout rooms to get a sense of when people are done/ not done to use time more effectively. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â All of the lectures were recorded, which was a blessing; I don't think I would have done as well without them. I found it incredibly helpful to look back on them while I was studying for exams to fill in some gaps in my notes. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â In a class where student cooperation was very helpful, it was difficult at first to try to meet classmates and connect. I appreciated, later, being able to have static breakout rooms so we could work with the same few people each time. I think it was hard to engage students in this larger class, but the idea of measuring Zoom participation in the call made the chat box become less meaningful. It was sometimes distracting when students were sending unimportant messages in the chat just to boost their participation, and others would just reiterate the correct answer. I wonder if there could be better methods of encouraging and measuring engagement. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really liked the fact that lectures were recorded and kept up permanently since it allowed me to go back and rewatch lectures to study. Unsure if in-person lecture was helpful since I never opted in. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The live lectures were usually pretty engaging, especially with the Zoom chat and the team problem structure. I think Study Halls could have been improved because I would join sometimes and be put into a breakout room with only other students, where guidance from a TA or peer tutor could have been helpful. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Virtual lectures and sections worked quite well -- I would have loved to be in person, but needs must.. However, I would have loved to spend time studying with more of my classmates. As a remote student, I mostly studied with other remote students, while the on-campus students had much more time together and could study. I love my remote classmates, but I would have loved to spend time with other students as well. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think this class functioned very well during the pandemic. The lectures were engaging even over Zoom because Tim poses lots of questions to the class. There were still frequent study halls so we could always get help if we needed it.  Our assigned breakout rooms were great because it emulated in-class collaboration with the same people, like you were sitting at the same table every day. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked that the lectures were recorded. It was handy to be able to go back and watch the videos.

At some point in the semester, the professor stated that he would be grading our participation in part based on Zoom chat messages. He claimed that Zoom can measure participation based on the volume of chats sent by each participant. Putting aside the fact that I wasn't able to find any websites that confirm this, this led to students sending many, many chats - often off-topic ones - that were distracting during lecture. It also wasn't a good format for participation because almost everyone would type the same answer. Questions were easily lost in the chat because people would type "^" to emphasize the question, but this action only pushed the question higher and made it harder to access. Public chat conversations - again, off-topic ones - would go on continuously during class. All this is to say that participation in lecture via chat should not be encouraged - unmuting oneself and speaking is much better. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The Zoom chat function was immensely helpful during the live lectures because students could ask and answer each other's questions.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The live virtual lectures worked well, and the discussion sections were extremely helpful.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The live class sessions were organized well, and breakout rooms were used for group work. In the middle of the term, a new policy was created that made class participation 5% of the course grade. Since participation was measured by the Zoom chat statistics, this change prompted the Zoom chat to become much more active, which helped foster greater engagement with the live classes. However, the addition of participation as part of the course grade may have led to difficulties for those studying remotely from other time zones. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the discussion section was a good idea to get into smaller groups and help each other through different problems. On Zoom I've noticed that sections always go better when students are allowed to keep themselves unmuted and have more open conversation engagement is much higher and it imitates an actual classroom more. Since this wasn't implemented, engagement in discussion section was pretty low compared to other classes which sucks because it was much much more needed in this class. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â While I definitely wish we could have collaborated with classmates when it came to learning retrosynthesis pathways, mechanisms, MO theory, etc., this class was structured pretty well during the COVID-19 pandemic. A portion of our grade came from our participation in Zoom, through comments in the chat and speaking, but I didn't think this format was too conducive to learning as people just started commenting for the sake of their grade instead of actually answering the questions or asking relevant, important questions. However, the lectures were delivered well over Zoom and the fact that they were recorded made them super useful for reviewing for exams.  The use of breakout rooms during lectures also had its pros and cons. On one hand it gave us a chance to solve and talk through practice problems in a group, but on the other hand because we were with the same breakout group everyday, if we didn't know we didn't have anyone else to ask and couldn't participate in the main room. I would have rather had random breakout rooms so that we got to learn from a variety of classmates with varying levels of expertise in organic chemistry. <br/></div>
