<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course is good as it is. The only suggestion I have is not to put time pressure on students in exams. The objective should be to test a student's mastery on the subject and time pressure unnecessarily puts stress on the students in the exam, which either leads to errors or inability to answer all the questions , even though the student knows how to solve it. It is unlikely that in the real world anyone has to solve problems on a regular basis with extremely tight deadlines. Those scenarios will be the exceptions and not the norm. Therefore, I would prefer that students are given adequate time to complete the exam by either reducing the number of questions or increasing the time allowed. Let the questions be tough, but give the student time to apply what they learnt in a less stressful environment. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: helpful TFs, problem sets prepare you well for the tests.
Weaknesses: pacing could be a bit off. Sometimes it felt like we took too long going over certain things, and we got behind. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths- JT is the best professor! Super open to questions, explains everything very clearly, and very easy to get along with
Weaknesses- not enough time on the midterm, section should be recorded, instead of asking us questions sometimes JT should just tell us what the answer is (so we can take better notes), hard to ask questions/office hours (you had to sign up for meeting times instead of just a zoom link for everyone with TA and JT) <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Well structured. Clear lectures. Helpful section. More OH would be good. <br/></div>
</div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â JT teaches stats in the most exciting way possible. JT &amp; both TAs were extremely helpful and available, even outside of their scheduled OH. The structure of this class as well as the resources available to students to review material were extremely well organized, even given the virtual setting. I wish problem sets were posted earlier to give more time, but honestly one week for each problem set was enough given the amount of help that was available. The problem sets themselves were also extremely useful, unlike problems sets in other QR classes where they have little or nothing to do with what's actually taught during lectures/what comes up on exams. Overall a great class, definitely the best class I've taken virtually. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: JT and my TF Brian Chung's energy really helped me engage with the class as a less naturally quantitative thinker. Going to office hours with JT when I could was also a very pleasant experiences and I feel that he was very invested in our growth as a learner, meeting us where we are. Weaknesses: I know JT mentioned briefly that many of these choices were related to his own pedagogical style, but taking the course in conjunction with the very differently organized class of ECON 116 was jarring. In ECON, some of the most useful resources were the class piazza board, peer tutors, open office hours where I could listen in to other student's questions and learn from them, and posting content from sections and pset corrections each week. I think I lost a bit of my engagement with AQA because I felt like I was going through the class alone with just one of my friends as a study buddy without those class features that foster community learning. I also didn't love the cold calling in class because sometimes I spent more time being anxious about being called on than thinking about the theory questions. While some may find this engaging or positive pressure to do the readings, it felt a little bit like it was stoking the infamous competitive culture of global affairs. This may seem overdramatic, and it really wasn't too bad getting called on when you didn't know the answer, that it did add on that mental component. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is very good. JT is a great professor and manages to keep class engaging and fun. The TFs were excellent in section, especially at explaining confusing concepts. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of this course is undoubtedly JT! He is an excellent professor who actually cares about his students and the content that is being taught. JT also always offered several opportunities for office hours with him on a weekly basis, which were a valuable resource that all students should utilize when taking this course. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think this course does a good job of simplifying stats down to a level that someone with no STEM background could understand. This simplification is certainly helpful for many students in the course; however, I think it can be a bit of a drag for other students. It feels very slow and simple for students who have more experience in math and stats. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the staff was the best part of this course.  I could see how the material could get boring, but the Professor and the TFs always kept it fun and interesting, making it a lot easier to learn. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was nearly perfect in terms of learning Statistics. As an S&amp;DS major, I learned so much from this class than the other Statistics courses I've taken. JT is a great professor; he's able to explain topics so well and is clear in terms of what he wants us to know for tests/finals. I do not have any weaknesses for this course, other than maybe more office hours. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths:
- A slow but methodical teaching of basic statistics

Weaknesses:
- Problem sets are often much longer than necessary. About halfway through the PSETs, I feel as though I have a firm grasp of the material. I feel the PSETs are unnecessarily long. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It might be better via zoom than in person JT did a great job <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the lectures are very detailed and well-written and JT explains everything in a comprehensible way. The exams are very fair - there are no surprises, so whatever effort you put in studying and on the psets is what you will get out of this course. The discussion section was incredibly helpful and really made the difference with practicing and engaging with the material.

Weaknesses: office hours were sometimes very unhelpful. The TFs and JT were cautious to not "give away" too much in their answers to students' questions which lead to many vague confusing responses. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: JT is a great teacher and I enjoyed having the chance to learn some Stata

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of this course is JT, without a doubt. He is such an engaging professor and really makes an effort to make the content understandable. 
However, I feel that this course has weaknesses that can make it difficult. I personally found this course incredibly frustrating, because of a significant disconnect between lecture and problem sets. During lecture I would feel like I had a good grasp of the concepts, and I would use that understanding on the problem sets and proceed to get marked off for every small error I made, even if the intent was correct, with feedback that I couldn't understand from the TAs. Overall, I felt that there was a gap between what I learned from JT and the TAs expected, and as a result of this gap I was never able to correct my errors in understanding. In addition, the TAs scheduled their office hours on Thursdays, yet problem sets would be due the following Wednesdays, which meant that TA office hours were practically redundant since very few people had the time to begin a problem set that far before the due date. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength of the course was Professor JT. He's super engaging, understanding, funny, and helpful. He takes time to make sure that we get the material, and he's always willing to help. He also pushed us to understand what we were learning, but he usually took it slow so we could think and take notes. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths; JT is incredible; his energy and enthusiasm, and sheer knowledge on the subject, made every class so lovely (even though it was statistics!). JT was always asking questions, calling on students, telling jokes and stories to lighten the mood and also ensure our engagement, and it paid off immensely. I cannot imagine having taken this course with anyone but JT, who not only enjoyed interacting and engaging with us, but also gave miraculously clear and thorough explanations of the topics we were covering. I feel like I learned so much!
Weaknesses: My major issue with the course were the PSETs. They are gargantuan. They are so immense. I am not exaggerating. They took forever to complete and many questions felt like busywork rather than asking us to really engage with the lessons. The grading and expectations for them was also very murky; some PSETs were graded a lot more leniently than others, and as such it became pretty difficult to figure out how much to include in a certain answer, or what exactly they were looking for. Lastly, sometimes PSET grading would lag behind a lot, which meant we'd sometimes be doing work that required something we used in a previous PSET, but since it had not been graded, we didn't know if we were doing correctly (thus leading to more mistakes and points taken off). <br/></div>
