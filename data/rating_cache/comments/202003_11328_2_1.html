<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strenghts- a lot of opportunities besides the main lecture to learn concepts - games, special activities, discussion sections, review sessions. Fair grading and assignments. Engaging lectures. Incredible professors and TA'S.
No weakness. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths are that the teachers are great. The content itself is a little difficult and abstract at times, but they did a good job of navigating us through it. I would say the weaknesses are that the TA's were not always on the same page as what was being taught since they did not attend lectures. Some of them are grad students who are certainly qualified to help us, but they may explain it in a way that we did not learn which can almost make things confusing to be told two different methods about the same topic. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professors are excellent at lecturing, the content is relatively accessible. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Lots of office hours, review sessions, etc; able to drop 2 problem sets, weekly homework not too overloaded. 
Weaknesses: Weird grading. For both of the midterms, which are 1/2 the class grade, the score is "curved", but not really. An approximate point range was sent out for each letter grade (like less than 35/75 = C, 35-55 out of = B, 55+ = A), but the actual grades weren't assigned specific grades or reflected in Canvas. If you're anxious or like to know your exact amount of points, it can be confusing. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think this course gives many resources to succeed! A weakness could be that it goes through a lot of material quickly. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The production quality of the lectures and the availability of office hours was a huge positive for this course. The professors were fantastic and had great perspectives on everything from the course content, to being a student at Yale, to real-world events. 

The pace of the lectures felt very slow at times, while on other occasions a topic that ended up being on exams was scarcely covered. This was most noticeable on the second midterm, where most of the class performed very poorly because it felt like the exam content was much different and much more difficult than the class content. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the content is very well organized throughout the semester; the problem sets are well designed and help reinforce what was learned in class; the professors are very experienced; many concepts that we learned were explained using both graphs and algebra.
Weaknesses: the lectures could be a bit slow at times (although this may be the result of the virtual format); one or two problem sets took significantly longer than the others to complete because of the length of the questions. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The organization of this course was a strength. The class did a good job of teaching essential knowledge for microeconomics. However, some exam questions felt unnecessarily difficult and were not directly covered by the course. Besides that, everything else was good. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: relatively simple information if you are good at math/logical reasoning. I'm not.

Weaknesses: lots of information, not very interesting if you don't really enjoy Economics, curve is killer. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength is that it covers many interesting topics and goes into some depth about how the concepts we are learning show up in real life (i.e. the discussion about examples of price discrimination).

A slight weakness would be the large amount of students can make it difficult to be heard, but that issue is largely alleviated by office hours and discussion sections. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It didn't feel as if the problem sets were comparable in terms of difficulty to many of the problems present on the midterm exams and final. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Some of the strengths of this course are its asynchronous nature, the focus on how to use the concepts learned to come to our own conclusions, and the extra activities created by the professors on Mondays and Fridays (Mon-an extra session to go over 1 problem in the pset, Fri-an extra session for extensions and applications of the concepts learned that week, i.e. a focus on COVID).  The biggest weakness was the lack of connectivity between the oldest concepts and the newest. It would have been helpful to have an extra session or something, not necessarily for review, but just to get the big picture of the concepts we learned and how some of them connect. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Lectures were disorganised and rambling. Class held outside of scheduled hours. Professors unresponsive to student concerns. Discussion sections pointless. No feedback given on any exams or problem sets. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is a good introduction to microeconomics for someone who has essentially no background in economics at all. However, it it taught at a math level that is too low for someone who has a strong mathematics background. As someone who expected an introductory microeconomics class to consider at least the basics of calculus (e.g. derivatives), I was disappointed when I learned (from the syllabus and the first lecture) that we would not be doing any math beyond algebra. While I understand that that is necessary for the least math-experienced student understand what is happening, the class was not very engaging for me as a result. As a follow-up to that comment, much of the math in economics seemed "hand-wavy" (for lack of a better expression) because of this absence of harder mathematics. We did not need to go into partial derivatives of multivariable functions, and even non-linear functions are not often used. Again, Economics 115 is a good introductory course for someone who is interested in Economics and does not have a strong mathematics background, but it is lacking in the rigor necessary to keep more advanced mathematics students interested. I understand certain things "have to be saved for Intermediate" microeconomics, but I think this course saves a little too much. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - Lots of TAs and help. PSETS were thorough and good practice for exams. 
Weaknesses - Large class size and mixing kids of different econ backgrounds made learning harder. With over 400 kids in one class, half of the class was extremely knowledgeable about economics while the other half severely struggled. Because of this, many important concepts in lecture were skimmed or brushed over because it was supposed to be an intuitive topic derived from something else already discussed. Ex. Subsidy from Pigouvian Tax. However, these are not concepts that people who struggled would have ever been able to derive without serious study and careful explanation. This gap made an uncomfortable mesh between reviewing concepts for the top and explaining things slowly for those who struggled. I think it was okay overall, but I remember wanting to review concepts in the recordings, only to find out that the professor had skipped those slides in presentation. <br/></div>

Also, outside of Joseph's review sessions, the other scheduled review sessions were not that helpful since they would just go through old exam questions rather than reviewing the conceptual ideas covered in lectures. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: all the resources they offer to students. I genuinely think the difficulty of this course is exaggerated; they provide so many resources (TA office hours, discussion sections, peer tutor office hours, office hours w/ Professor Polak or Berry) that it's impossible to fail if you reach out for help.
Weaknesses: I don't think they encouraged students to reach out if they needed help, especially at the start of the course. The course doesn't start out too difficult, so a lot of students (myself included) attended section but not office hours. When the course got more difficult, I had to take it upon myself to look through the Canvas calendar and figure out which office hours I could go to. Towards the end of the course, a lot more people used office hours, so by then I think many students have figured out the course can get difficult. Also, lectures feel really long, even if they're only 75 minutes. This might be an effect of staring at a Zoom screen for too long though. <br/></div>

The curve seems pretty generous too. It's hard to get an A, but not nearly as hard to get a B+ or an A-. And it's pretty hard to get a C or to outright fail.

Weakness: I felt that there were too many zooms that we had to attend in addition to the weekly lectures, for example there is the flipped activity on Monday and there is a special activity on Friday. Both of which are optional, but it is best to attend them. Also the class was scheduled for 1pm, which did not help with learning because I just get really sleepy and can't listen, so I end up re-watching the recorded sessions. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I appreciated that this course was recorded and had additional sessions to help give all students access to the course materials while reviewing (or if class sessions were missed). The professors and section leaders in this course are undoubtedly super knowledgable and very informed on microecon. However, this sometimes meant that the pacing of the class was too quick and not detailed enough for a first-year student that has never taken an econ course before. Often, the course material and problem sets were significantly less challenging than the material in the midterms, which was frustrating. Instead of harshly curving the testing, I wish they would have made the exams more practical. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course are that it offers multiple opportunities to engage with the material and get support. In addition to the lectures, there were Monday problem set review sessions and Friday special extension activities in addition to many discussion sections and office hours available throughout the week that anybody could attend. I think a big weakness of the course is the fact that the lectures moved at a really fast pace and did not go in depth with any of the concepts. In other words, we were given brief overviews of the concepts, but it was up to us to figure out how to actually use and apply them on problem sets and exams. I think having some example practice problems in the lectures would be a small but helpful way to improve instruction. Also, I felt that the exams, especially the midterms, did not allow us to best demonstrate our knowledge and skills. They were significantly more difficult than midterms from past semesters that we were given as practice, it was always a challenge to finish in time, and given the fact that we were learning all of the material virtually, the exam level/difficulty definitely could have been made more accessible. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths:
- Professors Polak and Berry are superb lecturers that were able to break down concepts very well
- There were plenty of resources for extra help, ranging from office hours to tutors to discussion sections to math workshops
- Incorporates some theories from other social sciences (political science, sociology), making the course especially beneficial if taken concurrently with these classes
- Optional activities were interesting and engaging, focusing on practical applications of what we learned in class

Weaknesses:
- Probably an unpopular opinion, but I felt the class suffered from a lack of calculus; it was very obvious where basic calculus could be used to simplify problems/concepts, and I think this should have been addressed for the whole class in order to enhance understanding of these topics
- Lectures would get very stale; some more interaction with the class (e.g. more interactive polls) would have been appreciated
- PSETs were graded very generously, with few comments or nitpicks, which did not match the grading system of exams at all
- Not even necessarily a weakness, but the class is primarily focused on theory rather than data; I think incorporating more of the latter would have made for a better experience <br/></div>

Weaknesses: The content is pretty dry. The questions on exams are always worded in a really confusing way and they are always looking for really specific answers so a lot of times you will get points taken off for not explaining something exactly as they word it. Also, lectures move really fast and the content you learn in class doesn't exactly prepare you for the psets (we never go over how to solve the types of problems that we encounter on psets in lecture and the content in discussion sections is usually limited (we only get to a few problems each week). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course are having the professor do problems during lecture to provide students with examples. Another strength is having professor Polak teach an additional Monday session that walks students through one problem on the problem set - this was very helpful. Also, this course has many office hours, which allow students to ask additional questions. 

Regarding weaknesses, the discussion sections can be clearer. In my discussion section, my TA rushed through the problems without giving students time to ask questions about those problems. The discussion sections can be more focused and less time constrained so as to give students a better understanding of the material. Moreover, the professor could make the notes more structured and the lecture slides easier to follow. <br/></div>

Professor Polak did an extension &amp; application session every Friday afternoon, which helped me develop a better understanding of some of the key economic concepts.

Weaknesses: 
Since this was a large lecture class, I disliked the online format, and I got distracted frequently during class. In addition, it was difficult to ask questions while the lecture was going on.

I called them the "Abbott and Costello of economics" because they always managed to incorporate some comedy into their lectures, and boy do they know their stuff. It's also relatively low maintenance and has a very manageable workload, which makes it super accessible for everyone at Yale to take it (as I believe they should).

Weaknesses: Can't think of any major ones to be honest, this was a great class overall. My one small gripe was the ranging difficulty of the practice exams compared to the actual thing, but no one comes to Yale to get spoon-fed through reading period/midterm season lol. <br/></div>

I think that the lectures were also well structured, with material gradually building upon itself as we progressed through the semester. One improvement that could be made would be to include more problem-solving examples in lecture. For example, some more time could have been spent on solving monopoly price-discrimination questions. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course are how many resources there are between extra activities on Friday, peer tutor hours, office hours, flipped problem set work, and discussion sections. Having so many resources for help and clarification definitely helps bridge any gaps left from lecture. A weakness of this class: the jump from the first midterm to the second midterm felt a bit abrupt. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A huge weakness was the way exams were conducted. Completing an exam over zoom while on camera was extremely anxiety-provoking for me. We do not need to be all on zoom. With some people not muting themselves combined with this feeling that I was being watched all made me anxious and distracted.
I was distracted by knowing that my face was on screen and feeling as if my every move was being watched. At best, I felt it unnecessary to be on zoom for open note exam and at worse I was completely distracting in a way that worsened my performance.
For future years, I highly suggest doing what many other courses do of using the timer feature on canvas so that the exam is only open for the amount of time permitted by instructors. Then, if there are pressing questions, a TF or instructor can be in a zoom room for questions if students have logistical questions about the exam that need answering. This solution would greatly improve my experience in Econ 115 online. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There were so many people in the class and it moved so fast. I really enjoyed learning, but I never felt like I learned how to actually answer the exam questions. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: lectures were recorded and topics were explained well. Questions were encouraged in office hours. 
Weaknesses: lectures were slow at times but that was expected with an intro course <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The combination of professors made this course thoroughly engaging. However, it may be a struggle to interact with the class topics outside of lecture. For me, discussion section every week was not particularly helpful. I think if the discussion section covered questions on previous exams on similar or the same topics, then students may make connections between the topics in lecture and the exams more clearly. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professors were fantastic!
Weaknesses: I would have liked better engagement with the textbook. It was difficult to study on my own time because of this, and I felt reliant on the sessions &amp; lectures. The exam feedback and grading was also very hard to go over and understand where I made my mistakes. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course moved incredibly fast. Now, this must be taken into account with the fact that I am a first year and this was in the middle of an incredibly rough year, both nationally and personally. But I still had a certain grappling on my other courses that I just didn't have with this one. I felt like not enough time was spent on certain concepts that didn't make sense, and at one point, I gave up taking notes on in-person lectures, because the lecture moved too quickly for me to even write things down. The workload was minimal, but the midterms gave me an incredible amount of anxiety, only because the course revolved around the recorded lectures that went too fast and didn't go into depth when needed. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One strength of this course was the inclusion of two instructors, Professor Berry and Professor Polak. Professor Berry was very conceptual, whereas Professor Polak was very precise. In fact, I would have liked to have seen Professor Polak teach a little more of the course. 

Professor Berry did a very good job keeping students engaged, particularly given the challenges that arise from virtual learning platforms. He was very animated, and made sure to incorporate many real-world examples of the concepts we were using. 

Other strengths of the course include the discussion section format and the flipped p-set activities. The smaller group settings, in which students could ask questions, was very helpful. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was pretty much perfect in all honesty. There were always TA's and TF's available for office hours, recitations, and general questions. Every lecture was recorded, so this was also incredibly useful! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One of the course's strengths was the wide variety of places to learn and get help. Besides the live lectures, there was a weekly Friday activity session where we could learn more about real-world applications. There was also a weekly problem set session where the professor went over the solutions for one of the problem set questions. There were also weekly discussion sections to go over example problems and a lot of peer tutor/office hour sessions that people could go to seemingly at any time. I think one of the weaknesses of the course (and this is kind of inherent given that it is an introductory course) is that we had to skim over a lot of topics, and the course sometimes felt rushed because it focused on breadth rather than depth. Again, however, this is probably very much because of the introductory-level of the course. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the professors tried to make their explanations clear, but lectures can be confusing and fast paced. I often had to rewatch parts of the lecture many times in order to semi-understand a concept. Also, I think we spent too much time on real-world examples and on getting people to raise their hand over Zoom to answer questions. Since there were so many students and due to the Zoom semester, I did feel very disengaged and detached from the professors and the rest of the class. However, section and office hours were great and made the class feel more personal. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The large size of the class, ECON 115, made it difficult to connect with my professors during class to clarify the material. Overall, I felt it was convenient that each class is recorded; however, I did not feel properly prepared for the midterms or final exam. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professors stayed after class to answer questions, which was great. Additionally, they held multiple review and activity sections throughout the week which were also very useful. <br/></div>
