<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Jorgensen could have utilized really any virtual tool to make this lecture more interesting than reading off of his scanned handwritten notes. It was so hard to follow along when all of the molecules were already drawn and there was nothing interactive about learning the reactions so it was hard to see how molecules would interact. The exams were also a big time crunch with no partial credit and I think a lot of students know more than the exams give them credit for. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I believe that while the virtual component could not be controlled, the instructor could have made a more engaging lecture and better use of technology to enable learning. I often found myself coming out of lecture more confused or not comprehending anything. The pre-written pdfs were not helpful. Aaron Clark's style of teaching was well facilitated including in-class problem solving, drawing reactions or notes while teaching, and engaging students. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professor was not very engaging at all and the material was basically all self taught. I wish there was more office hours during the semester and not just the week leading up to the exam. I had to study on my own fro 2-3 hours a day just to catch up because the lectures were so poorly conducted. The only time I learned was with my TA during discussion section (the TAs were amazing!!!). <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â live lectures are terrible. only take this class if u need it for a major. one of the worst classes i've taken at yale, typical weed-out class. exams are so hard, class average was like a 60% on each midterm exam... <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course could definitely be improved by listening to students more. I think a Piazza page is so important for ALL STEM courses and I really could have used that resource to help. I hope that the chemistry department will abandon Sapling. We should not have to pay so much for this course: textbook, answer guide, and sapling. It creates a really exclusionary environment for low-income students. <br/></div>
</div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weakness- The online lectures were a waste of time. Dr. Jorgensen just read from prewritten notes. I did not learn anything from the course instructor. I was taught via the textbook and the preceptor Aaron Clark. The exams (which were written by Dr. Clark) were a bit unfair and did not accurately test the material that was taught. The final exam, however, was a bit more fair than the 2 midterm exams. 

Strength- Sapling was a great tool to do practice problems as I read the textbook. Aaron Clark is a very friendly guy who obviously cares about student success--he does however need a bit more experience on writing exams. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I think the rigor of this class is a plus. I know a lot of people complain about this class, but I have found it incredibly rewarding. The content is far more interesting than anything learned in general chemistry. Further, I felt as though adequate emphasis was placed on reinforcing general chemistry skills at the beginning of the semester. 

Weakness: The lectures were a bit "dry," but in all honesty, it's organic chemistry -- if you don't do the reading, the lectures will be boring and confusing. The solution: do the reading. 

I also felt as though the course was a bit "unbalanced." Stereochemistry should have been on the first exam, and the second should have at least included dehydration reactions of alcohols. It was hard to cram for the final since a ton of information and new mechanisms were thrown at us in only 4 lectures. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: helpful TA's, notes given out in advance, summaries of reactions 
Weaknesses: Prof. Jorgensen is not a very engaging professor and makes the material harder to understand and synthesize. At the end of the semester, I stopped going to lectures virtually because I would end up more confused than if I solely learned from the book. Therefore, I most taught myself throughout the entire course with the exception of the discussion section where my TA was FAR more helpful. Also, many times I would be confused as to what was important/would be tested on exams and what was just additional information provided by the Professor. The course director was often unclear of what mechanisms we needed to know/didn't need to know, so I often relied on peers who crowd-sourced information on what was neccesary. Clearer messaging and expectations could help remedy this. Also, I have would appreciate slightly more practice materials than one past test and a short review powerpoint. I often found that what I was tested on and what I learned in lecture, section, and the book didn't really align. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There are many ways that this course can be improved. Firstly, the keys for all of the midterms we take in the class should be posted on Canvas. I would get answers wrong and even though I went to my discussion section to understand, I lacked a clear rubric outlining the steps of each question. Section is also only 50 minutes, which does not give enough time to properly review each question. The lack of these rubrics/keys had a significant negative impact on my learning. Secondly, there is only so much professors can do given the circumstances--I also understand that each professor has their own preferences. At the same time, I feel that there were many opportunities where there could be more student participation during the lectures. Students could only ask question by running them by the instructor. I've taken other STEM classes at Yale and the lecture style was more engaging.

I appreciated how the professor posted the lecture notes on canvas before each class. I also enjoyed how he would talk about his personal experiences with research during the lectures.

The peer tutors were my main source of learning/understanding. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is nationally known to be a hard class. Students everywhere struggle with it. This class was incredibly difficult. The weaknesses of it this semester were the style of teaching. While it was amazing getting to learn from a world renowned chemist, the teaching style was not productive for student learning. It was all monotonous and students were basically expected to learn on their own. The strengths were that if you put in the time outside of the class, you would probably do a good job and get a good grade. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One strength of this course is that the material helps you on your way as a pre-med or your major. Something I think is definitely a weakness is that the way this course is structured makes it go incredibly fast and packs so much material (material that from what I've compared from study websites and other schools' websites is normally learned in orgo II) into very little time. I feel like I had to teach myself the material over the week kind of a surface level or just enough to finish the electronic psets, and then teach myself more in-depth when exams came around. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course had the following weaknesses: exams were far more difficult than lectures and problem sets, it was never clear what we needed to know for exams, and it felt like the teaching staff were kind of expecting things to operate like we weren't online and facing the difficulties that introduced, but maybe that is just me. 
The lectures were always very good and Dr. Jorgensen did a good job of explaining things, but there was a clear disconnect between lectures and exam content. Also, this seems to be a common problem in intro chemistry courses, the practice exams from previous years are all but useless. If they aren't covering similar content or in a similar structure, it might be best to not include them at all. It would be much better to have practice exams that mimicked the content and structure of the real exams so that students knew what to expect and what to prepare for. Maybe also a study guide of some sort to summarize each chapter and what was expected to be known. I understand that you can't give the exact questions from an exam, that would be ridiculous, but it would be far more beneficial if we could at least be prepared for exams. This is also an exam in which far more content than is humanly possible, if you are taking more than the 1 credit that this course is worth, is thrown at students very quickly. If you are going to keep the content of this course so expansive and in-depth, such changes as those above might seriously improve student performance and the value that they get out of the course, a win for us and you. <br/></div>

Weakness: the way lectures were delivered were not really conducive to learning. I would have preferred slides that more clearly explained material. This is due to COVID, but the formatting of the tests did not reflect what parts of information we did know. Looking at past practice tests, orgs puts an emphasis on understanding parts of a mechanism and why they occur. Multiple choice doesn't really show that.

The information was not very organized which made it very difficult to study for tests. I wish professor Jorgensen had made powerpoints or used a tablet to draw the molecules. As a very visual learner, it was extremely difficult to follow reactions without seeing the reaction drawn out or the flow of the electrons in the beginning of the semester. <br/></div>

Weaknesses: Professors pretended like we were still in-person and structured the class as such. Professor was not only bad at teaching but the mode of delivery was absolutely terrible and I do mean bonkers. Every day he'd screen share a pdf of his notes and just scroll through the notes in a *minimized* window. No drawing or slides or anything and he had a tendency to ramble and speak in a monotone. Safe to say this is the least engaging, most boring, and most poorly organized class I have ever taken.

Exams were on canvas, but proctored in Zoom (?) which was always super, super sus. Unlike gen chem and the other orgo classes, there are only two midterms and neither of them get dropped. The lack of forgiveness in the grading and exam scheme is questionable on a normal basis, but given COVID and online schooling, it sent stress levels through the roof. This class is NOT optimized for your learning and you are really just thrown to the wind and expected to teach yourself everything. The exams are very difficult as well although the class is curved.

Preceptor (Aaron) doesn't have a lot of empathy for students, although he is a better teacher, and neither does Jorgensen. If you want a course where your professors and teaching staff want to see you succeed and will help you do that, this is not that course. I learned absolutely nothing from class.

The weaknesses, however, significantly offset this positive. The course was taught with Professor Jorgensen simply scrolling through a PDF with barely-legible handwriting and reading out what he thought was significant. This was despite him clearly telling us how normally, he would teach this course in such a way that he would write these notes for the students while lecturing, so the emphasis could be on hearing the concepts, connecting them to the drawings being made, and synthesizing that into your notes during lecture. Instead, lectures became a time to quickly write down everything one could read on the PDF even though everything wasn't specifically covered by Prof. J. Additionally, it became difficult to follow exactly how certain mechanisms took place because professor J did no drawing (despite having the clear option to simply use an iPad) and thus we were expected to know how to draw mechanisms and organic molecules without ever actually seeing them drawn. <br/></div>

The grades ended up being fair as compared to the grading in other STEM lectures. Additionally, the course should have been split up into 3 midterms like Intro Chem and like other organic chemistry courses in the past instead of just two. As a result, the midterms were 4 chapters of material at a time and there was no 'drop' grade, which would have been nice. Although this is not necessary, I think other chemistry courses set us up to depend on the option of dropping an exam grade. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â While I appreciated Dr. Clark's enthusiasm for teaching, it didn't really make up for Dr. Jorgenson's lack of it. Dr. Jorgenson was the course lecturer and I found his explanations to be mostly unhelpful to the point that by the end of the semester it became very difficult to watch the lectures as I already had to watch them asynchronously due to course conflict and I really felt like they weren't actually helping me. I always enjoyed attending Dr. Clark's section, but especially towards the end of the semester when Dr. Jorgenson began moving through material much more quickly and much less clearly, I started to feel lost in section because I hadn't actually absorbed all the content yet. Meanwhile earlier in the semester I found section really helpful, but because of Dr. Jorgenson's poor course planning, I couldn't get what I needed out of Dr. Clark's section at the end of the semester. Overall, I think I just wish things had moved a bit faster earlier in the course so there wasn't so much content crammed in at the last minute, which not everyone had the time to dedicate all their time to learning as we had other finals to worry about. I also wish we got more of Dr. Clark in lectures, as I found his explanations much more helpful than Dr. Jorgenson's. <br/></div>

The weakness is that the lecture was literally so useless and taught me nothing. Professor Jorgenson literally just went on and on about his own research and bragging about how smart he is instead of actually teaching or ever engaging with the class. It could be improved by maybe having a professor that cares just a little bit about his students. Lecture was not engaging at all.

In terms of weaknesses, however, the lectures were WAY too fast. Our professor just breezed through many main topics, but then would make time for rather lengthy tangents

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There were many opportunities to see material and to improve. You see the material first when doing the textbook reading (if you do it), then in the lecture. You're then exposed again in section and then assessed in your homework. In this way, I liked how the course was structured.

One aspect of the course that I didn't like were the assessments. The average of the tests was around a 70, which wasn't so bad but it felt that they were designed to test students on less important topics in the material. For example, the first exam barely touched upon reactions, which was the bulk of emphasized in the weeks leading up to the test. Or in the second exam, there were three questions that revolved around Hoffman vs Sayzaff products, which felt unfair considering we didn't spend that much time in class on them. <br/></div>

The lectures were not engaging in the slightest and just involved screen sharing an old PDF. Also, the Sapling homeworks had a huge number of bugs that made it way more annoying to do homework than it should've been; they were also graded for correction. The biggest strength of this course were the teaching fellows and peer tutors who basically reexplained lecture topics and answered questions in a much more understandable way. There were not enough time for tests and the test formats were incredibly inconvenient for students studying remotely. <br/></div>

I did not expect as much thermodynamics on the first midterm as there was it would have been helpful if this was emphasized a bit more. This is pretty specific, but some of the sapling questions don't accept the answer unless the molecule is drawn from a specific perspective  having already accounted for stereochemistry, the molecule additionally needs to be oriented in a specific way that was not indicated in the question. Making these more clear would be helpful. <br/></div>

The availability of the TAs was also not great.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professor occasionally attempted to cover, in one lecture,  much more material than was truly digestible, leaving many students struggling to understand the mechanisms of complex reactions, constituting a major weakness. The exam questions were sometimes subtly worded to lead to different answers than the expected, resulting in confusion. The time limit for the two midterms was too strict, preventing students from performing as well as they could have and being able to demonstrate the true extent of their learning. 

A strength of this class was that study guides for some complex reactions were provided prior to exams, clarifying the mechanisms. Having many resources (Sapling, HW, practice exams, etc) was quite helpful for students looking to understand the material and gain experience through practice of problems. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Organic chemistry is a difficult course for students and faculty in the best of times. I think a large part of the issue with the course as a whole is that I get the sense that no one really wants to be there, including both the teaching staff and the students. Any students with a genuine interest in organic chemistry would be in a more advanced class, and everyone else is just there to fulfill a prerequisite. On top of all that, most students go into organic chemistry amidst warnings of doom, so are already expecting the worst, giving the course no real incentive to improve. Perhaps the greatest tragedy is that whenever I actually engaged with the material (probably while studying for a test, certainly not in lecture), I found it quite interesting and wish I had more time to consider what I was reading. Organic Chemistry as a discipline is very interesting, and the mechanisms and how they were discovered is pretty cool, and that is the strength of the course. The weakness of the course is, well, the actual course itself, almost every aspect of which was poorly executed, dull, joyless, and tinged with "this isn't all that important, but you have to know it for your next quiz". <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One strength of this course is the use of discussion (or recitation) sections. Given that this course is a large lecture, I found it very helpful to meet with a smaller discussion group each week to actively discuss practice problems and review lecture material. These discussions heavily relied on breakout rooms, which enabled me to collaborate more effectively with peers. I personally recommend that breakout rooms be incorporated into the large lectures in the future, as this would help break up the monotony of having a single instructor talk and thus keep more students engaged. This monotony, in my opinion, was the greatest weakness of the course. I mean this in no offense to Professor Jorgensen, but by nature of organic chemistry, I often felt that viewing mechanism after mechanism on Jorgensens pre-written notes led students to become both disengaged and supersaturated with information. (This disengagement, I believe, is reflected by the poor attendance of many students during later lectures.) I recommend that this course incorporate something to break up the material by allowing breakout rooms or even granting time to self-solve practice problems as Jorgensen explains his notes, especially if this course remains virtual. <br/></div>
