<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: peer tutors are super helpful, TFs are knowledgeable and willing to help, Prof. Johnson is an engaging lecturer, PSets aren't overly complicated.
Weaknesses: some concepts are explained with an assumption of physics knowledge (might be a slight challenge if you have a less robust background in physics), exams were somewhat hard to get done in the time limit, but they were graded fairly with regards to time constraints. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was very enjoyable; Professor Johnson and the teaching team all had AMAZING personalities and were more than willing to help! <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures are fun, but sometimes I feel like I learn more from the textbook. Obviously, you cant cover everything in class but I think it would make the experience a little better if there was more content in the lectures. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Johnson was good at explaining confusing concepts in multiple ways and multiple times to help them make sense to us. Having the ability to go back and rewatch the recorded lectures were also a big help in solidifying that understanding. I also liked how Professor Johnson clearly pointed out what sections of the textbook the lectures aligned with, so it was easy to know where to look if I needed further clarification. The sample exams were also very helpful, and it was nice that the psets were largely graded for completion and low pressure. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I think the class itself was good in that there is a lot of support. The peer tutor and TF office hours and review sessions were incredibly helpful. What was essential in preparing for exams was Prof. Johnson's office hour review sessions. I don't think I would have passed my exams without that. 

Weaknesses: Lectures could get dense at times, especially when it came derivations. I think more screen annotating would have been helpful in guiding the flow of thinking. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - I don't like STEM but this class was somewhat enjoyable because it forced you to learn the "why" behind the topics and understand how things worked rather than just mindlessly plugging in numbers to equations. Grading the Psets on completion rather than accuracy also made it less stressful. The Sapling was way more manageable than last semester. Way less demoralizing than last semester where the average for some of the midterms was below a 70. 

Weaknesses - the course felt a little disorganized at times. It would have been nice to have the equation sheet that was going to be on the exam prior to the exam so that we could know what equations were important to understand instead of having to flip through Oxtoby. Additionally, the answer keys for the psets and sample exams often had mistakes or were unclear. And a lot of times we got the answer key for the sample exams just one night before the exam. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength is that the professor is very responsive to students. Something that could be improved is organization of all the class files. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength was that the exams are very fair and there are plenty of resources if you are struggling to understand the material. A weakness is that sometimes the lectures are a bit boring and difficult to sit through because there is so much math, but I think that is just a consequence of the subject. The course is also quite disorganized in terms of providing answer keys, for example many times the answer key for a sample exam would be released at around 10pm the night before the exam. There is also occasional misinformation among the TFs. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Though Professor Johnson was truly brilliant, the BIGGEST strength of this course came from the Teaching Fellows, Liv, Evan, and James. They were always SO lively and made the discussions about chemistry super interesting and not boring whatsoever. I really appreciated all of Liv's quirks and how she loved to laugh and make the course as interesting as possible over Zoom. Evan was also really amazing, and you could tell he knew his stuff. The course spends a lot of time making sure that you have a deep understanding of chemical topics (spoiler alert, Johnson often relates EVERYTHING back to thermodynamics). I also think that the other strength was how relaxed and non-competitive this course was  everyone was always willing to slow things down and explain things at a more understandable level, and the course was truly focused on learning over grades.
Weaknesses: There really were not many weaknesses associated with this course that couldn't have been solved by transitioning back to in-person lectures. In fact, I know it would have been even better in person. The one thing I will say is that the exams could be quite stressful when we took them, and even an extra 10 minutes on them would prove to make the experience a whole lot less stressful. However, looking back, it was always manageable, just a little daunting at times! Overall, I loved the course! <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - the exam format (a couple questions repeated from problem sets/practice exams, lowest question score for each test dropped) was a huge help and kept me from stressing too much about the class.

Weaknesses: practice exams and answer keys need to be released earlier! We need more than two days to do these practice tests. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The discussion sections and peer tutors were very helpful for learing the material. No major weaknesses. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The slides were difficult to follow along on, but Professor Johnson really does try to make the course as engaging as possible. The new information goes by pretty fast; however, the lecture recaps at the beginning of each class are helpful at summarizing the main points of the previous lecture. This class was more physics-based than I expected, so it was frustrating when the professor expects you to know physics concepts and equations especially if you haven't taken physics in high school before. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I really enjoyed the lectures. My teaching fellow was also super helpful when it came to clearing up confusion or questions I had about the different problem sets. I would have preferred if the answer keys to the practice exams and problems sets were published a little bit earlier. Sometimes they were released only a day before an exam, so I was not a big fan of that. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The TAs Peer tutors and professor were wonderful and knowledgeable about the subject matter. I think if the tests were given 10 extra minutes it would be better timing for students to demonstrate their chemistry knowledge.  The exam review sessions were extremely helpful. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course does an excellent job at exposing students to completely different fields within chemistry than students are exposed to in first semester. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course really stressed a cohesive picture of general chemistry using thermodynamics. This was helpful in understanding the root causes of chemical phenomena. While the derivations of various formulas was interesting, it might have been helpful to know which derivations are worth knowing. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was very clear in the timeline and the lectures were very good. For instance, I knew exactly what chapter of the textbook was being discussed and so on. However, I do wish that the exams were edited more so that all necessary information was included on tests. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: interesting material and topics covered, strong support system that includes peer tutors, TAs, professor. Weaknesses: Few weaknesses, just would have liked study material (practice questions, answer keys) to be given more ahead of time and with more detail. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength was that it was taught well and clear to understand. A weakness was that the different sections were not really interconnected so it was like jumping from one topic to the next with no connection between them. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The pace of the class felt fast, but not all of the syllabus content was covered at the end. Perhaps some of the nuance and depth of some areas could be shortened for the sake of covering more content while still maintaining a similar pacing to the course. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Mark has a great personality, Liv and Evan are great TFs

Weaknesses: sometimes not all the equations needed for a test were on the equation sheet, tests should have been proofread before they were released <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was pretty well managed--the lectures were recorded, so they were accessible for re-watching.  This really helped, especially with the more difficult subject material <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was much more math-heavy than Chem 163, which means that it offers an in-depth approach to the inner workings of topics, but comes at a drawback since lectures often delve into gritty derivations which aren't necessarily the most engaging. <br/></div>
</div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The peer tutoring and discussion sections were very helpful at teaching concepts and going over how to solve problems. Sometimes the lectures moved too fast and felt like there wasn't enough time to go over concepts in enough detail, so maybe slowing down the pace of lectures overall would be a small improvement. Also, sometimes the exams had typos, and while only 1 exam had them to the degree that I actually felt negatively affected, I felt pressed for time in general during online exams, so proofreading them would have made it less stressful. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This class was a little fast paced, which made it a challenge to keep up with the content, but the way exams were set up made it easier to have a better understanding of what to expect and the guided discussion sections also helped slow down the material and focus more on important details. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Johnson makes the class very interesting, TFs are very engaging, Peer Tutors are great. 
Weaknesses: The tests are not proof read very well. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the class did a great job over zoom. Maybe having the TFs and PTs talk more during lectures so we get opinions from other students who are more experienced. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The arc of the course content felt really smooth. Professor Johnson made himself and the TAs and peer tutors feel really accessible. There was a lot of online resources and reviews and helpful additional content. Overall, the class was pretty fun and engaging. 
Weaknesses: Sometimes I didn't totally follow Professor Johnson's explanations or lines of reasoning, but it wasn't ever something that some extra studying couldn't address. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The primary strength of this class that I would say sets this class apart from all others is the presence of the amazing crew of Teaching Fellows. The Teaching Fellows, in addition to the instructor himself, are among the most down-to-earth, supportive people one will ever encounter in the teaching crew of a class. To find evidence of the teaching crew's supportive qualities, one only has to look at the longs hours that they were all willing to stick out in review sessions before midterms and exams. Beyond the teaching crew, the material of the course is generally engaging material that has applications across all disciplines of STEM and is taught well by the teaching crew. The deep dives into select tenets of the curriculum of the course gave some exposure to true physical chemistry. With regards to exams, they were generally shorter, and plenty of sample exams and problems were developed and disseminated for content review before exams and midterms. 
Weakness(es):  While the curriculum contains many enriching deep dives into several sections of the curriculum, I would say a problem present with the curriculum itself is the fact that it so closely aligns to the standard general chemistry curriculum. In contrast, the curriculum of Chemistry 163 explored many topics that would never thought to be found in the standard general chemistry curriculum. As such, I believe that there is some room in the Chemistry 167 curriculum to include topics that deviate heavily from the current curriculum. <br/></div>
