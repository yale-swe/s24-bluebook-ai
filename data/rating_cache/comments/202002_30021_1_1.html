<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: interesting material, engaging and knowledgable professors (especially Prof Lin!!), good pace of learning and assessment, group quizzes facilitated learning and also fostered a sense of community within the class (even online)
Weaknesses: I would have preferred if the assignments for Part 2 had been spread out into multiple smaller assignments (like how it was in Part 1) rather than 2 big assignments <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths are the teaching. Both professors were wonderful and engaging. The homeworks and quizzes were challenging but doable.

The only weakness is that 1:45 is long for a class and it is sometimes hard to maintain engagement. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - very much alot of support, the professors were very understanding, group quizzes made a difference, I liked when we started quizzes during class and check in with TAs very easily if we had any questions, the syllabus was very helpful 
Weakness - not enough clear feedback in the homeworks and papers, I would want more feedback <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was very well organized and there were a lot of activities that engaged the student. Even though it was remote, the TAs and the professors both did a good job being as accessible as possible and were very open to helping students. I really liked the environment of the course and it overall felt very collaborative. I was able to learn and engage in the material without feeling stressed at any point. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course adapted really well to the online format! The homework assignments and quizzes were excellent -- I appreciated that the quizzes were open note and group work so that I could interact with other students in the class. The homework assignments (especially the build-up one for part 1 of the course) were also very helpful and interesting because each student could put their own twist on them. The professors are also amazing lecturers and go out of their way to help the students. The only weakness of the course to me was the length of lecture, but the professors did their best to make this more bearable by adding breaks during the lectures. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There is a lot of information packed in, simply due to the nature of the course, but the days of zoom calls and lecture slides often seemed to blur together, making genuine intake of information was rather difficult.  There was not enough breakup of information from session to session. The main strengths of the course really came from the homework assignments, which pushed students to grapple with specific topics and form a solid understanding of whatever their focus of research was. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The discussion sections did not really enhance my learning. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I enjoyed how this course was designed. I appreciate the fact that both Professor Near and Professor Lin recorded their lectures and posted the accompanying slides because it allowed us to refer back to them and go over concepts we may have been confused about. I also liked the breakout room exercises and group quizzes because it let us talk ideas through and clarify course content together. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I think the way this course was structured was a serious strength. Group quizzes were seriously helpful for getting to know and interact with my classmates, however in the future it might be a good idea to do a mix of group quizzes and individual quizzes, or make them more about application of the information than straight regurgitation to better assess our understanding of the material now that everything is online. It felt very easy and laid-back to me, which is honestly both a strength and weakness. On one hand it was nice to not be super stressed about my grade in this class because I was also working a job while taking this course, but I also felt like I put a lot more effort into this course than some other students but our grades barely differed because of the open-note group quizzes. However, I do think it was definitely the right choice to make quizzes open-note and not have exams because there's no real fair way to assess in the normal way, and I think having the two papers were a really good way of using an application-based manner of assessing students. I just wish there was a way for us to distinguish ourselves in terms of our grades. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â In the first part of the course, Professor Lin utilized every aspect of remote learning, from group quizzes to breakout rooms every day. This allowed me to be more engaged and constantly thinking about and debating various questions that she posed with peers. However, in the second half of the course, it was only long lectures which I felt were not very conducive to as engaging remote learning. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Prof. Lin was great! Very engaging, made the online format a lot better by having many breakout room exercises, and encouraged collaboration by creating quiz groups. Both parts of the course had very frequent office hours (I think almost every day) and the TAs were all very kind and responsive. I actually think this class was much better online than in-person (did not have the best experience in 101-2 during the year). 

Weaknesses: Unfortunately I found the BIOL104 portion to be not as engaging, since it was mostly lecture for 1hr45min. I enjoyed this class nonetheless. Also, I felt the feedback during the BIOL104 portion was a bit slow (especially compared to the BIOL103 portion). <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: even though it was held online, we had plenty of collaborative opportunities to work with other people and get to know the class. For instance, the quizzes were solved in pairs, which really helped me on learning collaborative skills and communication abilities. On the other hand, we also got individual study opportunities such as the review articles or proposals. Having both of these dynamics provided a chance to learn a wider variety of skill sets in my opinion. 

Weakness: it is definitely harder to point out a weakness, because both of my professors (professor Near and professor Lin) were such encouraging instructors. Something that can be further improved could be to add even more break-out room discussions especially for the second part of the lecture. For a lot of my classmates,  break-out room discussions helped provide a chance to review the content and move forward, and I personally feel like the frequency of having break-out rooms could be increased. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was awesome. Strengths: excellent professors and TAs, interesting course material, collaborative environment. No weaknesses in my opinion <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was very well structured and the assignments allowed students to engage in depth with all the topics. In my opinion, I don't think there were any concerning weaknesses. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professors are great and really care about student success. The quiz format (group, unlimited time, open note) reduced stress while encouraging communication and made taking classes online less isolating. The homework assignments for the first half of the course were highly specific, but the second half would benefit from more detailed instructions. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was very well organized and all materials are easily accessible. Also, the group quiz format of testing was appreciated as it promoted much needed collaboration and made class participation less intimidating as it was within small groups. Out-of-class resources were also abundant which made learning the material and asking for clarification easy. One weakness was that lectures became a bit content-heavy and difficult to follow in the second part of the class. However, that may just be an issue with the content itself, as Ecology and Evolutionary Biology are particularly dense subjects. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was very strong overall, and I only have one suggested improvement. The final quiz and essay grades were not entered into Canvas, nor was any feedback given regarding these final assignments: the improvement would be to give this feedback. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course was very well-organized! Occasionally, I had difficulty knowing exactly which material I needed to study, but Profs Lin and Near were incredibly well-organized the vast majority of the time. They were also both really helpful and informed, and made the class interesting!!! They also prioritized group work and collaboration, which I appreciated. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Two strengths of this course were (1) the group quizzes and (2) a step-by-step breakdown of research projects. The group quizzes fostered peer communication, and this student engagement was immensely helpful under the given circumstances, given the isolation that often accompanies remote learning. I also found that the group quizzes allowed for better understanding of the material, as students had to go beyond their own understanding and convince others of their logic. Moreover, I appreciated that each of the two research projects were broken down into smaller assignments throughout the semester, rather than just having one final paper due. This layout allowed me to respond to feedback, which was especially helpful when writing the research proposal because I had not formatted a college-level research proposal prior to this course.

However, the online formatting and accelerated pace of this summer course came with weaknesses that may not necessarily be present during an in-person fall/spring semester. Whereas a 10-minute break per class was offered in the first half of the course, the second half of the course only offered either a 5-minute break or no break at all. In addition, the second half of the course did not offer as many breakout discussions as the first half of the course. In my opinion, one 10-minute break and several brief peer discussions are needed each day in order to keep students engaged in what is otherwise a long lecture, especially when students are isolated within a remote environment. <br/></div>
