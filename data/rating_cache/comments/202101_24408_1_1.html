<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: great "survey" course of global health as a field. Professor Fallon is such an amazing person and instructor. 
Weakness: I wish we discussed more about our individual thoughts of what the institution of global health should look like. in the future I feel like that conversation was mainly absent, and it was more about like "it is what it is". I wish I could have engaged in that conversation in this class to further my knowledge but also I think it would have been beneficial for some of the people who were a bit disillusioned by what the field of global health can achieve in terms of goals. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I am amazed at how much ground we covered in this course. I did not expect to come away with such a comprehensive foundation for thinking about global health, but I certainly did! <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this class included the material as I really enjoyed the topics we were learning about and felt that Professor Fallon was a good lecturer. However, a weakness for this class was the way in which the exams were set up. The expectations for what we could complete in limited time frames felt unreasonable at times and when many students voiced their concerns it felt as though their concerns disregarded. Especially with how hard this year has been, I just felt that our concerns were not acknowledged and the structures of the exams ended up creating more stress than necessary. I do believe though that in a normal year this would not have been a problem, but more something specific to being on zoom. <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course could be a bit faster paced, but overall it was very well done. The only minor thing that could be improved is earlier posting of the weekly readings. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I feel as if the content we learned was very superficial and not in depth. This class gave a broad overview of large global health issues, such as ebola, malnutrition, HIV/AIDS, noncommunicable diseases. I think we could have gone through more policies that have worked in regards to combatting these issues rather than just describing the problems.

I think the exams were unnecessarily difficult, meaning it involved rote memorization of statistics and lecture slide facts that don't test your understanding, but rather your memorization abilities. In addition, the exam was extremely long and I believe that was unnecessary.

Because the class final was scheduled to be on the last slot of exams, Professor Fallon wanted to change the format to be more accommodating. In sections, we voted on a new final exam format and I know that a lot if not the majority of students voted to have the exam be take home, but the format didn't change. Instead we just got a new exam slot, which ended up being fine. I just thought it was weird to have students vote on a new exam format, and then disregard that a little bit. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course had many guest lecturers who provided extra nuance to the content that we covered in the main course. I appreciated their expertise.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked the lectures, especially when we had guests, and I thought the reading was perfect in length

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Fallon is incredibly passionate about the material and does a great job at making the course engaging. She's also very accomodating and cares about her students' well-being. She invited a variety of guest speakers whose backgrounds ranged from diplomacy to medicine, and it was very inspiring and informative to hear from these diverse experts on various topics ranging from mental health to economic development. The paper assignments really striked the right balance between length and depth, and I found them rewarding to write. Professor Fallon also had well-structured lectures and slides that made reviewing easier. The TFs provided detailed, timely feedback on the writing assignments.
Weaknesses: Occasionally, the material would feel a bit repetitive. The lectures about global health agenda / WHO priorities sometimes appeared too broad/vague, and it would feel like a list of empty phrases. I think picking out a few items from a long agenda would be more helpful. The midterm also involved more memorization than I expected, and the questions were a lot of words for such a time-constrained exam. I do believe the exam can be restructured to involve more interpretation/writing. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was well-balanced with different topics and guest lecturers, and the assessments/assignments were fair.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One strength is that Prof Fallon is really nice and approachable. At the same time, she did not listen to our feedback (even when she explicitly asked for it), particularly on which mode of midterm/final exam we'd like, considering COVID. In terms of weaknesses, the assignments were really poorly planned out. I did not feel like I gained much from them at all. The midterm was the most poorly structured exam I've taken at Yale, but hopefully this will change in future years. There were also way too many guest lecturers. I enjoy guests, especially in a class like this, but they were not always great, and since they were all presenting on their very specific area of expertise, we ended up skipping or barely touching on a lot of the more general topics that had been outlined in the syllabus. My TF was also not great. I never got any feedback on assignments beyond a very vague sentence or two. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength of this course is how comprehensive it is. We learned so many areas of global health that I had not thought about before, such as conflicts, medical tourism, and more. The guest lecturers were engaging, and I learned a lot from their areas of expertise. The class was organized, and I could follow along what was being talked about. I could connect different topics, and I could apply topics from one case study to others. I appreciated the discussion section activities that enhanced our understanding of certain concepts. The teaching team is very receptive to students and supportive. This course can be improved mainly by providing more feedback and guidance on assignments. I felt that I didn't really get much feedback on the paper and policy memo. I also think that logistics of exams and papers could be more clear and use up less of class time. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths:
This course covered really interesting concepts, and I think I stayed engaged because I was curious about many of the topics included in the lectures. Also, I was excited by the fact that the course included many guest speakers from all different backgrounds in global health. While I would have preferred to hear from less academics, we did hear from a former ambassador and important people in global health. Our sections were also setup to help us succeed, as we reviewed important concepts from class and had great conversations about global health topics.

Weaknesses:
I throughly enjoyed this class and really liked Professor Fallon and the TF's, however I felt that the expectations for writing assignments and tests were not very clear. While we were given a prompt and a general layout for the essays, I feel like the grading seemed a bit arbitrary at times. The main weakness related to this course was probably the exams - while we reviewed concepts in class, it often seemed like the tests sometimes involved super minute details. That said, I spent quite a bit of time studying for them so I felt ok about it. Perhaps next year the teaching team could provide a study guide or something along those lines. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One strength was the specific topics and lecture discussions to global health. One weakness is the lack of communication about exams specific such as time, length, and topics, etc. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: covers a wide range of topics in global health, provides opportunity to focus in through the essays on topics of interest

Weaknesses: focuses on breath rather than depth; I felt like most of the information could be googled; readings were not interesting; section discussions were not great.

I think the class has a lot of potential but should focus more hard discussion, critical thinking and prolbem solving <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Fallon is definitely a strength for this course: she is incredibly excited about the material and is really kind. The topics covered in lecture were always really interesting.

Weakness: At times the lectures felt a bit disorganized and unclear. There was often a lot of uncertainty throughout the semester (what the exam format will be, how long exams will be, etc.). Many other students did not feel that a section was needed for this course since much of the material felt straightforward. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths of this course were providing a broad overview of the field of global health while allowing for some more in depth exploration through the essays. One potential weakness was that there were a number of class days canceled due to covid schedule this semester, which was nice at the time but amounted to feeling like missing some learning opportunities. Also, just thought of this but it would be nice if the information from the slides could have citations next year! The readings allow you to dig deeper, but it would be good to be able to look up a specific reference for where some of the stats and info come from <br/></div>
