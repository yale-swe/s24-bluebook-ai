<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: prelectures are slightly helpful but I hated that one of the instructors used powerpoint to show math... Midterm practice problems are helpful. Poor explanations of intuition.. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Good support system with frequent office hours with profs/TAs/peer tutors. Good instructor. Class lectures were helpful with problem sets. Weaknesses: Videos and lectures each week were a significant time commitment. I did not like that the instructor who did the pre-recorded videos rotated from week to week, especially because the teaching with the other two instructors (not Taylor) was often very unclear and lacking in examples. Exam prep resources were scarce and not helpful <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â course was organized well up until the material for the 3rd midterm, which was very condensed with respect to its weight and significance. In addition, the applications to differential equations seemed outside of the scope of the course and was material more reminiscent of a course in differential equations, while the course skipped over some crucial concepts in linear algebra, such as the Jordan canonical form. Also glossed over rowspace and left nullspace, which were referred to many times implicitly but not by name, which would have improved clarity of lecture. In addition, some assignments, especially the later problem sets and 3rd midterm, felt more like tests of mental computational/arithmetic ability using complicated fractions and radicals than assessments/exercises of conceptual understanding. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There were many problems with this class. The prerecorded videos varied in quality and content, and the live classes covered the same material, so the videos became unnecessary. 
The problem sets were significantly more difficult than anything covered in class (which on its own is fine), but also covered a significant amount of material never discussed in class. The problem sets also focused on computation over understanding theory, so 70% of the work on the psets was calculating a matrix multiplication, inverse, or eigenvalues/eigenvectors by hand rather than demonstrating knowledge of a new concept. As a result they became incredibly tedious. 
The exams also focused on computation, where an algebra mistake on a timed exam could cost the majority of the points on a problem despite the correct method being used. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I am struggling to think of a strength for this course. The format of the course was fundamentally flawed; while it was conceived and marketed as a flipped classroom, the professors extensively reviewed the content from the videos during the live zoom sessions. The necessity of the review was due to the videos' poor quality and the professors lack of communication. It was often made apparent during the live sessions that the separate professors did not watch each other's videos. Thus, we could not ask questions on the videos, causing further confusion. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â There were little to no strengths of the course, with the only few coming from a wide range of content practiced on problem sets. There was a clear lack of understanding and clarity in almost all of the concepts in the course by the three professors. To make up for this, the course format was a hybrid flipped classroom, if you could call it that. The content was "taught" in recorded videos before each live class period, but was often so vague in instruction that the entire live class would need to be spent re-teaching the material. There was a clear lack of communication and preparedness by the three professors, who seemed to only be able to reiterate the concepts and proofs from the textbook. The content is difficult, and needs to be properly and efficiently taught, neither of which is true for this course. There also is way too much of an emphasis on theory and proofs, especially considering there is an identical class dedicated to this material with proofs. This class is supposed to be "with applications" but over the entire the semester, 1 application was explained, in the final lecture of the course. I continually asked my during this course "Has anyone even though about how the students are supposed to do this?" For example, on an exam, we were instructed to point our cameras at our hands, while only offering the exam through a PDF we had to view on the same device. For students with laptops, this clearly does not make sense and was not thought through whatsoever. Further, on problem sets, we were repeatedly asked to perform basic computation by hand, over and over throughout the semester, spending literally hours repeating the same process that we learned in the first few weeks of the course that can be easily and expediently calculated using a calculator or online software. Also the professors, despite repeated and varied pleas by a number of students, refused to publish solutions to any problem sets or exams. For the first exam, there were no practice problems published with a few days leading up to the exam. When pressed on the issue, the problems were finally uploaded with the comment in the announcement on canvas "under files-&gt;midterm 1 practice: The file is NOT meant to represent the exam, its content, or level of difficulty in any way . . ." What is the purpose of posting these problems which are practice for the exam if they do not represent the content on the exam? Additionally, there were no solutions posted to these problems for the first midterm, and they were posted for the second midterm they were riddled with computational errors in the Professor's handwritten document. The exams were also graded with little to no clarity, with an emphasis on the depth of explanation on computational math problems, regardless of correct answers, points were taken off repeatedly if an unexplained level of explanation was not met. When asked, professor McAdam only had apologies for the lack of clarity instead of an explanation for the removal of points. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The teaching of material was generally not very good. I feel that a lot of steps were taken by professors that leaped from one element to another, not truly clarifying the content. Also, dealing with proofs was never really taught in class but thrown at us in the problem sets. It would be very helpful if solving proof based problems were taught in class before presenting such problems on problem sets. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The dual lecture/seminar format of the course was very helpful for me as it allowed me to learn the material primarily in the pre-recorded lectures before reviewing that material (along with practice problems and additional instruction) in the seminar class times. Unfortunately, this course was taught by three professors, two of whom were not nearly as good at explaining the material, who alternated in the creation of the pre-recorded lectures. Thus, depending on the week, my understanding of the concepts going into my seminar section ranged considerably. Fortunately, my primary professor for the course (the one who always held my seminar section) was the most competent in portraying the course's material, which allowed my understanding to catch up. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures and overall course were very well organized. The course could perhaps be improved by offering more detailed solutions to the study guides to help with preparation for exams. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â the class was very organised but the 3 different professors teaching on rotation was very very annoying because they all have different teaching styles and notations and it was difficult to understand and each class had an hour worth of videos we had to watch. Parts were also unnecessarily tedious the questions themselves were not even hard it just was very tedious to calculate to the point where the profs just let us use wolfram alpha to do the basic calculations <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: So many office hours, help sessions, etc. 

Weaknesses: Lectures were not recorded and lecture notes were only posted occasionally - it doesn't take all that much effort to keep those resources available for our learning. The breakout rooms were so so hard to participate in during the end of the semester. The course was originally meant to not take the full live class time since we had videos to watch beforehand; this almost never happened, and we went to time or sometimes over most days. The videos before lecture should be scrapped and each professor just teach their class like normal. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course were Taylor McAdam's teaching. She was the only reason I really enjoyed this class, and I felt bad for any students who took the other sections. The problem sets were generally pretty doable, and there are a TON of help hours in this class. You will never feel like you're struggling alone. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Maybe spend less time and energy on going over the more mechanical computations and make more effort in covering and conveying the intuitions and connections between the algebraic expressions and geometric interpretations <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Better organization is definitely needed in this course. I loved having Taylor for sections, but the recorded lecture component was taught by all 3 professors. The inconsistencies in their teaching were really frustrating. Another huge weakness was the disparity in exam difficulty and problem sets, the problem sets being much more difficult. Wouldve also appreciated problem set solutions being posted after theyre due. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Weakness: The problem sets were mostly busywork. Please change this! It does not contribute to anyone's learning to be grinding out horrendous numbers. It would be a lot more beneficial to use numbers so that we can practice the concepts and methods. Computers will be used to do the actual number crunching. Furthermore, although we tried to do a flipped classroom, the recorded lectures were lacking. Not only were they not good at teaching the material, they actually made it more confusing. One would be better off saving time and not watching the recorded lectures because they had a negative effect on learning. The course would also be better off if solutions to homework, practice exams, and exams were provided.

Strengths: Professor McAdam was extremely approachable and good at explaining concepts/answering questions. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Taylor was a stellar professor and her pre-lecture videos were great, but when one of the other professors made the pre-lecture videos, I struggled to learn the material. It would have been much better if those videos were written out in real-time instead of just reading off of a prewritten slide, which is not conducive to learning or note-taking. Also, it would have been better if the answer keys for homework and exams were posted afterwards. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Linear algebra is a difficult subject. To improve: please follow the steps of Taylor McAdam and WRITE down the lectures, explaining the theorems/practice problems as you go. Also, please use better handwriting. Some instructors during the recorded lectures were difficult to follow due to preschool handwriting. <br/></div>
