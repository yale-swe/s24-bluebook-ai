<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Although the course is called intro probability and statistics, I felt like I spent more time learning about empirical applications of statistical methods than probability theory or statistical theory. The applications were interesting, but I wish we had spent more time learning about theory. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The problem sets were too difficult and there was no guidance provided on coding, though that was a big part of problem sets. Where advice was offered, it was very inaccessible to anyone without a background in coding. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: helpful videos, interesting applications, a TA that puts in the time and effort to make answer keys and to be available for answering questions

Weaknesses: the explanation of the probability theory was rather scattered, and it felt like I mostly got definitions that I had to piece together afterwards <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â It was really hard for me to grasp the essence of what exactly was going on the entire semester. We went through mostly topics we went through in ECON 117 but in depth and with lots of theory. I wish there were simple examples in class or in section for each regression model so we can get a better intuition as to what exactly we are doing. Also especially in the first half of the class, you get asked questions in homework and the midterm about material in the textbook that was never covered or glanced over during class. I had no idea how to do those questions and it took me forever. I ended up using my knowledge and sometimes my actual notes from ECON 117. Also not teaching coding was very unhelpful. It said so in the syllabus so I was expecting to have to learn on my own, but I learned so much more from ECON 117 because that class actually taught coding in sections. <br/></div>

</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course is a very shallow and very broad exploration of probability and statistics. I wish that less material was covered, but more deeply. I also feel that the exams weren't super fair, with deeper questions asked about concepts that we were given a shallow explanation about. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I learned about the applications of statistics in economics through the exploration of research papers and by recreating results on psets
Weaknesses: I did not feel that the course gave me a good foundation in probability or statistics. The probability portion of this class felt greatly rushed (one lecture often covered one chapter from the textbook) and important statistical concepts were underdeveloped (confidence intervals and hypothesis testing was glossed over during lectures and covered in sections instead in preparation for a pset). <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength is Professor Narita and Fernando are both very dedicated to teaching, very good at explaining the content, material is interesting. Weakness is problem sets are not well communicated and much more challenging than content discussed in class, and TA section materials are too proof-based and not so relevant with course materials. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Interesting content, really cool papers to go along with lectures.
Psets barely correlated with lectures so quite a bit had to be self-taught, and there isn't much help available from the TA or professor. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The curriculum was well-organized, with lectures building on each other. I thought the explanations of the different cultures of the various schools of thought in statistics was very important. The example studies in each lecture were very helpful in getting me to understand different approaches to answering different questions.
Weaknesses: I don't think we were given enough information (especially coding-wise) to do our problem sets well, even for people with coding experience. I also wish that we were given more examples (like, example math problems) for the earlier, more mathematical parts of the class. Writing down the definition of a moment-generating function and seeing how it works with a handful of made-up data are very different things. I felt that my shaky understanding of the earlier theory made later course comprehension tougher. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: interesting material, engaging empirical applications discussed, and engaging lectures 

Weaknesses: sometimes felt a bit disorganized. Pset questions weren't always super clear, and some were significantly more difficult than others. Also much less theory than I expected considering S&amp;DS 241 and 242 are the equivalent prerequisites for Econ 136, but perhaps we did discuss everything we needed to. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Notation can be somewhat overly complicated for simple concepts and the course doesn't spend a lot of time on statistics but it was very useful going through a wide range  of different studies and discussing the details  of how they were designed. I felt it was a great course for getting exposure to the statistics used in economics. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Luckily I knew R and some probability before, but the high paced nature of this course that does not dive deeply into any one topic makes it almost necessary that these concepts are familiar before the class begins. I wish there were more attention to mathematical proofs and the mathematics behind confidence intervals and the different statistical models. Luckily I will have a chance to take advanced probability to fill in these gaps. None of this is the fault of Professor Narita, instead it is just the nature of forcing two terms into one. 


As far as the syllabus, I feel the section on causal inference could be shortened. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â They throw a lot of information at you in this class. It was very difficult to know exactly what the expectations were and in general the lectures were very disconnected from psets and exams. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Very interacts and hands-on approach to learning econometrics

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This course is structured quite badly, there is a huge disconnect between the material taught in class and what is actually asked on the problem sets and exams. This is especially true for the problem sets. The sections were also extremely unhelpful as they were structured pretty badly, especially when section in the first half of the semester was just going over the last weeks problem set. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The professor is a really clear lecturer, but this is one of those classes where what's taught in lecture often has little to do with section and the problem sets. The class felt a bit disjointed for that reason. I also believe the professor should narrow the range of subjects on the syllabus -- I would have preferred going deeper into the foundations of econometrics rather than getting a whirlwind tour of machine learning. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Interesting lectures

Weaknesses: Lecture slides could be clearer; test questions were a little open ended and could be more well-thought out (it is unclear exactly what information to include to get full marks) <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A big strength was that the professor and TA were kind and reachable. Both responded to emails quickly to student concerns. In the middle of the course, additional support networks were also created (study groups, Piazza), which was also a strength. Another big strength of the course was the workload; I felt like the psets, while difficult, were well spread out over the semester and the course was designed to not be comprised of busywork but rather a few meaningful assignments. Finally, another strength of the course was that it emphasized important concepts and techniques in econometrics that I believe would be helpful for students to know.

I would say, though, that despite the above strengths, there are a few areas in which the course could be improved upon. First, the first part of the course on probability and statistics went by really quickly (~3-4 weeks) and I would recommend that more time is spent on those areas. I came into the course thinking that I would develop a solid foundation in probability and statistics but by the end, felt like my knowledge fell short, as the majority of the course was less focused probability and statistics but rather econometrics. Another recommendation I have for the course is for the section material to be more directly related to what we covered in class (perhaps a review of that week's concepts or practice problems). This would have helped me internalize the material better. Third, I wish that graded assignments would be returned faster to students; often times, it would be at least 3 weeks before we received our pset feedback back. This made it difficult to gauge how one was doing in the course. 

Finally, I really wish that there was a peer tutor for this course who would hold additional office hours. The course was really difficult and I would have appreciated having a third resource outside of the professor and the TA. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength: Lots of coding assignments, professor and TA very approachable and available for asking questions

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The lectures in this course are very organized and interesting. Prof. Narita utilizes case studies and past papers in order to show how concepts we are learning can be applied and used in research. This made the lectures super interesting and exciting.
Weaknesses: The PSETs were oftentimes much more difficult than shown in the lectures and included a lot of coding in R/Python. If you are not experienced in coding/data science, this makes the course incredibly difficult because the lectures only cover conceptual knowledge, but doesn't actually show you how to materially apply it in your psets. There wasn't much help on the coding portion in this course. Also, psets were graded very late so it was difficult to receive feedback and improve your grade until it was too late. <br/></div>
