<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â More often than not, especially with the homework prompts, I felt that this was more of an art course than an architecture course. I wish it was more analytical than abstract. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: you can get by just fine without doing any of the readings and the assignments were fun to do.

 Weaknesses: there is no grading system. I knew this going in but thought that they would at least give us clues about our standing. They did no such thing (even after the final project, they had nothing to say about where we stood in the class). This means that your TA's will have complete power of your grade and if you are not on their good side then there's no system that you can rely on to ensure that you are being judged based off of your work. Additionally, how this class is organized is that there are lectures and section meetings once a week. Each week, you do an assignment that's discussed in the section. This section is just a time where the TA's openly (and sometimes in a very disrespectful manner), criticize your work. I think this class can be improved by ensuring that these TA's have the appropriate training on giving feedback. Another aspect of this class that does not make sense is that the weekly assignments are completely unrelated to the material covered in lectures and to previous assignments. This means that each week, you start from scratch and figure out what you have to do, then get criticized for it in sections. This made no sense to me at all. They also say that they put improvement into consideration when grading the class and god forbid if you do well early on, you could possibly be doomed for the rest of the semester because you have set the standard too high. 

In terms of the lectures, they were mostly pictures of different beautiful architectural figures that the professor liked and talked about. We had zoom classes where they played a prerecorded video to us. Because of this, there was NO engagement in the class and their proposed solution to this lack of engagement was to force us all to have our videos on (and we would be marked as absent if we did not have them on throughout). I don't believe that policing us so closely (especially in these times where not everyone has the same access to wifi) was inappropriate. 

Now, onto the biggest weakness of the class, it was extremely American-centric, which is fine. In fact, we sometimes had references from places in South America and Europe as well which is great. However, each time these places were mentioned, the Professor would go deep into where each place is located whereas anytime we had pictures from places in Africa, they were mostly referred to as "somewhere in Africa." I thought this was extremely wrong and hope that it can be corrected for the future versions of this class. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The lectures truly could not be improved. Professor Purves is one of the most thoughtful, eloquent, and innovative thinkers I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. His approach to architecture really inspires his students to think deeply and question prior assumptions, whether or not they have any previous experience with architecture. 
Every week, students worked on their own drawings and design assignments and submitted them to be reviewed and discussed in section. The biggest weakness of this course was the lack of organization for sections and assignments. The TFs were working hard to do their best to communicate what they knew, but it was clear that assignments were not really planned in advance as much as they could be, and deadlines were not clear until they were much sooner than most classes. But the real issue is that we never received any sort of grades, certainly not by midterm, and not even now (weeks after our final assignment was due). Very late in the semester, right before finals, we got one progress report, but this was after an entire semester of weekly assignments that students all put an immense amount of work into, and they were never graded. We were told that we would hear from our TFs if we were "struggling" but that if not, we would not receive grades and should just trust that everything is fine. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Lectures, TA meetings were great, but the lectures felt loosely related to the drawing assignments, but still really enjoyed them. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course include the smaller section meetings with TAs, where you can receive personalized feedback. The only weaknesses of this class pertained to COVID-19 learning practices. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Very calm and interesting class. Material is very interesting and weekly assignments are not too difficult but challenging enough to require observation, creativity, and effort. Fantastic professor. Sections were easy to participate in. It would be great if students were able gauge their grade or progress throughout the course. Some weeks have a big amount of reading, though they are never discussed. Also, it would be nice to see the class look into more non-white and non-male architects. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course could be more clear on attendance policies and the general logistics on the syllabus. However, the class was wonderfully taught and we were encouraged to collaborate and do independent work. I loved having the opportunity to see the work of other students and I was constantly inspired by the lecture content. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The weekly sections were helpful in keeping track of the course and the professor's lectures were well-organized and thorough. 
Weaknesses: No grades were entered into Canvas throughout the entirety of the year, this made it very difficult to track your own grade which frankly is frustrating. The only way to get an inkling on your grades in the class was you would receive an email from a TF if your standing was getting low. Given that we had weekly assignments, it would be very nice to know how we were doing on these. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â All of the instructors and Teaching Assistants were very engaged with the course work and were able to provide ample critique and feedback.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I loved, loved, loved the lectures! The readings were great, though I wish we could have discussed them. Also, I didn't get a single grade back all semester, which was a little bit nerve-racking. And for all but the Plattus guest lectures, I wished we had just gotten more Prof. Purves. <br/></div>

Especially with the paper and the sketchbook flip-through-- we had no clue what was required until very close to the due dates which brought a lot of unnecessary stress and frustration. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength- our skills were based off the previous week which helped continuous growth. Weakness- final project wasnt related to anything all year <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course is basically everything about this course. Professor Purves is dedicated and enthusiastic to architecture, and he truly makes this class a top tier class. Another strength is the practice with looking at architecture and being able to take the details you learn about in lecture and putting them to paper. I really enjoyed the artistic assignments of the sketchbook assignments and design projects. The curriculum is very well thought out, and truly flows together nicely. The only weakness of this course may be the variety of assistance between the TF's. Some TF's helped cultivate students more than others: I wish I got more guidance from my TF's personally. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was structured and organized very well. Alec is a wonderful professor, as his lectures were always interesting. The sketch assignments and design problems were also very fun to work on! However, when it comes to section, I wish students received more direct feedback and critique. I felt as if I never really knew what areas I should have been improving on, which was frustrating for each successive sketch assignment. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Purves is one the greatest strengths of this course. It is a great opportunity to learn from a thoughtful and experienced architect who has traveled the world and uses all his photographs in the lecture. I also think the drawing assignments are a great way for you to learn how to represent architecture on a page by hand, or practice/improve on drawing skills you may already have. <br/></div>
