<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: There was a lot of support and understanding from the Professor and the TA for students.
Weaknesses: The lectures moved a little slow and it was hard to stay engaged. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â In terms of strengths, I thought that the biweekly lectures were very engaging. It was clear that the professor was very invested in the class and in us as students, and that made the classes more fun and interesting. She made a very strong effort to ensure that we were learning about topics that interested us, instead of just following what was in the textbook. I thought the syllabus structure was good and that it was better to have the easier topics towards the end of the semester, when students had a lot of assignments due for other classes. I also really liked having midterm and final projects rather than exams - it encouraged students to do in-depth research into specific topics rather than brute-force memorizing a bunch of stuff and forgetting it right after the exam. For weaknesses, we definitely had more total class time than we should have because the lectures were often quite long. I don't think the lectures should have been shorter, because it would have been impossible to fit in all the material, but I often felt like we had an extra 45 minutes of class a week, which is not what anyone signed up for. Even though the textbook readings were generally helpful, a lot of times they just repeated what the professor said in lecture. I'm not sure it was necessary to have quite as many textbook readings as we often did. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strength is Professor Bowern genuinely one of the nicest professors I've had. She went out of her way to make herself accessible and switched to a form of grading that would be more accessible in an online format. She seemed to understand the stresses of the pandemic period and was extremely kind with deadlines, help, grading, and engagement. I would recommend this course just for her. Weakness: No major ones but the biweekly section-like classes were a little disorganized. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â This is a good survey course that introduces many different kinds of linguistics without being confusing or overwhelming and the textbook is well-chosen. I liked Professor Bowern's use of Slack, various videos, and guest lectures to enrich our learning experience. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought this course was exceptionally well thought out and organized! Professor Bowern went above and beyond, getting the lectures up the weekend before we were supposed to watch them. She had so many opportunities to chat with her, both over zooms, emails, and in slack, as did our TF Marisha. Psets were clearly explained and synced up well with what we learned in class. Sometimes they were even fun, given how different linguistics analysis is from many of my other classes. Although I bet this course would have been even better in person, this was a relatively good course to take online because I could pause pre-recording lectures to shout out whatever random examples we were discussing.

Only weakness: I wish we'd spent less time on phonetics and more time on phonology, but this is such a minor change. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths:
- I really liked that we covered a lot of different topics. Even though this meant that we couldn't spend much time on each, it still helped me form a better understanding of what linguistics is.

Weaknesses:
- I thought the discussion sessions were not always productive. In some of them, we spent the first half of the session (or even more) talking about less essential things such as reviewing the previous problem set before jumping to the discussion. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the projects were a huge strength of the course; rather than an exam for which students would just memorize information, the projects allowed us to actually apply everything we knew to a language of our choice. Professor Bowern is also a huge strength and a phenomenal and understanding instructor. The only weakness I can think of is the time spent on phonetics, which I think could have been increased, but I think this is partly due to circumstances of this year and it would have been much easier had the class been in person. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Generally this course was taught very well. The project based nature of the class felt like a great way to apply our knowledge (although I know historically it is a exam based course. COVID would not allow for that). Sometimes the content felt like just saying things (I don't really know how to describe it but specifically the brain section of the class didn't feel as engaging as other sections). Overall though, it is a well taught class with a lot of interesting content to absorb. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Midterm and final were projects rather than exams so you can focus on how the class content applies to a language you choose. Problem sets stuck pretty closely to lecture and textbook content and rarely had curveballs.
Weaknesses: Attempts to construct opportunities for virtual social interactions through "study groups" were awkward and forced. <br/></div>
</div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course was very flexible with a manageable workload. The recorded lectures were easy to review at any pace, and the discussion sections were good opportunities to ask questions about the readings and expand on subjects from the lecture material. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â A strength was the vast array of topics we were able to delve into each week. On the flip side of that, a weakness was that we could not dive as deep as I would have liked to in some topics. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I just had a really rough time with the online aspect of this class. I did a lot better in other classes, but the recorded, asynchronous part made me feel very detached from the class. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: The midterm and final projects were designed well to push us outside of our comfort zone and analyze a foreign language of our choice on the basis of various linguistic features (e.g., phonology, writing system)

Weaknesses: Would be nice to do more practice exercises during the live lectures so that we're better prepared for the psets. Professor Bowern started doing this during the second half of the semester, and I think a lot of us found it helpful. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I thought the course was very approachable for a beginner, the instructors were kind and helpful, and the material was very interesting. I thought the recorded lectures were clear in their presentation and matched the readings. I enjoyed the problem sets, which were helpful for reviewing the content but generally not

In my opinion, the live sessions felt less useful than the recorded lectures, with relatively low information-density. I also felt like the course could have been slightly more technical and rigorous while still being an accessible introduction to linguistics. Lastly, I didn't think the project format for the midterm and final was particularly useful for reinforcing the material. I thought it was a great way to learn about world languages, but I felt like we weren't really applying the information we learned (and probably could have completed most of the assignment without having even taken the class). However, I do appreciate that this was trying to adapt to remote-learning, and the class usually has conventional exams (which not everyone prefers!) <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: the instructors (Professor Bowern and Marisha) were clearly very passionate about the subject, and I liked how they incorporated their current interests/research into the course. The problem sets weren't too demanding and helped reinforced what we had learned during lectures. Weaknesses: The live lectures were hard to engage with at times and not all of the activities we did during lecture were helpful for learning the material. That said, Professor Bowern provided us an opportunity to give feedback early on in the course and incorporated our suggestions to make the course more engaging. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course covered a broad range of topics and engaged with students' individual questions and interests about the topics covered. The midterm and final project were a good opportunity to use the different concepts we had learned and make connections between them to analyze a language of our choice, and to explore larger themes and trends between multiple languages, including learning from the research of our classmates. Including even more examples throughout the course of linguistics research or connections to daily life may be helpful. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The broad scope of this class is fantastic. As a complete beginner, it gave me a great overview of the subject. The class is ideal for determining whether you want to pursue further studies in linguistics, and if so, which type of classes you would enjoy in the future. It was also enjoyable if you are just looking for some cool social credit. Professor Bowern is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful; her expertise in Bardi, language change and revitalization, and the Voynich manuscript add extra depth to the class. I wish I would have asked more questions. The midterm and final projects were very fun, allowing me to implement what we learned during the semester on a specific language and then analyze the results of our typological survey.
Personally, the asynchronous nature of the class was less preferable. I found myself enjoying the discussion sessions more since they were more engaging and helped practice the analysis tools we used on psets. I also wish we spent some more time on syntax (with more in-class practice).
But overall, this was a very enjoyable class and I learned a lot. <br/></div>
