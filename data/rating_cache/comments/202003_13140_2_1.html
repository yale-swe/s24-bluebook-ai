<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths were that the assignments were fun, the lectures were engaging, the costume parties were amazing, and I felt very supported. I only wish that it had been in person :( <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths - Professor Feimster is an amazing lecturer and captivates the attention of students as well as finds way to engage students even remotely
Weakness - Not much direction for assignments <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Could be improved by shortening the readings or only having one reading. because there isnt a midterm or final, there are not many incentives to read. 

Strength was the engaging lectures. I loved the themes every Wednesday and the professors' high energy level and kind spirit. I also liked the eyes on the prize movies, and the letter assignments. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strength for me was the depth of the material we learned. I felt like I got to know so many civil rights activists and organizations closely through Professor Feimster's talks and the readings. I also enjoyed the different formats of assessments, which ranged from letters to zines to podcasts to reading analysis. I always got to use my mind in different ways for the assessments, and I learned how to present information in different formats while still getting the themes/story I want to show across. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: good content which makes the lectures engaging, focuses on individual activists (by the end of this course I had a pretty good grip on a wide range of activists), caring and knowledgeable professor, readings are manageable and very interesting, assignments are fun (especially the midterm zine we created)

Weaknesses: none that I can think of! <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Feimster is an amazing and engaging lecturer. The readings and discussion sections were helpful for interacting with the material in the course. The assignments were fun, creative, and used materials we learned in class in a different way. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: incredibly engaging lecture, creative assignments that were fun to complete, connection to present-day was made clear 
Weaknesses: none; I loved the course! <br/></div>

<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Feimster is such a charismatic, caring, and fun instructor. The readings were my favorite readings of any of my classes this semester (even in comparison to three other history classes I took this semester!). The assignments (letters, zine, podcast) were manageable and creative.  

Weakness: I think the only weakness is that the topic covers so much, so I feel that there is a lot I dont know about the Civil Rights Movement. But I dont think its the fault of the course itselfrather, the more you learn, the more you dont know! <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â I liked being able to attend one live lecture a week. The assignments were enjoyable and I liked that there were no exams to cram for. However, I felt the readings were a little too much some weeks. <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths- 
Professor Feimster's personality, teaching style, and ability to lecture in an engaging almost story-telling way
Creative projects in place of midterms or finals which are just as educational
Interesting readings/course materials and manageable workload allow you to spend more time learning, less time stressing

Weaknesses- 
Readings could have related more to lecture material, but usually section took on the role of explaining connection and significance <br/></div>

<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Great lectures, but honestly could use more specificity. I felt like sometimes the information in lectures was very vague. <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: really passionate instructor and TFs! All of the TFs were super engaged and were all extremely knowledgeable in different areas of Black Studies. Professor Feimster genuinely cared for her students and TFs and continually tried to engage her students in virtual lecture by holding theme days (Pajama Day, Yale Spirit Day, Hat Day, etc.). She's a fantastic storyteller and lectures were always very illuminating. Another strength is the workload and difficulty of the class; I never felt overburdened by the class and it was clear that Professor Feimster's priority was to have her students learn and be motivated to take action. 
One weakness, if I had to nitpick, is that sections sometimes felt like a regurgitation of the readings' information and there were days when discussions felt like everyone kept agreeing with each other. This wasn't a super frequent occurrence, and was sometimes justifiable (eg. the section the day after Election Day). <br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Dr. Feimster is amazing! Such an engaging lecturer and a super approachable, welcoming and encouraging presence. The material in this class was incredibly interesting. In my four years at Yale, this is one of few classes where I feel I genuinely learned something new every week. I also loved that we spoke about a lot of Civil Rights figures my large, underfunded public high school had never even introduced me to. As a STEM major who had never really taken an AFAM course, I was afraid this course would be hard for me to follow. However, it turned out to be the perfect pace and rigor. It's not a super slow course, but at the same time it is a survey that assumes no prior knowledge and is accessible for everyone. Workload is quite light -- and the work you do do is actually interesting. My TA was absolutely incredible. That made for great sections -- often better than the lecture itself. I also loved the assignment structure. It was great having a deviation from the traditional paper writing format. In particular, I enjoyed making the podcast. I researched Gordon Parks who was such an incredibly accomplished photographer, director, author and more.

Weaknesses: The readings were very long at times. As a result, you could tell most people hadn't read in section and that led to less riveting conversations. Lectures slides could be better organized. Some slides literally just had a name while others had so many words you couldn't even read them all. Lastly, clearer feedback/expectations on assignments would be nice. Most of us didn't know our first letter needed to have an argument. After that first letter, we were able to fix that issue. <br/></div>

<div class="question" id="Q0" style="width: 94.2%;">
<div id="answer" style="float: left; min-height: 10em; width: 100%; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: solid 0px;  border-color: #000000">
<b></b>
<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Professor Feimster is an incredible lecturer; even though I had to watch the recorded lectures, she brought so much energy and enthusiasm to each class. I also think that the course was organized and paced really well, and it was nice to have various projects that weren't just research papers. You also get a mix of assigned readings and documentaries to watch, so the weekly workload was very reasonable. Can't think of any weaknesses except that it might have been nice to receive multiple options for the final project because creating and editing a podcast with little to no background experience was harder than I thought. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Micah was a fantastic TF! She did a great job leading discussion during our sections--she always posed interesting questions that helped us critically engage with the readings and rethink our prior assumptions about the civil rights movement. I also think that Prof. Feimster was really kind and caring towards all of us as students, even in a virtual setting. I really appreciated that for this semester, and it definitely helped improve engagement with the course.  

I really would have appreciated fewer documentaries. Please. Watching virtual lectures + having to watch recorded documentaries was too much, especially because Prof. Feimster sometimes replaced readings with documentaries. I would have appreciated it if we could have kept the readings instead of the documentaries, and I also think it would have been great if some/all of the readings could have been available as a printed course packet for us to buy (while also still being available online for students for whom that isn't accessible!). During the virtual semester, it was REALLY helpful when I could step away from the screen and read a paper book for class. Idk if other students will agree with this, but that's my take. 

I thought it was a little strange that this course argued against the personalization of the civil rights movement (focusing too heavily on individual activists, such as Martin Luther King, Jr.), but that most of our assignments were about specific people. Sometimes I wondered if the focus on individual people was a little constraining and if we could have learned more about the movement as a whole if we looked more broadly and had more readings that tried to give overviews or analyses of specific organizations/themes without becoming biographical. Somewhat relatedly, I thought some of the readings were good at giving background and helping us understand the movement during a certain period of time, or with regards to a specific theme. (I remember the Charles Payne and the Peniel Joseph reading being really good for this.) But some of the readings were less helpful in this respect. I think this course could be strengthened by replacing a few of the readings that were very specific. 

I also think that this course had a lot of assignments for one semester: three 600-800 word letters, a zine, and a podcast. Instead of 5 short assignments, I think I would have preferred rolling two of those together into a slightly larger/longer assignment. Also, I liked the idea of having the final assignment be something creative, but I would have appreciated it if we could have chosen between making a podcast and something else. Maybe that would also give some variety for the TFs who have to grade the final projects! <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: Professor Feimster brought so much warmth, passion, creativity, friendliness, and expertise to class! Her actions showed how much she cares for all her students, and I liked that each class started with a song or other art or video clip. The themes of sexism, labor organizing, grassroots activism, respectability politics etc were prominently woven throughout lectures, readings, and projects. I also really liked how the projects (3 letters, a zine, and a final project) were not like typical classes with reading responses and papers; the projects all ended up being pretty low stress for me at least. This let me think about expressing whatever I wanted to focus on through less academic routes.

Weaknesses: I guess I knew more about the civil rights movement going in than I thought I did or something? She sold it as if this course would change everything we knew, and while I certainly learned new things, I wouldn't say it really went that far. I just wish she went a bit deeper at some points. We also kind of stalled out pretty close to the classical phase of the civil rights movement -- we got a little bit into the 70's, but I wish we'd spent more time in class on the ramifications of the movement. After this class, I don't feel I have a great answer to "when did the long civil rights movement end?" at all. It also might have been cool to have more choice in some of the projects and at least one be less biographical -- I still think she could ask us to keep them focused on a single event or town or something, but focusing on single figures did get a little old by the end. <br/></div>

However, I wish the powerpoints were slightly clearer. There was often a lot of text on them, so it was hard to pick out important points, and it was also hard to read that much text while listening to the lecture. There were also points that weren't included in the powerpoint, so I think refining the slides so they expressed the main ideas would be really helpful. There were also one or two weeks where the readings were too long, but overall they were very reasonable. Also making it slightly clearer when we were transitioning topics in the lecture. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The strengths of this course are the pedagogy, course organization, and teaching charisma of Professor Feimster and the Teaching Fellows. Prof Feimster and the TFs create a welcoming and intellectually vigorous learning environment in which students from a broad range of comfort levels can come together to discuss social justice. It is a rare blessing to find yourself in a class environment like this (especially on Zoom) and the interpersonal and intellectual growth was tremendous. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: I loved the creative assignments and I found the readings to be absolutely generative. Prof. Feimster has a wonderful personality and the material she taught is essential for anyone who hopes to understand American politics, past and present. Weaknesses: Due to the circumstances of remote learning, Prof. Feimster changed the syllabus (readings and course format) twice on the fly. The changes she made enhanced our learning experience but made for a somewhat disorganized semester. The pacing of the course was a bit off, the lectures did not always correspond with the readings, and I sometimes lost track of where we were going with the class and why. I do think all of those issues were specific to the challenges of teaching and learning amid COVID. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Overall, a fantastic course. My only real complaint was that the lectures/assignments/readings were not always correlated. For example we would talk about Ella Baker in lecture one week and then do a reading about her in another week and an assignment another week. This didn't always negatively impact my learning, but it was hard to keep track of the chronology sometimes. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: breadth, creativity of assignment formats (letters, podcast, zine) which allow you to communicate your research and learning to a wider audience, fascinating and interesting themes looking at leftist politics, gender politics, and more within the Black freedom struggle, professor Feimster was knowledgeable, engaging, enthusiastic and compassionate
Weaknesses: None, although the Zoom lecture format made it slightly harder to talk with Professor Feimster <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Crystal Feimster is an incredible lecturer. I appreciated that the assignments were geared towards conveying information to others rather than just exams and academic essays. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The readings are well curated and interesting. The professor and TFs were knowledgeable and approachable. A strength and weakness, depending on the student, of the course was that the assessments were often untraditional and more reminiscent of high school assignments than college ones. That can be good for a student who needs a break from the paper-exam cycle, but can also often lead to unclear expectations and can inadvertently incentivize sloppy work. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Strengths: super engaging and organized with interesting assignments. Amazing prof/TFs.

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â Although the lectures contained interesting information, it felt like the readings were not always connected to the lectures and the lectures not always connected to the assignments. I think section was the strongest part of the course, where we got to dive into material in a smaller setting. That being said, some weeks there was so much reading that in order to really analyze a piece we would only get to talk about 1/4 of the readings in section. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â One strength of this course was Professor Feimster. She is an incredibly knowledgeable and engaging lecturer and excited about teaching the course. Another strength was the mix of films/documentaries plus readings which allowed us to learn the material in different ways. Finally, the assignments (letters, zine, and podcast) were more original than typical papers and exams and more creative and fun to do. There was also an extra credit opportunity where we got to listen to interesting and engaging conversations and write a short reflection. 

A weakness of this course was that lectures sometimes went too fast or felt rushed in order to fit a lot of material into a short period of time. 

In terms of improvement, I think having a summary or highlighting the key words/ideas/people at the beginning or end of lecture would be helpful to guide us so we know what to pay most attention to and not feel overwhelmed. My TF, for example, had guiding questions for the weekly readings which were helpful. So I think doing something similar for lecture would also be beneficial. <br/></div>

<div id="text" style="width: 655px; height: 100%;">Â The course is perfectly designed, every aspect is well-curated for learning. From the professor's lectures to the sections with the TFs. Additionally, the assignments make you think about the different aspects of the civil rights movement and force you to examine people that are often neglected in the classical telling. This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. <br/></div>
