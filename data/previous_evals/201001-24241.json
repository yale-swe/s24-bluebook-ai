    "The pure joy of seeing a show every week starts to wane after too many middle-of-the-road shows and tedious class conversations. The best aspect by far is the review-writing practice, and getting feedback with a focus towards applying those skills to academic writing, but be aware that it's not a WR credit. Look for a more coherent syllabus before signing up for this...",
    "This course is an amazing opportunity to experience theatre-going in London. Due to the high frequency of play-watching, you get a feel for both what goes on in producing a show and for review-writing. You watch a number of different kinds of shows, which gives a diverse view of the London theatre world, and watching the shows is more or less enjoyable. However, discussing the plays or writing about them with very much knowledge is sometimes difficult because often all you know about the plays are what you gather from watching them, because you don't read the plays before watching them, usually. Also, sometimes it was unclear whether the course was more of a theatre review-writing class or a theatre discussion class (it was supposed to be more oriented toward review-writing). Overall, though, the course is a great experience.",
    "The London Stage offers an amazing opportunity to immerse yourself in London's theater and to master the technique of writing a theater review. The seminar component of the class is interesting, though not academically rigorous, but the chance to see this much top quality theater is what really makes this course worth taking.",
    "You see 1 play a week and write a review about it. In class you discuss the play you just saw. At the end of the semester you do a final project.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is a great opportunity to see and discuss a lot of theatre and to get class credit for something that is fun enough to be a hobby. It is quite different than other Yale theatre classes, however, in terms of focus and does not delve as deeply into the plays. It also tend to be very historically focused in terms of the ways the plays are approached."
