    "If the student will be working with Stem Cells I would recommend the course because it gives a clear overview of the field and introduces classic as well as current research through the assigned readings.",
    "I would recommend this to only those wishing to partake in stem cell research.",
    "Stem cells was informative, but engaging enough, so I'm not sure that I would recommend it. It provided an overview of stem cells but there were no real assignments until the final exam which did not provide a good basis for acquiring a general knowledge.",
    "workload is pretty minimal but might not be super engaging",
    "It is a course on stem cell research and application which provides basic knowledge and core concepts in the current field. It is broken up into lectures focusing on each sub-fields of stem cell research including clinical applications. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to acquire more information on stem cell since the course is so comprehensive."

It also gives me examples of how some of the concepts canbe applied to clinical use. Some of the experimental design and methods will be useful in my own research as well."
