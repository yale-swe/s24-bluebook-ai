    "Great course! Discussion was definitely a bit frustrating at times, but the readings were well chosen and reasonable in terms of quantity. I'd say they were a worthwhile experience on their own. Don't let the syllabus fool you; although this is very much an introduction to the Frankfurt School, it is not a survey course. You may not come away from the course being able to name-drop some of the big shots, but the depth at which the course engages with the texts will push you to develop a very solid foundation for further reading. Naturally, you'll also develop a familiarity with the language and style of this fairly complex philosophical tradition. The best part of the course was without a doubt Professor Wetters, who demonstrated admirable (and at times baffling) levels of dedication and caring. He consistently held the class to high expectations, but never stopped being kind, accommodating and encouraging. I especially valued how he was never condescending. Do not underestimate the difference that having a professor so invested in your growth as a thinker and a writer can make in your experience of a course like this, particularly as an undergrad."
