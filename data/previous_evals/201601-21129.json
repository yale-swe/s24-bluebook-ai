   "comments": [
    "Not a great class, because the material is interesting but not presented in the best way it could be.",
    "Easy class made difficult by lack of organization and superficial specificity at times. Every moment is hit or miss with a fairly large variance. A good Cr\/d that can be easy if you are lucky.",
    "yes - take it",
    "Extremely interesting.",
    "Reasonably interesting lectures, exams are specific but not unfair. Learned a lot of neat tidbits.",
    "recommend as a relaxed but informative fifth class",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. (But don't take it if you're looking for an easy grade-- you won't get anything out of it and you'll find it's much harder than you expected.)",
    "I wouldn't really recommend this class. While lectures were interesting, there was little structure to the actual content covered and when it came to exam time it felt like an absolute crapshoot when choosing what to study. A midterm and a final being the only two graded assignments gives little wiggle room for a blunder of an exam, and I personally struggled to pinpoint the important concepts and examples relevant to the exams due to the scattered, broad lectures.",
    "don't take it",
    "yes, definitely take this. I recommend credit\/d-ing the class (which I did not), as there are only 2 exams, and it can be hard to figure out what you need to know from lecture.",
    "Wouldn't recommend...very little work, just a midterm and a final, but very hard to follow and he cold calls on people",
    "One of the best classes that I've taken at Yale, and I would highly recommend this to another student. Specifically, the emphasis on this course on the technology that drives strategy and decisionmaking is a focus that I feel is very much needed (and lacking) in the courses that I've taken at Yalemuch imagination has been lost regarding how technology can shift a strategic landscape. This course brings it all together. Professor Bracken has done a wonderful job of integrating seemingly disparate topics into a cohesive, impactful class that will change the way you think about grand strategy. Perfect course for anyone looking into government\/business\/etc. Truly a wonderful opportunityif you get in, take the course.",
    "It is a great introduction to political science and a bit on business. If you need to take it it is some work but not too much.",
    "Dont take it",
    "Interesting class, a lot of information. Overall very facinating",
    "Not a gut, whatever they say. Pay attention",
    "Good course for anyone interested in Strategy, Technology and\/or War or the intersections of each.",
    "This class wasn't terrible, but also wasn't great. If you're looking for a straightforward class, this is the one, but don't think it's going to blow your mind or be a gut.",
    "This is a great course if you are interested in the material. If you come to class every day and listen closely to Professor Bracken while taking basic notes, you'll learn a lot about technology's role in strategy and war theory. Make sure to focus on terminology and key details in his lectures, and you'll get a lot out of what he has to say and do fine on the exams.",
    "I would recommend this course. Bracken does a great job impressing on his students the magnitude, importance, and complexity of challenges faced by domestic and foreign leaders. I had never thought much about grand strategy or nuclear strategy before, but this course made it tractable and fascinating. You should attend the lectures. They're real interesting. In addition, this course required almost no work. Readings for every lecture (do you do those? I don't do those.), midterm and final exams. That's it. You should know, however, that the exams are not easy to study for. Bracken gives no study guide and little indication of what will be on the exams."
