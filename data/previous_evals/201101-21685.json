    "Don't take it unless you've got to, or want a shitty overview of literary theory.",
    "Ew no. If you're not a literature major, don't bother wasting a credit on Haun Saussy's random selections of \"literary theory,\" history, and whatever else he chooses to put on the literary smorgasbord that was our syllabus. There is an upside to this class, though \u0097 the grading policy. Since 70 percent of the grade is based on quizzes (passage identification and commentary, 20 min. max), it's easy to do well as long as you skim the readings and have a good idea of what's going on.",
    "Definitely. Feel like it should be required to graduate from Yale.",
    "Yes, a very interesting course. Literature theory should be a part of every Yale education.",
    "Easy class--probably just for the Lit majors who have to take it, though.WORKLOAD:--> 7 quizzes (we ended up only having 6), 10% each, on easy, review-ish type topics (like, a quote from a reading that we talked about it in class; even if you don't do the reading, or come to class, most of the quiz questions are easy to B.S.);--> weekly-ish section (really chill, not a big deal), 10% of the grade; and--> one final paper, 10-15 pages (on flexible topics; pretty easy to choose something that you're comfortable writing about or that you can just look up on the internet), 20% of the grade.Even though you don't really have to go to class except when there's a quiz, Prof. Saussy's lectures are usually pretty entertaining. He has an interesting voice and he makes an effort not to be boring. Also, he's really nice.",
    "If you plan on studying any kind of literature in depth, you should take this class. The work is minimal--seven short quizzes and a paper at the end--and the lectures are engaging. Make sure to do the reading or you won't get as much out of it. I would definitely recommend this class for the syllabus and theteaching team.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you are interested in learning about these theorists on a deeper level, whether that be by taking more in depth courses beyond this one, or by reading and exploring on your own. While it does provide a base understanding of a broad range of theorists in the 20th century, the course lacks the structure to really explore these theorists in depth, and I do not think this basic understanding would be that useful to anyone on its own. The experience you receive from this class varies tremendously depending on the amount of work you put in, and it does not seem worth it unless you are willing to put in a considerable amount of work.",
    "I would recommend this class to any other student. Keep in mind that this class entails the historical philosophy of books, so it doesn't necessarily mean that you would like this class if you like Englishs. But literary theory is so essential to the art of reading.",
    "Interesting stuff at times but it can get pretty dry... take it if you need to or if you really enjoy gettin' theoretical. The 7 quizzes were easy if you did most of the reading and came to class.",
    "Take it -- don't listen to negative opinions about Saussy, he presents the material in avery accessible way and teaches it very well. The class is a lot of fun and will change your reading forever. Take it take it take it.",
    "Reasonably good overarching survey of many schools of literary criticism, although as with many survey courses, it often felt like the material didn't hang together. If you pay attention and do the reading, you learn a lot of important tidbits, but it's unclear what the whole picture is. Make sure you go to lecture though, as a lot of the reading is dense, while the takeaway points are few and far between. The quizzes were a good idea, as they forced you to read the material carefully and remember the articles' main points, but because they were worth so much, messing up on just one quiz could significantly affect your grade (as I suspect it did to mine). Overall, not a terribly thrilling course, but not as awful as some of the other reviews make it out to be. Not sure I would have taken it if I weren't a Lit major, but if you're interested in reading some of most foundational texts in lit crit, you should take this class.",
    "Yes, great course!",
    "A good overview of Literary Theory. Not, however, necessarily a good overview of methods of literary criticism. Be careful what you expect.",
    "I would recommend LIt 300 to everyone, especially people who love literature. The material in this class is necessary foundational material for anyone who is studying literature or modernity.",
    "I would recommend this course to those in the literature major otherwise one might find this type of course boring and just heavy reading. But I liked it a lot!"
