    "I haven't studied the post-communist region through a theoretical approach before, but only through a historical approach. This course was quite helpful in synthesizing some of the political theories I learned in my undergraduate career and using them to gain valuable insight in the region.",
    "This course was invaluable in understanding the evolution of Post-soviet studies in political science. A well-designed course with a reading list that I am ever thankful for, Hanson offered useful insights into current and past debates about area studies, rational choice theory, institutionalism, and more."

    "The syllabus was very organized and the readings each week were very informative and led to some great class discussions. I would have perhaps preferred to focus on maybe Central Asia or the Visegrad countries more, but I understand that time was a definite hindrance.",
    "A longer final paper with the chance to workshop ideas in class would have made the final output of the class more relevant to doctoral students' ongoing research."
