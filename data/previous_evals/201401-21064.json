   "comments": [
    "This course is an excellent way to learn about the ideals and themes that shaped the US into a global power. Take if you are more interested in conceptual history, than specific facts.",
    "Yes, I definitely would recommend it to anyone interested in international history.",
    "Prof. Cohrs is a hidden gem within the history department - brilliant, kind, and a great seminar leader. I would wholeheartedly recommend this class, or anything else he teaches! In terms of workload, I found this class pretty fair. The readings varied in length from week to week, but were always of a reasonable length. The long paper at the end was kind of killer if done last-minute (as I did), but still a rewarding experience.",
    "I would recommend if you are truly interested in EUROPEAN international relations - there is little American focus in the readings.",
    "A survey course of the diplomatic history of the West over the long nineteenth century (1776-1918). Heavy focus on European history. Deceptively light focus on America.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn a huge amount of material in a very well structured manner. The readings were typical of a history seminar: 100-200 pages per week, which was substantial, but relevant and interesting. Discussions were productive and enlightening without being intimidating. Professor Cohrs is very erudite, kind, and humorous--it was a joy to study with him. Overall, an excellent class. It has taught me lots of valuable things.",
    "Good and informative. Be prepared for lots of reading especially primary sources.",
    "If you'd like to gain a comprehensive understanding of the formation of world order throughout history, take this course. It was very fruitful for me, and I am sure that it will be invaluable for anyone interested in international and diplomatic history.",
    "Interesting seminar with a great professor about an important time period.",
    "Yes! Though only if you're pretty interested in the subject, and want to know the larger picture of the 19th century."
