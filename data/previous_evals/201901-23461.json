    "Knowledge of individual instruments' limitations, strengths, and special techniques. More importantly, practice with orchestrating and composing works of my own.",
    "This course was a great introduction to writing for orchestra and orchestral instruments. The course taught idiomatic techniques for different instruments, and also taught the useful skill of how to realize a score in a DAW with software instruments.",
    "-instrument properties -orchestration practice -Scoring, mixing and mastering in Logic -scoring to visual media -adapting piano scores to orchestras",
    "I learned how to orchestrate with many different instruments.",
    "This course helped us to learn how to write idiomatically for each section of a typical orchestra, as well as how to orchestrate small ensemble pieces into larger versions. In addition, we learned how to work with music software, particularly Logic Pro.",
    "Orchestration skills improved, learned more about individual instruments.",
    "This course did an incredible job developing my orchestration and composition skills, specifically in making me feel more comfortable with an area that I was nervous to explore. I became more comfortable composing for large ensembles as well as notating for and using a variety of different instruments."

   "comments": [
    "This course is great because it is so project based. The best way to learn orchestration is obviously by doing it. Moreover, the small group discussions during labs are really beneficial. However, I think that the first project in particular, the Bartok duo, was too boring and not fun at all. The lack of freedom and choice of a boring pizzicato duo means that I didn't fully engage with the course when completing the project. Not until later did I invest more of my time and best effort into that course. I think there was a lot of work to be done on projects at the end of the year, but not enough work on projects at the beginning. Perhaps assigning one more project at the beginning of the semester would keep students busier orchestrating.",
    "The course was great, though it could have been helpful to add some more score study to it.",
    "-well-structured & informative -scoring projects were very helpful -homework occasionally felt like busywork",
    "This course did an excellent job of starting off small and gradually increasing the complexity of assignments by the end to the point where it was quite amazing seeing the work everyone was capable of doing for the last couple projects of the semester. I really loved learning something about a particular section of the orchestra in one week and immediately getting the chance to incorporate it into the next assignment.",
    "The material was a little too similar to what is covered in MUSI 320\/420. Since those classes weren't a prerequisite, I felt like I was repeating a lot of material.",
    "The strengths of this course were exciting orchestration projects, attentive instructors that gave very helpful advice, and the student presentations that allowed us to connect and praise each other. If I would change something, I would like for there to be more activities that encourage interaction between students."

    "This is a great course to get familiar with the orchestra and orchestral instruments, and to learn to work with software instruments in a DAW. It's as much work as you are willing to put into it, which means you can get a lot out of it if you put in the work. Highly recommended!",
    "-yes -great practice for anyone that wants to write for real instruments",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in orchestrating and\/or composing, and to anyone who wants to gain a greater understanding of how orchestral music functions.",
    "I would recommend this course as a good middle ground between theory and creative expression.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students interested in composition. It is very important for people interested in composition to understand how to write for many different instruments, and this course forces you to do just that."
