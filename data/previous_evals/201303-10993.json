    "Boring lecture. Difficult material that you must learn on your own.",
    "If you have a 5 on both parts of the AP Physics C exam, take this course. It starts out easy, but it can be fairly hard by the end of the semester. Charles Baltay is an entertaining lecturer, and the homework is not too time consuming. Math 230 is definitely not a corequisite for this class.",
    "Baltay is extremely knowledgable about the subject matter and highly intelligent, but this could be to a fault; he is somewhat unfamiliar with the knowledge level of the students who take his classand thus with how to pace his class to maximum effectiveness.The problem sets are of nice length and difficulty, though, and the exams are fair and well curved. Take it if you meet the prerequisites (which should really be math 120, not math 230). It definitely keeps you out of busy work which seems to plague the other physics classes, and you hit some genuinely interesting topics.",
    "Excellent class. Take it if you did AP Physics C in high school, or even just AP Physics B and you like physics.",
    "This class requires consistent work, but the weekly problem sets are not ridiculously difficult.",
    "Physics 260 is a solid introductory lecture course for those who have already seen calculus-based mechanics and E&M before, and are comfortable with basic multivariable calculus. If you have the background and are going to take an introductory physics course, you should definitely pick this one. (For more about what counts as adequate preparation for this course, see the end of this review.)Baltay's goals in teaching 260\/261 are, as he explained to us on the first day of the class, 1) to get promising physics students excited about the science, and 2) to expose us to topics we will cover in more depth in later physics courses. These two goals frame the structure and style of the course, and I found this to be a good thing. As per the first goal, Baltay wants to get to the \"good stuff\"--e.g. general relativity, relativistic electrodynamics, quantum mechanics--and so 260 is more or less devoted to rapidly covering the contents of a more typical intro class to make room for the goodies in 261 (see goodies above). He is able to assume that the majority of students are comfortable with basic mechanics and E&M, which helps with this aim: this semester, we whipped through mechanics, did a cursory overview of Lagrangians and special relativity, and blazed through E&M. It's a good clip, but the course is well-organized and executed, so you won't always realize how much you're learning (i.e. you don't feel overwhelmed), and this speaks to Baltay's quality as a lucid lecturer. One result of this pacing is that the class focuses more on concepts and breadth than difficult problem solving. Unlike Physics 200, which subjects students to lengthy and unnecessarily demanding p-sets, Physics 260 opts to prime you to tackle the advanced topics when you study them in full in later courses. This means that Physics 260 is exactly what it's supposed to be: a really good introductory course, and not some nutty attempt to \"cover\" all of undergraduate physics in a year.Baltay, the man, the legend, is a pro--he doesn't mess around, and he's really good at explaining physics efficiently and tidily. Class consists entirely of him working through derivations on the chalkboard, and occasionally doing example problems. There aren't a lot of surprises from Baltay: he will refer to all weirdly shaped objects as \"ugly potatoes,\" he will always ask you \"Is this ok?,\" he will refer to all cars as VWs, he will always jump from telling you \"you'd better be comfortable with gauge theory\" to asking if you've ever seen a spring before, and you can sure as hell bet that he'll wear the same shirt and belt combination every day (the man is on a roll). For these reasons, he's a pretty entertaining guy if \"you dig\" his dry sense of humor, and he really is a good teacher and a nice man.Problem sets take 1-3 hours a week and the midterm was rather easy. Ideally, one should study the material as it is covered--it's easy to end up in a position where you need to cram for the exams.A word on the \"requisite\" background for this class. You'll be fine in the course if you've done either AP physics or multivariable calculus, even if you haven't seen both. If both the math and the physics are totally new, this course could be a lot. Baltay will try to scare people off on the first day of class, claiming that everyone will need to be able to solve partial differential equations or something ridiculous--this is wildly false. If you can do volume integrals and partial derivatives, or if you did AP physics and know single-variable calculus, you're set. You don't need Math 230 for this, trust me (but your quantitative soul needs it).",
    "Go for it. PHYS 260 is easy and fun! Prof. Baltay is the man! :) Also, if you haven't taken multivariable before, don't worry. Just take ENAS 151 \/ MATH 120 concurrently. If you are good learning certain things by yourself (either from Taylor \/ Gryffiths or math books), you will be just fine! :)",
    "Ugh. The problem with this class is that it's a mix of people who are way ahead of the curve and should have gone directly into 410 and people who are always trying to keep up with them (i.e everyone in Math 120 who learned what double integrals were half way through the class). So half the class is struggling and the other half is perpetually bored. Baltay is fine, but honestly nothing to write home about. I found, for example, that our TA who led the review sessions at the end of the term was much better than Baltay at explaining things.Honestly, if you're really good at physics, skip this class and go to 410. You'll do fine, and things will be easier both for you and for the people who really are at the level at which this course is taught.",
    "Physics 260 is a speedy review of high school mechanics and E&M with more rigorous math, as well as an intro to some higher-level physics. I would recommend this course to any student with the proper math and physics background (Math 230 is definitely not necessary, but a background in Multivariable Calculus would be extremely helpful). If you have this background, the course will not be too time-consuming for you, but if you don't, expect to put in a lot of time. Regardless, p-sets are fairly straightforward, and the exams are pretty fair. Also, Baltay's dry sense of humor makes the lecture entertaining.",
    "This class is very fast paced. You cover a lot of material very, very quickly - this semester we went over mechanics, E&M, and relativity. Both the work and the concepts you learn range from rather easy to extraordinarily difficult. I had only taken AP Physics B and was still able to get by, but I had to do a lot of work. If you've taken Physics C, the beginning of class will probably be more of a review for you, whereas it was completely new material for me. The midterm was surprisingly easy, and the final was terrifying (three of the problems were on concepts I don't even remember covering in class...). Baltay is an interesting and humorous teacher, and you do learn a lot, but you'll have to do a lot of work.",
    "The class is called intensive and it means it. The entirety of mechanics and E&M plus special relativity is covered in a single semester. If you aren't confident about your mastery of AP physics, this class is a crazy crash course that may go over your head. On the other hand, if you feel good about AP physics material, this is a great review of those concepts with some cool topics and derivations that you haven't seen yet. Either way, it is very important to keep up, since the class goes along at a relativistic velocity. A good pset study group is invaluable.",
    "Physics 260 is extremely challenging, but manageable. Unless you're a super physics whiz (and if you are, I'm not talking to you, you're probably already set on taking the class and good for you), 260 will be a stretch. If you like physics and want to push yourself, go for it. Don't be intimidated out of trying--there's a bit of a grace period with dropping down to 200, and since you're probably a freshman nothing you do now will make or break your academic career. Also, reach out to other people in the class. A lot of them are probably feeling the same way you are, and for me, having people to work through problems with when I didn't get it saved my butt over and over.If you're not interested in physics or looking to coast or just want a super low-pressure freshman year, this is not the course for you.",
    "I would recommend the class. I learnt a ton of physics.",
    "Take it! Even if you aren't in MATH 230, it should be doable, especially if you have prior experience with multivariable calc. The material seems impossible at first, but all makes sense when you start studying for the midterm\/final. Plus the workload is not bad at all--only 10 problems per week and no quizzes.",
    "If you have a strong Physics background, take this course. It's well structured, and Baltay is a good lecturer. P sets and tests are fair. Not an overwhelming amount of work either",
    "Physics 260 is a very mathematics-based approach to physics. Good if you're familiar with some vector calculus, like line\/surface integrals, Stoke's theorem, etc. If not, that's ok, but expect to spend quite a bit of time learning them. Having buddies in the class is very helpful. This is no easy class. However, it does run by many topics, so whatever floats your boat.",
    "This is where the Twain quote \"College is a place where a professor's lecture notes go straight to the students' lecture notes, without passing through the brains of either\" comes into play. While Physics 260 is arguably the best of the introductory physics sequence courses, Baltay focuses a bit too much on obscure mathematics that doesn't really conceptualize the physics too well. Other than that, the lectures are solid and engaging, the psets manageable, and the physics just really cool. However,the midterm and final should focus a bit more on physics questions instead of obscure math that appeared for all of 10 minutes in one of the many lectures.Also, be prepared to work hard outside of class in terms of undersatnding the concepts if you don't already have a full grasp of them. The midterm was ridiculously easy if you studied your psets, and the final was absurdly hard because no one studied the random examples in the notes that everyone thought would not be on the test.",
    "I took this class because I was told it wasn't as hard as Physics 200 or 180 and was way more interesting, and that's about what I'd say here. You definitely need to have knowledge of multivariable calculus to be successful, but it might be possible to learn it along the way. Psets are pretty easy until E&M, but then there's a solutions manual online, so don't despair! The final was tough but the midterm was much more doable.",
    "A class that is accelerated to cover the majority of topics in classical mechanics and electromagnetism with several other topics like special relativity thrown in.",
    "Physics 260 is a great treatment of physics for a freshman course. It covers much of the AP material while introducing several new topics in the semester, giving doing so theoretically. Baltay is a entertaining and informative lecturer and made class an enjoyable experience. Anyone who enjoys physics or is wondering if physics is for them should take this course. While prior training is almost certainly necessary there is a good bit of basic review. The work is not daunting, and the homework doesn't take too long. Also, as someone in Math 230 I must say that Math 230 is certainly not necessary for this course, and doesn't complement it significantly.",
    "This course is an effective summary of topics in mechanics, electromagnetism, and special relativity. However, students without any background in these topics would not benefit as much from this course, as the pace can be very fast at times and some material is skipped. Baltay is good at answering questions but he can ramble sometimes.",
    "Don't take this course unless you are comfortable with math to the level of multivariable calculus (or you're willing to get slapped in the face with math and teach yourself like I had to). The course material is interesting if you love physics. I found it quite challenging, and though I like the professor, he teaches at a fast pace and will leave you behind with no problem.",
    "Sort of. Baltay is a good lecturer and you do learn quite a bit, but I think 260 is really designed for freshman physics majors, so as an upperclassman majoring in a different science it wasn't what I needed. You really need to remember high school physics, both mechanics and E&M (and having seen calculus-based physics before would have been really, really helpful), in order not to be confused. So if you already remember all that stuff and aren't completely in love with physics, why bother to take it?",
    "Physics 260 covers your typical intro physics topics (mechanics, momentum, energy, E&M, special relativity), incorporating multivariable calculus and delving deeply into topics important to the field of physics. I found it an appropriate introduction to a field of science that is known to be very rigorous. I would certainly recommend 260 to an aspiring physics major who is comfortable with her\/his physics skills, though I don't think it is ideal for those who simply need a physics credit.",
    "Definitely doable in conjunction with Math 120, but don't let the P-Set difficulty fool you, study up for the final!",
    "a good class. exams can be hard.",
    "Phys 260 was a good course. The material was interesting, Prof. Baltay explains it well, and the work is challenging but reasonable. For math background, the class expects multivariable calc, but you can take math 120 at the same time and be fine as long as you're ok doing some work on the side (for example, you'll need triple integrals before 120 covers them, but they're pretty straightforward). Definitely recommended if you have the background and like physics.",
    "It is a good place to start physics if you have a good math background. The class moves quite fast, but the problem sets do not require that much time and were very manageable. The proofs in the lectures, however, can be frustrating since it is not a math class and Prof. Baltay mainly wants to demonstrate the physics. The two exams were pretty fair. On a side note, MATH 230 is NOT a co-requisite for the course. If you know some multivariable calculus including the Stokes theorem and the Divergence Theorem, you will be more than fine.",
    "Absolutely recommended. If you have a sufficient math background, take it. I hadn't taken Physics C yet- I'd say you need *either* Multivariable or Physics C, both would be better. If you're thinking about majoring in Physics (or not), take this class.",
    "Take it if you want to cover broad basis of physics instead of getting nailed at solving tiny little problems. Previous knowledge in vector calculus would strongly help you although it is not necessary as Prof. Baltay would scare you in the beginning of the class.",
    "Great course, but it moves fast. Don't get left behind. Definitely be prepared to spend a lot of time going over the textbook.",
    "Physics 260 is a quick, thorough, and detailed (what a contradiction!) review of all the mechanics and electricity and magnetism of an introductory physics course. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to be as thorough as Physics 200, so this is a course that is doable, but less meaningful, for those who are being exposed to the material for the first time (only doable for the mathematically inclined). Professor Baltay is truly an excellent instructor. He makes the material as captivating as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be at this level. The bit covered in relativity is a great way to stimulate the appetite of future physics majors because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more detailed than what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d normally get in such a course, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far from an explanation of the full picture, leaving you with a desire to learn more. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend the course for those who want to be exposed to enough physics in a semester to get a larger view of the subject as a whole and to those who received a thorough treatment of physics in high school.",
    "I would reccommend this course to anyone coming in with AP physics C background and a working knowledge of multivariable calculus. Math 230 is not actually a corequisite, very few people actually take it.Professor Baltay is engaging and funny. The problem sets areNot particularly challenging, with a few exceptionally difficult problems here and there. The midterm was basically all things we had seen before on homework. On the final, Baltay decided to put two topics that were barely covered in class, though. People were not happy about that.",
    "Math 230 is NOT required, math 120 is totally fine.",
    "It is an introduction to all of physics. I would recommend it.",
    "You run through all of the AP Physics C curriculum from high school in one semester, and more. If you like physics and feel confident that you understand physics on a deep level, and feel mathematically prepared, then this class is for you.",
    "The course is a good introductory physics class for those who have had a decent grounding in mechanics and E\/M. Be aware that Multivariable Calculus is a requirement, though Math 230 is not strictly so. The midterm is fair, though it was not extremely apparent what we should have covered for the final. Overall, it is a great course, and Baltay is a wonderful lecturer. Take it, by all means!",
    "A fun and fast paced jaunt through mechanics and electromagnetism. A lot of review from AP C, but much more in depth, so the class was always interesting. The homework is not too much, maybe 5 hours a week, but make sure you know your stuff for the midterm and final. Always a fun time with Baltay leading the class.",
    "It's essentially applied multivariable calculus. Fascinating but a ton of work and not the best organized class. Few people attend lecture because it is very difficult to stay focused the way it's taught; unfortunately, the textbook does not count as a substitute.",
    "This is by far the hardest intro. physics class, and I do not believe it is as \"well-taught\" as everyone claims that it is. The professor, Charles Baltay, is still very likable and is a decent professor, but the class moves very quickly and the homework problems don't necessarily give one a mastery of the material. It's very barebones in that you go to lecture, have a midterm, go to lecture, then have a final, which can make the class intimidating. A tip for the class: not everyone in lecture is as comfortable with the material as you think they are; students would often not ask questions when it was clear they had them because they thought everyone else understood much more fully.",
    "A better choice than the other intro physics options, but still not perfect.Physics 260 is a great class, but there are still a few issues. The first, and probably most annoying, is Baltay's unpredictable pace. Some days he will spend an hour caught up in some seemingly trivial algebraic derivation. Others he will plough through several sections worth of material without pausing to give a single example. Still others he will spend painstakingly reviewing topics already familiar to any high-school physics student (this should be everyone in the class).The problem sets assigned are also not ideal. They are pretty easy, albeit occasionally tedious (especially the E&M integrals), but they fail to cover some of the more important topics, and always seem to avoid any truly difficult problems. This means that while you will cover many interesting topics in class, the problem sets will look a lot like those you will almost certainly have seen in a high-school physics course.Finally, in terms of math background required for this course. Math 230 is absolutely not a corequisite (although if you take it, 260 will look like a cakewalk by comparison). A better choice for this class would be Math 120, Math 151, Physics 301, or something else along those lines. You should be familiar with the concepts of div, grad, and curl, but beyond that you should be fine.Overall, Physics 260 is much better than the other introductory physics options, but it still fails to be a truly intensive introduction to physics.",
    "Take this class. You'll get a fantastic introduction to higher level Physics, and no better teacher for that than Baltay. The material is exciting, and he makes it even more so! Also, he didn't let us get lost in the technicalities, but instead also spent time talking about the beauty and intuition of the big picture physics, which was great.That said, you should probably go into this course with a pretty good grasp of multi and a decent physics background. Don't be unduly frightened by Baltay's warnings about prereqs at the beginning of the class though.",
    "Yes. Take it because it is challenging and also because the instructor is one of the best for intro physics. But don't be scared off by his first few classes.",
    "260 is a hard class, but forget the math co-requisites. Taking 260 with whatever math you want, such as 120, 222 or 225 is completely fine. If you're a physics major (like I was), 260 is a good class, if you just wanna take physics for fun, take another class. You learn a lot in 260, but the evaluations are insane. Everybody felt like crying in the final (and I talk for all the people I talked to). No review sessions and no practice exams at all make you freak out even more before the tests.",
    "I loved this class and the material. I'm a junior American Studies major so I took the class credit\/d and did pretty poorly on the tests, but still got so much out of it. I haven't been in math classes since freshman year or physics classes since high school, and it was definitely hard to catch up on my math skills, but if you're a non-physics\/math major who loves physics, this class seems to be much better taught than 200 or 180 - Baltay is a great lecturer. And the psets are interesting rather than tedious. Nevertheless, this is not an easy credit\/d class, you still have to put in plenty of hours for the psets, and if you're like me, many more hours for refreshing math skills. Also, Baltay doesn't exactly love having non-physics\/math people in the class, since he sees it as an advanced and self-selecting elite group.",
    "If you're good at Physics, feel free to take this class because nothing in it is impossibly difficult. It's a very quick review of mechanics and E&M, but it uses multivariable calculus occasionally and it has some Special Relativity thrown in. 180, 200 and 260 all fulfill the prerequisite, so take this class if you're legitimately interested in learning higher level physics.",
    "At the beginning of the class, Professor Baltay does this thing where he tries to discourage people from taking the class. Don't be intimidated by this. Baltay is an excellent lecturer and, even if you only sort of think that you can do it, try to because it will be worth it. As far as problem sets go, they are somewhat sporadic in that one week a problem set will be really easy and take only about an hour and the next week it will take eight and be quite difficult. This is a good class, and I recommend that you take it.",
    "I would recommend taking Physics 260 for anyone who enjoys physics and has taken and gotten A's in both AP Physics C courses in high school. Physics 260 is very math oriented as well and you should make sure you study a little ahead in multivariable calculus. I never took multivariable in high school and the only things you really need it for are center of mass and moment of inertia.",
    "I absolutely loved this class. I learned a tremendous amount and really appreciated the mathematical treatment of the material, as well as Professor Baltay\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to help us see the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbig picture\u00e2\u0080\u009d of physics and how everything fits together. Professor Baltay\u00e2\u0080\u0099s introduction during the first two days of class I really thought helped contextualize the rest of the semester very helpfully in the frame of what physics really is, its different branches, and how they fit together to help us understand the universe and how it works. I also really appreciated his occasional digressions when teaching certain material to describe to us how it is similar to or different from material we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll meet later (for example, presenting special relativity in the context of how it is similar to and different from general relativity, which we discuss next term). Professor Baltay is also incredibly patient and approachable with questions, often staying long after class to help answer questions and clear up points of confusion, whichI found to be extremely helpful. If you have a strong interest in physics, a desire to see physics presented in a multivariable mathematical environment, and decent preparation, definitely take this class. By the way, if you took AP Physics B in high school but your school didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t offer C for example, you should be totally fine taking this class if you really want to, despite the fact that Physics C is listed as a pre-req, so don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let that shy you away; Physics B will be sufficient especially if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been exposed to some intermediate math already since the treatment is fairly mathematical and good math prep can help you for sure (some differential equations or linear algebra might help a little bit and multivariable calculus would help a ton). Phenomenal professor and fantastic class. Enough said.",
    "I am not sure I would recommend this course. The professor was engaging, care about Physics, and stayed after class to help. The material was really interesting. However, it was done slightly too fast to actually get a real good feeling for it, and we should have at least had more homework each week to force us to really understand it when we were speeding through some of the earlier topics. I also wish Professor Baltay had held his own office hours and that solutions were posted to the problem sets after we turned them in. I heard a number of people saying that they were confused at parts. It was somewhat intimidating to ask him for help, since he made it seem like everything should be absolutely obvious for us, even when it wasn't. I heard other people say they were lost as well. Often he would not actually even finish the few examples he gave us. I also think that both textbooks could have been much clearer, although I do not know that there is an alternative for that. We learned some pretty cool material though, and the homework load isn't bad at all. Just brush up on your physics and multivariable before you take it, so that the concepts come more easily.",
    "If you love Physics and you've taken multivariable calculus, go for it. A more rigorous introduction to university physics you couldn't hope for. If you understand the key ideas in lecture, the pSets are actually less time consuming than Phy 200.The only reason why I wouldn't recommend this course to an aspiring physicist is the math. Everything is math. The course consists of a series of derivations. Which is cool, but if you don't understand the math, the course becomes meaningless. You should know triple integrals by the mid term, and have finished vector calculus 3ish weeks before the exam. Maths 120 lags a couple weeks behind, so do expect to be teaching yourself some topics if you're not taking Maths 222 or higher."
