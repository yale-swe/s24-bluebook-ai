   "comments": [
    "Econ 110 is a great course if you prefer smaller class sizes and want a more hands-on lecture. Tolga is also one of the best teachers I have had so far. That being said this class seems more difficult than the lecture version, and if you are taking this econ, it should be something you are passionate about, not just to fill a credit.",
    "if you are thinking about taking an econ major, this might be a good class to take!",
    "To understand economics, you must have a solid foundation in both mathematics and the humanities. Based on my observations, it is more common for students to lack the mathematical intuition. In general, students who struggle with Econ 110 have a decent understanding of the basic theory, but they have difficulty expressing that understanding in numbers or graphs. Therefore, the level of difficulty of this class for you will largely be a function of your comfort with math. If you have a firm grasp on math, do not fear the strict curve of the seminar - you will do just fine! As long as you keep up with all the readings, go to office hours when you have questions, briefly review your notes every week, and pay attention in class, this course won't kill your GPA. (I don't actually know my final grade yet, but I'm still fairly confident about that statement - I did better than most on the midterm, and I feel pretty good about the final.) I would especially recommend the seminar over the lecture if you have Prof. Koker. He's exceedingly supportive, friendly, humorous, and accessible. He holds lengthy office hours each week and actually likes answering students' questions. His examples in class are always interesting, and by the end of the course, you'll be able to explain so many natural economic phenomena that are a part of your daily life. I wasn't expecting Econ 110 to be a memorable experience, but it definitely was thanks to Prof. Koker!",
    "I think even if Econ is not your thing, this class is completely doable. Coupled with Tolga as an amazing professor, the class will be very fun even if you don't like the material covered. It's good to understand econ at an intro level, and this class is a good choice.",
    "You learn much more in this course than the lecture. The scale is tougher but depends on what your priority is.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to gain a great understanding in the basics of microeconomics.",
    "Difficult curve. Only take if you're a dedicated economics student willing to put in hours of fully understanding the material.",
    "It was an introductory microeconomics course that went at a faster pace, and included many insights past what could be found in a book.",
    "Econ110 was challenging. I took it without having studied Econ before and would probably not recommend it for another student.",
    "I would encourage other students as I felt I learn a lot more in the seminars rather than lectures. Its also a great learning atmosphere,",
    "Econ 110 is a weeder course; it is a survey of microeconomics designed to help you determine whether economics is a good major for you. The small-classroom format is great for students who want a personal relationship with the instructor, but the grading curve is harsher. Tolga is a wonderful instructor and wants to see his students do well. If you must take Intro Micro, do it with him--you'll get a lot out of this course. If you're on the fence, try the big lecture where the curve will be more forgiving.",
    "A great introduction to economics; math is key, however the level of math required is not high at all. The PSets were not too much work however it is necessary to start them early in case you have questions. The textbook was incredibly useful and tied directly to the course. Exams were fair and reflective of the material covered, and review sessions were always helpful. On the whole, I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in economics.",
    "Only if interests in Econ as a major."
