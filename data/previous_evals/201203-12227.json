    "Take it if you need to. Not very fun.",
    "I liked the fact that Econ 121 was really heavily quantitative. I'm sure a lot of people will complain about the length of the problem sets and whatnot, but though they sometimes were time-consuming, I never felt like there was anything I didn't understand. Everything was very straight-forward, and Professor Samuelson does a good job of writing the problem sets in such a way that you really learn the material as you progress through them. Obviously, most people who take Econ 121 are required to for their major, so I would definitely suggest taking it with Samuelson. He was a really good lecturer who made a 9 am class much more bearable than it otherwise would have been.",
    "No",
    "if they're majoring in economics.",
    "The class is required for the major. However, I have heard horror stories about other professors who teach Intermediate Micro. Definitely worth taking this class in the Fall if Samuelson is going to be teaching it because it was overall an enjoyable, fair experience.",
    "Professor Samuelson is not bad as a lecturer, but the material of this class is just awful.",
    "I mean, 121 is rarely a choice for anybody. Its required for the econ major. If you're not an econ major, don't take the class unless you enjoy being bored stiff by the driest material on planet earth. If you aren't an econ major, and are still thinking of taking this class, I question your lifestyle. Why waste any bit of your tuition on taking 121 when there are so many other incredible course opportunities out there? the silver lining for econ majors was that samuelson is a good dude. very good teacher too. I'm rambling, nobody is gonna read this far back on the course recommendations anyways. happy shopping",
    "You're likely taking it because you have to, but it's not so grim as everyone says; pretty interesting material, and Professor Samuelson is a fairly fun lecturer.",
    "Just take it.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to obviously, but it is not overly painful. The curve is great.",
    "Samuelson super enthusiastic and makes a somewhat dreary subject at 9 am as exciting as it can be. His lectures are always well outline and he is always prepared, eager to help, and quick to respond to emails. Take Yingni for your section leader - she goes over things very well. Problem sets are tough but they didn't grade too harshly. The first two midterms were more straightforward than the psets.",
    "I would recommend it if you are an econ major, don't if you are not. I would definitely suggest taking it with Samuelson.",
    "I don't know. I haven't showed up since the second week. But the problem sets are well-done, the lecture Powerpoints posted online are excellent, and the exams are fair and not too difficult.",
    "Unless it's for the Econ major, I would not take it.",
    "Very good class, if you enjoyed micro you'll enjoy this even more. Samuelson is a great lecturer and fair grader. Everything you do in the psets and lecture is relevant to the exams so you don't feel like you are wasting your time, and also feel well prepared for the exams. Definitely take his course if you need econ 121 for the major.",
    "The material is fascinating, even though this modeling of people's and firms' behavior is all theoretical and has very little practical bearing (but the same goes for pretty much the entire econ department at Yale). It's not math-intensive (all you need is simple multivariable), but the critical thinking is quite hard. Samuelson likes to write problem sets that are always challenging and often leave you tangled in a morass of algebra. USE THE TAs; they were incredibly helpful, and instrumental in getting the impossible parts of problem sets done. Samuelson himself seems like a nice guy and not a bad lecturer, but sometimes the way he presents the material is esoteric and obscure, when in fact the principles are not that hard. This stuff would have been MUCH easier to understand had the notes not been all random letters in random equations and mazes of algebra. The tests aren't awful. In terms of grade distribution: if you want a solid A, good luck.",
    "If you need to, sure. If not, this is not a course that you want to take for fun.",
    "Good course. If you are an econ student you pretty much have to take it. You basically take every concept from intro microecon and add math to it.",
    "This class is okay. The material is rather dry because it is just the math behind intro micro. Also, the P Sets are very challenging and sometimes will take several hours. This being said, try to take the class with Samuelson. He does a good job of presenting the material in a clear way and is very fair when it comes to tests\/ grading.",
    "I don't think I would take it if it weren't for my major.",
    "Yes.",
    "Reasonably well taught intermediate micro class. P-sets are very relevant to the lectures, and the tests are very manageable if you do the p-sets thoroughly.",
    "Take it with Samuelson. Don't take it if you are not econ major.",
    "I would recommend this class to people who want to go further into economics and who have already taken the intro course at Yale.",
    "GIven that any intermediate micro class is going to cover the same topics, this class was exactly what you would expect. That said, Prof. Samuelson does a good job of trying to bring in real life examples and talking about current debates during lecture to make it more interesting. The problem sets are pretty standard - they cover material from the past week. Some tedious algebra, but nothing harder than a derivative. Overall, it was a good class.",
    "Only take it for the econ requirement. Other than that I don't think you wil learn too much useful material.",
    "Microeconomics is not a very interesting subject, but Professor Samuelson is great. I enjoyed this course more than Intro Micro because it takes more of an analytical approach. If you're proficient at math, you won't find this course too challenging. If you're not an Econ major and interested in taking some Econ courses, I would recommend taking other Econ courses.",
    "Basically intro micro with more in-depth algebra and mathematical translation of concepts. Stay on top of the assignments and you will thank yourself in the midterms which, in addition to the final, are thankfully not very cumulative. Take this only if you are an econ major.Prof. Samuelson did a great job of explaining concepts (especially mathematical interpretations) that could have been easily messed up and complicated by a less skilled professor. He also does a great job of not getting caught up in details that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t essential to understanding fundamental concepts, which I suspect is partly due to him teaching mostly grad school level econ courses.",
    "If you have to, you have to. If you don't have to, don't. If you can, Cr\/D it and it will be a breeze.",
    "Econ 121 applies economic models that are more mathematically based than those in Into Micro to current economic debates. It was a very good class and Samuelson is a great teacher. The models can be quite technical, and the problem sets can be quite tedious.",
    "If it's not for your major, don't take it. Simple as that.",
    "Get ready. There is not a ton of work for the class- there is no reading, so just the one problem set per week, but those can be very long. While some are shorter, there are a few that take over 10 hours. Keep your Sundays clear, and make sure not to get overwhelmed by their difficulty. I also found section to be completely useless. The 9 AM time slot is rough because it is hard to absorb dense material so early. That said, Professor Samuelson is animated and a good teacher, but at 9 AM and with this class that makes less of an impact. Overall: not a ton of work, just a hard class.",
    "Basically intro micro with a little math thrown in. It gives you a pretty intuitive understanding of a lot of concepts in economics that were probably unclear in intro. instead of move around curves, you use equations. Not hard by any means. There were so many people who would say that this class was death or whatever. Its actually pretty easy if you have at least some background in math, which if you're an econ major you really should have. By 'math', I mean understanding what it is to use the Lagrangian and understand what a derivative means. The people that seem to complain the most are either global affairs or ep&e kids who don't really understand math, but have to take the class. The course is also ridiculously curved. An A was around a 94, while an A- was a 78. So basically everyone gets an A-, which in my opinion is pretty unfair, but understandable since its Yale. Better alternative to 125 for those considering it, I heard that class was next to impossible. I'd recommend it, but honestly you probably already know if you're taking it or not.",
    "This class is difficult. This class is early. If you are afraid of either of the above, you should think twice about taking this class.Here is my one of my biggest complaints about the class: the problem sets and the tests don't really look like what we do in class. The stuff we cover in class is important conceptually to understand some of the ideas behind the problem sets, but the mechanics of actually doing the math on the problem sets is rarely ever taught in class. This results in a lot of self-teaching and figuring stuff out on your own and late nights struggling with friends in Bass (DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITHOUT FRIENDS unless you are incredibly confident in your ability, in which case I guess none of these reviews will matter for you). Even with friends, this class was kind of a struggle. Copying psets will get you nowhere for the obvious reason that the tests will cover largely the same material.My other biggest complaint, which is sort of related to the previous thing, is that Samuelson did not make the tests look like the practice tests he posted. The last five practice tests for both midterms and the final sort of looked similar to each other, with one oddball question every now and then. But, for example, the Fall 2012 final honestly did not resemble any of the previous ones. I am just not okay with thefact that someone can basically do the problem sets and practice tests in their sleep and then get super stumped by the actual test. I understand that the idea is like, oh, well if you REALLY understood the material, it wouldn't matter if it came in a different format of a question! You should be able to do it anyway because it tests the same CONCEPTS! But the truth is that for most people, this isn't really the case... and for less than genius people, testing the same concepts with totally different types of questions is still really damn challenging.That being said, I overall enjoyed this class (shocking, I know) because the material is interesting. I'm not 100% decided as an econ major and I decided to go ahead and take this class anyway, and I actually got a pretty good grade even given all the ranting above. Also, you should take my complaints with a grain of salt because I am shitty shitty shitty at math (which, hopefully as you know, is somewhat important for the course), and because I did miss a few classes (though from what I heard, class actually matters almost zero as to how you really end up doing). The psets took on average about 10 hours a week (aka each Sunday sitting in Bass struggling with friends starting from brunch and ending at midnight, 1, etc.). Also, the curve is OUTRAGEOUS. On one of our midterms, anything above a 34\/100 was in the B range... talk about ridiculous. Then again, an A on that test was a 94\/100... Also ridiculous.Basically, as far as I can tell, it's nearly impossible to get below a B, and nearly impossible to get above an A-, as long as you somewhat try.",
    "Take it if you need to.",
    "pretty standard. widely considered the hardest core econ class at yale, and so far, yes, unless youre econ math. problem sets are terribly long and hard, you cant do them alone. but if you do them with friends, you get 10\/10s. exams much easier than the psets. not too necessary to go to the 9am lecture cause samuelson puts all the slides online. you have to take this class, so it doesn't really matter.",
    "Compared to the other intermediate micro course, ECON 121 is much easier and much less work. Exams are fair, and the weekly pests are harder than in intro micro but grading is still pretty generous. Samuelson is a good lecturer, and if you do go to lecture, you'll be sure to understand a lot. Having a textbook is not required, but without it you're sort of floating in a sea of ignorance. That being said, you'll still be able to do all the problems since the math isn't difficult, but you might lack some of the reasoning.",
    "ECON 121 provides a clear picture of the undergraduate level microeconomics. Its strength lies in the mathematical derivations of economic concepts which gain them validity and--I must say-- beauty. Professor S is an amazing one. He is really encouraging and open to any questions. He can even turn any irrelevant questions to related and excellent ones. Some people complain that there is too much math in ECON 121, but Prof Samuelson is brilliant in explaining whatever economic concepts so as not to dissolve them in boggy mathematical details.Problem sets could be difficult but the exams were decent. The grade distribution is really lenient (74 and above for an A-!!). I must admit that this course is the highlight of my freshman year and it's not as bad as what people think it is.",
    "This is the most difficult Econ class I've taken at Yale. While it is a requirement for the Econ and Global Affairs (Development) majors, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone not considering these majors. If you are not mathematically-inclined, this class will very hard. There is a lot of tedious calculus and algebra on the problem sets.",
    "If you need to take this class, resign yourself to being miserable. If you don't need to take this class, really evaluate your life choices before taking it.",
    "I would recommend it for econ majors. i took it instead of micro theory and I don't regret it. I do feel like I have a firmer grasp of conceptual issues than I did before",
    "Cool class - go to section if you take it",
    "Take this class only if you have to for your major. The material is extremely dry and you never really understand what is going on, you just learn how to solve formulas without understanding their connection to the real world. Exams were not too bad but the problem sets were extremely long. They were really annoying because their difficulty was due to algebra and not the concepts themselves.",
    "Absolutely!!",
    "Only take this course if you are going to major in Economics. It is not easy and is not fun but also isn't as bad as many people say it is. Just stay on top of the work and you will be fine.",
    "necessary",
    "The level of detail in the course makes it necessary only for Econ majors. Can't recommend a better professor to reach the course than Samuelson.",
    "Samuelson is a good lecturer and always available to help students, which is pretty impressive. But find good people to work with on the psets, because some of them are irritatingly\/unnecessarily complex.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you have a real passion for the math behind microeconomics or you want to be an econ major. The class itself is sometimes dense and at times seem pointless. However, this class turned out not to be as bad as everyone said it would be. Definitely put in time for the p-sets, but the midterms are fair.",
    "Great chance to build on the intro classes. Take it with Samuelson.",
    "I would definitely recommend ECON 121 for other students. Though it was my most difficult and most time-consuming class this semester, I felt that I learned a lot and that my time was well spent.",
    "Best way to prepare for the exams is to do the previous midterms\/final exams that Prof. Samuelson provides. The textbook is somewhat helpful, but focus on problem-solving techniques rather than concepts.",
    "Economics 121 is a thorough course in microeconomics. I would obviously recommend this course to a student who is majoring in economics, but I would certainly not recommend it to anyone who is not, because you do not learn much real additional economic material or concepts than in introductory microeconomics.",
    "Have to take it for econ so just do it.",
    "I would recommend econ 121 if you are an econ student. However, a lot of the topics taught are also important for other majors as well.",
    "Only take it if you have to (aka Economics major). It's definitely a challenging class and studying for the 2 midterms and final can be quite time consuming.",
    "Although the material is challenging, Professor Samuelson is excellent - he is enthusiastic and engaging and makes otherwise daunting material interesting. If you need to take this course, take it with Professor Samuelson.",
    "If you're taking this class you probably have to suffer through it at some point during your Yale career, so take it with Samuelson. He teaches the material clearly and cogently, the curve is generous, and--although it's perhaps more mathematical than the other intermediate micros--it's definitely worth it.",
    "A tough class, but I felt like I learned a lot.",
    "ECON 121 provides students with a good sense of the mathematical aspects of microeconomics and covers some interesting material. If you are looking for a more heavily proof-based class then 125 might be a better bet, but 121 is still fairly rigorous. The problem sets can be a bit tedious, but overall the class is quite good.",
    "If you are an Econ major, you pretty much have to take this class. If not, I would not recommend it. While microeconomics is important, for a non-major student, a more advanced look at microeconomic concepts is not necessary. If you are an Econ major, Professor Samuelson is good. His lectures aren't the most interesting, especially at 9 am, but he wants his students to learn the material and does a pretty good job of explaining the material. The TAs were kinda useless in my opinion though, and the problem sets were long and full of tedious math that didn't do too much to strengthen one's understanding of the concepts."
