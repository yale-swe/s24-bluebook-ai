    "TAKE IT!",
    "G&G 212 gave us a good look at the main elements of global tectonics in thorough detail. The professors are probably the most approachable I have met during my time at Yale, and I must admit that I get along better with them than I do with many who teach in my major. This was, of course, helped by the fact that the class spent a week together doing field work in a foreign country. Nevertheless, the fact that a week with them was great and not intolerable says much. Especially in helping to work out a topic and seek out research for my final paper, the professors were very helpful and quite willing to give time (and patience) to pointing me in the right direction. Everything from class lectures was always clear and presented in a way that we could understand, and you leave the class at the end of the semester with a good sense of the connectedness of the whole of global tectonics, which is important. I took this class as a science credit, but I am pretty sure I now have a lifelong interest in geology, even if it does not become my career.",
    "Yep! The lectures are boring and hard to follow at times. The trip is totally worth it. I learned more about geology (and the people in the class!) than I did the whole semester. That's the kind of stuff that actually sticks with you. Hiking around cliffs, snorkeling, seeing\/touching the things you're talking about, chatting on the porch after dinner. That's what learning is really about.",
    "TAKE IT. awesome field trip. awesome professors. some of the material is a little dense, and many of the papers were written in the 1960s, so that's weird.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn about Geology. If you don't, don't take it for the science credit or the trip. It's pitched at a high level, and if this appeals to you it will be a worthwhile endeavor. You will learn a lot and you will learn it quickly. There's not a lot of accountability for your learning and the written workload is light, so if you're not interested and self motivated you'll be floating by in a holding cell while complicated figures whiz before you. The professors are charming and somewhat eccentric. This is the vibe I get from the geology department as a whole. Overall it's a very good class, and a unique class, with a somewhat scattered curriculum and some overall planning issues.",
    "Well, this class was absolutely amazing. First, the subject matter is totally awesome- global tectonics is relevant to everything of interest, ever! The professors do a great job of making the subject matter approachable and at a level we can all understand. When things are unclear, they explain it. The grading consists of weekly (or so) reading summaries that vary a lot in difficulty, but are all interesting. Basically, you read the paper, think about it for a bit, realize what it's actually saying, and write the summary. Also, there is a long final paper which you should start early but is doable.The professors and teaching fellows are really amazing. If everyone picked majors based on how cool the people associated with the major are, everyone would pick geology. The trip was not only an awesome chance to get an introduction to field geology under the sun of Barbados, but also offered the opportunity to get to know some really interesting people.Full disclosure: this trip was one of the best experiences ever, and the class is also really fun (particularly once you know everyone so well.) YOU SHOULD ALL TAKE THIS COURSE. The end.",
    "This incredible class, taught by two amazing professors, provided an excellent overview of plate tectonics and an introduction into geology.",
    "YES-this class is SO much fun, and not a lot of work. Seriously, one of the most fun classes you can take at Yale while still expanding your mind. Spend a fun break in Barbados, learn how volcanoes and earthquakes work-taking this class is a no brainer. It may be challenging for someone who hasn't taken a geology course before or who has does not have a solid science background. The professors are great too! Take it!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. If you can get in, absolutely. Great science course, the professors are awesome (like chill science bros, who are also experts in their fields), plate tectonics is underratedly so interesting, and you get to go on a spring break trip (the most fun, seriously).",
    "such a wonderful class - definitely take it.",
    "I would but be aware that there is a lot of geology jargon involved so if you don't already have a background in geology, you might want to read up before the class or you have to do some catch up during the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as it can be one of the best experiences you will have at Yale. It can be daunting for non science majors who have little experience reading scientific literature or who have not done any field research. However, if you are lucky enough to be accepted in this class for the field trip, the professors are very accessible and helpful."
