I've wanted that perspective for a long time and I'm glad to have it. The lectures and discussion were almost always informative, approachable and built towards that understanding.",

    "Need to figure out how to maximize the ability of Marian and Reid to teach the students. The distribution of teaching, across faculty, TAs, and students was not helpful, rushed the classroom experience, resulted in inefficient allocation of teaching time based off level of experience.",
    "Structure of the class felt unbalanced. Every week was a sprint to finish the first lecture, then followed by a student presentation that felt drawn out and sometimes boring or unprepared. Maybe more like 80 minutes of professor lecture, followed by something a little shorter and more to the point by the students? Also, I think we definitely should have visited a landfill or MRF. Seems like it would have augmented learning, and why not?",
    "the student led discussions",
    "I prefer lectures than student led discussions",
    "The teaching team was quite large and not always on the same page when it came to direction. It was hard to prepare for student presentations because it felt as though Reid had very different ideas of what was expected than Marian. The class was also very quantitative and lacked real life applicability for waste managers. It would have been more helpful to draw in case studies and real world examples to help drive points home. The readings were often very technical and difficult to comprehend or synthesize.",
    "The student led portions of the lecture were often not useful for learning more about waste. The grading rubrics were very vague, while at the same time the grading was harsh. Tough grading is fine but not when it is combined with unclear expectations.",
    "The instructors of this course need to be more organized in their expectations and get on the same page a lot of the time. I and my fellow students frequently felt like we were getting different feed back or instruction on the submitted work from different instructors. Or perhaps were told by one instructor that content was appropriate and then lost points on their grade for using said content. Also, students need to be given feed back sooner. I have never taken course at yale or otherwise where I was given no feedback at all on my standing in the course until five days before the final assignment for the course was due. The faculty were extremely kind an understanding in letting me have more time to work on my final material to address the grade issue, however, I would have been able to get a lot more out of that process if I hadn't been doing it during finals week. About 25 hours of work was added to my finals week in this process and though it was a worth while endeavor, it would have been so much more appropriate and fruitful during the semester. I requested feed back a month before I was given any and this process could easily have happened during that month if i had known the severity of the situation. that be being said, I was very happy with the progress I made in my writing, the improvement in my paper and the extension which was given so I was able to address the grade issue at all.",
    "Allow more time in class for group discussions on readings and themes presented in the lecture.",
    "The teaching team is quite arrogant and unresponsive to student needs. Often they would act like students were asking stupid questions or missing some important concept, without explaining what that might is. The condescending attitudes and \"devil's advocate\" approach of some of the team was not conducive to learning, especially for those new to the content. The course content is also very weak- it is too technical and obscure for what students need to learn. Most of it is a presentation of data, rather than any kind of synthesis or analysis. We need to understand trends and themes, not minutiae!",
    "I didn't like that half of every class was spent on student presentations. It made everything feel really rushed",
    "This course was profoundly disorganized and frustrating. It may improve with time but I would advise against taking it for the next few years until they figure out what they want it to be.",
    "Need more practical topics and examples",
    "1) structure: it felt a little loosey goosey in the second half with various student presentations. 2) design: a lot of breadth is covered in this class, which made it feel rather \"college seminar\" like. If that was the goal, then okay, its design was congruent with the execution. But if this was to make appreciable gains in certain substantive areas of wast emanagement, I'd cut down on the number of topics and immerse a little bit greater. 3) assigning readings and not lecturing on them or about them is kind of a waste of time. the readings sometimes felt complimentary and ancillary to what's being taught in the class."

    "Little direction and instruction from course faculty. Vision for student presentations was incomplete.",
    "It was helpful to discuss the project with other students who brought in their own background work and expertise. However, as students, we had a different idea on how our presentation should go than the direction given form the teaching team. The group wok work was presented as an opportunity for students to seek out the aspects of waste that interested them most, but in the end, it seemed as though we were limited to what the teaching team liked\/ believed in\/ agreed upon.",
    "I do not think it is appropriate that grades were assigned the same to each student in the team. For example, some students were clearly not prepared for their lecture, while other students worked with professors to develop appropriate content.",
    "This was probably the worst part. Both of us struggled hard to be able to find content that would satisfy expectations. We both felt woefully underprepared to be giving a lecture on something we knew nothing about and struggled to find evidence of. Also, in my opinion, my partner wildly misrepresented the content and quality of what she was going to present. She did not follow the schedule we had in mind and thus our discussion session went completely differently than we had agreed to and much of the work i put into that part of the presentation when entirely to waste. I know that learning to work with others is important but its frustrating to be graded with another adult who you trust to act one way and then does something completely unexpected.",
    "The group presentations were sometimes a bit scattered but overall added good variety to the course.",

If you are looking for more practical understanding and application of waste management, this probably isn't the class for you. Then again, there are very few waste classes at FES, so this might be the only option for students right now.",

    "Keep your expectations for this class low, especially if you are somewhat familiar with waste issues. Also, don't expect this to be tailored to private sector issues- most of the content and readings are at the macroeconomic, societal level. The teaching team is quite haughty and may make you feel stupid. That's just their style\/personalities, don't let it stop you from voicing your opinion or asking questions when you don't understand. Be prepared to put in quite a bit of work for the in-class group presentation, as well as the paper at the end. They make both assignments more complex than they need to be.",
