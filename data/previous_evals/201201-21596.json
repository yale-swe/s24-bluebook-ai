    "Take it if you want a simple, low-commitment neuro course on learning and memory. Shop it if you're picky about professors and lectures.",
    "Learning and Memory has probably taught memore than most courses at Yale.Professor Brown is definitely very sensitive to the students' abilities and makes his tests fair despite the fact that the material can be very difficult. The class is full of dedicated students all working toward a common goal of understanding the information instead of beating each other on the tests, and this helped make the environment very low-stress. Although I was afraid of taking this course at the beginning of the semester, it turned out to be one of the best classes I've ever taken here.3 difficult (but non-cumulative) tests; intermittent homework assignments; VERY low stress lab days where you work with a virtual mouse. Just start studying for the tests early and you'll be okay!",
    "If you're interested in the subject, it's a great way to learn about the brain. Mostly, it is about how these processes work, rather than how we perceive them, which was frustrating to me, as a non-science major, but it was still informative in other ways.",
    "Absolutely - it's a lot of work, but worth it if you're interested.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in the material! Professor Brown may seem quiet, but he's really nice and is an expert in this field. You'll learn a lot and have fun at the same time.",
    "It's interesting; covers the processes of learning and memory along with the brain parts involved and the things that can go wrong in the process. You might be looking to understand yourself better; it doesn't really do that. But it's a nice textbook (and the professor basically just follows it word for word, so the actual lecture isn't that helpful, so I guess if you can get yourself to read a textbook without getting tested on it, you could just do that). Also the professor brings cookies about once a week and this is the best thing ever.",
    "Basics of Learning and Memory can be fairly advanced for someone without a neuroscience background, but after the first third of the semester, you'll get the hang of what you're talking about. Not a whole lot of work for a class that will teach you a whole lot of very useful information. I'd recommend it.",
    "Solid course - well organized, engaging, lots of content. Not difficult to do well if you study. Thomas Brown brings cookies to class - it's adorable. Highlights include a fun assignment analyzing a movie (Memento) that involves a depiction of amnesia. You can definitely learn a lot! No prior neuroscience background is necessary to succeed. Also won't give you an equivalent knowledge base as intro neuro, but will help.",
    "Take it if you are interested in having an in-depth look at learning and memory. The material is very interesting, and the grading is fair. You will get to do a series of labs that are pretty fun, and the professor brings in cookies! It's also not too much work. Try to keep up with the reading, since the material on the slides and the book are the same. I highly recommend this course.",
    "Fascinating material. Professor Brown is a lovely person who cares about his students. However, he could do with being more engaging as a lecturer. There are three exams (no final), one paper, and two or three small HW assignments. The HW and paper are graded nicely, the exams are a bit difficult. The power points pretty much cover all the material in the book and on the exams. I took this course with no background in neuroscience, which made things a bit difficult in the beginning. But it's definitely possible to do, and I think I did fine in the class."
