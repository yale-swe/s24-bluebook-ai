    "Be prepared to spend a lot of time outside class rehearsing for the final performance if you take this class.",
    "Depends. Are you okay with a HIGH stress end of the year but very chill semester? if so, go for it! it's a great class!!!",
    "This course is a lot of work. When you look at the syllabus, you might think that it's front-loaded. It is not. After Spring Break, we started mounting a play -- La Hija del Capitan by Ramon del Valle-Inclan. We ended up doing very well at the performance (which took place on the Friday of Reading Period, shortly before finals started), but the preparations were very stressful. Prof. Safille cared a lot about our success and wasn't comfortable with the American method of preparing a play--starting about 3 weeks before the performance she became very stressed because she felt that we were behind. Walking into the building where we had class began to provoke an immediate increase in my blood pressure.That's not to say that the class wasn't enjoyable when Prof. Safille wasn't talking about how far behind we were. The course was divided into two halves, before and after spring break, with very different MOs. During the first half we'd each do an improv, sometimes alone but usually in groups, every one to two weeks. The rest of the time we'd talk about the readings, which were manageable and often interesting. I particularly enjoyed some of the poetry readings.The workload overall is a bit above average even before you factor in the end-of-semester play. With the play, this class involves at least as many course-hourse as a 1.5-credit language class and probably more so be aware of the time commitment. The professor is knowledgeable and caring, though she can be intimidating, and the course is fun, though it can be demanding (note that during the second half of the class you will continue meeting during class time but you'll also have many out-of-class rehearsals). Shop it and see what you think.",
    "A theater class heavy in theory taught in Spanish. Poetry as well. And you also put on a play. I would recommend it- good learning experience. The professor is incredibly dedicated and talented too.",
    "I loved this class, and would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is interested in being in a production in Spanish, and understands the commitment that this class will take. Expect to spend not much time on homework in the beginning of the semester (work in this period generally consisted of readings, five one-page papers, scene improvisations, and two tests), but know that the amount of time required for the class jumps in the second half of the semester. In the weeks leading up to the play, we spend 2-3 hours outside of class each day in rehearsal (outside of class), and in the final week (reading week) we were in rehearsal for 5-6 hours each day. With that said, putting on a play as a final project was incredibly rewarding, much more so than a test or final paper. Also, Barbara is wonderful. She may at times get on your nerves but she really cares about each individual student, and has a wonderful artistic vision.",
    "I think it's a fabulous idea for a course. What amazing material. I feel like I've been exposed to Spanish drama in a new, interesting way. I don't know if I would take it with Barbara again, but then again it's her first time teaching the class so it might be better-organized next year.",
    "This is a great opportunity to do something you probably wouldn't ever do at Yale otherwise. Barbara is very gifted and is a fascinating professor. Hopefully the department will provide her with more support in the future so that she doesn't become sostressed."
