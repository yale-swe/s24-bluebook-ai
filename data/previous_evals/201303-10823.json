    "You will only get out of this class what you put into it. Since most of the actual grammar and vocabulary is SELF-STUDY (I repeat, SELF-STUDY)class is mostly for the teacher to put that grammar to use in situations. So if you know that you're not motivated enough to look over the grammar and vocab and memorize the daily core conversations (which are for grade, so really you have to) you will struggle in this class.That said, you learn Japanese incredibly quickly. I came with a slight background in Japanese already but even for me the pace was quick. You switch teachers every day or so and it's a great way to get used to different native speakers and how they sound. You also switch classrooms and mix up who's in your class which is also a nice way to meet people (even if you'll only know them by last name until you actually go, \"oh hey, what IS your name?\").Overall: recommended",
    "Horrible textbook, useless clinics, good teachers.",
    "I would definitely recommend Japanese 110 to a fellow student. Again, the workload is large but manageable. The instructors do a good job of making sure you have fun, and even the assignments are designed to make sure you enjoy them. There are things like mediaassignments and the instructors even make songs that are frankly catchy and surprisingly useful. You would enjoy the class if you like learning new languages, and the instructors are very capable, motivational, and helpful.",
    "If you have ever had an interest in learning Japanese, take this class. It's a lot of work, but it's very very worth it."
