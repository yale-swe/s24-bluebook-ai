    "I learned a ton about Boko Haram (obviously), the United Nations, insurgency, terrorism, Nigeria, Africa, reintegration of combatants, and conflict resolution.",
    "I learned about Nigerian politics and history, terrorism and counterterrorism in general and applied this theoretical knowledge to the terrorist organization Boko Haram.",
    "Learned about Nigeria, Boko Haram, reintegration, working on a team, and working for a client.",
    "I developed a team work spirit and appreciated the value of working in a team. I learnt a lot about international security and diplomacy. I was most impressed by the caliber of speakers who came to talk to us during the class (former U.S ambassadors and an official from the Nigerian Military).",
    "This was a great opportunity to present information to a multilateral institution, and to better understand how they do business.",
    "One of the more interesting courses I've taken at Yale. This non-traditional graduate seminar allowed the students to develop unique skills in the world of consulting; something many students aspire to do but leave graduate school unprepared for. I wish Yale and Jackson offered more courses such as this one."

   "comments": [
    "Incredible guest speakers throughout the course. Professor King is deeply passionate about the material and the students.",
    "I enjoyed the fact that our course was so relevant and that we got to apply the theories we studied to a real-world conflict. Especially meeting with people who had experience and unique knowledge of the situation in Nigeria and of Boko Haram, was a valuable and educational. I felt that we sometimes deviated from our weekly readings and I wish we had read more of them, because they were incredibly informative and would have helped my understanding of the topic. Finally, I think that the class dynamic made it difficult for some students to participate at times and also gave rise to the impression that some students' opinions were valued more than others'. Overall I really enjoyed the course and I learned incredibly much from Prof. King as well as my fellow students who had experience in a variety of industries\/sectors.",
    "A unique opportunity and experience. The course's greatest weakness was that energy died down towards the end for both students and professor. Explanations and solutions for such a situation are unclear.",
    "The course engaged us to work for a real client (UN counter-terrorism executive directorate) and it was motivating to know that they wanted us to draft a document that will help inform them during a meeting with Nigerian government. The nature and structure of the course is different from what I'm other courses I have taken here at Yale and although it involved a lot of reading, I was comfortable with the assigned task. The readings were voluminous and we didn't get a chance to discuss the class reading.",
    "While more structure would have been helpful at times, I loved the flexibility and ability to cater to the client.",
    "Because the design of this course was relatively new, expected flaws were worked out during the course of the semester. Additionally, changing requirements from our client often forced last-minute changes. However, in a class designed to teach the students the ins and outs of consulting, these unexpected changes proved to be some of the finer learning points of the course."

    "It's remarkable to get a chance to learn from Casey King and to learn about conflict resolution.",
    "Absolutely! It was a unique experience!",
    "Yes, should the opportunity ever arise again. A fantastic learning experience among smart students on a challenging project.",
    "Yes, if you are looking to get some experience working of a client and facing real world challenges as to what a client want to include or exclude in preparing a working document.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "If a student desires to enter consulting, Casey King's class or a similar one would be a necessity.",
    "Yes, he is a great professor."
