    "If you are considering taking L5 Arabic, it means that you are dedicated to learning the language so my advice will have little bearing on your decision. Know this, however: L5 Arabic is a lot more enjoyable, a lot less stressful and a lot more practical (learning Arabic commonly used in the media and newspapers) than all of the lower level Arabic classes.Definitely recommend (especially Ustaaz Youness!)",
    "As it is now, Arabic 150 01 tries to take on much more than it can handle, and as a result does not effectively teach any of the material it attempts to cover. It did serve as a way for me to maintain my Arabic skills and keep practicing the language, and my reading ability has definitely improved just from the sheer amount of text that were presented to us over the course of the year, but other than that I really feel as though I have gained little else from the experience.Until Arabic 150's structure is changed to allow for greater time allotted to the subjects and skills it is trying to teach and takes a more comprehensive approach, focusing not just on reading but also grammar and speaking, I would not recommend taking the course to a student with a similar background in Arabic to me. I am a huge Arabic enthusiast and have spent much time trying to convince my peers of how great the Arabic language is and how they all should study it. However,based on my experience with Yale's Arabic program thus far, I do not feel comfortable anymore suggesting to my Yale peers that they start studying Arabic here, because I would feel guilty for getting them started in a mediocre program when there are so many other stellar language programs available at Yale.",
    "Yes! Arabic 150 will build your language skills in a way that is practical and comprehensive. You will never wonder \"why\" you are completing a certain assignment, reading, or discussion, as each part of the course feeds into a well-rounded learning process.",
    "I definitely recommend it!!!!Arabic 150 consists mainly of reading articles, discussing them and writing about them. We learn new vocabulary and have weekly quizzes. We do not focus on learning grammar. Each Friday we present a news article in Arabic. The class is discussion based, lively and fun."
