   "comments": [
    "Some of the lectures for PSE are interesting, and some are outright boring. As a person who's more into the physical sciences, it irritated me to no end that the life-science lectures were delivered with considerable sophistication, yet the phys-science lectures were all dumbed-down for the premeds. The discussion sections for PSE are an exercise in BS. Some of the lectures you'll hear are about cutting-edge developments in some field, and so the only people who _actually_ know anything about the lecture topic are the people in the lecturer's lab. Discussion sections thus boil down to people citing facts from Wikipedia and debating the ethics of the science in question.\/\/\\\\\/\/\\\\That said, your total time commitment for this is about 1.5 hrs\/week for the actual class, and about 1 hr\/week for doing the problem sets (which are usually qualitative rather than quantitative, and thus are also an exercise in BS). You get guaranteed funding for summer research if you take both semesters of this, so I figure it's worth it.\/\/\\\\\/\/\\\\OVERALL ASSESSMENT: much less work; good quality. I would recommend this to my fellow students, even if only for the summer research money.",
    "The only reason I did it was for the research money. And to meet other freshmen interested in research. And to those ends, it was good.",
    "SCIE 198 was great! It was an ideal introduction to the science scene at Yale. Unfortunately, the student-led sections can be dull, but I truly enjoyed the course and learned a lot this semester!",
    "Everybody with interest in science should apply for this great course.",
    "There are some caveats to this class in that sometimes the lectures are too hard or not to your liking. However, this is the point. Perspectives give you many glimpses into what doing science is like. One of the best ways to get to know Yale's scientific community.",
    "It's a blowoff class, plain and simple. But you get research funding and the material really is pretty interesting, honestly.",
    "it is an interesting course. during the semester, you learn about topics you would never have chosen, and there are chances to learn more about whichever topic interests you by speaking directly to the researcher after the lectures. the discussion sections are fun and informative and the chance for paid summer research is one you can benefit from through taking this class.",
    "You essentially get to listen to really interesting people talk about science. It's nice to get exposure to a wide range of fields, and it's pretty neat to realize that all of the work they're talking about developed very recently, and is still going on now.",
    "Perspectives is very interesting - it provides in-depth lectures on many scattered topics within the sciences, something which is useful in helping determine one's own personal scientific interests. However, if one does not like learning about wide and varied subjects, and does not wish to conduct research in the summer afterward, the class might be a drag.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to do research over the summer. Otherwise, it may not be a good use of time. If you already know what field of science you are interested in, the other lectures may seem a little dull. It is a low amount of work, even for .5 credits, with problem sets of three of four questions due only every other week.",
    "Of the 3 components of this class (one being lecture, one being homework questions\/discussion, and the third being summer money) I like 2. Lectures are fascinating though sometimes difficult to understand. I think the presenters do a great job of making it understandable though. The course definitely succeeds in presenting the student to the broad array of research at the university. The summer money is also a plus!Discussion section is not my favorite part of the week, it's kind of boring.But otherwise, I would recommend this class. No class is perfect, but 66.6% of this class is worth it, so why not? It's not that much work.",
    "If you're not absolutely positive you're looking for hard sciences, it's probably not the best class for you. On the other hand, if you're not sure if you like hard or soft sciences, this class could really tell you which you truly like better. It's a difficult class for a Friday afternoon because it's so long so be sure that you are absolutely committed to it.",
    "I would recommend PSE to a student only if they were willing to go into the course with a willing attitude. Overall, PSE is really just what a student makes of the course. You can easily be disengaged through PSE and just sit through the first semester just for the research money at the end of the year and absolutely hate it, or you can put an effort to understand topics on things you may not necessarily be interested in and find it to be not as horrible as you thought it was.",
    "Good for those interested in all types of science",
    "I would definitely recommend Perspectives to any student who is interested in research (especially those here at Yale) and doesn't know what to major in. The course helps you see how real research is done and you get funding for your own research experience over freshman summer. For those who don't know which science subject to concentrate in, Perspecives helps you taste a number of those subjects and helps you decide.",
    "To be honest, the only reason I decided to do Perspectives was for the summer research opportunity, which is phenomenal. However, the program itself is often a waste of time. Although some of the lecturers are interesting, most are far too technical for a freshman audience. Furthermore, the student-led discussion sessions are a let-down, since few students have the technical knowledge to grasp the material, let alone offer new insights. That being said, the program is not much of a time commitment and it is definitely worth taking due to the summer research opportunities (especially the great stipend).",
    "I would recommend taking this class if you want to meet other leaders in the scientific community at Yale and are interested in taking summer research positions here at Yale, then this is the course for you. If this is not the case, i would NOT recommend this course.",
    "It's a great program and if you are looking into interdisciplinary research and a summer research position, this is the course for you.",
    "I would take this course if you're really interested in summer research. It's a great way to get support while doing it. However I didn't really enjoy the lectures, because the professors go into really technical details and probably forgot that we are still freshmen. A few people I've talked to also felt the same. But there are also some people who really enjoyed the talks.The discussion sessions, on the other hand, were FANTASTIC. I was with a group of other freshmen who were really passionate about science and with two faculty discussants who really enjoyed talking with us. I came out of each session feeling inspired by what I just learned.",
    "Decent course, definitely worth it for the research during the summer. Most lectures were interesting and at a reasonable level.",
    "I would recommend this course for people who are interested in many areas of science--the lectures really do cover a wide range of fields. I thought the lectures were mostly enjoyable, but the discussion sections were much more interesting. The homework is easy and usually follows the lecture closely. Overall, not too much work, a wide variety of interesting topics, and the summer internship funding is a huge plus as well.",
    "Yes! Good way to get exposure.",
    "The class is pretty much as advertised: lecture one week, discussion the next. The lectures are generally interesting, but vary week to week and are often based on one's own interests. There are problem sets every other week that are typically not too difficult. Sometimes the discussions get boring, since they are 90 minutes and there isn't always a ton of on topic material to be discussed.",
    "You hear and discuss topics from a variety of fields. I would definitely recommend this course. It is a low-pressure way of finding out your research interests.",
    "When I was admitted to Perspectives, I was very excited because of the summer opportunity. But during my first semester here at Yale I found out that I am not a Sciences person. So, the lectures were getting boring, more boring... On the other hand, the discussions have potential to be really interesting. It all depends on the leaders. Both Professor Segraves and Professor Megan, the coordinators of PSE, are very approachable and always want to help students with any questions. If you REALLY love Sciences (let me tell you that I thought I love Sciences before) and want an opportunity to do research over the summer in any lab at Yale (all the labs are very welcoming since they don't have to pay you), I think you should take it. If you are undecided about sciences, DROP IT. It is not worth it! Yale has many great opportunity to fund research over the summer and I don't think you should worry about it, specially in your freshman year.",
    "This class is invaluable to any Yale student who desires to do research at Yale that is exciting to him or herself.",
    "If you get in, take it! I've had an awesome experience so far. Granted, about half the lectures bore me to death (I'm not a biology person in any way), but the discussions are always lively the following week. Questions vary from presenter to presenter in terms of difficulty, but honestly, it's only one set every two weeks, so it's essentially nothing. Plus, you'll gain a basic understanding of the cutting edge research in numerous fields; it's cool to hear someone say \"Neutrino!\" and actually know what their talking about.Not to mention the whole $4,000 stipend! It's been extremely helpful in finding research for the summer. Most professors recognize that if you're in the program, you're a certain quality of science student, and with the stipend, there's no imposition on them to find you funding. I have my lab all set, and I couldn't be happier. Honestly, it's an awesome program, and if you have the chance and love research, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "A somewhat limited overview of the different research opportunities available at Yale and in the scientific community. Very little workload (at least in the first semester) but not the best way to spend your Friday afternoon. Nonetheless, if you want to get your foot in the door for some of the research opportunities available at Yale, this might be your best bet.",
    "Take it for the research grant. It is also a great introduction to scientific research at Yale. But the lectures are not always interesting, especially if you're not into every single scientific field. The student-led discussion sessions are especially boring.",
    "Fun class for \"science people\". The class exposes you to various areas of science and opens doors for further scientific inquiry. Not very work intensive.",
    "Go to a lecture from a researching Yale professor one week and then go to a discussion section the next week. Only worthwhile for the money and research projects.",
    "I would recommend PSE only if one is certain that he\/she wants to do research the following summer. The lectures are interesting, but often the problem sets are challenging and the grading is completely ambiguous.",
    "Perspectives on Science is a wonderful class that I definitely recommend. The lectures are all very interesting and the professors are all very nice and enthusiastic about their research. The discussion groups are nice, allowing students to talk more about the research and other related topics. I have learned so much in so many different fields of science that I would otherwise have not known.",
    "A good introduction to scientific research at Yale that is not too stressful. Do not expect to learn general information about the major branches of science, but rather expect to get a feel for the specific hot areas of current research and a launching pad for scientific thought and research of your own.",
    "I would recommend taking PSE to another student interested in research of a variety of fields, but did not want to take a work-heavy course. Also for any who are interested in discussion even on a subject they are not familiar with, and who have a general interest in science. The course is very much what you make it to be through participation in discussions.",
    "Definitely recommended for anyone interested in any field of science or engineering."
