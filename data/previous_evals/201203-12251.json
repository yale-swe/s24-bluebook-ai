    "Before you take any lit class, you should make sure that you are interested in the books you will be reading. Don't take any class just to have the professor. No matter how amazing they are, if you aren't interested in the material, the class will be rough.",
    "Jungle Books was both awesome and a little disappointing at the same time. It was awesome because we got to read awesome books. There are a few duds (especially Green Mansions), but even the duds, by the end of the semester, kind of just end up giving you a really great perspective of the jungle book genre. But, for example, Heart of Darkness, The Lost Steps, and The Storyteller are truly great books and I never would have read most of them if I had not taken this class. Moreover, Prof Gonzalez is an awesome, chill guy, and he seems to grade pretty easily, which takes a lot of stress out of the class. However, some parts of the class were disappointing. Even though Prof Gonzalez is awesome, he would just spend most of the class rambling rather, than, say, giving you a very straightforward and analytical critique of the book you had just read. Anyway, this is a good and interesting class and a pretty relaxed writing credit. I recommend it, especially if the idea of the jungle appeals to you.",
    "Professor Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez Echevarr\u00c3\u00ada is an excellent instructor. He brings such a breadth of personal and academic knowledge of the course material that it is amazing that there were only ~27 students in this seminar. He structures the course that if we had a particular week for any given book, he would mostly lecture the first day on the important background to the novel and the themes therein, and then on the second day he would have a class discussion of those themes and more detailed aspects of that novel. I would take this class if you haven't read these books, or if you have never taken a class with Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez Echevarr\u00c3\u00ada (as he mostly teaches courses in Spanish). There were only two essays and a take-home, which makes reading a novel each week very manageable.",
    "Recommended. As far as writing credits go, the workload is not too intense, and the readings are really interesting. Prof. Gonzalez Echevarria is a good professor, although he often does most of the talking in this seminar.",
    "It's an easy writing credit and the novels are interesting. Professor Gonzalez is a very interesting man and it's often fun to come to class and hear him speak. Take it if you need a writing credit.",
    "I will be honest. I took this class because I needed an English credit, I had been to the jungle, and this course appeared easy in its requirements. In the end though, the writing required turned out to be the same amount as any other writing credit I've taken, which is good. We read a lot of books in this course, though reading all of them is in no ways required. The fact that Professor Gonzalez spent a substantial amount of time the whole semester lecturing on the literary and historical background of the texts and genre, including many personal anecdotes about the authors involved, minimized discussion compared to what you would normally expect from a seminar. In many respects he treats the course as a wide-ranging survey of literature and throws in bits and pieces of literary theory along the way. Many of the books were interesting, some were not. We didn't really ever have much time to go into detail on the level of passages and the actual writing during class time. Most of the discussion was very general. At the end I did have a great feeling about all that we really had gonethrough, despite not being able to finish all the books (or even most of them), but my experience during the class was not always the most satisfying.",
    "Prof. Echevarria is hilarious and a great lecturer. He has a ton of experience in literature and a huge amount of personal experience with the actual authors we read. The books are interesting, though Tristes Tropique is very dry.This is more of a lecture class than a seminar, and Prof Echevarria often gets sidetracked talking about very specific details of the authors' lives. He also tends to have a specific answer in mind when he asks a question during lecture.This is a pretty decent class, with a rather minimal workload and a great professor. However, if you're interested in having in-class discussion, there's probably a better one for you to take.",
    "Jungle Books is a pretty good class. Some books are fascinating reads, others are difficult to trudge through, but the essays are fun to write and the professor has a good sense of humor.",
    "Yes! Mostly lecture but prof. Gonzalez-Echevarria is very entertaining so it's worth it.",
    "Take it. The books are great, and there is less writing than other WR courses. He gives ample attention to your writing also."
